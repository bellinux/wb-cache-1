40|$|A incorporação de farinha de sorgo (Sorghum vulgare) à farinha de trigo nacional tem como objetivo {{principal}} diminuir a importação de trigo, utilizando matérias primas nacionais. Foi estudado o efeito da adição de níveis crescentes de farinha de sorgo à farinha de trigo nacional no sistema farinha-água (SFA) e no sistema farinha-água-ingredientes (SFAI). Enfatizou-se também a pesquisa da influência dessa mistura na qualidade tecnológicade pães obtidos. A miitura de 5 a 30 % de farinha de sorgo com a farinha de trigo indicou que houve um aumento na viscosidade máxima dada pelos amilo gramas dessas misturas. No sistema farinha-água houve um aumento do nível de absorção de água com a incorporação de maiores porcentagens de farinha de sorgo na massa. Em presença de ingredientes (SFAI) houve uma redução na quantidade de absorção de água tanto pela farinha de trigo quanto pelas misturas das farinhas. Nas características de mistura, o tempo de desenvolvimento da mas sa e o tempo ótimo de mistura tiveram uma ligeira diminuição, indicando que a adição de farinha de sorgo praticamente não alterou a energia necessária para desenvolver o glüten. No sistema farinha-água-ingredientes (SFAI) o tempo ótimo de mistura da massa apresentouvalores mais elevados, o aumento da quantidade de farinha de sorgo fez com que houvesse aumento pouco acentuado do que no sistema farinha-água (SFA). A extensibilidade diminuiu com a incorporação de farinha de sorgo e com os maiores tempos de descanso. A resistência à extensão aumentou com a incorporação de farinha de sorgo e com menores tempos de descanso. Os resultados obtidos acusaram a possível presença de fator oxidante na farinha de sorgo. O número proporcional sofreu um decréscimo com a incorporação de farinha de sorgo à farinha de trigo e com a redução dos tempos de descanso. Os valores mais elevados foram obtidos com 45 minutos de descanso, podendo isto indicar urna força de ligação mais forte na rede de proteínas do glúten nos menores tempos de descanso. As áreas dos extensigramas foram decrescendo conforme se aumentou o teor de farinha de sorgo na massa, indicando urna deterioração na rede do glúten. No teste experimental de panificação os pães feitos com até 10 % de farinha de sorgo forneceram urna qualidade similar à do pão elaborado com farinha de trigo pura. Nos subseqüentes níveis de adição ocorreu uma queda nos índices de qualidade do pão bem mais acentuada. A avaliação sensorial indicou que até 6 % de farinha de sorgo incorporada à farinha de trigo nenhuma diferença significativa a nível de p < 5 % foi observada. Por isso concluiu-se a possibilidade de se utilizar até 6 % de farinha de sorgo na farinha de trigo brasileiro sem que sejam notadas diferenças no sabor e no aroma do pão obtidoThe {{incorporation of}} sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) flour into the locally produced wheat flour has. the principal objective of dirnllrlsh ing wheat importation by employing Brazilian raw materials. The effect of adding {{increasing amounts of}} sorghum flour to local wheat flour was studied in flour-water system (FWS) and flour-wat er-ingredients system (FWIS). There was also studied {{the effect of the}} above mixture on the technological quality of bread. Addition of 5 - 30 % of sorghum flour to wheat flour produced an,increase of maximum viscosity as shown by the <b>amylograms</b> of the mix tures thus obtained. In the flour-water system there was an increase of the water absorption level when large proportions of sorghum flour were incorporated in the dough. In the presence of ingredients (FWIS) the water absorption diminished both for wheat flour and flour mixtures. Regarding the characteristicsof the mixture,the dough development and the optimum time of the mixture showed a slight decrease thus indicating that the addition of sorghum flour practically did not alter the energy required for the development of gluten. In the flour-water-ingredients system (FWIS) the optimum time of dough mixing showed increased values. The increase of thequantity of sorghum flour produced a light increase of the time of dough mixing in the flour-water system (FWS). Extensibility diminished with the incorporation of sorghum flour and with increasing resting times. Resistance to the extension increasedwith the incorporation of sorghum flour and with shorteroresting times. These results pointed towards a possible presence of an oxidising factor in sorghum flour. The proportional number showed a reduction with the inoorporation od sorghum flour to wheat flour and with shorter resting times. Higher values were obtained with 45 minutes of rest, a possible indication of a stronger binding force in the protein network, of the gluten in thecase of shorter resting times. The extensigram areas showed a decrease with increasing amounts of sorghum flour in the dough, indicating a deterioration in the gluten network. Bread samples produced with up to 10 % of sorghum flour were of similar quality as bread made with pure wheat flour. With increasing addition levels the indices of bread quality showed a falling tendency. Sensory analysis did not disclose any significant difference at p < 5 % leveI on addition of up to 6 % of sorghum flour to wheat flour.

Generally, the starch examined was characteristic of each tuber crop species, but there were similarities between the two varieties of each. Yam starch was small, 2 - 3 μm in size, and its X-ray diffraction pattern was a B-type in contrast to Taro and Cassava starches being an A-type. The starch-iodine absorption spectra of Yam starch indicated that the amylose content was low and the chain length was relatively short. On gelatinization, Yam starch was extremely high in swelling ability and was also very hard to break. Taro starch was small, resembling the Yam starch and had very high values in whiteness and yield. The other properties of Taro starch were found to be intermediate between those of Yam starch and Cassava starch. Cassava starch granules were relatively large, gelatinized easily, and seemed to be soft in its structure. 熱帯の代表的ないも類であるヤムイモ（グアム島産;野生種,栽培種）,タロイモ（オアフ島産;水田,畑地）,およびキャッサバ（ジャワ島産;苦味種,甘味種）から,同一方法で澱粉を調製した。これらの各澱粉につき,粒の形状,X線回折図形,ヨウ素呈色,膨潤力,溶解度,アミログラム,その他について測定し,それぞれの特性を比較した。 3 種のいもの間には明確な相違点がみられたが,同一種のいもでは品種間の差は小さかった。ヤムイモの澱粉は小形（平均 2 - 3 μm）で,X線回折図形は他の 2 者と異なりB型であった。アミロース含量が低く（平均 9 %）その鎖長も短いように思われた。また,糊化に際してはきわめて大きく膨潤するが,こわれにくい澱粉であることなどがわかった。タロイモ澱粉はヤムイモ澱粉と同様の小粒で,収率が最も高く（約 30 %）白度も高い。澱粉の性質はヤムイモ澱粉とキャッサバ澱粉のほぼ中間に位置した。キャッサバ澱粉は, 3 者のうちでは最も大形で糊化しやすく,やわらかい粒構造をもっていることが示唆された...|$|E

Amylograms of 6 % slurries of cornstarch in the preheated milks were compared with gel electrophoresis patterns of the whey proteins remaining undenatured in the same preheated milk samples. As temperature of preheating was increased, smaller portions of each whey protein remained undenatured and the second increase in viscosity shown by the Amylograph became less. After all the whey proteins except (alpha) -lactalbumin and (beta) -lactoglobulin had been completely denatured by preheat treatment at 82 (DEGREES) C, the second step in the viscosity curve no longer appeared but {{was replaced by a}} gradual viscosity increase.

The objective of the paper is to study the effect of buckwheat processing products (flour and flakes) on the technological process and quality of bread made from whole-wheat flour.

Investigation of structural and mechanical properties of dough showed an increase in water-absorbing capacity in all samples when adding buckwheat products. Moreover, dough made with buckwheat flakes has a lower value of mixing tolerance index (by 47 %) than dough made from buckwheat flour, and a higher valorimetric value (by 20 %).

A project was carried out from 1986 - 1991 in which different cassava genotypes, harvest ages, substitution levels and bread acceptability were evaluated. However, these studies did not have any effect on the baking sector because a constant supply of high quality, high volume and reasonably-priced cassava flour was lacking. Based on these studies, this work was aimed at determining the influence of three industrial cassava market genotypes (CMC- 40, HMC- 1, MCOL- 1505), using four wheat-cassava flour composite substitution levels (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %) regarding the rheological and fermentative characteristics of dough in bread-making. Farinogram, alveogram, <b>amylogram</b> and falling number index analysis were analysed. Specific volume and acceptability of three types of bread (common, mold and hamburger) were evaluated.

Dough development time for the composite flours was half the a-verage required for wheat flour and the tolerance index was higher; its stability became reduced due to increased substitution le-vels and its firmness increased due to a rise in water absorption.

40|$|The {{quality of}} cassava starch, an {{important}} trait in cassava breeding programs, determines its applications in various industries. For example, development of waxy (having {{a low level}} of amylose) cassava is in demand. Amylose is synthesized by granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) in plants, and therefore, down-regulation of GBSSI expression in cassava might lead to reduced amylose content. We produced 63 transgenic cassava plant lines that express hair-pin dsRNAs homologous to the cassava GBSSI conserved region {{under the control of the}} vascular-specific promoter p 54 / 1. 0 from cassava (p 54 / 1. 0 ::GBSSI-RNAi) or cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S (35 S::GBSSI-RNAi). After the screening storage roots and starch granules from field-grown plants with iodine staining, the waxy phenotype was discovered: p 54 / 1. 0 ::GBSSI-RNAi line A 8 and 35 S::GBSSI-RNAi lines B 9, B 10, and B 23. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that there was no detectable GBSSI protein in the starch granules of plants with the waxy phenotype. Further, the amylose content of transgenic starches was significantly reduced (< 5 %) compared with the level in starch granules from the wild-type (about 25 %). The inner structure of the waxy starch granules differed from that of the untransformed ones, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy analysis as well as morphological changes in the iodine-starch complex. Endothermic enthalpy was reduced in waxy cassava starches, according to differential scanning calorimeter analysis. Except B 9, all waxy starches displayed the A-type X-ray diffraction pattern. <b>Amylogram</b> patterns of the waxy cassava starches were analyzed using a rapid viscosity analyzer and found to have increased values for clarity, peak viscosity, gel breakdown, and swelling index.

The effect of the addition of this isolate to wheat flour at different substitution levels (5, 10, and 15 %) was also evaluated to find the suitable level needed to improve the nutritional value of wheat protein without affecting the rheological properties of the dough which are necessary for making bread an other baking products. The protein contents of deffated cowpea lour and copea protein isolate were 21. 91 and 69. 72 % on fresh weight basis, respectively. The protein content of the wheat flour mixed with untreated and treated (chemically and enzymatically) isolates increased with increasing the level of isolates addition. Cowpea protein isolate contained most essential amino acids in amount adequate to daily intakes of preschool children except for methionine. Methionine is the limiting amino acid in cowpea protein isolate. The amino acid composition of cowpea protein isolate was not affected markedly by enzymatic and chemical treatments. The addition of untreated and treated cowpea protein isolates to wheat flour increased lysine content in all mixtures and the increase rate was proportional to the amount of isolate added. Addition of untreated cowpea protein isolate to wheat flour improved farinograph parameters of wheat flour dough at all levels of addition, whereas chemically treated isolate adversely affected these parameters except pepsin/pancreatin treatment at 5 % level which paralleled farinogram parameters of the control. Extensigraph parameters reduced for all mixture samples compared to the control.

Rheological properties of wheat and composite flour by means of Farinograph, Extensograph, and Amylograph were also evaluated. Based on the farinograph evaluation of composite flour (70 % of wheat flour + 30 % soybean flour) it was found that the formed mixture was hydrated more slowly than the pure wheat flour, time of dough development was about 6. 5 minutes longer than that for pure wheat flour, and a value of water binding was higher by 12. 4 % compared with wheat flour. Created dough could be characterized as strong, holding long enough optimum of its rheological properties. By means of extensographic evaluation of composite flour it was found that it has lower extensographic energy, less resistance and lower tensibility compared to wheat dough, which led to insufficient volume of products. By <b>amylogram</b> it was found that composite flour has higher enzymatic activity compared to wheat flour, nevertheless both flours could be characterized as suitable for leavened bakery products. Addition of gross non-defatted soy flour at 30 % had a significant impact on technological quality of loaves baked during the baking experiments. Compared with loaves of wheat flour, the lower bread volume, specific volume and volume yield, and less satisfactory cambering was found. The effect of freezing on dough in the case of wheat flour showed the gradual reduction of the quality parameters of the loaves baked from such dough after freezing time lasting for 1, 3 and 6 months.

O amido de Musa AAA-Nanicão e Musa AAB-Terra foram caracterizados quanto as suas respostas fisiológicas [12]. Em continuidade, o presente trabalho estudou características físicas e morfológicas dos grânulos de amido de ambas as espécies de banana comparando-as com amido nativo de milho comercial. O amido de bananas foi extraído segundo CHIANG, CHU & CHU [3]. A morfologia dos grânulos foi realizada após tratamento enzimático {{in vitro}} a 37 °C/ 24 h com alfa-amilase pancreática. Foram efetuados os respectivos amilogramas e difractogramas de raios-X. Os grânulos de amido da Musa Tipo AAA-Nanicão apresentaram comprimento entre 30 - 40 µm. Em Musa AAB-Terra, os grânulos, também ovais e alongados, eram um pouco menores, 20 - 30 µm. A corrosão enzimática in vitro iniciava-se sobre a superfície anteriormente lisa e formavam estrias superficiais e apicais. A Microscopia Eletrônica de Varredura (MEV) mostrou que a hidrólise in vitro por 24 horas foi pequena e ocorria sobretudo nas camadas amorfas dos grânulos de ambas as espécies. O padrão de corrosão demonstrou-se distinto daquele ocorrido no amido de milho. As suspensões de amido de bananas ao viscosímetro demonstraram forte capacidade de hidratação e menor capacidade de retrogradação em relação ao milho, sobretudo do amido de Musa Tipo AAA-Nanicão; o amido de Musa Tipo AAB-Terra apresentou maior estabilidade de pasta. Na análise de difração de raios-X, os grânulos de bananas apresentaram padrão tipo B e C para Musa Tipo AAA-Nanicão e Musa Tipo AAB-Terra, respectivamente. Conclui-se que os amidos de Musa AAA-Nanicão e Musa AAB-Terra são estruturalmente distintos, justificando as respostas fisiológicas distintas encontradas posteriormente pelos mesmos autores. As distinções das propriedades físicas e bioquímicas obtidas para os grânulos, embora moderadas entre si e bastante distintas em relação ao amido de milho, não explicaram a alta resistência dos amidos das bananas à digestão enzimática.

Banana starch {{has been studied}} {{in the area of}} Nutrition ever since the concept of RS was introduced. The {{starches}} of Musa Type AAA-Nanicão and Musa Type AAB-Terra were characterized according to their physiological responses [12]. As a continuation, this study presents other physical and morphological features of starch granules from both species of banana, comparing them with native starch from commercial corn. The banana starches were extracted according to CHIANG, CHU & CHU [3]. The morphology of the granules was examined after hydrolysis in vitro pancreatic alpha-amylase. The respective X-ray <b>amylogram</b> and diffractogram were prepared. The length of the starch granules from Musa Type AAA-Nanicão was 30 - 40 µm. The starch granules from Musa Type AAB-Terra also presenting an oval, elongated shape, were slightly shorter between 20 - 30 µm. The enzymatic attack in vitro initiated on the once smooth surface and the corrosion caused superficial and apical grooves. A scanning electron microscopy showed that the 24 hour hydrolysis in vitro was limited, and occurred mostly in the amorphous layers of both species. The pattern of corrosion was distinctly different in the corn starch. In the viscosimeter the banana starch suspensions demonstrated a great capacity for hydration and a smaller capacity for retrogradation as compared to corn starch, especially the starch from Musa Type AAA-Nanicão; the starch from Musa Type AAB-Terra presented a greater paste stability. In the X-ray diffraction analysis, the banana starch granules were shown to be the standard type B and C for Musa Type AAA-Nanicão and Musa Type AAB-Terra, respectively. It was concluded that the structures of the starches from Musa AAA-Nanicão and Musa AAB Terra were different, justifying the different physiological responses previously found by the same authors. The distinction between the properties, both biochemical and physical, obtained for the two types of banana starch granule, although only moderate between the two, and considerably different when compared to corn starch, did not explain the high resistance of the banana starches to enzymatic digestion. For the first time, the parameters obtained in this study allow one to evaluate the characteristics and differences between the starch granules of different kinds of banana and their relation with the corn starch...|$|E
