40|$|The {{observed}} rate {{of reaction}} in the dysprosium triflate catalyzed aza-Piancatelli rearrangement is controlled by a key off-cycle binding between aniline and catalyst. Deconvoluting the role of these <b>ancillary</b> <b>species</b> greatly broadens our understanding of factors affecting the productive catalytic pathway. We demonstrate that the {{rate of reaction}} is controlled by initial competitive binding between the furylcarbinol and nitrogen nucleophile using either a Brønsted or Lewis acid catalyst and that the resulting rearrangement proceeds without involving the Brønsted and Lewis acid catalyst. This shows conclusively that the rate-controlling step and selectivity of reaction are decoupled. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanistic}} {{details on}} enamine formation between dimethylamine and propanal are unraveled using the ab initio and density functional theory methods. The addition of secondary amine to the electrophile and simultaneous proton transfer {{results in a}} carbinolamine intermediate, which subsequently undergoes dehydration to form enamine. The direct addition of amine {{as well as the}} dehydration of the resulting carbinolamine intermediate is predicted to possess fairly high activation barrier implying that a unimolecular process is unlikely to be responsible for enamine formation. Different models are therefore proposed which could explain the relative ease of enamine formation under neat condition as well as under the influence of methanol as the co-catalyst. The explicit inclusion of either the reagent or the co-catalyst is considered in the transition states as stabilizing agents. The participation of the reagent or the co-catalyst as a monofunctional <b>ancillary</b> <b>species</b> is found to stabilize the transition states relative to the unassisted or the direct addition/dehydration pathways. The reduction in enthalpy of activation is found to be much more dramatic when two co-catalysts participate in an active bifunctional mode in the rate-determining dehydration step. The transition structures exhibited characteristic features of a relay proton transfer mechanism. The free energy of activation associated with the two methanol-assisted pathway is found to be 16. 7 kcal/mol lower than that of the unassisted pathway. The results are found to be in concurrence with the available reports on the rate acceleration by co-catalysts in the Michael reaction between enamine and methyl vinyl ketone under neat conditions...|$|E
40|$|Interactions between {{light and}} {{molecular}} matter featuring photon absorption are {{commonly associated with}} excitation of individual chromophores. Subsequent relaxation is achieved through numerous mechanisms, such as scattering and energy transfer to neighbouring chromophores. The efficiency of such processes depends on many factors, including the intensity and wavelength of the optical input, the absorption cross-section of the molecule and the relative orientation of molecular components. New photonic materials are developed {{on the principle that}} such factors are controllable, duly tailoring the system to suit new technological applications. The parameters that determine the linear response in multicomponent materials are typically assessed within the theoretical framework of classical optics. However, with improved interest and capability in fabricating nanoscale structures (especially those that exhibit quantum effects), it is becoming increasingly relevant to develop theory that more faithfully represents how individual photons engage with matter. In such constructs, the interaction of materials with optical waves and photons is highly dependent on local molecular environment, therefore surrounding structures and <b>ancillary</b> <b>species</b> exert forms of influence on the photophysical processes inherent within dielectric media. At optical wavelengths where the secondary structure displays little intrinsic optical absorption, the role of such components is often interpreted as modifying the input through a corrective local index of refraction. Although expedient in the discussion of bulk properties of a macroscopic medium, it is reasonably supposed at a local chromophore-photon level that optical mechanisms operate in a different fashion. Using a fully quantized approach to the representation of local molecular electronic structure and electrodynamics, this research develops rigorous theory and a corresponding physical interpretation of how photon absorption, scattering and energy transfer are modified by vicinal, non-absorbing chromophores. The results provide insight into the mechanisms achieved within multi-chromophore systems, highlighting factors that assist in the optimization of optical characteristics in designer materials...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{result of}} UV-Visible photon {{absorption}} by complex organic molecules {{is the population}} of short-lived electronic excited states. Transportation of their excitation energy between single molecules, formally mediated by near-field interactions, may occur between the initial absorption and eventual fluorescence emission events, commonly on an ultrafast timescale. The routing of energy flow is typically effected by a sequence of pairwise transfer steps over numerous molecules, rather than a single step over the same overall distance. Directionality emerges when there is structure in the molecular organisation. For a chemically heterogeneous system with local order, and with suitable molecular dispositions, automatically unidirectional transfer can be exhibited {{as the result of}} a 'spectroscopic gradient'. However it is also possible to exert control over the directionality of excitation flow by the operation of external influences. Examples are the application of an electrical or optical stimulus to the system - achieved by the incorporation of an <b>ancillary</b> polar <b>species,</b> the application of a static electric field or electromagnetic radiation. Most significantly, based on the latter option, an all-optical method has recently been determined that enables excitation transportation to be completely switched on or off, such that the energy flow is subject to controllable photoactivated gating. It is already apparent that this photonic process, termed Optically Controlled Resonance Energy Transfer, has potentially numerous applications. For example, it represents a new basis for optical transistor action...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} a common cause of species {{richness}} gradients has spawned more than 100 explanatory hypotheses {{in just the past}} two decades. Despite recent conceptual advances, further refinement of the most plausible models has been stifled by the difficulty of compiling high-resolution databases at continental scales. We used a database of the geographic ranges of 2, 869 species of birds breeding in South America (nearly a third of the world's living avian species) to explore the influence of climate, quadrat area, ecosystem diversity, and topography on species richness gradients at 10 spatial scales (quadrat area, ≈ 12, 300 to ≈ 1, 225, 000 km 2). Topography, precipitation, topography × latitude, ecosystem diversity, and cloud cover emerged as the most important predictors of regional variability of species richness in regression models incorporating 16 independent variables, although ranking of variables depended on spatial scale. Direct measures of ambient energy such as mean and maximum temperature were of <b>ancillary</b> importance. <b>Species</b> richness values for 1 ° × 1 ° latitude-longitude quadrats in the Andes (peaking at 845 species) were ≈ 30 – 250 % greater than those recorded at equivalent latitudes in the central Amazon basin. These findings reflect the extraordinary abundance of species associated with humid montane regions at equatorial latitudes and the importance of orography in avian speciation. In a broader context, our data reinforce the hypothesis that terrestrial species richness from the equator to the poles is ultimately governed by a synergism between climate and coarse-scale topographic heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|A summer field {{campaign}} {{was conducted at}} the forested background site of K-puszta in Hungary. The main aim {{was to assess the}} contribution of terpene-derived particulate organic compounds to the PM 2. 5 organic carbon (OC) and of the secondary organic carbon (SOC) from α-pinene to the OC. The study lasted from 24 May to 29 June 2006; the first half the weather was cold, while the second half was warm. Separate daytime and night-time PM 2. 5 samples were collected with a high-volume sampler and the samples were analysed by several analytical techniques, including ion chromatography (IC) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The latter technique was used for measuring the terpene-derived <b>species.</b> <b>Ancillary</b> high time resolution measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were made with proton-transfer reaction–mass spectrometry. The temporal and diurnal variability of the particulate compounds and VOCs and interrelationships were examined. It was found that the monoterpenes and a number of terpene-derived particulate compounds, such as cis-pinic and cis-caric acid, exhibited a strong day/night difference during the warm period, with about 10 times higher levels during the night-time. During the warm period, the IC compounds and LC/MS compounds accounted, on average, for 3. 1 % and 2. 0 %, respectively, of the OC, whereas the contribution of SOC from α-pinene to the OC was estimated at a minimum of 7. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a family}} of rare uranium(III) alkyl complexes, Tp* 2 UR (Tp* = hydrotris(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazolyl) borate) (R = CH 2 Ph, CH 2 SiMe 3, CH 3, (CH 3) 3 CH 3) by salt metathesis from Tp* 2 UI and a series of potassium and sodium alkylating agents is presented. Complexes herein are routinely characterized by 1 H NMR, infrared and electronic absorption spectroscopies, and X-ray crystallography. The reactivity of these complexes with a variety of organic substrates, including terminal acetylides, amines, a variety of phenols, and benzene thiol, has been explored. This has resulted in the quantitative formation of a series of uranium(III) -element bonds, of the type Tp* 2 UR, via protonation of the alkyl substituent. ^ The studies of the reactivity of U(III) alkyl complexes are extended through exposure to a variety of C=E (E = O, S) multiple bond containing substrates. Treating the U(III) alkyl complex with carbon dioxide results in insertion into the uranium-carbon bond to generate Tp* 2 (O 2 CCH 2 Ph). The addition of 1 atm of CO 2 to the bis-Tp* U(III) derivatives results in the insertion of the greenhouse gas. In analogy, the reactivity of carbon disulfide was evaluated. CS 2 was successfully inserted across the uranium alkyl, amide, and thiol linkages. Additionally, the reactivity of Tp* 2 UCH 2 Ph with various ketones and acetates was explored. ^ Addition of a series of organic oxidants including pyridine-n-oxide, sulfur, and a variety of azides and diazomethanes, results in the quantitative formation of Tp* 2 U(E 2 -) (E = O, S 2, NR, N-NCR 2) and half an equivalent of bibenzyl. This type of reactivity shows the unique character of the U(III) carbon bond and how {{it can be used to}} facilitate two electron processes on uranium through reductive coupling of the alkyl substituent. This results in the alkyl complex functioning as a source of 2 ̆ 2 Tp* 2 U 2 ̆ 2. ^ The synthesis and reactivity of a rare, U(III) bis alkyl complex, Tp* 2 U(CH 2 Ph) 2 (THF) is summarized in chapter four. Upon exposure of this alkyl complex to an equivalent of benzophenone or mesityl azide, oxidation occurs, resulting in the formation of a U+ 4 product. Traditional reactivity of the bis alkyl complex towards protonolysis has been presented as well. Furthermore, the bis alkyl complex supports the first catalytic example of hydrosilyation of terminal olefins by uranium. ^ The chemistry of uranium with redox-active amido phenolate ligands is highlighted in Chapter 5 of this work. A series of mono amido phenolate uranium complexes have been synthesized, including (dippisq•) UI 3 (THF) 2, (dippap) UI 2 (THF) 2, (dippap) U(CH 2 Ph) 2 (THF) 2, and Cp* 2 U(dippap). Bis(amido-phenolate) U(IV) species have been synthesized and isolated as (Rap) 2 U(THF) (R = tBu, DIPP). Subsequent reactivity with I 2 produces the oxidative addition products (Risq) 2 UI 2 (THF), which establishes the [ap] ligand framework as viable for supporting two electron processes on uranium. ^ The final entry of this work focuses on the development of asymmetric ligand frameworks for a series of uranium complexes. Chiral species are important for the development of catalysts that mediate a variety types of asymmetric processes. A series of mixed ligand uranium(III) complexes, bis(Tp R) and TpR/Cp*, were synthesized and characterized, and subsequent alkylation chemistry was explored. Likewise, a series of mixed redox-active and CpR <b>ancillary</b> <b>species</b> were generated to serve as a platform for the isolation of tetravalent uranium alkyl complexes. Finally, the {{synthesis of}} uranium(III) and (IV) complexes supported by the tris(oxazoline) borate ligands are reported. ...|$|E
40|$|Forage {{quality in}} grassland-savanna {{ecosystems}} support high biomass of both wild ungulates and domestic livestock. Forage quality is however variable in both space and time. In this study findings from ecological and laboratory studies, focused on assessing forage quality, are combined {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of a remote sensing approach for predicting the spatial and temporal variations in forage quality. Spatially available ecological findings (ancillary data), and physically linked spectral data (absorption data) are evaluated {{in this study and}} combined to create models which predict forage quality (nitrogen, phosphorus and fibre concentrations) of grasses collected in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, and analysed in both dry and wet seasons. Models were developed using best subsets regression modelling. Ancillary data alone, could predict forage components, with a higher goodness of fit and predictive capability, than absorption data (Ancillary: R 2 adj ¼ 0 : 42 — 0 : 74 compared with absorption: R 2 adj ¼ 0 : 11 — 0 : 51, and lower RMSE values for each nutrient produced by the <b>ancillary</b> models). Plant <b>species</b> and soil classes were found to be ecological variables most frequently included in prediction models of ancillary data. Models in which both ancillary and absorption variables were included, had the highest predictive capabilities (R 2 adj ¼ 0 : 49 — 0 : 74 and lowest RMSE values) compared to models where data sources were derived from only one of the two groups. This research provides an important step in the process of creating biochemical models for mapping forage nutrients in savanna systems that can be generalised seasonally over large areas...|$|R
