25|$|Much of the {{characteristic}} flavour of Madeira {{is due to}} this practice, which hastens the mellowing of the wine and also tends to check secondary fermentation in <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> in effect, a mild kind of pasteurization. Furthermore, the wine is deliberately exposed to air, causing it to oxidize. The resulting wine has a colour similar to a tawny port wine. Wine tasters sometimes describe a wine which has been exposed to excessive heat during its storage as being cooked or maderized.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, intense {{feelings}} of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may {{always seem to}} be present, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> actually present and experienced from past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or flashbacks may haunt the person, and nightmares may be frequent. Insomnia may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generations, thus making genetics as one of the components of the causes of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.|$|E
25|$|Relevant is {{the fact}} that {{certainty}} is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's problem of induction). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This {{is an example of the}} butterfly effect, which is one of the subjects of chaos theory. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to predict real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to predict or attain certainty <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.|$|E

25|$|Semiotic {{art history}} seeks {{to uncover the}} codified meaning or {{meanings}} in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness. Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system. According to Schapiro, to {{understand the meaning of}} frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a , or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo da Vinci? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to reveal new possibilities.|$|E

500|$|Critic Gregory Weight {{cautions}} viewers {{against a}} cynical {{interpretation of the}} events in the film, stating that Lynch presents more than [...] "the façade and that he believes only evil and deceit lie beneath it". As much as Lynch makes a statement about the deceit, manipulation and false pretenses in Hollywood culture, he also infuses nostalgia throughout the film and recognizes that real art comes from classic filmmaking as Lynch cast thereby paying tribute to veteran actors Ann Miller, Lee Grant and Chad Everett. He also portrays Betty as extraordinarily talented and that her abilities are noticed by powerful people in the entertainment industry. Commenting on the contrasting positions between film nostalgia and the putrefaction of Hollywood, Steven Dillon writes that Mulholland Drive is critical of the culture of Hollywood <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a condemnation of [...] "cinephilia" [...] (the fascination of filmmaking and the fantasies associated with it).|$|E

Ian Inglis praises the song's [...] "uncluttered production and economical backing", adding: [...] "'Deep Blue' is unlike anything he had written or recorded at that time, and its relative obscurity is undeserved." [...] While comparing the song favourably with better-known compositions by Lennon ("Julia") and McCartney ("Yesterday", [...] "Let It Be"), Inglis concludes: [...] "Where they differ is that Harrison's song is about himself <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about his mother; her death is a starting point for an exploration of the 'suffering' and 'darkness' that afflict us all." [...] Elliot Huntley describes it as [...] "a plaintive acoustic guitar tune" [...] that became an [...] "unjustly overlooked B-side".|$|E
500|$|Stastny is a left-handed {{center and}} was one of the few NHL players known to use a wood stick since 2005, preferring it through his first four seasons in the NHL. However, he made the switch to a {{graphite}} stick to begin his 2010–11 NHL season. He considers himself a playmaker, a characteristic he says he inherited from his father. Former Avalanche captain Joe Sakic, who played with Paul and Peter Stastny, sees similarities between the two, namely their strong skating and ability to see the game. Former Avalanche coach Joel Quenneville, who faced Peter during his playing career, has said Paul plays in a similar way and complimented his hockey sense. George Gwozdecky, Stastny's coach at the University of Denver, has complimented his intelligence, ability to pass and see the ice. Although it has been said that Stastny is a slow skater, Gwozdecky too feels he is a strong skater.

500|$|GHTV was {{designed}} by FreeStyleGames {{to allow them to}} provide new music without having to secure more stringent music licensing rights. FreeStyleGames found that this mode attracted the attention of bands who were eager to offer their music for it; the bands saw GHTV as comparable to the marketing that music television channels had done in the 1980s and 1990s, putting the imagery of the band at the player as they played along. FreeStyleGames also compared GHTV to music services like Spotify and Pandora. This approach makes it easier to secure licensing rights, and fits in better with the current [...] "throwaway culture" [...] nature of society today according to Jackson. Jackson explained that the feature and its curated playlists were [...] "about discovering music <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about going and finding music you know you already like". Activision's Hirshberg stated that GHTV was developed as a better means to provide new songs to players through a round-the-clock content platform, rather than relying on scheduled downloadable content, allowing the company to provide a much larger quantity of songs, with plans for [...] "hundreds at launch on day one" [...] of the game's release.|$|E
