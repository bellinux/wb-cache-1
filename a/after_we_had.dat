25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
25|$|Immediately on our {{coming up}} out of the water <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been baptized, we {{experienced}} great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E

500|$|On 23 July, the {{day after}} leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: [...] "At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> almost given up our belief in it!" [...] In the {{succeeding}} days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although {{by the end of}} July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.|$|E
500|$|Following pilot {{training}} in the United Kingdom, Drummond received the rank of temporary second lieutenant and was attached to No.1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps, which was based in Egypt. During the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, he {{took part in the}} air assaults that preceded the Battle of Magdhaba on 23December 1916. He later wrote, [...] "The day before the Magdhaba battle, the whole crowd of us with all the bombs we could carry, went out. You couldn't see the place for smoke <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> left... The Turks were retreating all the time and we had great sport coming down to about 50 feet and peppering them with machine guns..." [...] On 20March 1917, Drummond, flying a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, was one of two pilots who strafed enemy troops threatening Lieutenant Frank McNamara as he rescued a downed Australian airman, the action for which McNamara was awarded his Victoria Cross.|$|E
500|$|Team Canada {{assistant}} coach Ferguson {{felt that the}} Canadians had gotten over-confident. [...] "I was fooled again. I felt that <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> taken a 3–1 lead, the final score might be something like 7–1. But those two short-handed goals. When you score one short-handed goal it can turn it all around. But two? That's almost fatal." [...] According to Tim Burke of the Montreal Gazette, both goaltenders, Tony Esposito and Vladislav Tretiak, reached great heights, or the outcome could have been 10–10. Tretiak was making an unexpected start for the Soviets. The Soviets had planned to start Viktor Zinger, but he {{was reported to be}} ill before the game. The Soviets coach Bobrov complained about the refereeing and the play of Wayne Cashman, stating that [...] "if that game had been played in Europe, he would have spent the whole game in the penalty box." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{final four}} months of the game's {{development}} constituted [...] "crunch time". During this period, Neurath rented an extremely small basement office space in a Somerville, Massachusetts social services building: he sought to circumvent the long commute that several team members had been making from Massachusetts. Furniture consisted of inexpensive folding tables and [...] "uncomfortable red deck chairs". Development {{took place during the}} winter, but the room was drafty and poorly heated. The team hired college friends such as Marc LeBlanc to bug test the game, and Spector stayed at the studio for roughly a month and a half, according to Church. Spector later said that [...] "in that little office, that team created some serious magic. I mean, the sense of doing something incredible was palpable". Neurath summarized, [...] "Despite the austere working environment, the game came together amazingly well in the final stretch, and we delivered the Gold Master just about two years <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> started." [...] The game was released in March 1992.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} April they {{observed}} the tracks of an Arctic fox, the first trace they had seen of a living creature other than their dogs since leaving Fram. Soon they began to see bear tracks, {{and by the end}} of May seals, gulls and whales were in evidence. On 31 May, by Nansen's calculations, they were only [...] from Cape Fligely, the northernmost known point of Franz Josef Land. However, travel conditions worsened as the warmer weather caused the ice to break up. On 22 June the pair decided to rest on a stable ice floe while they repaired their equipment and gathered their strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained on the floe for a month. The day after leaving this camp Nansen recorded: [...] "At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> almost given up our belief in it!" [...] Whether this still-distant land was Franz Josef Land or a new discovery they did not know—they had only a rough sketch map to guide them. On 6 August they reached the edge of the ice, where they shot the last of their dogs—they had been killing the weakest regularly since 24 April, to feed the others. They then lashed their two kayaks together, raised a sail and made for the land.|$|E
6000|$|... "First of all I think <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better build a fire," [...] {{suggested}} Gif. [...] "Then, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{warmed up}} and rested a bit, we can prepare supper." ...|$|R

500|$|Production on Jurassic Park began {{before the}} {{discovery}} of the large dromaeosaurid Utahraptor was made public in 1991, but as Jody Duncan wrote about this discovery: [...] "Later, <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> designed and built the Raptor, there was a discovery of a Raptor skeleton in Utah, which they labeled 'super-slasher'. They had uncovered the largest Velociraptor to date - and it measured five-and-a-half-feet tall, just like ours. So we designed it, we built it, and then they discovered it. That still boggles my mind." [...] Spielberg was particularly pleased with {{the discovery of}} the Utahraptor because of the boost it gave to the velociraptors in his film. Spielberg's name was briefly considered for naming of the new dinosaur. In reality, Velociraptor, like many other maniraptoran theropods, was covered in feathers. Jurassic Park and its sequel [...] were released before this discovery, so the creatures in both films are depicted as featherless with scales all over in the manner of modern reptiles. For Jurassic Park III, the male Velociraptor was given quill-like structures along {{the back of the head}} and neck. While this was the extent to which CGI effects were able to render feathers at the time, the structures do not resemble the down-like feathers real-life dromaeosaurids bore or the fully developed arm feathers, akin to the wing feathers of modern birds, borne by Velociraptor.|$|E
500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese recalls that, [...] "That {{very night}} in Cardiff, only hours <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> flogged Wales 28-9, their players {{turned up at}} the after-match dinner and one of them, Robert Ackerman, said: 'You can't say your players are better {{individually}} than ours. Man on man, there is little difference'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you don't}} believe in baccarat tables in London!" [...] he said. [...] "Very good! <b>We</b> shall see. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> supped <b>we</b> shall see!" ...|$|R

2500|$|... "In 1969 we were {{robbed of}} victory in Oslo [...] by the inefficient and ludicrous {{handling}} of a technical offence. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been declared winners {{and the results}} posted on the notice-board a protest about late play early in the match was made. The event ended in complete confusion, but in 1970 the official program listed France as the 1969 champions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Paul Bracchi {{investigated}} Scientology in {{the mid-1990s}} while working at the Evening Argus in East Grinstead. He recounted {{the case of a}} Scientologist who had been accused of stealing documents from Saint Hill Manor, and was told in writing that he was a suppressive person and Fair Game. The man's wife told Bracchi, [...] "For months <b>after,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> anonymous notes delivered in the post almost daily. They said, 'You bastard,' 'You're dead,' 'Nothing will save you.' It was terribly frightening." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kipling {{referred}} to such conflicts, for example: [...] "In the afternoon [...] before {{we took our}} sleep, she (the Portuguese ayah, or nanny) or Meeta (the Hindu bearer, or male attendant) would tell us stories and Indian nursery songs all unforgotten, and we were sent into the dining-room <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been dressed, with the caution 'Speak English now to Papa and Mamma.' So one spoke 'English', haltingly translated out of the vernacular idiom that one thought and dreamed in".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a shot---but {{not until}} <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> used our cameras," [...] {{answered}} the doctor's son. [...] "Don't forget the first object of this outing---to get some good pictures." ...|$|R

2500|$|She {{added that}} some of the {{technology}} on Space: 1999 has come to pass: [...] "We made up a scanning device for Dr Russell. Someone would simply be lying on the floor half dead, and I would [...] with this funny little thing that was a prop. I could read all his vital signs. They can pretty much do that [...] nowadays. There were times that we were playing with props that didn't read anything — I just had a bunch of dialogue to say <b>after.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> the Commlock. All of those things {{were on the verge of}} happening anyway. Now we're way past it. When we made it, 1999 seemed so far away." ...|$|E
2500|$|A common {{story is}} that while an instructor, Caldwell disciplined Mannock for [...] "showboating" [...] in a DH2—and then chose the talented pilot for his squadron. This appears {{chronologically}} implausible, although Caldwell obviously admired Mannock and may have hand-picked him. Caldwell also criticised Mannock for shooting two German airmen who had crash landed behind Allied lines. He wrote: [...] "The Hun crashed but not badly, and most people would have been content with this—but not Mick Mannock. He dived {{half a dozen times}} at the machine, spraying bullets at the pilot and observer, who were still showing signs of life...On being questioned as to his wild behaviour <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> landed, he heatedly replied, 'The swines are better dead—no prisoners for me!'".|$|E
2500|$|... “Our goalkeeper Asım Tevfik, left-forwarder Emin Bülent {{and right}} midfielder Ali Sami Yen were {{commissioned}} {{for the task}} of determining the new team colours. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{been in and out}} of several shops, we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fat Yanko’s store at Bahçekapısı (between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul, now called Bahçekapı). One of them was quite dark red, resembling the cherry colour, and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange. When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us of the beauty of a goldfinch. We thought we were looking at the colours flickering in burning fire. We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it would take us to victories. Indeed it did.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, {{that would}} ruin {{the charm of}} the place,” protested Uncle John. “Don’t suggest such a horror to Castro, Louise; at least until <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{returned}} to New York.” ...|$|R
