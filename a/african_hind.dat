50|$|Mycteroperca fusca has {{a limited}} range {{where it is}} rare {{especially}} in areas which are subjected to heavy fishing pressure. A {{number of studies have}} shown a negative correlation between the abundance of M. fusca and the amount of fishing pressure, suggesting that overexploitation has significantly reduced the population. It may also be threatened by competition and parasites from the invasive non-native European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), which has escaped from aquaculture in the Canaries, and <b>African</b> <b>hind</b> Cephalopholis taeniops, which has thought to have arrived in the Canaries in ships' ballast water from West Africa.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Non-native marine species, {{including}} tropical eastern Atlantic {{fish species}} {{are on the}} increase in Malta, with shipping activities being the main vector for the movement of these alien species from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean Sea. This calls for cooperation and collaboration between various sea-users and researchers to ensure continuous monitoring of coastal biodiversity. Methods Research methods involving local fishermen cooperation in monitoring efforts to identify and track populations of alien species in the Central Mediterranean has led to new records for the genus Cephalopholis (Perciformes: Serranidae) in Malta. Morphological characteristics, meristic counts and mitochondrial DNA sequences from specimens of both species sampled from Maltese waters were analysed to confirm their species identify accurately, essential for tracking their respective population expansions in the Mediterranean. Results and conclusion Results from this study have led to confirmation of the first record of the Niger Hind, Cephalopholis nigri (Günther, 1859), in the Mediterranean Sea and of {{the establishment of the}} <b>African</b> <b>Hind,</b> Cephalopholis taeniops (Valenciennes, 1828) in Maltese waters...|$|E
40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>hind</b> Cephalopholis taeniops (Valenciennes, 1828) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial demersal species caught in the Cape Verde archipelago. The species is closely associated with hard substrate and {{is one of the}} main attractions for SCUBA divers. In January 2006 a former Soviet fishing vessel - the Kwarcit - was sunk off Santa Maria Bay (Sal Island). Young C. taeniops are commonly observed in this artificial reef (AR). In order to investigate the species' use of the AR, 4 specimens were captured and surgically implanted underwater with Vemco brand acoustic transmitters. The fish were monitored daily with an active telemetry receiver for one week after release. Simultaneously, an array of 3 passive VR 2 / VR 2 W receivers was set for 63 days, registering data that allowed an analysis of spatial, daily and short term temporal activity patterns. The results showed site fidelity to the AR, with no migrations to the nearby natural reef. The method used allowed to register a consistent higher activity during daytime and a preference for the area opposite the dominant current...|$|E

50|$|Stevenson carried 67 of Mississippi’s 82 {{counties}}, {{running up}} huge margins {{in the northeastern}} corner and rural areas of the state. Eisenhower carried fifteen counties, {{the first time a}} Republican had carried any since Herbert Hoover in 1928 carried Pearl River County, George County and Stone County, and only the second since Benjamin Harrison in 1888. His main base of support came from the western counties along the Mississippi River, which had a high concentration of <b>African</b> Americans, including <b>Hinds</b> County, home to the state capital Jackson. Three counties - Sharkey, Forrest, and Lowndes - gave Eisenhower over sixty percent of the vote.|$|R
40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>hind</b> Cephalopholis taeniops (Valenciennes, 1828) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} and important demersal species caught in the Cape Verde archipelago. In this report, the life history parameters of C. taeniops are estimated and the status of the stock in the insular shelf from São Vicente to São Nicolau is assessed. Data were collected following a biological sampling scheme established in 1993. Following the changes in the gonadosomatic index it is concluded that the highest reproductive activity period extends from June to October. The maturity ogive is estimated and the mean length at sexual maturity was determined at 26. 5 cm, which corresponds to a mean age of sexual maturity of 4. 2 years. The weight-length relationship is estimated with α = 0. 0067 and β= 3. 2. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters are estimated using the Ford-Walford plot and the Macdonald and Pitcher method. For assessment purposes, the growth parameters L∞ = 62. 9 cm, Κ= 0. 12 per year and t 0 =- 0. 28, estimated using the Macdonald and Pitcher method, are used. The natural mortality is estimated to be M= 0. 34 by Pauly’s empirical formula and M= 0. 38 by Rikhter and Efanov’s formula, the last one being used in the assessment. Age-based assessment methods are applied. The cohort splitting is performed through least squares minimisation, following the Macdonald and Pitcher method of analysing distribution mixtures...|$|E
