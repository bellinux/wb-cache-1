5|$|Pepper Rodgers {{was hired}} soon after Fulcher quit. Rodgers was hired {{away from the}} UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher, simply could not return Tech to its {{national}} prominence of Dodd's era, and after six seasons, Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and barely a 50% winning percentage. Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school, and Athletic Director Doug Weaver, replaced him with Bill Curry. Homer Rice became Athletic Director, and attempted to reinvigorate Tech's program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. The Georgia Tech football program reached its lowest point in modern history after the hiring of Bill Curry, who had no experience as a head coach, but was <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> change after the flamboyant Rodgers. Curry's first two Tech teams from 1980–1981 went 2-19-1 with the only bright spots being a brilliant 24-21 victory over Bear Bryant's Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3-3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field. Things had gotten so bad, they could only get better. He slowly rebuilt the team, restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base, and in 1985 Tech won 9 games, including a 17-14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl.|$|E

50|$|While Brichter was {{initially}} developing Tweetie, {{he wanted to}} add <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> function to the application. Regarding other mobile applications of that time, he said “They all {{had to find a}} spot and just cram <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> button somewhere. Usually in one of the corners in a toolbar bordering a scrollable list. That was the most valuable real estate for navigation and action UI, so using it up for something as mundane as <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> button just seemed wasteful.” Brichter thus decided to create a different method of refreshing such that the valuable corner space could be utilized for something else. Although he initially planned to create <b>a</b> <b>refresh</b> mechanism that follows Apple’s platform conventions, Brichter’s work with pull-to-refresh resulted in a novel interaction new to Apple’s platform at the time.|$|R

In addition, due to their acidity, aroma, and ability to soften meat and deglaze cooking juices, white wines {{are often used}} in cooking.|$|E

25|$|Jars of Clay's eponymous first {{full-length}} {{album is}} characterized by a combination of drum loops and acoustic guitar strumming that would become an early trademark of the band. Strings are also used prominently in most of the songs. Honest, intense, poetic, and harmonic with sonic influences as diverse as Gregorian chants, mandolin, and gothic layered vocals, Jars of Clay was <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> break from the pessimism and alterna-angst that dominated the mid-90s music scene.|$|E

Evans' Owen Shaw was repeatedly singled out as <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> and charismatic addition to the cast, though others described the character as generic and dull.|$|E

25|$|Apeliotes (or Apheliotes) (the {{name means}} 'from the (rising) sun') was the Greek deity {{of the east}} wind. As this wind was thought to cause <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> rain {{particularly}} beneficial to farmers, he is often depicted wearing high boots and carrying fruit, draped in a light cloth concealing some flowers or grain. He is clean shaven, with curly hair and a friendly expression. Because Apeliotes was a minor god, he was often syncretized with Eurus, the southeast wind. The Roman counterpart of Apeliotes was Subsolanus.|$|E
25|$|The Pilgrims held a true thanksgiving {{celebration in}} 1623 {{following}} a fast, and <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> 14-day rain {{which resulted in}} a larger harvest. William DeLoss Love calculates that this thanksgiving was made on Wednesday, July 30, 1623, a day before the arrival of a supply ship with more colonists, but before the fall harvest. In Love's opinion this 1623 thanksgiving was significant because the order to recognize the event was from civil authority (Governor Bradford), and not from the church, making it likely the first civil recognition of Thanksgiving in New England.|$|E

Thukpa is a kind of noodle soup common among the Monpa tribe of the region. Native tribes of Arunachal are meat eaters and use fish, eggs, beef, chicken, pork, and mutton to make their dishes.

25|$|Snyder met Allen Ginsberg {{when the}} latter sought Snyder {{out on the}} {{recommendation}} of Kenneth Rexroth. Then, through Ginsberg, Snyder and Kerouac came to know each other. This period provided the materials for Kerouac's novel The Dharma Bums, and Snyder was the inspiration for the novel's main character, Japhy Ryder, in the same way Neal Cassady had inspired Dean Moriarty in On the Road. As the large majority of people in the Beat movement had urban backgrounds, writers like Ginsberg and Kerouac found Snyder, with his backcountry and manual-labor experience and interest in things rural, <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> and almost exotic individual. Lawrence Ferlinghetti later referred to Snyder as 'the Thoreau of the Beat Generation'.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century {{planting}} vines {{in countries}} where it was unknown was booming. However, it was shaky in places with higher temperatures during fermentation. The use of larger containers creates problems of fermentation: the yeasts produce heat which cannot escape and beyond 35°C the micro-organisms begin to suffer and fermentation slows then stops. After cooling the wine a new addition of yeast is needed to resume fermentation (not to mention the adverse effects on the wine's aromas {{and the risk of}} lactic bite). In California the search for temperature control of fermentation matured. Applied to white wine they revolutionized this type of wine. European wines, marked by their processes of crushing the grapes are diametrically opposed to those very fruity wines marked by <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> liveliness. During the years 1960–1990, these methods of wine-making moved to Europe and the use of refrigeration equipment is now widely used in almost all regions producing white wine.|$|E

25|$|Built as the Portland & Ogdensburg Railroad before {{acquisition}} by the Maine Central Railroad (MEC), {{the line}} initially provided transportation for summer visitors to grand Victorian hotels, including the Bay of Naples Inn in Naples (reached by connection with Sebago Lake steamboats), the Crawford House in Crawford Notch, and the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods. Cool, clean air at Sebago Lake and the White Mountains provided <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> {{escape from the}} heat, humidity and smoke of 19th-century cities. Autumn foliage and winter skiing extended the tourist season. The Flying Yankee train-set operated as the Mountaineer from Boston to Crawford Notch via Intervale Junction during World War II, but passenger service {{had been reduced to}} a single daily round-trip between Portland and St. Johnsbury by the 1930s. The train between Portland and St. Johnsbury usually consisted of a RPO-express car, a baggage car and a single coach after the 1920s; and substitution of a stainless steel combination for the coach and baggage car reduced the train to two cars {{for the last several years}} before the end of passenger service in 1958.|$|E
25|$|When Sanger {{was around}} {{five years old}} {{the family moved to}} the small village of Tanworth-in-Arden in Warwickshire. The family was {{reasonably}} wealthy and employed a governess to teach the children. In 1927, at the age of nine, he was sent to the Downs School, a residential preparatory school run by Quakers near Malvern. His brother Theo was a year ahead of him at the same school. In 1932, at the age of 14, he was sent to the recently established Bryanston School in Dorset. This used the Dalton system and had a more liberal regime which Sanger much preferred. At the school he liked his teachers and particularly enjoyed scientific subjects. Able to complete his School Certificate a year early, for which he was awarded seven credits, Sanger was able to spend most of his last year of school experimenting in the laboratory alongside his chemistry master, Geoffrey Ordish, who had originally studied at Cambridge University and been a researcher in the Cavendish Laboratory. Working with Ordish made <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> change from sitting and studying books and awakened Sanger's desire to pursue a scientific career.|$|E
25|$|Back in England in 1965, Smith beat a weak New Zealand 3–0, {{then lost}} 1–0 to South Africa, but was {{appointed}} captain for the MCC tour of Australia in 1965-66 with Cowdrey as vice-captain, despite {{support for the}} Kent captain at Lord's. Although the press labelled the England team as the weakest to go to Australia, their entertaining cricket won them favour with the crowds. They also made their runs faster than any other England team since the war and for once England batted faster than Australia, <b>a</b> <b>refreshing</b> contrast to other Ashes series of the era. The tourists had had the best run of games of any MCC team since the war, beating Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, drawing with Queensland, when they needed two more wickets to win, and losing to Victoria by 32 runs after an exciting run-chase. As a result, the bookies reduced the odds of their winning the Ashes from 7/2 to evens. England survived the follow on in the First Test and made 558 in the Second, both drawn. At Sydney in the Third Test England rattled up 488 and won by an innings and 93 runs {{to give them a}} 1–0 lead in the series. It was Australia's biggest defeat at home for nearly 50 years, but they fought back to win the Fourth Test by an innings and retained the Ashes. Rain ruined play in New Zealand and the three Test series was drawn 0–0 despite the home team suffering {{at the hands of the}} England bowlers. On his return to England Smith was dropped after losing the First Test against the West Indies in 1966 by an innings. He was replaced by Cowdrey and retired at the end of the following season.|$|E
