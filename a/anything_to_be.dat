5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E

To strengthen his position, there were Luther's own statements in his sermons on the Book of Genesis, as well as historical precedents which proved to his satisfaction {{that it was impossible}} for <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> un-Christian that God had not punished {{in the case of the}} patriarchs, who in the New Testament were held up as models of faith. It was during an illness due to his excesses that the thought of taking a second wife became a fixed purpose.|$|E

500|$|Pennington {{argues that}} American Beauty defines its {{characters}} through their sexuality. Lester's attempts to relive his youth are {{a direct result}} of his lust for Angela, and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from [...] "cold perfectionist" [...] to a more carefree soul who [...] " [...] happily along with" [...] the music in her car. Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other. Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability. By the end of the film, Angela's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester's attraction to her. Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, [...] "How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How can they be so shameless?" [...] To which Ricky replies, [...] "That's the thing, Dad—they don't feel like it's <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ashamed of." [...] Pennington argues that Col. Fitts' reaction is not homophobic, but an [...] "anguished self-interrogation".|$|E
500|$|Some {{reviewer}}s {{criticized the}} loud {{sound on the}} album and the lyrics. Jim Farber of the Daily News said the [...] "jerry-built" [...] sound the band used for the album [...] "isn't <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> admired". MusicOMH reviewer Alex Nunn, gave the album two stars out of five and said, [...] "Musically it's power chords and big riffs-ahoy, generic, mundane, boring stuff. The Open Door {{is an exercise in}} how not to make a sophomore album." [...] Darryl Sterdan of Jam! also rated The Open Door with two stars, highlighting Lee's voice and criticizing the [...] "lather, rinse, repeat" [...] formula used for making the songs on the [...] record. He further explained the songs together make a [...] "monotonous blast of self-indulgent Evanonsense", concluding that [...] "some door are better off staying closed". Andy Gill of The Independent also criticized The Open Door and said Lee's narrow vocal range was mirrored in the [...] "restricted breadth of the band's musical and emotional range, which never strays outside the short distance from paranoid to apocalyptic, concerns addressed in as bombastic and tune-dodging a manner as possible". At the 2007 NRJ Music Awards, The Open Door received a nomination for Best International Album of the Year, and the album won Album of the Year at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards. One of the album's songs, [...] "Sweet Sacrifice", was nominated in the category of Best Hard Rock Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Reception of [...] "Not Afraid" [...] {{was mixed}} to positive. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone praised the song's tone: [...] "Over a dark, operatic beat. Eminem {{delivers}} rhymes that are typically acrobatic—and typically heavy-handed. But the anger has a gathering quality." [...] Dolan also praised the song's inspirational theme. Henry Adaso of About.com gave a positive review on the song, noting [...] "Boi-1da's bouncy charm" [...] and [...] "heartwrenching lyrics from a master poet" [...] as good {{aspects of the}} song and noted no negative aspects. In Adaso's guide review, he praised Boi-1da's production and Eminem's affecting lyrics; he considered the former's work [...] "shimmering" [...] and Eminem's [...] "sensitive lyrics entwine on this knocker"; overall, he gave the song {{four and a half}} stars out of a possible five. After the song's release, AllHipHop called it [...] "an anthem in nature and rebellious to the core." [...] In her review of the Recovery, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone noted that even if Eminem—reaching his late 30s—is becoming [...] "a grumpy middle-aged man, at least he's owning it". Winston Robbins of music website Consequence of Sound called [...] "Not Afraid" [...] one of the songs on Recovery [...] "with catchy hooks, choruses, and beats multiplied by the endless pool of wit and anger that Eminem possesses". In his album review, Thomas Nassiff wrote on behalf of AbsolutePunk; he noted the song for being radio-friendly and that it [...] "doesn't sacrifice <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> friendly to the masses." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent said that this is where [...] "the only completely commendable sentiment on the entire album comes" [...] and called it a [...] "proud rehab anthem". In his review for Recovery, Benjamin Meadows-Ingram of Spin magazine called [...] "Not Afraid" [...] a [...] "stadium-ready lead single"; he went on to say, [...] "Finally, Eminem addresses his personal and professional failings head-on, rather than hiding behind a joke or inside a nightmare. It's a necessary first step in moving on." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} concerts for {{the duration}} of the tour were also met with high praise from critics: [...] Merecedes J. Howze of New Pittsburgh Courier praised the [...] "consistent" [...] show in Cincinnati, stating [...] "The duo has proven numerous times that their union, professionally and personally, is unstoppable." [...] Howze concluded that the show was definitely a [...] "couples concert" [...] meant to be [...] "enjoy" [...] with a love partner. CityBeats Jac Kern, who attended the same show praised the duo for performing hard while fully using both of the two stages and interacting with the crowd. However he also felt that intimate moments between the couple on stage were [...] "possibly staged". The production of the tour was stated to be both large and minimal by The Boston Globe writer James Read who commented that only a few performers could manage to pull off a production of On The Run's scale. He continued his review, [...] "Nor is there much to behold beyond its stars: no long catwalks, elaborate sets, or even a visible band. With Beyoncé and Jay-Z, two natural-born entertainers, you do not need much more." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press reported that the set list of the show emulated a conversation told through songs; he noted that despite the concert being a collaborative tour, [...] "it was the performers' emotional solo material that made their presence as a collaborative duo strong and resilient". The first Canadian show of the tour was again well received by critics. Graham Slaughter of the Toronto Star concluded in his review, [...] "If there's <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned from the On the Run tour, it's that tight timing, a dynamic storyline and legendary talent make a 42-song concert not just enjoyable, but rather unforgettable. Performers be warned: the bar on dual concerts has forever been raised." [...] Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times who attended the first of two shows in Pasadena, California, also gave a positive review noting that the concert showcased how a marriage should work with the spouses [...] "balancing out each other's weaknesses with individual strengths" [...] on stage. Ali went on praising the stage interactions between the pair such as kissing and toggling and concluded, [...] "Whether it was a carefully orchestrated act or not, they are a great team." ...|$|E
