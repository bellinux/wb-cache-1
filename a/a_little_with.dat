25|$|Scott {{played a}} full season of county cricket for Sussex in 1932, usually opening the bowling {{alongside}} Maurice Tate and batting at No 7 or 8 in a side full of runs. He contributed both runs and wickets: in all games he scored 838 runs {{at an average of}} 24.64 and took 67 wickets at 21.98. In the match against Northamptonshire at Northampton, he made 116 out of 169 in exactly 100 minutes, hitting seven sixes, all of them off Vallance Jupp, and 11 fours; it was his first century and it remained his highest first-class score. Late in the season, the Sussex captain Duleepsinhji, whose health had long been fragile, was forced to stand down and Scott, as the only regular amateur cricketer in the team – Melville was playing for Sussex at this point, but was still a student at Oxford – took over as captain. Sussex had been in with a chance of their first victory in the County Championship until late in the season; in the event, they subsided <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>with</b> the departure of Duleepsinhji, but still finished second.|$|E

25|$|For many years, the tolls on the {{navigation}} were leased, {{and the value}} of the lease steadily increased, from £402 in the 1780s to £950 in 1828, and had reached £1,857 per year for the period from 1843 to 1845. For the following three years it was £3,020, but it then declined, as railways arrived in the area. Brigg railway station opened on 1 November 1848, and the line from there to Gainsborough Central followed on 2 April 1849. Tolls reduced, falling to £949 in 1850, and to £700 by the late 1850s. After thirty years, trade revived <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> <b>with</b> the tolls reaching £1,000 in the 1890s. It was further boosted by the development of the sugar beet industry in the 1930s, with tolls averaging £1,294 in the late 1930s. Bishopbridge, where there was a basin, two corn mills and warehousing, acted as a distribution and collection centre for the farms and villages of that part of Lincolnshire, but by the 1970s commercial traffic had ceased except between Ferriby and Brigg, where there were factories along the river bank. All commercial traffic had ceased by the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} during the match itself, fans and the media began to react {{strongly}} to the shock of Norwich's worst-ever home defeat. During the first half, after the side had gone 4–0 down, two supporters approached the Norwich bench, appearing to throw their season tickets at Gunn. Many fans walked out before the match ended, and around 300 people protested outside the ground afterwards. Media coverage of the match was unsurprisingly negative: the BBC used terms such as [...] "calamitous defending", [...] "Colchester run riot", [...] "dismal", and a [...] "disastrous start"; journalists also speculated about Gunn's competence as a manager. Matters seemed to stabilise <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>with</b> a 4–0 League Cup win at Yeovil the following Tuesday. However, Gunn was sacked by McNally on 14 August 2009, six days after the defeat by Colchester.|$|E
500|$|Amber Holcomb, a {{contestant}} of the 12th {{season of}} American Idol covered the song on April 10, 2013, during {{an episode of}} the show. Brian Mansfield of USA Today praised her performance writing that she was [...] "comfortable and confident and happy" [...] but added that in the end, the high melody of the song [...] "puts a little strain on her voice toward the end". That was somehow echoed by Bobby Olivier of The Star-Ledger who noted that the performance was [...] "pitchy, {{but a lot of}} fun". However, he wrote that Holcomb [...] "seemed to struggle <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>with</b> keeping up with the melody" [...] and that her version was different from the original, but concluded that it was a solid performance. On April 8, 2013, Zendaya and Val Chmerkovskiy performed a samba dance to the song during the 16th season of the American show Dancing with the Stars. Morissette Amon and Penelope Matanguihan performed the song on the first season of The Voice of the Philippines on June 23 and July 14, 2013 respectively.|$|E

[...] Poquita Ropa offered a drastic change in which Arjona minimized the number of instruments. The result was a set of a cappella performances. Arjona commented about this album that [...] "music and women look better with little clothes." [...] Production was handled by Arjona and Dan Warner, who also worked with Shakira, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. Birchmeier gave the album a somewhat positive review, saying that it was a [...] "stripped-down acoustic effort", considering it [...] "impressive". He also commented that Poquita Ropa [...] "finds Arjona at his most naked, backed by spare arrangements of acoustic guitar, piano, and Hammond B-3 along with occasional touches of strings, woodwinds, and chorus vocals." ...|$|E

The black hood is slightly glossy in bright light, can fade <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>with</b> age, and is slightly duller and more brownish in the adult female.

The tail tip and outer wing feathers are white. The underparts are white. The eyes are a dark brown, the legs grey and the bill a pale bluish grey tipped with black, with a prominent hook at the end.|$|E

2500|$|Maradona captained the Argentine {{national}} team {{to victory in}} the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, winning the final in Mexico City against West Germany. Throughout the tournament, Maradona asserted his dominance and was the most dynamic player of the tournament. He played every minute of every Argentina game, scoring five goals and making five assists, three {{of those in the}} opening match against South Korea at the Olimpico Stadium. His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game in Puebla. Argentina eliminated Uruguay in the first knockout round in Puebla, setting up a match against England at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. After scoring two contrasting goals in the 2–1 quarter-final win against England, his legend was cemented. The majesty of his second goal and the notoriety of his first led to the French newspaper L'Equipe describing Maradona as [...] "half-angel, half-devil". This match was played with the background of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom. Replays showed that the first goal was scored by striking the ball with his hand. Maradona was coyly evasive, describing it as [...] "a little with the head of Maradona and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>with</b> the hand of God". It became known as the [...] "Hand of God". Ultimately, on 22 August 2005, Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his hand purposely, and no contact with his head was made, and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate. This became known as an international fiasco in World Cup history. The goal stood, much to the wrath of the English players.|$|E
