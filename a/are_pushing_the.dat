This would allow the city to organize its government independently, to pass laws, to enact its own tax regulations, etc. The idea of municipal autonomy was expounded and elaborated on by Rosario-born politician Lisandro de la Torre in the first years of the 20th century, and incorporated into the Argentine Constitution as part of the 1994 reform.|$|E

Amaterasu produces black flames at {{the focal point of the}} user's vision. Once created, it can continue burning for seven days and seven nights. The flames cannot be extinguished with water or any other normal method; only the user can put the flames out. Said to be [...] "the fires from hell" [...] and to burn as hot as the sun itself, Amaterasu burns virtually any material, including other flames, until nothing but ash remains. However, the flames cannot burn through chakra or materials infused with chakra, as they fail to burn into Naruto's Kurama chakra cloak or through Gaara's chakra-infused sand. This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person. Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks. For more advanced users, they can shape Amaterasu into more specialized configurations. Use of Amaterasu puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed. For all its lethal potential, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body parts before it spreads. Other defensive options <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> flames away, absorbing them, certain space–time ninjutsu, or being the host of the Ten Tails.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and noted that}} the episode [...] "gains points for the obscure subject matter" [...] but [...] "loses them for the strained conspiratorial element". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also gave it a [...] "B–". He praised the cold open for its strangeness and X's involvement, but thought that the explanation for Banton's shadow was not satisfactorily fleshed out. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the episode's case, calling it one wherein [...] "Mulder and Scully get to investigate properly, coming up with theories that they later build on or retract." [...] Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the episode's conclusion, noting that [...] "there's no better illustration for distrusting the government than the brilliant closing scene" [...] which features Shalhoub [...] "fixed to a chair, bombarded with flashes of light, as one single tear rolls down his terrified face." [...] Other reviews were decidedly more critical. John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 5 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode falls short due to a completely ludicrous central concept, only partially countered by an interesting resolution highlighting the more sinister side of Informant X. Much like last season’s final few episodes, this season is ending with plenty of hints that Mulder and Scully <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> wrong buttons." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2011, Silas takes a dislike to Riley's fiancé, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), {{after he}} learns of her promiscuity. Silas {{attempts}} and fails to attack Mercedes with a candlestick when her back is turned. Metcalfe later hinted that Mercedes {{may have to}} watch her back in the future {{when it comes to}} Silas. She said [...] " [...] is a tough cookie, isn't he? I think every girl in the village needs to watch their back where Silas is concerned..." [...] In October 2011, it was reported that Silas would hold Mercedes captive in a vault. Silas decides to teach heavily pregnant Mercedes a lesson after she confesses to an affair with Riley's father, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Silas's plan is to keep Mercedes alive until she has given birth and then murder her. Metcalfe called the plot [...] "brilliant" [...] and said it was [...] "quite flattering" [...] to be trusted with it. The actress explained that Mercedes thinks that she is going to die whilst being help captive. Mercedes also fears that her baby is going to die. Metcalfe said that it does not take long for Mercedes to realise that Silas is responsible for the recent murders. Silas wants to keep the baby alive, but not Mercedes. Therefore, Silas does the [...] "bare minimum" [...] for Mercedes, giving her water, a small amount of food and keeping her warm. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy opined that storyline sounds [...] "really dark" [...] and asked Metcalfe whether Hollyoaks <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> boundaries with it. Metcalfe revealed that [...] "they are a little bit", saying [...] "It's all shot in a very clever way, so it was fine when it came to compliance. But it was difficult {{and there was a lot}} of stuff that we had to be really careful about when we were filming it."

2500|$|... 2015 Greek {{sovereign}} debt default: The publicly acrimonious discussions between Greece and EU-ECB-IMF troika {{culminated in the}} 2015 Greek referendum which massively rejected the terms for accepting bail-out money [...] {{and led to a}} surge in public support for populist political parties in Southern European countries. The suggestion of a temporary 'time-out' from the EuroZone for Greece by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and a German Finance Ministry suggestion that Greece move titles to Greek assets - including heritage sites and islands to an [...] "external fund" [...] based in Luxembourg to serve as collateral in exchange for bail-out money from the EU-ECB-IMF troika; infuriated many policy-makers who perceived Germany's demands as humiliating punishment and refreshed memories to post-WWII reparations owed by the German government which were never fully repaid due to extensive debt-relief accorded to Germany. Pablo Iglesias, a prominent anti-austerity leader in Spain, hailed the Greek rejection of the bailout plan and expressed solidarity with Greece: [...] "We don’t want to be a German colony". In Italy, Beppe Grillo mocked Germany and the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF troika of lenders saying [...] "Now Merkel and bankers will have food for thought.". Jacob Soll, professor of history and accounting at the University of Southern California, summarized the sentiment amongst academics in Germany: [...] "Germans were honest dupes and the Greeks corrupt, unreliable and incompetent.". Expressing dismay about the far-reaching geopolitical implications of Greece leaving the Eurozone, Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European studies at Oxford University, termed the German-inspired policy prescriptions as deeply flawed and possibly unachievable by Greece [...] "even with the best political will in the world." [...] and warned how the Grexit ("Greece exit") will be perceived elsewhere: [...] "EU can’t get its act together" [...] adding {{that it would be a}} [...] "huge blow for the EU particularly in the eyes of the outside world: China, India, Russia, and the U.S., not to mention closer neighbors." [...] Leading academics and analysts highlighted that EuroZone anti-deficit policies forced upon Greece by the German-backed troika to curb public spending had brought about deflationary pressure, weakened demand and led to widespread unemployment in several EuroZone countries. Paul Krugman, a Nobel economics winner, stated that he was troubled by the actions of the troika to use economics as a weapon to force a regime change in Greece. Fellow Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz squarely faulted the troika for imposing upon Greece an [...] "unconscionable torture of the present". Wharton finance professor Bulent Gultekin opined: [...] "The endless austerity measures have made it worse for the country. It's been the wrong remedy for the wrong patient at the wrong time". John Cochrane, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University pointed to the source of the current crisis : [...] "Europe should not have bailed out German and French banks and allowed Greece to default in the first instance. In a currency union, {{sovereign debt}} is like corporate debt. Corporations default — or they should — without bailouts, and don’t leave a currency zone when they do so. Europe should not have allowed and encouraged national banks to load up on national debts." [...] Francesco Caselli, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, opined that Greece should [...] "focus on structural reforms rather than austerity. Greece should have gotten meaningful debt relief and much more time to balance the deficit." [...] Olivier Chatain, strategy and business policy professor at HEC business school in Paris opined: [...] "There's a big chasm between what's asked of Greece and what they can do." [...] Mauro Guillén, Wharton management professor and director of The Lauder Institute urged an effort from the creditor nations: [...] "Wages in Germany should rise and government demand for goods and services should increase,(...) Surplus economies, like Germany and the Netherlands, who can spend more should do so". Patrick Minford, professor of economics at Cardiff University in Wales pointedly observed the destructive nature of German economic policies which result in massive trade surpluses for Germany while pauperising weaker EuroZone countries: [...] "unhealthy for Germany to run very large trade surpluses. They’re sabotaging the rest of Europe." [...] Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute assessed the current situation saying: [...] "Greece's debt cannot be paid back under any circumstances, (..) They need to undergo bankruptcy proceedings. We cannot move forward until the Germans and Dutch begin to realize this money will never get paid back and [...] <b>are</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> Greek economy further into depression." ...|$|E

One hears that this sort of open conviviality tempts by its facility to those excesses of hospitality which are such a drain on English incomes; but again that is something of which an outsider can hardly venture to have an opinion.
