Now, at last, I {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E

I find it sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty of our planet, that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E

In June 2014, FinMkt {{filed a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a breach of agreement by former partner Dara Albright. FinMkt claimed that Albright regretted having sold NowStreet for only $5,000, and {{that as a result}} of the deal FinMkt owned a third of Lendit. Albright filed a countersuit denying FinMkt's ownership of NowStreet and claiming she had been “fraudulently induced” to sell. “It is unfortunate that we were forced to file this action,” said Cox. “We intend to let the facts speak for themselves, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> utmost confidence the courts will rule in our favor." ...|$|E

During his tenure, Brittain was able to convince the state of Georgia to increase funding for the Institute.

[...] Additionally, a $300,000 grant (equivalent to $ in [...] ) from the Guggenheim Foundation allowed Brittain to establish the David Guggenheim School of Aeronautics at Georgia Tech.

500|$|Regarding {{the look}} {{and nature of the}} film's cinematography, Giaimo was greatly {{influenced}} by Jack Cardiff's work in Black Narcissus. According to him, it lent a hyper-reality to the film: [...] "Because this is a movie with such scale <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian fjords to draw from, I really wanted to explore the depth. From a design perspective, since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects, and what the fjords provide, it was perfect. We encased the sibling story in scale." [...] Ted D. McCord's work in The Sound of Music was another major influence for Giaimo. It was also Giaimo's idea that Frozen should be filmed in the CinemaScope aspect ratio, which was approved by Lasseter. This marked Frozen the first film to be completely shot in CinemaScope since 2000's Titan A.E.. Giaimo also wanted to ensure that Norway's fjords, architecture and rosemaling folk art, were critical factors in designing the environment of Arendelle. Giaimo, whose background is in traditional animation, said that the art design environment represents a unity of character and environment and that he originally wanted to incorporate saturated colors, which is typically ill-advised in computer animation. For further authenticity, a live reindeer named Sage was brought into the studio for animators to study its movements and mannerisms for the character Sven.|$|E

500|$|In June 2005, Ivy Queen {{partnered with}} co-founder of Perfect Image Records, José Guadalupe to form Filtro Musik. This stemmed from Guadalupe parting ways {{with the other}} co-founder of Perfect Image, Anthony Pérez who in turn would launch his own label The Roof Records. Filtro Musik's concept {{initially}} stemmed from its name which means [...] "filter" [...] in English. Guadalupe explained the title, saying [...] "I've been in this industry for 15 years now, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to filter and pick the best". In the coming year, Univision Music Group signed the label to licensing plan to release the album in September 2005, which ensured that the [...] "album was positioned in Latin and mainstream accounts that would normally not carry Latin product." [...] Ivy Queen was previously married to fellow reggaeton artist Omar Navarro, known by his stage name Gran Omar. They were divorced in 2005 shortly before the release of Flashback, which influenced {{the composition of the}} album. She denied ever having found him in the act of adultery, while claiming that if she had found Navarro with another woman, she'd be in La Vega Alta, a prison for women in Puerto Rico. She also denied rumors that she had physically assaulted the woman she caught with Navarro. She stated they had not lived with each other for two months citing the [...] "extensive travels of her husband and his workload of being a producer" [...] as being causes {{to the end of the}} nine-year marriage.|$|E
500|$|Schooley and McCorkle {{approached}} {{the challenge of}} portraying dating {{in a way that}} would appeal to both younger and older children by having the villains, particularly Shego, react to news of Kim and Ron's relationship with disbelief since [...] "Ron is painfully aware that he is the luckiest man in the world ... for landing Kim", according to Schooley. Approaching their romantic relationship much like they did their friendship, the writers refused to treat the storyline like a soap opera in which the couple constantly breaks up and reunites, keeping their romance realistic by quickly abandoning [...] "the lovey-dovey phase". To avoid alienating younger audiences, Schooley and McCorkle only slightly acknowledged the relationship, maintaining that Kim [...] "still saves the world. We still have the villains, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> comedy with the villains and their bizarre schemes and how they get foiled." [...] The fourth season introduces new villains such as Camille Leone, a shapeshifting celebrity heiress, Warmonga, and a more serious villain who possesses [...] "No funny clownish behavior, just evil." [...] The villains also work together against Kim in different combinations. Kim is also given her own car while her brothers, having skipped several grades due to their intelligence, join her in high school despite being only 12 years-old, much to Kim's chagrin. Wade ventures outside his bedroom more often, occasionally assisting Kim and Ron in person. The recurring character Monique, who was created because Schooley and McCorkle felt that Kim would be more realistic if she were to have a female best friend in addition to Ron, is expanded from that of simply an observer of Kim and Ron's lives to a more involved member of Team Possible, broadening the ensemble. Ron's home life is also explored as he welcomes a younger sibling. The series ends with Kim and Ron graduating, leaving their future open to imagination. Several Season 4 episodes were edited and shortened for time because they would run up to five minutes too long, forcing Loter to eliminate some sub plots and characters.|$|E

István Gyulai, then-Secretary General of the International Association of Athletics Federations, asked Isaiah Kiplagat, president of Athletics Kenya, to help {{shed light on the}} issue. Born in Kenya under a different name, it was claimed that {{the identity of}} Taher was altered upon his switch to Bahrain, to qualify for international junior and youth events. According to the East African Standard, Taher had supposedly beaten Eliud Kipchoge in a junior cross-country race in 2001. Kiplagat was quoted as saying that [...] "I have already told IAAF that the two runners are cheats <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> proof".|$|E
2500|$|A fervent anti-communist, Felt {{advocated}} American {{military intervention}} in Laos to suppress the Soviet-backed Pathet Lao insurrection and to interdict the flow of supplies from North Vietnam to Communist insurgents in South Vietnam through the Laotian town of Tchepone. In a meeting with Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, Felt declared, [...] "We have the Seventh Fleet <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> planes to wipe Tchepone {{off the face of}} the earth." [...] Instead, after an initial buildup of ships and Marines near Laotian borders, all American forces were withdrawn in accordance with a 1962 Geneva Conference in which all parties pledged to respect Laotian sovereignty. North Vietnam continued to supply South Vietnamese insurgents via Laos along what would become the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b (i.e. 1) then a (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b–9 (1–35), therefore the weight b1 is 35 instead of 36.
