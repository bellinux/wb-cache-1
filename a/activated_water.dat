To cleave the N-glycosidic bond, monofunctional glycosylases use an <b>activated</b> <b>water</b> molecule to attack carbon 1 of the substrate.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of IMPDH involves {{a sequence of}} two different chemical reactions: (1) a fast redox reaction involving a hydride transfer to NAD which generates NADH and an enzyme-bound XMP intermediate (E-XMP*) and (2) a hydrolysis step that releases XMP from the enzyme. IMP binds to the active site and a conserved cysteine residue attacks the 2-position of the purine ring. A hydride ion is then transferred from the C2 position to NAD and the E-XMP* intermediate is formed. NADH dissociates from the enzyme and a mobile active-site flap element moves a conserved catalytic dyad of arginine and threonine into the newly unoccupied NAD binding site. The arginine residue is thought to act as the general base that <b>activates</b> a <b>water</b> molecule for the hydrolysis reaction. Alternatively, molecular mechanics simulations suggest that in conditions where the arginine residue is protonated, the threonine residue is also capable of <b>activating</b> <b>water</b> by accepting a proton from water while transferring its own proton to a nearby residue.|$|R
50|$|ALDH3A1’s {{catalytic}} mechanism mirrors that {{of other}} enzymes of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. The sulfur atom of Cys244 attacks the carbonyl of the aldehyde substrate in a nucleophilic attack that releases a hydride ion. The hydride ion is accepted by the NAD(P)+ bound to the Rossman fold. Unique interactions between the cofactor and the Rossman fold facilitate an isomerization of the enzyme that releases the cofactor while maintaining {{the integrity of the}} active site. A water molecule enters the active site and is subsequently activated by a glutamate residue. The <b>activated</b> <b>water</b> then attacks the thioester enzyme-substrate complex in nucleophilic reaction that regenerates the free enzyme, and releases the corresponding carboxylic acid.|$|E

50|$|Beta-ketoacyl-synthase’s {{mechanism}} {{is a topic}} of debate among chemists. Many agree that Cys171 of the active site attacks acetyl ACP's carbonyl, and, like most enzymes, stabilizes the intermediate with other residues in the active site. ACP is subsequently eliminated, and it deprotonates His311 in the process. A thioester is then regenerated with the cysteine in the active site. Decarboxylation of a malonyl CoA that {{is also in the}} active site initially creates an enolate, which is stabilized by His311 and His345. The enolate tautomerizes to a carbanion that attacks the thioester of the acetyl-enzyme complex. Some sources speculate that an <b>activated</b> <b>water</b> molecule also resides in the active site as a means of hydrating the CO2 of attacking C3 of malonyl CoA. Another proposed mechanism considers the creation of a tetrahedral transition state. The driving force of the reaction comes from the decarboxylation of malonyl ACP; the energy captured in that bond technically comes from ATP, which is what is initially used to carboxylate acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{previously}} {{reported that the}} hydrolysis of inositol monophosphate was catalyzed by IMPase through a 2-magnesium ion mechanism. [...] However a recent 1.4 A resolution crystal structure shows 3 magnesium ions coordinating in each active binding site of the 2 dimers, supporting a 3-magnesium ion mechanism. The mechanism for hydrolysis is now thought to proceed as such: the enzyme is activated by a magnesium ion binding to binding site I, containing three water molecules, and stabilized by the negative charges on the carboxylates of Glu70 and Asp90, and the carbonyl of Ile92. [...] Another magnesium ion then cooperatively binds to binding site 2, which has of carboxylates of Asp90, Asp93, Asp220, and three water molecules, {{one of which is}} shared by binding site 1. Then, a third magnesium weakly and non-cooperatively to the third binding site, which has 5 water molecules and residue Glu70.
