25|$|At one time, in {{an effort}} to extend the U-2's {{operating}} range and to eliminate the need for foreign government approval for U-2 operations from USAF bases in foreign countries, it was suggested that the U-2 be operated from aircraft carriers. Three aircraft were converted for carrier operations by the installation of <b>arrester</b> <b>hooks,</b> and carrier-qualified naval aviators were recruited to fly them.|$|R
2500|$|The {{specification}} {{required the}} Pike to fly with wheels or floats. [...] As a landplane the Pike had a single-axle undercarriage, {{with a pair}} of oleo legs mounted at the wing root front spar and with rearward bracing. [...] The axle carried <b>arrester</b> <b>hooks,</b> which engaged on landing with the longitudinal arrestor wires of those days. [...] The floats were long, with marked chine and two steps, the second close to the tip where there was also a water rudder. [...] They used the same oleo legs as the landplane, augmented by a pair of forward-reaching struts to the fuselage behind the lower radiator, and another pair aft.|$|R
25|$|Hurricane Mk IIC version {{equipped}} with catapult spools, an <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> and full naval avionics; 400 aircraft were converted and used on fleet and escort carriers. The Merlin XX engine on the Sea Hurricane generated 1460hp at 6,250 ft and 1435hp at 11,000 ft. Top speed was 322 mph at 13,500ft and 342 mph at 22,000 ft.|$|E
25|$|Deliveries to the US Navy {{took place}} during 1943 and 1944. The service {{received}} 80 SB2A-2s and 60 SB2A-3s; the latter variant was fitted with folding wings and an <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> {{to enable them to}} operate from aircraft carriers. The US Navy also regarded the SB2A as unsuitable for combat and training purposes, and mainly used its aircraft as target tugs and for ground maintenance training.|$|E
25|$|Hurricane Mk I version {{equipped}} with catapult spools, an <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> and the four-cannon wing. From February 1942, 400 aircraft were converted. The Sea Hurricane IC used during Operation Pedestal had their Merlin III engines modified to accept 16 lb boost, and could generate more than 1,400hp at low altitude. Lt. R. J. Cork {{was credited with}} five kills while flying a Sea Hurricane IC during Operation Pedestal.|$|E
5000|$|Many air combats took place, {{and in its}} brief {{campaign}} in Norway the squadron accounted for at least 14 enemy aircraft, besides probably destroying many others. On 7 June the squadron was ordered to evacuate Norway immediately and, {{on the night of}} 7 through 8 June, the Hurricanes were successfully flown back to Glorious — a dangerous procedure as none of the aircraft were fitted with deck <b>arrester</b> <b>hooks.</b> The ground parties embarked on [...] and SS Monarch of Bermuda and reached the UK safely, but the squadron's aircraft and eight of its pilots were lost when Glorious was sunk by German warships on 9 June 1940. The two pilots who survived were the Squadron Commander, Squadron Leader (later Air Chief Marshal) [...] "Bing" [...] Cross, and the Flight Commander, Flight Lieutenant (later Air Commodore) [...] "Jamie" [...] Jameson.|$|R
50|$|Armament {{was fairly}} standard. There was a fixed 0.303 (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun monted {{in the port}} side of the pilot's cockpit. The gunner had a Lewis gun of the same calibre, mounted on a Scarff ring. Up to four bombs could be carried on underwing racks. The {{specification}} required the Pike to fly with wheels or floats. As a landplane the Pike had a single-axle undercarriage, {{with a pair of}} oleo legs mounted at the wing root front spar and with rearward bracing. The axle carried <b>arrester</b> <b>hooks,</b> which engaged on landing with the longitudinal arrestor wires of those days. The floats were long, with marked chine and two steps, the second close to the tip where there was also a water rudder. They used the same oleo legs as the landplane, augmented by a pair of forward-reaching struts to the fuselage behind the lower radiator, and another pair aft.|$|R
2500|$|F4U-1A (Corsair Mk II Fleet Air Arm): The {{designation}} F4U-1A {{does not}} appear in lists of Corsair Bureau Numbers and was not officially used, being applied post-war to differentiate mid-to-late production F4U-1s from the early production variant. Mid-to-late production Corsairs incorporated a new, taller and wider clear-view canopy with only two frames — very close to what the Malcolm hood did for British fighter aircraft — along with a simplified clear view windscreen; the new canopy design meant that the semi-elliptical Plexiglas rear-view dorsal turtledeck [...] "flank" [...] windows could be omitted. The pilot's seat was raised [...] which, combined with the new canopy and a lengthened tailwheel strut, allowed the pilot better visibility over the long nose. In addition to these changes the clear view panels under the cockpit were also omitted. These Corsairs introduced a -long stall strip just outboard of the gun ports on the right wing leading edge and improved undercarriage oleo struts which eliminated bouncing on landing, making these the first [...] "carrier capable" [...] F4Us. Though the Royal Navy had been successfully operating the Corsair Mk I since 1 June 1943 when No. 1830 Squadron was commissioned and assigned to HMS Illustrious. [...] F4U-1s in many USMC squadrons had their <b>arrester</b> <b>hooks</b> removed.|$|R
25|$|The Alpha Jet was {{designed}} to perform a diverse range of roles. The principal users of the type, Germany and France, operated their Alpha Jets in different capacities, the former as a ground attack platform and the latter as a trainer aircraft. Beyond performing different roles, the Alpha Jet fleets of France and Germany noticeably differed in their specification and equipment; German aircraft were fitted with a more extensive weapon-aiming system, a different fuel system, a yaw damper, different brakes, nosewheel steering, an <b>arrester</b> <b>hook,</b> and Stencel ejector seats in place of Martin-Baker. According to aerospace publication Flight International, {{the majority of the}} specialised equipment used on the ground attack-orientated variant of the Alpha Jet was provided by German firms. In addition to the ground attack role, the Luftwaffe also employed the Alpha Jet in the electronic countermeasures (ECM) and aerial reconnaissance roles; for the latter purpose, a reconnaissance pod could be fitted upon the port hardpoint.|$|E
500|$|As completed, {{the ship}} had two main hangar decks and a third {{auxiliary}} hangar, giving a total capacity of 60 aircraft. The third and lowest hangar deck was used only for storing disassembled aircraft. The two main hangars opened onto the middle and lower flight decks to allow aircraft to take off directly from the hangars while landing operations were in progress on the main flight deck above. The upper and middle hangar areas totaled about , the lower hangar about [...] No catapults were fitted. Her forward aircraft lift was offset to starboard and [...] in size. Her aft lift was on the centerline and [...] The aft elevator serviced the upper flight deck and all three hangar decks. Her arresting gear was an unsatisfactory British longitudinal system used on the carrier Furious that relied on friction between the <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> and the cables. The Japanese {{were well aware of}} this system's flaws, as it was already in use on their first carrier, Hōshō, but had no alternatives available when Akagi was completed. It was replaced during the ship's refit in 1931 with a Japanese-designed transverse cable system with six wires and that was replaced in turn before Akagi began her modernization in 1935 by the Kure Model 4 type (Kure shiki 4 gata). There was no island superstructure when the carrier was completed; the carrier was commanded from a space below the forward end of the upper flight deck. The ship carried approximately [...] of aviation fuel for her embarked aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|A tailhook, arresting hook, or <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> is {{a device}} {{attached}} to the empennage (rear) of some military fixed-wing aircraft. [...] The hook is used to achieve rapid deceleration during routine landings aboard aircraft carrier flight decks at sea, or during emergency landings or aborted takeoffs at properly equipped airports.|$|E

The pilot's seat was raised 7 in which, combined with the new canopy and a lengthened tailwheel strut, allowed the pilot better visibility over the long nose. In addition to these changes the clear view panels under the cockpit were also omitted. These Corsairs introduced a 6 in-long stall strip just outboard of the gun ports on the right wing leading edge and improved undercarriage oleo struts which eliminated bouncing on landing, making these the first [...] "carrier capable" [...] F4Us. Though the Royal Navy had been successfully operating the Corsair Mk I since 1 June 1943 when No. 1830 Squadron was commissioned and assigned to HMS Illustrious. [...] F4U-1s in many USMC squadrons had their <b>arrester</b> <b>hooks</b> removed.Additionally, an experimental R-2800-8W engine with water injection was fitted on one of the late F4U-1As. After satisfactory results, many F4U-1As were fitted with the new powerplant. The aircraft carried 237 gal (897 l) in the main fuel tank, located in front of the cockpit, as well as an unarmored, non-self-sealing 62 gal (235 l) fuel tank in each wing. This version of the Corsair was the first to be able to carry a drop tank under the center-section. With drop tanks fitted, the fighter had a maximum ferry range of just over 1500 mi.|$|R
2500|$|The Zéphyr {{differed}} from the Magister in being equipped with an <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> and a modified structure and undercarriage strengthened for carrier operations. [...] The Zéphyr also included a nose-mounted light. [...] As {{it did not have}} ejection seats, the Zéphyr had new sliding canopy hoods which could be locked open during carrier launchings and landings. One six-round rocket pod could be mounted under each wing for weapons training. [...] Two guns could be fitted in the nose, but these were seldom carried. Thirty-two aircraft were delivered.|$|E
2500|$|Hurricane Mk I version {{equipped}} with catapult spools plus an <b>arrester</b> <b>hook.</b> From July 1941 they operated from [...] and from October 1941, {{they were used}} on merchant aircraft carrier (MAC) ships, which were large cargo vessels with a flight deck fitted, enabling aircraft to be launched and recovered. A total of 340 aircraft were converted. The first Sea Hurricane IB kill occurred on 31 July 1941 when Sea Hurricanes of 880 squadron FAA operating from HMS Furious shot down a Do 18 flying-boat.|$|E
2500|$|Several Meteor F.3s were {{converted}} into navalised aircraft. The adaptations included a strengthened undercarriage and <b>arrester</b> <b>hook.</b> Operational {{trials of the}} type took place aboard [...] The trials included carrier landings and takeoffs. Performance of these naval prototype Meteors proved to be favorable, including takeoff performance, leading to further trials with a modified Meteor F.4 fitted with folding wings; a 'clipped wing' was also adopted. The Meteor later entered service with the Royal Navy, but only as a land-based trainer, the Meteor T.7, to prepare pilots of the Fleet Air Arm for flying other jet aircraft such as the de Havilland Sea Vampire.|$|E

A total of 340 aircraft were converted. The first Sea Hurricane IB kill occurred on 31 July 1941, when Sea Hurricanes of 880 squadron, operating from HMS Furious shot down a Do 18 flying-boat. The Fleet Air Arm preferred the lighter de Havilland propellers over the Rotol types; it was found during tests that the Rotol unit {{could lead to the}} nose dipping during arrested landings, causing the propeller blades to [...] "peck" [...] the carrier deck. The lighter de Havilland units avoided this problem.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 October 1949, {{the third}} prototype, VP422, made its maiden flight. Being {{representative}} of the subsequent production aircraft, VP422 incorporated a number of modifications {{as a result of}} the experiences gained from trials with the second prototype, these alterations included the fitting of a longer <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> when a number of [...] "bolters" [...] were experienced during the early dummy deck trials. After the longer hook was incorporated, this modification was carried though the remaining production runs. Other changes included the addition of fixtures for rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) and hard points plumbed for external drop tanks. On 22 November 1949, Hawker received an initial production contract for 151 aircraft, the aircraft also received the name Sea Hawk at this point. Throughout 1950, both VP413 and VP422 were used to conduct preliminary service trials.|$|E
2500|$|To meet {{specification}} N.15/44 for a navalised Mosquito for Royal Navy {{use as a}} torpedo bomber, de Havilland {{produced a}} carrier-borne variant. A Mosquito FB.VI was modified as a prototype designated Sea Mosquito TR Mk 33 with folding wings, <b>arrester</b> <b>hook,</b> thimble nose radome, Merlin 25 engines with four-bladed propellers and a new oleo-pneumatic landing gear rather than the standard rubber-in-compression gear. Initial carrier tests of the Sea Mosquito were carried out by Eric [...] "Winkle" [...] Brown aboard HMS Indefatigable, the first landing-on taking place on 25 March 1944. An order for 100 TR.33s was placed although only 50 were built at Leavesden. Armament was four 20mm cannon, two 500lb bombs in the bomb bay (another two could be fitted under the wings), eight 60lb rockets (four under each wing) and a standard torpedo under the fuselage. The first production TR.33 flew on 10 November 1945. This series was followed by six Sea Mosquito TR Mk 37s, which differed in having ASV Mk XIII radar instead of the TR.33's AN/APS-6.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{prototype}} to fly {{was actually}} the third aircraft ordered: Designated XFJ-2B and first flown on 27 December 1951, it differed only from a standard F-86E-10 in its armament, having four 20-mm Colt Mk 12 cannon instead of the six Colt-Browning M3 [...]50 machine guns of the Sabre. The second and third aircraft to fly were designated XFJ-2 and lacked armament, but were modified to be carrier-capable: They had an <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> and a longer nosewheel leg to increase angle of attack at take-off and landing, and catapult fittings. In August 1952 carrier trials were flown on , followed by carrier qualification trials on [...] in October-December 1952. Results were less than satisfactory. Low-speed handling was considered poor, and the <b>arrester</b> <b>hook</b> and nose gear leg were insufficiently strong.|$|E
