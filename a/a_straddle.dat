5|$|The {{match that}} {{followed}} was between Shawn Michaels and Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho. The {{start of the}} match saw Michaels and Jericho exchange several near-falls attempts before Michaels applied a modified figure four leglock, which Jericho broke free. Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho but Michaels grabbed the bottom rope, causing Jericho to break the hold. Jericho attempted the Walls of Jericho again, but Michaels countered into <b>a</b> <b>straddle</b> pin to take the win. After the match, both men shook hands.|$|E

40|$|Sixteen {{patients}} with <b>a</b> <b>straddling</b> tricuspid and two with <b>a</b> <b>straddling</b> mitral valve {{were identified by}} two dimensional echocardiography. In all but one the atrioventricular valves appeared at the same level, indicating absence of the ventriculoatrial septum. <b>A</b> <b>straddling</b> valve was diagnosed by identifying subvalvular apparatus from one atrioventricular valve in both chambers, independent of whether they were ventricles or rudimentary chambers. Further confirmation was obtained during real time study where the valve leaflets appeared to fly through the ventricular septal defect. Overriding of the valve annulus was greater than 50 % in 12 and less than 50 % in five, with one other patient having none detectable. The relation of the central fibrous body {{to the tip of}} the interventricular septum was reliable in assessing overriding of greater than 50 %, but where it was less than 50 % other views were necessary to detect its presence. The diagnosis of straddling with or without overriding of an atrioventricular valve can be reliably made by two dimensional echocardiography, and carries important implications relating to the type of surgical intervention possible, and in those with <b>a</b> <b>straddling</b> tricuspid valve, the position of the atrioventricular node...|$|R

25|$|Pacific Petroleums (acquired by Petro-Canada) {{had already}} built <b>a</b> <b>straddle</b> plant at Empress to extract liquids, so Dome’s idea was not new. However, Dome built {{a much larger}} {{facility}} there. The facility was constructed {{on a patch of}} bald prairie in the early 1970s. The owners were Dome and a TransCanada subsidiary, which later sold its interest to PanCanadian Petroleums.|$|E
25|$|Another Amoco/Dome {{joint venture}} soon followed. At {{the end of}} the ‘60s, Alberta and Southern Gas Company began {{building}} a larger plant at Cochrane, a small town just west of Calgary. In industry parlance, this was <b>a</b> <b>straddle</b> plant. Another step {{in the development of the}} Amoco/Dome liquids system was Dome’s construction — in 1976 — of the Edmonton Ethane Extraction Plant. This straddle plant replaced an earlier facility.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesHearts with an absent {{atrioventricular}} {{connection and}} <b>a</b> <b>straddling</b> of the solitary atrioventricular valve are rare but significant lesions. They are suitable only for Fontan-like palliation, in which atrioventricular valvar abnormalities {{play a significant}} role in determining the outcome. We studied the segmental arrangements in such lesions and clarified the valvar morphology, particularly its surgical implications. MethodsWe made a macroscopic review of all specimens with an absent atrioventricular connection and <b>a</b> <b>straddling</b> atrioventricular valve that were held in the collections of 3 institutes. We included only those specimens with the straddling valve supported exclusively by either the right-sided or left-sided atrioventricular junction and excluded those with a common atrioventricular junction. ResultsWe found 11 hearts with an absent right atrioventricular connection and <b>a</b> <b>straddling</b> left atrioventricular valve, and 3 with an absent left atrioventricular connection and <b>a</b> <b>straddling</b> right atrioventricular valve. Most had right-hand ventricular topology and discordant ventriculoarterial connections. We found multiple valvar abnormalities, including dysplastic leaflets, short cords, abnormal attachments, and abnormal papillary muscles. The most consistent features were a line of maximal coaptation between the bridging leaflets always perpendicular to the plane of the ventricular septum and a free-floating bridging anterosuperior leaflet. ConclusionsStraddling of a solitary atrioventricular valve with an absent atrioventricular connection produces a uniatrial but biventricular connection. In this setting, the valve guarding the abnormal solitary atrioventricular junction cannot be classified morphologically as mitral or tricuspid. The markedly variable valvar morphology likely makes these valves prone to insufficiency in the long term...|$|R
25|$|This type of brake pre-dates the direct-pull brake. It is a centre-pull {{cantilever}} {{design with}} an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side, a cable {{stop on the}} frame or fork to terminate the cable housing, and <b>a</b> <b>straddle</b> cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes. The cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable, causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> Mississippi <b>straddle</b> {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> live <b>straddle,</b> but instead of being made by the player [...] "under the gun", {{it can be made}} by any player, {{depending}} on house rules (one common variation is to allow this left of big blind or on the button). House rules permitting Mississippi straddles are common in the southern United States. Like <b>a</b> live <b>straddle,</b> <b>a</b> Mississippi <b>straddle</b> must be at least the minimum raise. Action begins with the player {{to the left of the}} <b>straddle</b> (in <b>a</b> common variation, action starts left of the big blind, skips over the straddle who is last). If, for example (in a game with $10-25 blinds), the button puts a live $50 on it, the first player to act would be the small blind, followed by the big blind, and so on. If action gets back to the straddle with no raise, the straddle has the option of raising. The player to the left of <b>a</b> Mississippi <b>straddle</b> may re-straddle by placing a blind bet raising the original straddle.|$|R

2500|$|This type of brake has {{symmetrical}} {{arms and}} therefore centre more effectively.

2500|$|Danny Tidwell {{was born}} in Norfolk, Virginia and raised in nearby Virginia Beach. His early {{childhood}} was turbulent, and he sometimes got into trouble. [...] Tidwell started dancing {{at the age of}} eight in an after-school program for at-risk youth. Local dance instructor Vicky Cooke took notice of the [...] "little bit of a kid in <b>a</b> <b>straddle,</b> trying to reach his fingers to his toes", and after the program closed, Cooke mentioned the boy to Denise Wall. The two women decided to accept him to their studio, Denise Wall’s Dance Energy, for free. Over the next couple of years, Wall took a personal interest in Tidwell, {{and by the time he}} was ten, he was calling Wall [...] "Mom" [...] and her other sons (Scotty, Travis, Tyler and Shannon) his brothers. She found out that the boy would often walk part or all of the ten miles (16km) home after dance class, had little adult supervision outside of the studio, and, at one point, had not been registered in school for months. [...] He lived with his biological mother and two sisters until he was ten, before moving in with Wall; she officially took custody of Tidwell at the age of twelve.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a critique of}} alternative organizational structures in the hedge fund industry.
