40|$|This study {{followed}} {{one male}} secondary school cohort over three years, prior and during a positive education implementation at their school. The {{purpose of this}} research was two-fold. Firstly, it investigated the predictive power of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> on the Wellbeing of this cohort. Secondly it examined whether the whole school approach towards positive education had any effect or impact on the predictors and outcome. This research was conducted as Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> have been proposed as protective factors for adolescent wellbeing in theoretical literature, however, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence that demonstrates this. Literature that demonstrates Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> are concepts which can successfully be taught as part of a positive education program to enhance student wellbeing is also limited. To conduct the research, a longitudinal mixed method research design was chosen. It followed a sequential exploratory mixed method approach, quantitatively measuring Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life,</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Wellbeing via questionnaires at four time points over two years. The quantitative findings were then used to inform the design of three semistructured focus group interviews with fifteen randomly selected participants. This study found Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> to be strong predictors of secondary boys’ Wellbeing, and, each predictor can be taught as part of a whole school approach towards positive education to enhance wellbeing. However, the effectiveness of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> education is dependent on the successful implementation of the whole school approach. In the case of this study, Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> education could be improved by further collaboration with parents/carers/guardians, and, further teacher training on applying student-centred learning to the positive education based classes. These findings are significant as they empirically demonstrate Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> are protective factors for male adolescent Wellbeing, and, these predictors are teachable concepts that can be taught as part of a whole school approach to positive education to enhance male adolescent wellbeing...|$|R

5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre <b>and</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E
5|$|Dunster is {{mentioned}} as a manor and Dunster Castle as belonging to William I de Moyon (alias de Moion, also de Mohun) in the 1086 Domesday Book. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, he constructed a timber castle on the site {{as part of the}} pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege {{during the early years of}} the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century. During the English Civil War, Dunster was initially held as a garrison for the Royalists. It fell to the Parliamentarians in 1645 and orders were sent out for the castle to be demolished. However, these were not carried out, and the castle remained the garrison for Parliamentarian troops until 1650. Dunster is regularly home to Taunton Garrison who re-enact plays, battles, <b>and</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the civil war. Major alterations to the castle were undertaken by Henry Fownes Luttrell who had acquired it through marriage to Margaret Fownes-Luttrell in 1747. Following the death of Alexander Luttrell in 1944, the family was unable to afford the death duties on his estate. The castle and surrounding lands were sold off to a property firm, the family continuing to live in the castle as tenants. The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954, but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust, which operates it as a tourist attraction. It is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E

5|$|Space <b>and</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the {{new capital}} were {{strictly}} regimented: residential areas were {{separated from the}} markets, and the military was given its own cantonments, separated from the ordinary populace and each {{the home of a}} specific ethnic contingent of the army (e.g. the Turks, Faraghina, Maghariba and Shakiriyya regiments). The city was dominated by its mosques (most famous among which is the Great Mosque of Samarra built by Caliph al-Mutawakkil in 848–852) and palaces, built in grand style by both the caliphs and their senior commanders, who were given extensive properties to develop. Unlike Baghdad, however, the new capital was an entirely artificial creation. Poorly sited in terms of water supply and river communications, its existence was determined solely by the presence of the caliphal court, and when the capital returned to Baghdad, sixty years later, Samarra was rapidly abandoned. Due to this fact, the ruins of the Abbasid capital are still present on site, and the city can be mapped with great accuracy by modern archaeologists.|$|E
