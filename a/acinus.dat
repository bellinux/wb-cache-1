25|$|Secretory {{cells are}} found in a group, or <b>acinus</b> (plural, acini). Each <b>acinus</b> {{is located at the}} {{terminal}} part of the gland connected to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each <b>acinus</b> consists of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a central opening where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the secretory cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the secretory product being produced: serous, mucoserous and mucous.|$|E
25|$|Darker-staining cells form {{clusters}} called acini, {{which are}} arranged in lobes separated by a thin fibrous barrier. The secretory cells of each <b>acinus</b> surround a small intercalated duct. Because of their secretory function, these cells have many small granules of zymogens that are visible. The intercalated ducts drain into larger ducts within the lobule, and finally interlobular ducts. The ducts are lined by a single layer of columnar epithelium. With increasing diameter, several layers of columnar cells may be seen.|$|E
25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} {{leads to}} acetylcholine (ACh) release onto the salivary acinar cells. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors, specifically M3, and causes an increased intracellular calcium ion concentration (through the IP3/DAG second messenger system). Increased calcium causes vesicles within the cells to fuse with the apical cell membrane leading to secretion. ACh also causes the salivary gland to release kallikrein, an enzyme that converts kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin. Lysyl-bradykinin acts upon {{blood vessels and}} capillaries of the salivary gland to generate vasodilation and increased capillary permeability respectively. The resulting increased {{blood flow to the}} acini allows production of more saliva. In addition, Substance P can bind to Tachykinin NK-1 receptors leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequently increased saliva secretion. Lastly, both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous stimulation can lead to myoepithelium contraction which causes the expulsion of secretions from the secretory <b>acinus</b> into the ducts and eventually to the oral cavity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pancreas}} plays a {{vital role}} in the digestive system. It secretes fluid that contains enzymes into the duodenum. These enzymes help to break down carbohydrates (usually starch), proteins and lipids (fats). This role is called the [...] "exocrine" [...] role of the pancreas. Cells are arranged clusters called acini. Secretions {{into the middle of the}} <b>acinus</b> accumulate in intralobular ducts, which drain to the main pancreatic duct, which drains directly into the duodenum.|$|E

50|$|Microscopically, PIN is a {{collection}} of irregular, atypical epithelial cells. The architecture of the glands and ducts remains normal. The epithelial cells proliferate and crowding results in a pseudo-multilayer appearance. They remain fully contained within a prostate <b>acinus</b> (the berry-shaped termination of a gland, where the secretion is produced) or duct. The latter can be demonstrated with special staining techniques (immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins) to identify the basal cells forming the supporting layer of the <b>acinus.</b> In prostate cancer, the abnormal cells spread beyond the boundaries of the <b>acinus</b> and form clusters without basal cells. In HGPIN, the basal cell layer is disrupted but present. PIN is primarily found in the peripheral zone of the prostate (75-80%), rarely in the transition zone (10-15%) and very rarely in the central zone (5%), a distribution that parallels the zonal distribution for prostate carcinoma.|$|E
50|$|From a {{metabolic}} perspective, {{the functional}} unit is the hepatic <b>acinus</b> (terminal <b>acinus),</b> {{each of which}} is centered on the line connecting two portal triads and extends outwards to the two adjacent central veins. The periportal zone I is nearest to the entering vascular supply and receives the most oxygenated blood, making it least sensitive to ischemic injury while making it very susceptible to viral hepatitis. Conversely, the centrilobular zone III has the poorest oxygenation, and will be most affected during a time of ischemia.|$|E

50|$|Mucoserous acini (singular <b>acinus)</b> {{or mixed}} acini are mainly present in submandibular and sublingual glands. They are formed by mucous cells with some serous cells {{interspersed}} each other. Both cells pour their secretion {{directly in the}} lumen.|$|E
50|$|Four PIAS domains and two PIAS motifs {{have been}} identified. They include the N-terminal {{scaffold}} attachment factor-A/B, <b>acinus</b> and PIAS (SAP) domain, the Pro-Ile-Asn-Ile-Thr (PINIT) motif, the RING-finger-like zinc-binding domain (RLD), the highly acidic domain (AD), the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM), and the serine/threonine-rich C-terminal region (S/T).|$|E
50|$|Centroacinar {{cells are}} {{spindle-shaped}} {{cells in the}} exocrine pancreas. Centroacinar cells are {{an extension of the}} intercalated duct cells into each pancreatic <b>acinus.</b> The intercalated ducts take the bicarbonate to intralobular ducts which become lobular ducts. These lobular ducts finally converge to form the main pancreatic duct.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes an {{apoptosis}} {{inhibitory protein}} whose expression prevents apoptosis after growth factor deprivation. This protein suppresses the transcription factor E2F1-induced apoptosis and also interacts with, and negatively regulates <b>acinus,</b> a nuclear factor involved in apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Its depletion enhances the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic drugs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{intercalated}} duct, {{also called}} intercalary duct(ducts of Boll), is {{the portion of}} an exocrine gland leading directly from the <b>acinus</b> to a striated duct. The intercalated duct forms part of the intralobular duct. This duct has the thinnest epithelium of {{any part of the}} duct system, and the epithelium is usually classified as [...] "low" [...] simple cuboidal.|$|E
5000|$|Some sources {{consider}} [...] "lobar" [...] ducts to be {{the same}} as [...] "interlobar ducts", while others consider lobar ducts to be larger and more distal from the <b>acinus.</b> For sources that make the distinction, the interlobar ducts are more likely to classified with simple columnar epithelium (or pseudostratified epithelium), reserving the stratified columnar for the lobar ducts.|$|E

50|$|The glands {{themselves}} are quite complex. The mucus factory {{is at the}} bottom, in the submucosa, it is composed of many little sacs (acini) where the mucus originates. Each sac (<b>acinus)</b> has one end that can open and close (dilate) to allow the mucus out. The acini empty into little tubes (tubules) that lead to a reservoir (collecting duct) that has a portal through the skin (mucosa) that can open and close allowing the mucus into the main tube.|$|E

50|$|Organisms of the salivary {{microbiome}} {{reside in}} the three major salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual. These glands secrete electrolytes, proteins, genetic material, polysaccharides, and other molecules. Most of these substances enter the salivary gland <b>acinus</b> and duct system from surrounding capillaries via the intervening tissue fluid, although some substances are produced within the glands themselves. The level of each salivary component varies considerably depending on the health status {{of the individual and}} the presence of pathogenic and commensal organisms.|$|E
50|$|The N-terminal {{scaffold}} attachment factor-A/B, <b>acinus</b> and PIAS (SAP) domain {{is found}} in all PIAS proteins. It is composed of four alpha helices. It binds to areas of chromatin that are rich in adenine (A) and thymine (T). These A/T rich regions are known as matrix-attachment regions. Once bound, the matrix-attachment regions anchor loops of chromatin to the nuclear matrix. The nuclear matrix is a structure within the nucleus where {{it is thought that}} transcription regulation takes place. SAP also binds to p53.|$|E
50|$|The serous demilune is an {{artifact}} from {{traditional methods of}} preparing samples. Samples are traditionally preserved and fixed in formaldehyde. When samples were preserved by quick-freezing in liquid nitrogen and then fixed with osmium tetraoxide in acetone, no demilunes were found. Examination showed that the serous cells and mucosal cells were aligned in the <b>acinus.</b> The traditional preparation caused mucous cells to swell during fixation which results in the serous cells being popped out of their alignment. After sectioning the serous cells resembled the common demilune shape, and were so named.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{have three}} major salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual. These glands, along with {{additional}} minor salivary glands, secrete a rich mixture of biological chemicals, electrolytes, proteins, genetic material, polysaccharides, and other molecules. Most of these substances enter the salivary gland <b>acinus</b> and duct {{system from the}} surrounding capillaries via the intervening tissue fluid, although some substances are produced within the glands themselves. The level of each salivary component varies considerably depending on the health status {{of the individual and}} the presence of disease (oral or systemic). By measuring these components in the saliva, it is possible to screen for a variety of infections, allergies, hormonal disturbances, and neoplasms.|$|E
5000|$|Cytochrome P450 1A2 is evenly {{distributed}} {{over all the}} cells of a liver <b>acinus,</b> and {{is in contrast to}} other members of the cytochrome P450 family exclusively expressed in the liver. Cytochrome P450 A2 is usually not inducible by clinically frequently used drugs making it ideal even in complex clinical situations (exceptions are oral contraceptives resulting in a strong induction of P450 A2). Nutrition and lifestyle can strongly influence P450 A2 induction e.g. smoking or coffee consumption. The test substance 13C methacetin itself is considered as is non-toxic and very well tolerated in the used dosage. Similarly, 13C is a stable, naturally occurring and non-radioactive carbon isotope. For this reason, patients need to fast for at least three hours before measurement to remove potential interferences with carbon from the food.|$|E

50|$|The SAF-A/B, <b>Acinus</b> and PIAS (SAP) domain {{is located}} at the N-terminal of PIAS proteins. This {{evolutionarily}} conserved domain is found in proteins ranging from yeast to human and is shared by other chromatin-binding proteins, such as scaffold attachment factor A and B. The SAP domain can recognize and bind to AT-rich DNA sequences present in scaffold-attachment regions/matrix-attachment regions. These elements are frequently found near gene enhancers and interact with nuclear matrix proteins to provide a unique nuclear microenvironment for transcriptional regulation. An LXXLL signature motif is present within the SAP domain of all PIAS proteins. This signature motif has been shown to mediate interactions between nuclear receptors and their co-regulators. It is also essential for the binding of PIAS3 to androgen receptor. The LXXLL motif represents the minimal requirement for the interaction with the NFκB p65 subunit and for the inhibition of NFκB transcriptional activity. It was previously described that the LXXLL motif is also responsible for the retention of PIAS3 in the nucleus.|$|E
40|$|Akt {{promotes}} cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting {{components of}} the intrinsic cell death machinery. Akt translocates into the nucleus upon exposure of cells to survival factors, but {{little is known about}} its functions in the nucleus. Here, we show that <b>acinus,</b> a nuclear factor required for apoptotic chromatin condensation, is a direct target of Akt. We demonstrate that Akt phosphorylation of <b>acinus</b> on serine 422 and 573 results in its resistance to caspase cleavage in the nucleus and the inhibition of acinus-dependent chromatin condensation. Abolishing <b>acinus</b> phosphorylation by Akt through mutagenesis accelerates its proteolytic degradation and chromatin condensation. <b>Acinus</b> S 422, 573 D, a mutant mimicking phosphorylation, resists against apoptotic cleavage and prevents chromatin condensation. Knocking down of <b>acinus</b> substantially decreases chromatin condensation, and depletion of Akt provokes the apoptotic cleavage of <b>acinus.</b> Thus, Akt inhibits chromatin condensation during apoptosis by phosphorylating <b>acinus</b> in the nucleus, revealing a specific mechanism by which nuclear Akt promotes cell survival...|$|E
40|$|Fusion with lysosomes is {{the common}} last step of endocytic {{trafficking}} and autophagy. Accordingly, several proteins are required in both pathways for cargoes to reach their destinations. Among these proteins, Drosophila <b>Acinus</b> stands out, as it exerts opposite effects on these two pathways, and thus establishes a new paradigm. Loss of <b>Acinus</b> function destabilizes early endosomes, thereby promoting the delivery of their cargo to lysosomes. By contrast, the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes is inhibited in acn mutant cells. The increase in autophagy upon <b>Acinus</b> overexpression and its location to the nucleus are consistent with <b>Acinus</b> being a novel regulator of autophagy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acinus</b> (apoptotic {{chromatin}} condensation inducer in the nucleus) is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) originally {{identified for}} {{its role in}} apoptosis. It was later found to be an auxiliary component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which is deposited at exon junctions {{as a consequence of}} pre-mRNA splicing. To uncover the cellular functions of <b>Acinus</b> and investigate its role in splicing, we mapped its endogenous RNA targets using the cross-linking immunoprecipitation protocol (iCLIP). We observed that <b>Acinus</b> binds to pre-mRNAs, associating specifically to a subset of suboptimal introns, but also to spliced mRNAs. We also confirmed the presence of <b>Acinus</b> as a peripheral factor of the EJC. RNA-seq was used to investigate changes in gene expression and alternative splicing following siRNA-mediated depletion of <b>Acinus</b> in HeLa cells. This analysis revealed that <b>Acinus</b> is preferentially required for the inclusion of specific alternative cassette exons and also controls the faithful splicing of a subset of introns. Moreover, a large number of splicing changes can be related to <b>Acinus</b> binding, suggesting a direct role of <b>Acinus</b> in exon and intron definition. In particular, <b>Acinus</b> regulates the splicing of DFFA/ICAD transcript, a major regulator of DNA fragmentation. Globally, the genome-wide identification of RNA targets of <b>Acinus</b> revealed its role in splicing regulation as well as its involvement in other cellular pathways, including cell cycle progression. Altogether, this study uncovers new cellular functions of an RBP transiently associated with the EJC. J. F.
