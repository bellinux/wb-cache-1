40|$|The {{effects of}} perirhinal cortex lesions in rats on spatial memory might {{depend on the}} choice of strain. The present study, therefore, {{compared}} perirhinal lesions in Sprague-Dawley rats (associated with deficits) with Dark Agouti rats (associated with null effects). Tests of reference memory and working memory in the water maze failed to provide evidence that perirhinal lesions disrupt overall levels of performance (irrespective of strain) or that these lesions have differential effects on the rates of spatial learning in these 2 strains. Strain differences were, however, found, as the Dark <b>Agouti</b> <b>strain</b> was often superior. Furthermore, the perirhinal lesions did have differential effects in the 2 strains, but these {{did not appear to}} relate directly to changes in spatial learning...|$|E
40|$|A soluble {{histocompatibility}} antigen was extracted from normal rat lymphoid cells {{by exposure to}} an hypertonic KCl solution. The antigen was assayed by inhibition of monospecific cytotoxic (CT) alloantiserum and shown to have the specificity AgB 4 or Rt H 1. 1, the major locus private antigen of the dark <b>agouti</b> <b>strain.</b> Yields were ~ 2000 CT inhibitory units (ID 50) per 109 cells. Gel filtration of the extract over Sephadex G- 200 resulted in an approximate four-fold purification with a final concentration of 530 ID 50 units per mg protein. The major portion of the antigen appeared {{at the front of}} the inner bed volume but a minor included peak at about 65, 000 mol wt. was also seen. Yields and specificity were greatly increased by (a) not washing the cell suspension before extraction (b) removing excess salt from the extract by dialysis rather than gel filtration (c) removing insoluble nucleic acids from the dialysed extract by ultracentrifugation...|$|E
40|$|Rats of the Dark <b>Agouti</b> <b>strain</b> {{were trained}} on delayed {{alternation}} under conditions that should encourage egocentric working memory. In two experiments a T-maze was set within a cross-maze so that different arms {{could be used}} for the sample and test runs. The maze had high opaque side-walls, and testing was conducted in low light levels so that distal visual cues might be eliminated. By rotating the maze 90 ° between the sample and choice run and by using two identical mazes set side by side it was possible to nullify other spatial strategies. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that rats preferentially used place information, intramaze cues, and direction cues, even though only egocentric or idiothetic (nonmatch-to-turn) working memory could successfully solve every trial. Rats were able to maintain an accurate sense of location within the maze even though distal cues were not visible and the animal was moved between the sample and choice runs. Experiment 2 confirmed that another rat strain (Long-Evans) shows the same learning profiles. Both experiments indicate that rats are very poor at using either egocentric or idiothetic information to alternate, and that retention delays as short as 10 s can eliminate the use of these forms of memory...|$|E

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{assume that}} laboratory rats have poor vision, and accordingly, {{that they need}} not consider differences in the visual function of rats {{as a consequence of}} strain or experience. Currently, it is not specifically known whether rat domestication has negatively affected the visual function of laboratory rat strains, what the effects of strain albinism are on rat visual function, or whether there are strain differences in the visual function of laboratory rats that are independent of pigmentation. In order to address these questions, we measured psychophysically the vertical grating acuity of three pigmented (Dark Agouti, Fisher/ Norway, Long-Evans) and three albino (Fisher- 344, Sprague/Dawley, Wistar) strains of laboratory rats, and compared their acuity with that of wild rats. The grating thresholds of Dark Agouti, Long-Evans and wild strains clustered around 1. 0 cycle/degree (c/d) and did not significantly differ from one another. Fisher/Norway rats, however, had a significantly higher threshold of 1. 5 c/d. The grating thresholds of Fisher- 344, Sprague/Dawley, and Wistar strains, which were clustered around 0. 5 c/d, were significantly lower than those of the pigmented strains. These data demonstrate that there is significant strain variability in the visual function of laboratory rats. Domestication of Long-Evans and Dark <b>Agouti</b> <b>strains</b> {{does not appear to have}} compromised visual acuity, but in the case of Fisher/Norway rats, selective breeding may have enhanced their acuity. Strain selection associated with albinism, however, appears to have consistently impaired visual acuity. Therefore, a consideration of strain differences in visual function should accompany the selection of a rat model for behavioral tasks that involve vision, or when comparing visuo-behaviora...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} that vitamin K 1 (2 -methyl-S-phytyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone) and related naphthoquinones correct plasma prothrombin deficiency {{in the absence}} of extensive liver damage found prompt and consistently promising clinical applications. The scarcity of published reports on the toxicity of the compounds (1 - 3) prompted the presentation of the following observations on the toxic effects in mice. ACUTE TOXICITY Mice of the Swiss (albino) and C 311 (<b>agouti)</b> <b>strains</b> and hybrid white mice, 3 to 4 months old and weighing 25 to 30 grams, were used. The animals were maintained on a diet of Purina dog chow and an unlimited supply of water. The naphthoquinones’, as listed in table 1, were dissolved in sesame oil for subcutaneous and oral administrations. The amount of the solvent was 0. 3 cc. or less. The toxic dose of 2 -methyl-i, 4 -napthoquinone was the same, however, in a series in which the compound was dissolved in 0. 1 to 1. 0 cc. of sesame oil. For intravenous injection, the compounds were dissolved in water, 0. 5 mgm. per cc., and the mice received 0. 25 or 0. 5 cc. in the lateral tail vein. At this concentration, the compounds remained in solution at 40 #{ 176 }C. The manifestations of the toxicity of all the compounds were practically identical. The mice were prostrated within 3 to 5 minutes and died within a half hour after the injection of large doses of 1, 4 -naphthoquinone and 2 -methyl-i, 4 -naphthohydroquinone. At lower doses, the onset was later and the symptoms lasted for as long as 72 hours. Transitory mild collapse and respiratory embarrassment were noted with 1. 6 grams per kilogram of the di-isovalerate subcutaneously and with 0. 25 mgm. of 2 -methyl-i, 4 -naphtho-quinone and the hydroquinone intravenously.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{molecular}} mechanisms of Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), a severe infection of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) caused by Herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV- 1); a rat model resembling the human condition was characterized in the DA (Dark <b>Agouti)</b> <b>strain.</b> After injection into the whiskers’ area HSV- 1 entered the CNS {{at the level of the}} brain stem via the trigeminal ganglion, subsequently spreading to the thalamus, cortex and olfactory bulb, leading to death at five days post infection (dpi). In contrast, the Piebald Virol Glaxo (PVG) strain was found to be completely resistant to disease and without signs of immunological reactions within the CNS, since HSV- 1 virus did not penetrate beyond the site of inoculation. The kinetics of HSV- 1 infection in the two strains was thoroughly characterized by magnetic resonance imaging, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, virus isolation in green monkey kidney cells, histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Kinetics of virus propagation and primary immune reactions following HSV- 1 infection were compared between the susceptible DA and the resistant PVG strain at 12 hours post-infection (hpi), 1, 2, 3 and 4 dpi. A low expression of Toll-like receptors 2 and 9 and slower recruitment of macrophages was associated with viral replication in the perineurial cell layer and consecutive propagation to the CNS in the DA rats, while virus spread was confined to the epineurium of the peripheral nerve in the resistant PVG strain. The underlying genetic mechanisms for the difference in susceptibility between the two strains were dissected in a F 2 (DAxPVG) intercross, with genome-wide microsatellite-based genotyping. Linkage analysis revealed a very strong quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 4 regulating susceptibility to HSE. Fine mapping of the QTL by infection of additional rats with recombinations in the region, haplotype mapping of disease susceptibility in a panel of inbred rat strains, infection of congenic strains, sequencing and mRNA expression studies of the genes in the interval indicated the calcitonin receptor (Calcr) as the candidate gene. Functional experiments with treatment using calcitonin receptor agonists in vivo provided further support of the candidate gene status of Calcr. Additional genetic determinants of susceptibility to HSE were studied in two other rat strains: Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) and Brown Norway (BN), which are susceptible and resistant, respectively, to HSE, as well as in 29 BNxSHR recombinant inbred lines (RIL). The use of an already existing database of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) differing between SHR and BN revealed another significant QTL on chromosome 4 regulating susceptibility to HSE. Further analysis of the QTL using immunohistopathology indicated the Von Willebrand Factor homologue (Vwf) gene, which has a role in blood-brain-barrier homeostasis, as a possible candidate for regulating differences in susceptibility between the BN and SHR strains. In summary, the present study has demonstrated a strong genetic influence on the susceptibility to HSE in a rat model that displays many similarities to the corresponding human condition. Further genetic and functional studies are needed to confirm the candidate gene status of Calcr and Vwf regulating HSE and these may ultimately lead to more effective treatments of this severe CNS infection...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{autoimmune}} encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-recognized {{model for}} multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans. However, adjuvants used with encephalitogens to induce EAE produce non-specific effects {{interfering with the}} mechanisms involved in the autoimmune response to {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) tissue. It is therefore important to establish a more suitable model of EAE for analysis of autoimmune phenomena resembling those operative in MS. Here we report that EAE can be induced regularly in Dark <b>Agouti</b> (DA) <b>strain</b> of rats with spinal cord tissue without any adjuvant, as judged by both clinical and histological parameters. The incidence and severity of EAE depended on the origin of the encephalitogen, the rat versus guinea pig spinal cord homogenate being more efficient. Furthermore, EAE could be reinduced in animals which had recovered from disease that had been induced actively with encephalitogen alone, suggesting the role of adjuvant-generated non-specific mechanisms in resistance to reinduction of EAE. Thus, EAE induced in DA rats with encephalitogen alone provides a reproducible model for defining pathogenically relevant events in CNS autoimmunity devoid of the potentially misleading effects of adjuvants...|$|R
40|$|Behavioral, electrophysiological, and {{anatomical}} {{evidence suggests}} that retrosplenial (RS) cortex (areas RSA and RSG) {{plays a role in}} spatial navigation. This conclusion has been questioned in recent work, suggesting that it is damage to the underlying cingulum bundle (CG) (areas CG and IG), and not RS, that disrupts spatial place learning (Aggleton et al., 2000). We revisited this issue by comparing Long–Evans rats, the strain used in studies that report RS deficits, to Dark <b>Agouti</b> rats, the <b>strain</b> in which no RS deficit has been reported. Rat groups with RS, RS � CG, or no lesion were tested on a place task in a swimming pool, a test of nonspatial and spatial learning, and a matching-to-place task, a relatively selective test of spatial learning. Long–Evans rats given RS and RS � CG lesions, either before or after training on the two tasks, were impaired on both tasks, a deficit not attributable to impaire...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is a chronic, {{autoimmune disease}} of the central nervous system, which mainly affects young women during a reproductive period of life. Since, its symptoms might be significantly affected by pregnancy, {{in this study we}} investigated the development and kinetics of disease in the model of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CR-EAE), induced in genetically susceptible Dark <b>Agouti</b> (DA) <b>strain</b> of rats. They were sensitized with bovine brain white matter homogenate (BBH) in complete Freund’s adjuvant during the first, second or third week of pregnancy, and the disease scores were compared between treatment groups, and identically treated nongravid females. Additionally, the susceptibility to the induction of EAE was tested in offspring of mothers that during the pregnancy were sensitized with BBH. The data have shown that pregnancy does not block the induction of EAE, but that it significantly changes the course of diseases, depending on time of immunization. In rats sensitized {{during the first week of}} gestation the onset of the clinical signs was delayed, but after the delivery the intensity of disease significantly increased. Similar aggravation, with appearance of monophasic form of disease was observed in the group of rats sensitized during the third week of gestation. On the contrary, in rats sensitized during the second week of gestation the beneficial effects were observed, with later onset of attacks, and lower disease score. Furthermore, offspring of these rats after immunization with BBH developed a monophasic form of EAE of lower intensity, suggesting that some protective factors might be transferred across the placenta...|$|R
40|$|Adjuvant-induced {{arthritis}} can {{be transferred}} to naive Dark <b>Agouti</b> (DA) <b>strain</b> (DA. CD 45. 1) rats by thoracic duct (TD) lymphocytes. Disease can be re-induced in convalescent rats by further transfer of arthritogenic cells, suggesting that resolution of the adoptive disease is not due to active regulation. To examine whether resolution is due to exhaustion of effector cells, we transferred the disease to DA. CD 45. 1 recipients, using CD 4 + T cells from DA. CD 45. 2 donors. At {{the height of the}} adoptively transferred disease, donor cells comprised only 5 – 10 % of recirculating CD 4 + T cells but they accounted for ~ 40 % of the CD 4 + T cells in synovium-rich tissues of the hind paws. Approximately 65 % of the donor cells in the synovium expressed a marker of proliferation (Ki- 67 antigen). Division of CD 4 + T cells continued in shielded paws after suppression of the recirculating pool of lymphocytes by selective irradiation. Intravenously injected CD 4 + TD T lymphoblasts from arthritic donors were recruited to normal paws and, in greater numbers, to paws of animals with existing arthritis. Survival of the [125 I]iodo-deoxyuridine-labeled lymphoblasts was greater in animals with existing arthritis. We conclude that effector CD 4 + T cells in target tissues can proliferate in response to autoantigens and exhibit enhanced survival. However, without a continuous supply, adoptively transferred effector cells do not produce autonomous local disease, due to limits to their lifespan and ability to replicate indefinitely.

40|$|Because {{particular}} inbred {{strains of}} experimental animals are informative {{for only a}} subset of the genes underlying variability in BMD, we undertook a genome screen to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in 828 F 2 progeny (405 males and 423 females) derived from the Copenhagen 2331 (COP) and dark <b>agouti</b> (DA) <b>strains</b> of rats. This screen was performed to complement our study in female Fischer 344 (F 344) and Lewis (LEW) rats and to further delineate the factors underlying the complex genetic architecture of BMD in the rat model. Microsatellite genotyping was performed using markers at an average density of 20 cM. BMD was measured by pQCT and DXA. These data were analyzed in the R/qtl software to detect QTLs acting in both sexes as well as those having sex-specific effects. A QTL was detected in both sexes on chromosome 18 for midfemur volumetric BMD (vBMD; genome-wide, p < 0. 01). On distal chromosome 1, a QTL was found for femur and vertebral aBMD as well as distal femur vBMD, and this QTL appears distinct from the proximal chromosome 1 QTL impacting BMD in our F 344 /LEW cross. Additional aBMD and vBMD QTLs and several sex-specific QTLs were also detected. These included a male-specific QTL (p < 0. 01) on chromosome 8 and a female-specific QTL on chromosomes 7 and 14 (p < 0. 01). Few of the QTLs identified showed overlap with the significant QTLs from the F 344 /LEW cross. These results confirm that the genetic influence on BMD in the rat model is quite complex and would seem to be influenced by a number of different genes, some of which have sex-specific effects...|$|R
40|$|Cloning of the {{inversion}} breakpoints in the <b>agouti</b> mutant <b>strain</b> a has implicated the E 3 ligase Itch in {{the spontaneous}} inflammation {{that occurs in}} these mice. 1 RH Anaylsis of a mice suggests that the inflammatory disease {{is due to a}} dysregulated T helper type- 2 immune response. In order to verify the importance of Itch inactivation in the spontaneous inflammation of a mice and to determine which cell type is responsible for the pathology, the Itch gene has been targeted for conditional deletion in mice using the Cre-loxP system. The results presented in this thesis provide the first direct evidence that Itch deficient CD 4 + T cells are sufficient to cause spontaneous inflammation. The function of CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells was found to be intact in vitro. Instead, sensitivity to the immunomodulatory cytokine TGF-(3 was reduced in Itch deficient CD 4 + T cells. Inadequacies in peripheral tolerance mechanisms were observed based on oral tolerance studies. Itch deficiency was found to directly contribute to the CD 4 + bias towards T helper type- 2 (Th 2) differentiation observed in a mice. Itch modulation of Th 2 differentiation occurs in a Stat 6 dependent pathway. Itch fl/fl CD 4 Cre Stat 6 -/- CD 4 + T cells were found to be incapable of differentiating into Th 2 cells in vitro. Itch fl/fl CD 4 Cre Stat 6 -/- did not develop spontaneous inflammation disease, underscoring the 1 ST-T importance of T h 2 differentiation in the pathology of a mice. Itch fl/fl CD 4 Cre mice were found to accumulate memory phenotype CD 8 + cells in their secondary lymphoid organs. The inflammatory pathology of Itch fl/fl CD 4 Cre 1 mice was not required for accumulation of Itch deficient memory-like C D 8 + cells. The cause for this accumulation remains unclear, although an increase in homeostatic proliferation of the memory-like cells is considered unlikely. The findings of this thesis provide definitive support for several speculations regarding the function of Itch. In addition, they provide novel venues of study for the role of Itch in the immune system. Collectively, they argue that further study of this E 3 ligase will be a fruitful endeavor for immunologi...|$|R
40|$|Renal {{transplant}} patients must {{cope with}} the knowledge that donor organ rejection can occur at any time, and with the side effects of immunosuppressive agents which are necessary for graft survival. Treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) could address these issues due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. However, cell therapy with MSC can pose potential risks such as malignancy or the induction of an immune response leading to accelerated graft rejection. These risk factors could be circumvented by the use of extra-cellular vesicles (EV) from MSC. EVs are small, membrane-bound bodies released by cells into the environment where they can act as signal mediators and transporters, acting on pro-teins and RNA, for example. The EVs carry properties of their cell of origin and could transmit some MSC-type effects. Therefore, use of MSC-EV could provide the benefits of MSC while avoiding the risks identified with whole cell application. In the present work, the MSC-EVs were tested in a rat renal transplant model in vitro. MSC and MSC-EV were isolated from Lewis and Dark <b>Agouti</b> rat <b>strains</b> and applied in order to investigate the regenerative capabilities of the MSC-EV on the kidney epithelial cell line NRK 52 e under different conditions. Damage inducers including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), serum-free medium, vincristine, or cobalt chloride (CoCl 2) were applied with or without addition of MSC-EV, and the proportion of damaged cells was determined by flow cytometry. In ad-dition, the immunomodulatory properties of the MSC-EV in terms of T-lymphocyte proliferation and IFNγ secretion were analyzed using flow cytometry and ELISA. It was determined that NRK cell damage mediated by serum-free medium could be significantly reduced through the use of MSC-EV, whereas the EV had no impact on the level of damage that occurred with the other inducers. In addition, it was demonstrated that MSC-EV, unlike MSC themselves, have no influence on the mitogen-induced proliferation of T cells, therefore the physical presence of the MSC is necessary for their immunomodulatory capacity. However, IFNγ production by leukocytes could be significantly reduced by the addition of EV. In summary, these results suggest that MSC-EV certainly have the potential for providing protective treatment during kidney damage and can also partially affect the immune response, making them a good candidate for study in relevant preclinical animal models. The results suggest that MSC-EV treatment might complement an immunosuppressive agent used to inhibit T cell proliferation to improve the overall outcome...|$|R

Posterior pituitaries were dissected free from anterior pituitary tissue and, in groups of 8 — 10, incubated at 37 °C in 1 ml bicarbonate-buffered Krebs—Ringer solution gassed with 02 :C 02 (95 : 5, v/v) and containing 1 mg bovine serum albumin and 20 ßCi (2 nmol) L-[4 - 3 H] phenylalanine.

40|$|The {{roles of}} muscarinic and nicotinic {{cholinergic}} receptors in perirhinal cortex in object recognition memory were compared. Rats' discrimination {{of a novel}} object preference test (NOP) test was measured after either systemic or local infusion into the perirhinal cortex of the nicotinic receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA), which targets alpha- 7 (α 7) amongst other nicotinic receptors or the muscarinic receptor antagonists scopolamine, AFDX- 384, and pirenzepine. Methyllycaconitine administered systemically or intraperirhinally before acquisition impaired recognition memory tested after a 24 -h, but not a 20 -min delay. In contrast, all three muscarinic antagonists produced a similar, unusual pattern of impairment with amnesia after a 20 -min delay, but remembrance after a 24 -h delay. Thus, the amnesic effects of nicotinic and muscarinic antagonism were doubly dissociated across the 20 -min and 24 -h delays. The same pattern of shorter-term but not longer-term memory impairment was found for scopolamine whether the object preference test {{was carried out in}} a square arena or a Y-maze and whether rats of the Dark <b>Agouti</b> or Lister-hooded <b>strains</b> were used. Coinfusion of MLA and either scopolamine or AFDX- 384 produced an impairment profile matching that for MLA. Hence, the antagonists did not act additively when coadministered. These findings establish an important role in recognition memory for both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in perirhinal cortex, and provide a challenge to simple ideas about the role of cholinergic processes in recognition memory: The effects of muscarinic and nicotinic antagonism are neither independent nor additive...|$|R
40|$|The {{amphetamine}} derivative 3, 4,-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; "Ecstasy") is {{a recreational}} drug of abuse, particularly popular {{among young people}} with whom it has formed a well-established sub-culture. MDMA is popular for its euphoria-inducing and mild stimulant properties and its popularity continues to rise despite a number of well-publicised cases of MDMA-associated fatalities and evidence of MDMA-induced acute toxicity. MDMA is known to produce an acute efflux of serotonin (5 -HT) release in the brains of experimental animals, in which a marked behavioural response is also demonstrated. In the long-term MDMA causes specific neurotoxic damage to serotonergic nerve terminals, a phenomenon which is not demonstrated in other neurotransmitters. MDMA use {{has been associated with}} long-term adverse effects on both psychological and physiological health and this may represent a major public health problem given the 2 million people who use the drug in the UK alone. However, there is a perceived imbalance between the relative number of those who use MDMA and the serious adverse effects of the drug and it is possible that these may occur in a more susceptible sub-population of users. This thesis involves in vivo work using the Dark <b>Agouti</b> (DA) rat <b>strain</b> which is known to be more susceptible to MDMA and which may therefore provide an insight in this more susceptible sub-population of human MDMA users. The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that a single exposure to MDMA (15 mg. kg- 1) has a significal effect upon local cerebral glucose utilisation (LCMRglu) and local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) in DA rats both acutely and in the longer-term. This work demonstrates that this single dose of MDMA is neurotoxic to serotonergic neurons, inducing up to 80 % depletion of serotonergic nerve terminals 6 weeks later. Furthermore, data generated from pharmacological challenges upon animals treated with MDMA 6 weeks earlier demonstrates the existence of compensatory mechanisms which act to normalise LCMRglu and LCBF, despite the persistence of serotonergic depletion. Thus this thesis extends the currently available information regarding acute and long-term effects of MDMA in a vulnerable sub-population of users and also proposes potential theories for the mechanisms of action by which pharmacological compensation for these long-term effects of MDMA-induced neurotoxicity may occur. In addition this thesis examines the effects of previous exposure to MDMA upon physiological challenges that might realistically be encountered by human users of the drug. The nature of MDMA-induced neurotoxicity suggests that human users of MDMA may suffer from untreatable chronic psychosis, and this thesis lends support to the view that currently available first line anti-depressant therapies may not be useful in the treatment of this sub-section of the population.
