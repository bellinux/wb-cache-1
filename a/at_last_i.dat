5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> <b>I</b> {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E

25|$|After {{the battle}} and still {{by the end}} of the war, {{considerable}} controversy abounded over exactly what had happened at Jutland and who, if anyone, was to blame for perceived failings. With the war over, it was decided to publish an official history of the battle. Captain John Harper was appointed by the then First Sea Lord, Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, to review all the available documentation and write the report. At the moment Wemyss retired and was replaced as First Sea Lord by Beatty, the finished book had already reached the stage of proof copies awaiting approval on his desk. Beatty objected to the account, requesting Harper make alterations which Harper refused to do unless Beatty would give him written orders to that effect. It had already become known to the public that Harper was writing the account (questions had been asked about it in Parliament) and he refused to put his name to an account he could not agree with. Instead, Beatty appointed two brothers, Captains Alfred Dewar and Kenneth Dewar to write a 'staff appreciation' of the battle, which would be circulated to navy officers only. The Harper report was passed to Sir Julian Corbett, who was writing an official history of the whole naval war on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Corbett was shown the staff appreciation, and said I 'read it with increasing wonder till <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>I</b> felt it my duty to convey to the Admiralty that such a grotesque account of the battle certainly ought not to go out as their considered verdict'. The account was classified as 'secret' and yet another version was commissioned, the 'Admiralty Narrative'. This was shown to Jellicoe, and a long correspondence ensued where he objected to many parts of the narrative. With particular reference to Evan-Thomas, Jellicoe objected to the claim that Evan-Thomas had been responsible for the distance between his ships and Beatty's, which had resulted in Beatty going into battle without the support of the four most powerful ships in his command.|$|E

6000|$|As Mrs. Cliff {{opened the}} door of Willy Croup's state-room, a pale white face in the lower berth was turned towards her, and a weak and {{trembling}} voice said to her, [...] "Oh, Sarah, you have come <b>at</b> <b>last!</b> <b>Is</b> there any way of getting me out of this horrible little hole?" ...|$|R

500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed. [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>I</b> turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' He gave me a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening aria, [...] "" [...] (I will gladly {{carry the}} Cross), is in bar form AAB, with two stollen (A) {{followed}} by an abgesang (B). The first stollen starts with a ritornello for full orchestra, anticipating in counterpoint the rising and then falling motif of the bass soloist, mounting to an anguished augmented second marking the word [...] (Cross), followed by descending sighing figures signalling the bearing of the cross. After the entry of the soloist, with its long and expressive melismatic lines, the three groups of strings and oboes accompany in counterpoint and echoing responses drawn from motifs of the opening ritornello. The ritornello is then taken up in the second stollen, but with significant variations because of the differing text: [...] "It leads me after my torments to God in the Promised Land". After {{a repeat of the}} opening ritornello, the final abgesang illustrates the words, [...] "There <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>I</b> will lay my sorrow in the grave, there my Savior himself will wipe away my tears." [...] Declamatory triplets, dramatically spanning the whole bass register, are responded to by sighing motifs in the accompaniment. A reprise of the orchestral ritornello brings the aria to a close.|$|E

Philip attacked Henry in Normandy and captured strongholds in Berry, then they met to discuss peace again.

2500|$|Of the Zambaco affair, {{which would}} sputter {{on for some}} years, Georgiana wrote to her dear friend Rosalind Howard [...] "Dearest Rosalind, be hard on {{no one in this}} matter, and exalt no one, and may we all come through it <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> <b>I</b> know one thing, and that is that there is enough love between Edward and me to last out a long life if it is given us".|$|E
2500|$|In 1945 {{she fell}} in love with {{director}} Roberto Rossellini while working on Roma, Città Aperta aka Rome, Open City (1945). [...] "I thought <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>I</b> had found the ideal man... had lost a son of his own and I felt we understood each other. Above all, we had the same artistic conceptions." [...] Rossellini had become violent, volatile and possessive, and they argued constantly about films or out of jealousy. [...] "In fits of rage they threw crockery at each other." [...] As artists, however, they complemented each other well while working on neorealist films. The two finally split apart when Rossellini fell in love with and married, Ingrid Bergman.|$|E
2500|$|Widman {{described}} the run {{after the game}} as follows:"The play was a revolving wedge on Chicago's left tackle. [...] Their end and tackle had been drawn in by our men, and when the ball {{was given to me}} on a delayed pass I had a clear field, except for Chicago's backs. [...] I ran as fast as I could diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>I</b> was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard line. [...] I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and managed to crawl over the line. [...] I did not know I had made a touchdown, however, until Captain Bennett told me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence's {{second husband}} Richard Aldrich became a {{lieutenant}} in the United States Navy during World War II, during which time Lawrence had a standing invitation to perform for British troops {{from the head of}} the UK's Entertainments National Service Association. Her chief obstacle was getting from her home in Massachusetts to Britain. Aldrich was overseas at the time. In her 1945 memoir A Star Danced, she recalled, [...] "After weeks of more or less patient waiting, repeated timid, pleading, urgent and finally importunate requests to the authorities who rule such matters in Washington and London, and a rapid-fire barrage of telegrams, cables and telephone calls, it had happened. <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>I</b> had permission to do what I had been wanting desperately to do for four years—go to England and do my bit on a tour for E.N.S.A." ...|$|E
2500|$|The crowd departs: (Duet, Norma and Pollione: In mia man alfin tu sei / [...] "At last {{you are in}} my hands; no one can {{cut your}} bonds. I can"). Norma demands that he forever shun Adalgisa; only then will she release him and never see him again. He refuses, and she vents her anger by telling him that she will then kill her children. [...] "Strike me instead", he demands, [...] "so that only I alone will die", but she quickly asserts that not only will all the Romans die, but so will Adalgisa, who has broken her vows as a priestess. This prompts him to plead for her life. (Cabaletta: Norma and Pollione: Già mi pasco ne' tuoi sguardi / [...] "Already I take {{pleasure}} in the look you give me, your grief and in her death; <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>I</b> can make you as miserable as I".) When Pollione demands the knife, she calls the priests to assemble. Norma announces {{that it would be}} better to sacrifice a priestess who has broken her vows, and orders the pyre to be lit. Oroveso demands to know who is to be sacrificed while Pollione demands that she keep silent, but Norma then reveals that it is she who is to be the victim because she is the guilty one, a high Priestess who has broken her vows, has become involved with the enemy, and has borne his children. (Aria, Norma to Pollione: Qual cor tradisti / [...] "May this awful moment now show you the heart you betrayed and lost"; Duet: Norma and Pollione; Ensemble, Norma, Oroveso, Pollione, Druids, Priests: each expresses his/her sorrow, anger, pleas to Norma, with Oroveso learning for the first time that Norma is a mother.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Les Murray {{was born}} in Nabiac on the North Coast of New South Wales {{and grew up in}} the {{neighbouring}} district of Bunyah where he currently resides. He attended primary and early high school in Nabiac and then attended Taree High School. In 1957 he began study at the University of Sydney in the Faculty of Arts and joined the Royal Australian Navy Reserve to obtain a small income. Speaking about this time to Clive James he has said: [...] "I was as soft-headed as you could imagine. I was actually hanging on to childhood because I hadn't had much teenage. My Mum died and my father collapsed. I had to look after him. So I was off the chain <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> <b>I</b> was in Sydney and I didn't quite know how to do adulthood or teenage. I was being coltish and foolish and childlike. I received the least distinguished degree Sydney ever issued. I don't think anyone's ever matched it." [...] He developed an interest in ancient and modern languages, which qualified him to become a professional translator at the Australian National University (where he was employed from 1963 to 1967). During his studies he met other poets and writers such as Geoffrey Lehmann, Bob Ellis, Clive James and Lex Banning as well as future political journalists Laurie Oakes and Mungo McCallum Jr. Between times, he hitch-hiked around Australia and lived briefly at a Sydney Push household at Milson's Point. He returned to undergraduate studies in the 1960s and became a Roman Catholic when he married Budapest-born fellow-student Valerie Morelli in 1962. They lived in Wales and Scotland and travelled in Europe for over a year in the late 1960s. They have five children.|$|E
