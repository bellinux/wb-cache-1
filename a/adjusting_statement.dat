We examined the association between various safety statements and prescription behavior for gastroprotective drugs in na€ ıve patients in the Netherlands during the years 2008 – 2011. Data from the PHARMO Database Network were analyzed with interrupted time series analyses to estimate the impact of each communication on drug prescriptions. Dispensings were used as a proxy variable for prescrip- tion behavior. After the early communication in January 2009, 15. 5 % (95 % CI 7. 8, 23. 4) more patients started concomitantly with (es) omeprazole and 13. 8 % (95 % CI 6. 5, 21. 2) less with other PPIs. Directly after the first statement in June 2009, we found a steep increase in histamine 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RA) peaking at 25 %, placing those patients at risk for gastrointestinal events. This effect for H 2 RA faded away after a few months. In February 2010, when the official advice via an <b>adjusted</b> <b>statement</b> was to avoid (es) omeprazole, we found a decrease of 11. 9 % (95 % CI 5. 7, 18. 2) for (es) omeprazole and an increase of + 16. 0 % (95 % CI 10. 3, 21. 7) for other PPIs.

40|$|The Quantity Theory of Money is implicitly {{embedded}} in the arguments for price level <b>adjusted</b> financial <b>statements</b> - inflation accounting. Historically, the instability of commodity prices, {{which is due to}} changes in relative prices, is considered by one school of economic thought (monetarism) as a reflection of the instability of the value of nominal money. Monetarists maintain that it is the level of the money supply which accounts for the instability of commodity prices. Hence, (1) all changes in the level of the money supply is deemed responsible for changes in the general level of prices, and (2) with each increase in the general level of prices, paper money is said to lose value. In a money economy, nominal money prices reflect the underlying exchange ratios of the various commodities that are produced and exchanged for nominal money. In the absence of monetary dislocation (monetary revaluation or devaluation), any change in the nominal price of a commodity reflects a change in its purchasing power (a change in its exchange ratio vis-a-vis other commodities). Since the physical form of a commodity is relatively constant while the price varies, the simultaneity of these two conditions produces a sensory illusion that leads the monetarists to argue that the measuring device (money) is defective. This paper attempts to demonstrate (in the absence of monetary dislocation) : (1) the stability of paper money, which makes it a valid measuring device; and (2) that the quantity theory of money, which is the basis of constant dollar accounting, is a flawed theory. price level changes, level of money supply, instability of commodity prices, monetarism, price level <b>adjusted,</b> financial <b>statements,</b> general purchasing power. ...|$|R

40|$|Conference, and {{attendees}} at Carnegie Mellon and Harvard University faculty workshops. All remaining deficiencies {{are entirely}} our own. Inflation, Foreign Exchange, and Parsimonious Equity Valuation Inflation poses problems for parsimonious equity valuation using bottom line accounting numbers. At issue are the distortions in earnings and book values that follow {{from the use}} of historical cost unadjusted for general price level changes. These distortions include the understatement of operating assets and the mismatching of allocated costs that reflect past price levels with revenues that reflect current price levels. In this paper, we consider accounting policies that allow one to recover parsimonious valuation in an inflationary environment. Our model generalizes the cash flow dynamics of Feltham and Ohlson (1996) to encompass stochastic inflation. We show that parsimonious valuation can be achieved through either a restatement of book value and increase in depreciation similar to the policy recommended by SFAS 33, or a decrease in depreciation sufficient to capture both effects. We also suggest an approach for approximate parsimonious valuation without preparing full-scale general price level <b>adjusted</b> financial <b>statements.</b> Extending the analysis to the setting of a multinational firm with a unit operating in a country experiencing inflation, we show how to achieve parsimonious valuation in domestic currency through foreign currency translation using either historical or current exchange rates as prescribed under SFAS 8 and SFAS 52, respectively.

Firstly, the study aims at finding {{out whether the}} financial statement adjustments significantly influence credit ratings. Secondly, the thesis investigates whether {{the effects of the}} adjustments on credit ratings differ between IFRS and U. S. GAAP companies. DATA The data used in the empirical analysis is provided by a global credit rating agency, referred to as Credit Rating Agency X. The data consists of reported and <b>adjusted</b> financial <b>statements</b> as well as credit ratings from the time period 2004 - 2007. The final sample comprises of 963 companies from 42 countries and 17 industries. 20 percent of the final sample is IFRS observations whereas the mount of U. S. GAAP observations totals 80 percent. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS The main empirical analysis is implemented by using a linear regression method. The effects of financial statement adjustments on credit ratings are analyzed by models comprising of adjustments to EBIT, total debt, interest expense as well as free cash flow and control variables. The effects of IFRS and U. S. GAAP adjustments on credit ratings are compared by constructing a model adding in interaction terms for IFRS dummy variable and the adjustments. RESULTS The results indicate {{that for the most part}} the financial statement adjustments do affect credit ratings. It appears that adjustments to EBIT and total debt are the most significant adjustment types. However, overall the effects appear to be fairly small suggesting that the adjustments are not highly material in determining credit ratings. It is also found that only the effects of EBIT adjustments on credit ratings differ between IFRS and U. S. GAAP. This implies that IFRS and U. S. GAAP provide financial information of equal quality.

40|$|Background. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the importance of parental factors possibly related to dietary control in early and continuously treated patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Methods. A questionnaire was disseminated among parents of 238 patients with PKU born after the nationwide introduction of newborn screening for PKU (1 September 1974) until 31 December 1995. The questionnaire was based on a behavioural model measuring people's attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacy. Dietary control was defined on the basis of mean phenyl- alanine (Phe) concentration of the PKU patients measured between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1996. Results. Response rate was 71 %. Attitudes: children of parents who believed that their child adheres well to the diet, even if his or her Phe concentrations are sometimes too high, had lower Phe concentrations than children of parents who disagree with this <b>statement</b> (<b>adjusted</b> difference - 103 mu mol/L, p < 0. 001). Subjective norm: Phe concentrations were higher when parents answered that their relatives did not approve when their child deviates from the diet (p = 0. 004). Self-efficacy: children of parents who reported difficulties in having their child eat the synthetic protein substitute three times a day had higher Phe concentrations than those of parents who did not have such difficulties (adjusted difference 156 mu mol/L, p = 0. 007). Conclusion. More attention should be given to parents having their child eat the synthetic protein substitute at least three times a day and to teaching parents to keep strictly to the diet without being too rigid. These factors were strongly associated to dietary control and may be amenable to change...|$|R
40|$|Auditor-Client {{negotiation}} about difficult client {{accounting issues}} involves the auditor, the client, {{and various other}} parties on both the client and auditor side. On the auditor side, the Professional Practice Department {{has been reported to}} {{play a significant role in}} the financial reporting process, yet is rarely the focus of academic study. In this study, I investigate how communicating the involvement of the Professional Practice Department (PPD) to top management using different influence techniques impacts negotiated outcomes between audit partners and top management. I examine the impact of communicating the involvement of the PPD in the context of two other variables found in prior auditing literature to be important in the negotiation process, auditor type and CFO (Chief Financial Officer) preferred auditor-type. While auditors must attest that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, they also must ensure they foster a functional working relationship with the client. The auditor-client context is unique, and takes place within an on-going relationship where expectations and preferences have been established. Therefore, I examine these negotiation outcomes while incorporating a key contextual variable, auditor-type, in the negotiations. Both the CFO's preference for auditor-type, as well as actual auditor-type will be examined in addition to the specific influence tactic. I use a 3 x 2 x 2 fully factorial design to experimentally analyze the impact of two manipulated variable (influence tactic and auditor-type) and one measured variable (CFO preference for auditor-type) on two dependent variables. The two dependent variables are the CFO's willingness to post an adjustment to the financial statements and the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner. I report the results of an audit negotiation experiment in which 154 highly experienced CFOs responded to a case scenario that incorporated or measured the three key variables (influence tactic communicating PPD involvement, auditor-type and CFO preference for auditor type). My results indicate that using the most aggressive influence tactic to communicate the Professional Practice Department's involvement had a mixed effect on the CFOs willingness to post adjustments to the financial statements. The CFOs in this influence condition that were paired with an accommodating auditor-type reported a higher willingness to <b>adjust</b> the financial <b>statements</b> while CFOs paired with a proactive and advising auditor-type reported a lower willingness to post adjustments. All CFOs reported less satisfaction with the audit partner when the most aggressive influence tactic was used to communicate the Professional Practice Department's inyolvement. Furthermore, the CFO's preference for an auditor-type significantly affects negotiation outcomes. CFOs that prefer more proactive and advising audit partners are more likely to post adjustments to the financial statements, regardless of whether or not. they are informed of the Professional Practice Department's involvement. These same CFOs report a high level of satisfaction with the audit partner and their satisfaction is not impacted by the type of audit partner they are paired with. CFOs that prefer more reactive and accommodating audit partners are less willing to <b>adjust</b> the financial <b>statements</b> and report less satisfaction (dissatisfaction), when paired with proactive and advising audit partners. These results highlight the importance of the existing relationship within the auditor-client dyads and help support findings from auditor-client negotiation research which show that prevailing expectations of the CFO are a contextually important feature of audit negotiation and should be incorporated into more research. I also show that aggressive tactics can help persuade some CFOs to adjust the financial statements; however, consistently pushing too aggressively results in reduced cooperation. Furthermore, there are large costs in terms of the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner in using aggressive tactics, and therefore, practically speaking the tactic that could potentially be the most effective may result in a lost client...|$|R
