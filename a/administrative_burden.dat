40|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> {{stemming}} from regulations are a worldwide cause {{of concern for}} policy-makers. Reducing <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> has become an important policy objective in economic growth strategies for many governments. The European Commission set out a policy goal of reducing <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> by 25 % by 2012, although the literature provides limited evidence of its impact. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> on growth by using 6 business regulation variables for a panel of 182 countries. The results from the fixed effect regression analysis suggest that reducing <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> in certain policy areas spurs economic growth. In particular, reducing burdens concerning start-ups and paying taxes enhances growth significantly. Furthermore, using a panel of 26 European countries, our results suggest that reducing the <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> by 25 % has {{a positive effect on}} growth of 1. 62 % in the European Union...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to assess the effect of {{regulatory}} burdens in the European dairy industry on its competitiveness. A theoretical foundation is provided by transaction cost economics and total quality management insights. The effects of legislation on administrative requirements and competitiveness are supposed to be mediated by impacts on innovativeness, company strategy, food safety system availability, as well as the available information & communication capabilities. We will connect to previous research (Wijnands et al., 2007) and the findings therein. Four sub-questions are addressed: • what is the relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> innovation and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> food safety & quality system deployment and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> food labelling requirements and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> supply chain transparency and competitiveness? In addition to the theoretical framework presented earlier in Bremmers et al., 2008, this paper contains the first results of a survey in the European dairy industry. They are combined with the proceeds from a literature search. The results show that (Q 1) especially product innovation is negatively impacted by <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens.</b> Food safety and quality systems (Q 2) serve to provide a level playing field in Europe. They would be installed also if no legal requirements would enforce them, because clients ask for it, so that <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> could easily be attributed to business strategy rather than legal obligations. To reduce <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> we advice to integrate food safety and quality requirements is necessary. It would reduce monitoring and reporting costs, both for private as well as public parties. Food labeling (Q 3) (a ‘made in Europe’ origin marking) could work contraproductive with respect to the competitive position of dairy firms and will have an increase of <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> as a net-effect. And last but not least (Q 4), increased chain transparency (mentioning the name of intermediary producers on the end-product package) will accelerate <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> but will only be beneficial for SMEs with a differentiated product. Commodity-producers in the dairy industry which only follow a cost strategy will gradually merge and/or disappear. dairy industry, competitiveness, <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> food safety, labelling, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

5|$|Protestantism {{was focused}} on the Bible and family worship was {{strongly}} encouraged. The kirk sessions applied personal and moral discipline. They discouraged group celebrations. Sessions had an <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> in the system of poor relief, the administration of the parish school system. They also took over the pursuit of witchcraft cases. The most intense hunt was in 1661–62, but improving economic conditions and increasing scepticism led the practice to peter out {{towards the end of the}} century. The numbers of Roman Catholics and the organisation of the Church probably deteriorated, but began to revive with the appointment of a Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694.|$|E
5|$|This forced Bhimsen {{to share}} the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> between Rajendra, Samrajya Laxmi, and himself, and ask for their {{opinions}} on administrative matters, {{in order to reduce}} further friction between himself and the royalty. Rajendra was put in charge of defense, finance, and foreign relations; while Samrajya Laxmi was put in charge of justice, accountancy, and civil administration. Nevertheless, Rajendra's activities were heavily influenced by the advice of Samrajya Laxmi, while the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi had no say in any matter; furthermore, the King and the Senior Queen did not dare yet to outright dismiss Bhimsen's plans and advice, fearful of the large army under his command. This arrangement worked well for the next three years; for instance, that year, Nepal was struck by a great earthquake, and all three power holders were able to coordinate with each other and provide emergency relief to the citizens.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1920s, {{there were}} no {{significant}} changes to the building. Neither World War I nor the November revolution of 1918 caused damage to it. In 1920, the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> was considerably increased by the incorporation of several outlying towns and villages into the city of Berlin in the Greater Berlin Act. As a result, some departments and units had to be housed outside the building. In 1929, the Magistrat commissioned the city planning division to develop a concept for a new administrative building encompassing two city blocks that would also link the Stadthaus to the City Hall. This plan also included the existing main city library and the city savings bank. It would have been part of a wideranging plan to redevelop the area of the Molkenmarkt, including replacement of the old and substandard housing along Am Krögel, an alley leading to the Spree. These plans had to be abandoned in 1931 because of the political and economic situation of Berlin after World War I.|$|E

Most of the U.S. and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf and the other allied commanders wanted to fight cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf's experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including allied commanders, with greater ease. He had {{a good relationship with}} Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who in turn helped Schwarzkopf win over the Saudi Arabian populace. In spite of the cooperation, he later said he considered the Arab troops to be the least effective of the war. Schwarzkopf also had an agreeable relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Cal Waller, who handled much of the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden.</b> Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also cooperated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders meant their forces were able to cooperate effectively during the operation.|$|E

25|$|The Reformation, {{carried out}} in Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and heavily {{influenced}} by Calvinism, amounted to a revolution in religious practice. Sermons were now the focus of worship. The Witchcraft Act 1563 made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes. There were major series of trials in 1590–91, 1597, 1628–31, 1649–50 and 1661–62. Prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. Seventy-five per cent of the accused were women and modern estimates indicate that over 1,500 persons were executed across the whole period. Scottish Protestantism {{in the seventeenth century}} was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In the mid-seventeenth century Scottish Presbyterian worship took the form it was to maintain until the liturgical revival of the nineteenth century with the adoption of the Westminster Directory in 1643. The seventeenth century saw the high-water mark of kirk discipline, with kirk sessions able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. Kirk sessions also had an <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> in the system of poor relief and a major role in education. In the eighteenth century there were a series of reforms in church music. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted at most once a year, sometimes in outdoor holy fairs.|$|E

Due to the new conventions that are formed by IMO, more requirements are added which often lead to time consuming administrative tasks and documentation that should be spent on activities which are contributing to the ships safety. The issue has been observed by IMO that has through BIMCO done a study with the aim to identify and reduce <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> at sea. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} find out if safety officers aboard Swedish ferries consider that SOLAS Chapter III, 8. 3 och 19. 5 regulations are <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> restricted to muster lists and documentation of training aboard the ship. The secondary questions to the study are if it is possible to remove, combine or change the documents and how much time can be saved by doing this. The question about timesaving could not be answered, because the values were scattered and could not be used for further investigation. The observed values were accumulated by a survey and the result indicated that safety officers did not experience the two regulations as <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens.</b> Due to this, the majority of the respondents did not have requests about changing or removing the requirements since all safety officers considered them to be important.

500|$|The {{seventeenth century}} saw the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk {{sessions}} {{were able to}} apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva. Public occasions were treated with mistrust and from the later seventeenth century there were efforts by kirk sessions to stamp out activities such as well-dressing, bonfires, guising, penny weddings and dancing. Kirk sessions also had an <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> in the system of poor relief. An act of 1649 declared that local heritors were to be assessed by kirk session to provide the financial resources for local relief, {{rather than relying on}} voluntary contributions. By the mid-seventeenth century the system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands. The system was largely able to cope with general poverty and minor crises, helping the old and infirm to survive and provide life support in periods of downturn at relatively low cost, but was overwhelmed in the major subsistence crisis of the 1690s, known as the seven ill years. The kirk also had a major role in education. Statutes passed in 1616, 1633, 1646 and 1696 established a parish school system, paid for by local heritors and administered by [...] ministers and local presbyteries. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Greece is {{currently}} developing the Hellenic Cadastre {{and in that}} process all properties have to be declared by those with relevant rights. The declaration process is extremely complex and hence imposes significant <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> on citizens and businesses. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an e-government solution for reducing the <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> related to the informative stage of the specific public service. By informative stage we refer to all these actions that one needs to undertake to obtain all essential information in order to be capable of executing a specific service. The analysis of this service suggest that its complexity is mainly related to the different supporting documents that need to be submitted along with the declaration form, which depend on a number of factors. Consequently, an online dialogue was suggested that enables automatic identification of the input documents to be submitted. The dialogue was modelled using BPMN and developed in an open source environment. This approach is expected to significantly reduce <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> in this service. Most importantly, the followed approach can be also applied in other complex public services. 1...|$|R
