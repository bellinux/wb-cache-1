25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the 2005 London bombings, a new {{directive}} stated that New York City would institute a citywide transit <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>program</b> {{with the intent of}} reducing crime and fighting terrorism in the city's transit system. Transit Auxiliary officers work out of Transit Bureau precincts known as Districts and carry Transit portable radios. Unlike a precinct, the transit districts cover miles of underground subway. Transit Auxiliary Police officers go through additional training by the Transit Bureau Vandals Squad as well as the Counter-Terrorism Division to build vandalism and terrorism awareness within the Transit System. Transit Auxiliary officers are paired with either a regular police officer or Auxiliary police officer. Transit Auxiliary Police periodically perform inspections of the subway station(s) and platforms which they are assigned to, taking note of any suspicious occurrences, and set up a fixed post at the subway turnstiles, token booths, mezzanines, or platforms. Transit Auxiliary officers also conduct subway train inspections as well as train runs to/from stations that which assignment is given. Due to the common medical emergency calls in Transit, if medically qualified, Transit Auxiliary Police officers can respond to medical emergencies if they are near to the transit location. The main function of the NYPD Transit Auxiliary Police, like the NYPD Transit Police, is to primarily remain within the subway system.|$|E

The O.P.P. auxiliary is a volunteer program where selected citizens receive special training in order to perform many duties such as community policing initiatives and projects, regular patrol, crime and disaster scenes, large gatherings or parades for crowd and traffic control, and traffic control at accidents. The Ontario Provincial Police <b>auxiliary</b> <b>program</b> is the only such Canadian program that requires its auxiliary constables to attend a full-time recruit course conducted near its regular training facility in Orillia,. [...] This is followed by ongoing in-service training at the detachments. The program may {{also serve as a}} stepping stone for potential future employment. The O.P.P.

5000|$|In 1978, the Canadian Coast Guard (at {{the time}} {{under the federal}} Minister of the Department of Transport) {{established}} the Canadian Marine Rescue Auxiliary (CMRA) across Canada in order to involve volunteers in a structured way to provide marine rescue assistance and rescue prevention education. This national <b>auxiliary</b> <b>program</b> provided funding for volunteer operations, such as reimbursement of fuel costs and insurance coverage, when volunteer boats and crews were formally tasked to respond to marine incidents by the Victoria (Joint) Rescue Co-ordination Centre (JRCC) of the Department of National Defence (DND). Guidance in volunteer training and provision of some specialized rescue and life saving equipment were also provided under this program. The CMRA underwent a name change to Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary. In the Pacific Region of the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, under which the Canadian Coast Guard (Special Operating) Agency now falls, the CCGA-Pacific underwent a rebranding doing business under the name Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue or RCM SAR, effective May 2012.|$|E

40|$|Using {{automated}} reasoning techniques, we {{tackle the}} niche activity of proving that a program is free from run-time exceptions. Such a property is particularly valuable in high integrity software, e. g. safety or security critical applications. The context for {{our work is}} the SPARK Approach {{for the development of}} high integrity software. The SPARK Approach provides a significant degree of automation in proving exception freedom. However, where this automation fails, the programmer is burdened with the task of interactively constructing a proof and possibly also having to supply <b>auxiliary</b> <b>program</b> annotations. We minimise this burden by increasing the automation, via an integration of proof planning and a program analysis oracle. We advocate a “co-operative” integration, where proof-failure analysis directly constrains the search for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>program</b> annotations. The approach has been successfully tested on industrial data...|$|E
