5|$|Operation Head Start {{eventually}} lead to Operation Chrome Dome. Chrome Dome was an operation where bombers would be in constant <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> and loiter at points just outside the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Operation Head Start was {{conducted}} at the base from September to December 1958. It helped to demonstrate that a continuous <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> could be maintained successfully.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} nuclear bombs aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, the cleanup (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the cleanup costs and political consequences proved too high to risk again, so SAC ended the <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> program the following day.|$|E
50|$|SAC's <b>airborne</b> <b>alerts</b> {{during this}} period also {{included}} Operation Chrome Dome for the bomber and tanker force. Although ostensibly a peacetime mission, Chrome Dome placed heavy demands on flight crews and five B-52 aircraft were lost to airborne mishaps during the operation's eight-year period.|$|R

50|$|Early on New Year's Day, the RCT was {{attached}} to the 82nd <b>Airborne</b> and <b>alerted</b> to go on the attack. On 3 January, the RCT, acting as the left flank of the 82nd, attacked south along the Salm River. The 551st PIR, as an attached unit, fought through Basse-Bodeux, while the 2nd Battalion captured Trois-Ponts. The southerly attack continued to Mont-de-Fosse where advance elements were subjected to intense shelling.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the Cold War, B-52s {{and other}} US {{strategic}} bombers performed <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> patrols under code {{names such as}} Head Start, Chrome Dome, Hard Head, Round Robin, and Giant Lance. Bombers loitered at high altitude near {{the borders of the}} Soviet Union to provide rapid first strike or retaliation capability in case of nuclear war. These airborne patrols formed one component of the US's nuclear deterrent, which would act to prevent the breakout of a large-scale war between the US and the Soviet Union under the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction.|$|E
5|$|With even a {{few hundred}} missiles, the Soviets could afford to target every US bomber base. With no warning system in place, a sneak attack could destroy a {{significant}} amount of the US bomber fleet on the ground. The US would still have the <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> force and its own small ICBM fleet, but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch, leaving them with a massive strategic advantage. To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would come too late to cover this period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E
25|$|Special {{research}} missions {{were flown}} by the 9th in the B-52F from October 1959 to June 1960 with the AGM-28 Hound Dog air-launched cruise missile, although the squadron never employed them on nuclear alert duty. Afterwards, the squadron supported SAC's Worldwide <b>Airborne</b> <b>Alert</b> Force from 1960 to 1965.|$|E
40|$|An {{element of}} the NASA/FAA {{windshear}} program is the integration of ground-based microburst information on the flight deck, to support <b>airborne</b> windshear <b>alerting</b> and microburst avoidance. NASA conducted a windshear flight test program {{in the summer of}} 1991 during which airborne processing of Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) data was used to derive microburst alerts. Microburst information was extracted from TDWR, transmitted to a NASA Boeing 737 in flight via data link, and processed to estimate the windshear hazard level (F-factor) that would be experienced by the aircraft in each microburst. The microburst location and F-factor were used to derive a situation display and alerts. The situation display was successfully used to maneuver the aircraft for microburst penetrations, during which atmospheric &quot;truth &quot; measurements were made. A total of 19 penetrations were made of TDWR-reported microburst locations. Predicted and measured F-factors agreed well in penetrations near microburst cores. Although improvements in airborne and ground processing of the TDWR measurements would be required to support an <b>airborne</b> executive-level <b>alerting</b> protocol, the practicality of airborne utilization of TDWR data link data has been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} "free flight" is {{intended}} to emphasize more flexibility for operators in the National Airspace System (RTCA, 1995). This may include the potential for aircraft self-separation. The purpose of this simulation was to begin examining some of the communication and procedural issues associated with self-separation in an integrated air-ground environment. Participants were 10 commercial U. S. flight crews who flew the B 747 - 400 simulator and 10 Denver ARTCC controllers who monitored traffic in an ATC simulation. A prototypic <b>airborne</b> <b>alerting</b> logic and flight deck display features were designed to allow for increased traffic and maneuvering information. Eight different scenarios representing different conflict types were developed. The effects of traffic density (high and low) and different traffic convergence angles (obtuse, acute, and right) were assessed. Conflict detection times {{were found to be}} lower for the flight crews in low density compared to high density scenarios. For the controllers, an interaction between density and convergence angle was revealed. Analyses on the controller detection times found longer detection times in the obtuse high density compared to obtuse low density, as well as the shortest detection times in the high density acute angle condition. Maneuvering and communication events are summarized, and a discussion of future research issues is provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) {{as the future}} source of aircraft surveillance worldwide provides an opportunity to introduce high-precision <b>airborne</b> conflict <b>alerting</b> systems for operations in high-density traffic environments. Current alerting systems have been very successful at preventing mid-air collisions in the en-route environment but have limited benefit in high-density environments such as near airports where most mid-air collisions occur (59 %). Furthermore, introducing an ADS-B-enabled conflict alerting system generates an incentive for General Aviation users to voluntarily equip with ADS-B avionics.

25|$|The B-52G {{began its}} mission from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, {{carrying}} four type B28RI hydrogen bombs on a Cold War <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> mission named Operation Chrome Dome. The flight plan took the aircraft east across the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea towards the European {{borders of the}} Soviet Union before returning home. The lengthy flight required two mid-air refuellings over Spain.|$|E
25|$|In July 1960, the Hound Dog reached initial {{operational}} capability with the first B-52 unit. The Hound Dog was used on <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> {{for the first time}} in January 1962. In 1962, SAC activated missile maintenance squadrons to provide maintenance for both the Hound Dog and the ADM-20 Quail decoy missile. Full {{operational capability}} was achieved in August 1963 when 29 B-52 bomber wings were operational with the Hound Dog.|$|E
25|$|The B-36, {{including}} its GRB-36, RB-36, and XC-99 variants, was in USAF service {{as part of}} the Strategic Air Command from 1948 to 1959. The RB-36 variants of the B-36 were used for reconnaissance during the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the B-36 bomber variants conducted training and test operations and stood ground and <b>airborne</b> <b>alert,</b> but the latter variants were never used offensively as bombers against hostile forces; it never fired a shot in combat.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of August 9, the {{reinforced}} North Vietnamese 5th Battalion attacked a Korean tactical base in Đức Cơ, when the <b>airborne</b> were <b>alerted</b> to prevent the defeated North Vietnamese regiments, trying to retreat back into Cambodia. During several hours of fighting the outnumbered South Koreans defeated their enemies who left {{more than one hundred}} bodies on the battlefield. Meanwhile, USAF jet fighters opened fire on a pair of South Vietnamese villages, which they mistakenly believed were Vietcong camps. The resulting attack left 63 people dead and at least 100 more wounded.|$|R
50|$|The 82nd <b>Airborne</b> {{had been}} <b>alerted</b> on 15 September. On 19 September, they were loaded into C-141s. They were to {{drop into the}} Amman Airport, and secure and hold it for {{follow-up}} units. Within minutes after the first C-141s became airborne the mission was aborted and all returned to Pope AFB/Fort Bragg.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 July 1989, the 1st Combat Evaluation Group {{reporting}} {{directly to}} SAC headquarters was split with most HQ 1CEVG organizations transferring to SAC HQ (e.g., the Command Instrument Flight Division) and RBS personnel, equipment, and [...] becoming the 1st Electronic Combat Range Group. <b>Airborne</b> NEACP <b>alerts</b> ended in 1990 and during 1991's Operation Desert Storm to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion and occupation, SAC bomber, tanker and reconnaissance aircraft flew operations (e.g., B-52s with conventional bombs and conventional warhead AGM-86 ALCMs) near Iraq from bases in Great Britain, Turkey, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.|$|R
25|$|The B-52D was {{returning}} to Georgia from Massachusetts after an earlier Chrome Dome <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> to Europe. Near Meyersdale, Pennsylvania, on a path east of Salisbury, Pennsylvania; and after altitude changes to evade severe turbulence; the vertical stabilizer broke off. The aircraft was left uncontrollable as a result; the pilot ordered the crew to bail out, and the aircraft crashed. The wreckage of the aircraft {{was found on the}} Stonewall Green farm. Today, the crash site is in a private meadow of Elbow Mountain within Savage River State Forest, along the public Savage Mountain Trail just north of the Pine Swamp Road crossing.|$|E
25|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, F-104C Starfighters of the 479th Tactical Fighter Wing from George AFB, California, were {{deployed}} to Eglin {{as part of}} the immense build up of military strength and material in the State of Florida in preparation for possible military action. The 4135th Strategic Wing, Strategic Air Command, Alert crews at Eglin were placed on <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> priority with two Eglin B-52s on 24-hour flights within cruising range of Russia. Flights of 24 hours, more than double the usual ten-hour missions, were refueled by KC-135 tankers. Following the end of the crisis, the SAC crews returned to their usual routines. Ready Force, A Company, of the 82d Airborne Division, U.S. Army, was deployed to Eglin from Fort Benning, Georgia, for a possible jump into Havana to seize the airport.|$|E
25|$|AWRE's {{trickery}} {{with the}} steel balls had other unintended outcomes. Even an event as inconsequential as early morning frost was an issue. Violet Club could be loaded into a bomber {{for up to}} thirty days on standby while parked overnight on a remote base where the bomb could get very cold. If the steel balls froze together inside the bomb cavity {{and could not be}} removed, the bomb was useless. AWRE's solution was to fit the bomb with an electric blanket. Because the bombs were armed before flight, the take-off was hazardous; the bombs could not be jettisoned, and landing with an armed bomb on return to base was too hazardous to contemplate. As a consequence, Violet Club could not be used on an <b>airborne</b> <b>alert,</b> or even flown to a remote dispersal base.|$|E
50|$|Needless to say, {{this was}} the heyday of ALCS operations. Around-the-clock, there were three {{dedicated}} ALCCs on ground alert, one ALCS capable Looking Glass SAC ABNCP airborne at all times, {{and at least two}} ALCS-capable Auxiliary ABNCPs on ground <b>alert.</b> <b>Airborne</b> missileers, along with all other Cold Warriors kept the peace for several decades.|$|R
50|$|The first {{integrated}} circuit {{was produced in}} September 1958, but computers using them didn't begin to appear until 1963. Some of their early uses were in embedded systems, notably used by NASA for the Apollo Guidance Computer, by {{the military in the}} LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile, the Honeywell <b>ALERT</b> <b>airborne</b> computer, and in the Central Air Data Computer used for flight control in the US Navy's F-14A Tomcat fighter jet.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviets placed seven <b>airborne</b> {{divisions}} on <b>alert</b> and airlift was marshaled {{to transport}} {{them to the}} Middle East. An airborne command post {{was set up in}} the southern Soviet Union, and several air force units were also alerted. [...] "Reports also indicated {{that at least one of}} the divisions and a squadron of transport planes had been moved from the Soviet Union to an airbase in Yugoslavia". The Soviets also deployed seven amphibious warfare craft with some 40,000 naval infantry in the Mediterranean.|$|R
500|$|The {{accident}} caused controversy at {{the time}} and in the years since. It highlighted the risks Thule Air Base posed to Greenlanders from nuclear accidents and potential superpower conflicts. The accident, which occurred two years after the Palomares crash, signaled the immediate end of the <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> program, which had become untenable because of the political and operational risks involved. Scott Sagan, a political science academic and anti-nuclear writer, postulated that if the HOBO 28 monitoring aircraft had crashed into the BMEWS early warning array instead of Baffin Bay, it would have presented NORAD with a scenario (radio link to [...] "Hard Head" [...] aircraft and BMEWS both dead, no nuclear detonation detected) that also matched that of a surprise conventional missile attack on Thule, leaving the unreliable submarine telecommunications cable between Thule and the US mainland as the only source of information to the contrary. A satellite communications link was set up in 1974.|$|E
500|$|In 1960, the USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) began Operation Chrome Dome, a Cold War <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> program {{devised by}} General Thomas S. Power to fly nuclear-armed Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers to {{the borders of}} the Soviet Union. The flights were {{scheduled}} to ensure that twelve bombers were aloft at all times. These bombers gave SAC offensive capability {{in the event of a}} Soviet first strike, [...] and provided a significant Cold War nuclear deterrent. Beginning in 1961, B-52 bombers also secretly flew as part of the [...] "Hard Head" [...] mission (or [...] "Thule Monitor Missions") over Thule Air Base. The objective of [...] "Hard Head" [...] was to maintain constant visual surveillance of the base's strategically important Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), which provided early warning of Soviet missile launches. If the communication link between North American Aerospace Defense Command and the base was severed, the aircraft crew could determine if the interruption resulted from an attack or a technical failure. The monitoring mission started when the designated aircraft reached a waypoint at [...] in Baffin Bay and entered a figure-eight holding pattern above the air base at an altitude of [...]|$|E
2500|$|SAC {{maintained}} the increased <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> until 21 November, when it {{returned to normal}} <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> posture and assumed DEFCON 3. [...] On 27 November SAC returned to normal ground alert posture.|$|E
50|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G Stratofortress {{from the}} 380th Strategic Aerospace Wing, Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York {{on a secret}} <b>airborne</b> nuclear <b>alert</b> crashed and burned on the ice near Thule Air Base. The impact detonated the high {{explosives}} in the primary units of {{all four of the}} B28 nuclear bombs it carried, but nuclear and thermonuclear reactions did not take place due to the PAL and fail-safe mechanisms in the weapons. More than 700 Danish civilians and US military personnel worked under hazardous conditions, the former without protective gear, to clean up the nuclear waste. In 1987, nearly 200 of the Danish workers tried unsuccessfully to sue the United States. Kaare Ulbak, chief consultant to the Danish National Institute of Radiation Hygiene, said Denmark had carefully studied the health of the Thule workers and found no evidence of increased mortality or cancer.|$|R
25|$|The Boeing EC-135 was {{a command}} and control version of the Boeing C-135 Stratolifter. During the Cold War, the EC-135 was best known for being {{modified}} to perform the Looking Glass mission where one EC-135 was always airborne 24 {{hours a day to}} serve as flying command post for the Strategic Air Command in the event of nuclear war. Various other EC-135 aircraft sat on <b>airborne</b> and ground <b>alert</b> throughout the Cold War, with the last EC-135C being retired in 1998. The EC-135N variant served as a tracking aircraft for the Apollo program.|$|R
2500|$|The {{division}} {{was formed to}} command four strategic wings that were formed in the Southeastern United States as part of SAC's program to disperse its B-52 force to minimize attrition from a possible Soviet first strike. [...] Once the division's wings were organized and equipped, they maintained {{a portion of their}} aircraft on <b>airborne</b> and ground <b>alert.</b> [...] During the Cuban Missile Crisis, all combat aircraft of the division were placed on increased alert status. [...] In addition to its SAC mission, the division's wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida was involved in testing armament for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.|$|R
2500|$|On 20 October 1962, at {{the start}} of the Cuban Missile Crisis, each of the division's wings were {{directed}} to put two additional B-52s on alert. [...] Two days later 1/8 of the B-52s were placed on <b>airborne</b> <b>alert.</b> [...] Additional division KC-135s were placed on alert to replace KC-135s devoted to maintaining the increased B-52 bomber force on <b>airborne</b> <b>alert.</b> [...] On 24 October SAC went to DEFCON 2, placing all aircraft on alert. [...] This posture was maintained until 21 November, when SAC returned to its normal <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> status and assumed DEFCON 3, but the 822d maintained an increased number of bombers and tankers on ground alert for another week.|$|E
2500|$|Cold War {{tensions}} between the United States and Russia {{came to a head}} in October 1962. [...] President John F. Kennedy informed the American public that the Soviet Union had installed missile sites in Cuba from which it could strike the United States. As a result, SAC canceled flying training and increased the size of its ground and <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> forces. The wing launched four B-52s on Chrome Dome and Hard Head VI missions, established the Loring Tanker Task Force, and aircraft not supporting <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> were put on ground alert. [...] During the Cuban Missile Crisis, wing bombers flew 132 <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> missions and its tankers flew 214 air refueling missions, transferring almost 24 million pounds of fuel to the B-52s.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 October all the division's B-52 units {{except the}} 19th Wing were {{directed}} to put two additional aircraft on alert. [...] On 22 October 1/8 of the B-52s were placed on <b>airborne</b> <b>alert.</b> Additional KC-135 were placed on alert to replace KC-135s devoted to maintaining the B-52 bomber force on <b>airborne</b> <b>alert.</b> On 24 October SAC went to DEFCON 2, placing all aircraft on alert. They remained in this state until 21 November, when SAC returned to its normal <b>airborne</b> <b>alert</b> posture and went to DEFCON 3. The dispersed B-47s and their supporting tankers were recalled on 24 November. On 27 November SAC returned to normal alert posture and began coordinating the return of its Florida aircraft to their home bases.|$|E
50|$|After {{successfully}} {{demonstrating the}} ALCS could launch a Minuteman ICBM from the air, ALCS achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) on 31 May 1967. From that point on, <b>airborne</b> missileers stood <b>alert</b> with ALCS-capable EC-135 aircraft for several decades. Over the years, ALCS operations were adapted {{in order to}} ensure the most effective use of this survivable ICBM launch capability. With ALCS now standing alert around-the-clock, the Soviets could no longer successfully launch a Minuteman LCC decapitation strike. Even if the Soviets attempted to do so, EC-135s equipped with the ALCS could fly overhead and launch the remaining Minuteman ICBMs in retaliation.|$|R
50|$|In September 1994, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment {{along with}} the rest of the 82d <b>Airborne</b> Division was <b>alerted</b> as part of Operation Restore Democracy. The 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment was {{scheduled}} to make a combat parachute jump, in order to help oust the military-led dictatorship and restore the democratically elected president, although Haiti had never had democracy in any form. The Division's first wave was in the air, with the 505th PIR loaded on aircraft awaiting takeoff, when the Haitian military dictator, upon learning the 82nd Airborne was on the way, agreed to step down and averted the invasion.|$|R
