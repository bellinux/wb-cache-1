40|$|<b>A</b> <b>controlled</b> {{language}} is <b>a</b> subset {{of a natural}} language with artificially restricted vocabulary, grammar, and style. Texts written in <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> language are usually less complex and less ambiguous than those written in an uncontrolled language. The use of <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> language therefore produces better results in machine translation. On the other hand, <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> language reduces the power of expression and decreases the writing speed. In short, <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> language brings out the maximum performance of machine translation systems {{at the cost of}} the burden on source text authors. So the controlled lan-guage approach is suitable for translation for dissemina-tion of information. And <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> language becomes more beneficial when texts are translated into multiple target languages...|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local water mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions.
