30|$|Bioinformatics tools, like {{molecular}} docking experiments, which involve study {{and analysis of}} ligand-receptor interactions, play important role in identifying the molecular targets (receptors) for different ligands. We have periodically reviewed some such novel molecular targets for <b>antihyperlipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> research (Jain et al. 2010; Arya et al. 2014). It was thought worthwhile, to assess the interaction of compound LM- 1554, with few such molecular targets through, its in silico docking experiments and gain some insight on its probable mechanism of action. Six such molecular targets related to hyperlipidaemia were selected for this study. These were, Niemann Pick C 1 like 1 protein (NPC 1 L 1), ATP citrate lyase (ACL), C-reactive protein (CRP), lanosterol 14 α-demethylase (LDM), squalene synthase (SqS) and farnesiod X-receptor (FXR). The X-ray crystal structures of these targets complexed with their respective co-crystallized native ligands were available from the RSCB-Protein Data Bank (PDB).|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of acute-onset, {{long-lasting}} cholestasis induced by atorvastatin. This <b>antihyperlipidaemic</b> <b>drug</b> was taken for 40 days by a 72 -year-old male {{as a treatment for}} his mixed dyslipidaemia. At that point, the patient presented with asthenia, nausea, painless icterus, acholic stools and hyperchromic urine with biochemical analyses showing a dramatic increase in bilirubin (total bilirubin 22 mg/dL; direct bilirubin 21 mg/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (up to 4 -fold over the normal level) with less marked increases in transaminases. Liver histology showed a pattern of cholestasis with evident signs of cholangiolitis and damage of the interlobular bile ducts. Serum transaminase and bilirubin levels returned to normal within 5 months after atorvastatin withdrawal while alkaline phosphatase normalized after only 8 months. Scores on both the Maria and Victorino clinical scale for the diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis and the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale indicated that atorvastatin was the probable cause of prolonged cholestasis in this patient. This is a rare case of cholestasis probably caused by atorvastatin and unusually characterized by bile duct damage...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} carried out on the effect of Solanum macrocarpum, α-Solanidine (a glycoalkaloid found in the Solanaceae), three <b>antihyperlipidaemic</b> <b>drugs</b> (nicotinic aid, simvastin and cholestyramine) on forty two (42) male rats made hyperlipidaemic by {{treating}} them with 400 mg/kg triton-X for 7 days. The rats were divided into 7 groups of 6 rats each. At 24 h, 48 h and 72 h respectively, the rats in each group were humanely sacrificed and blood samples collected for endocrine function analysis which included thyroid hormones (thyroxine or T 4, 3, 5, 3 – triiodothyronine or T 3 and thyroid stimulating hormone or TSH), sex hormones (testosterone and 17 β oestradiol) and the pancreatic hormone, insulin. Changes in T 3, T 4, oestradiol, testosterone and insulin were significant (p 0. 05) throughout the period of study. For the extract, T 3 significantly increased (p< 0. 05) from 0. 60 ± 0. 14 ng/mL to 0. 65 ± 0. 13 ng/mL and then decreased to 0. 55 ± 0. 21 ng/mL at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h respectively. For α-Solanidine and the three hypolipidaemic drugs, T 3 values were too small to be measured i. e. < 0. 20 ng/mL. For the extract, T 4 significantly increased (P< 0. 05) from 3. 60 ± 0. 5 µg/dL to 4. 30 ± 0. 43 µg/dL and then decrease...|$|R
