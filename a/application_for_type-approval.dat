40|$|The {{objective}} of our measurements {{was to determine}} the most important properties of the TBK bio-diesel with relevance to ICE use and to evaluate its effects on the power output, fuel consumption, exhaust emissions of a CI engine in comparison with commercial diesel fuel. Thus the standardized diesel fuel was used as reference fuel, and it was compared with the newly developed biofuel called TBK. Based on our measurements its most important physical and chemical properties and its effects on combustion and exhaust gas emissions in ICE are presented in detail. Emissions mean on the one hand components which are regulated in the emission directives of the European Union <b>for</b> <b>type-approval</b> of vehicles or engines, and on the other hand, a detailed analysis of hydrocarbons. The evaluation was {{made on the basis of}} engine test bench measurements realized on a city bus engine typical for the Hungarian bus fleet.

40|$|The European Commission Regulations No 692 / 2008 and No 715 / 2007 set the {{regulatory}} framework <b>for</b> <b>type-approval</b> of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 / 6). However, these regulations leave open some issues regarding the Euro 6 emission standards to be addressed and defined before the entry into force of these pieces of legislation. Among them, the Type I test particle number limit for vehicles equipped with Positive Ignition Direct Injection engines should be defined. The Joint Research Centre has carried out a study to support a possible implementation of such a limit for Euro 6 petrol vehicles. The {{first part of this}} report provides a review of the particle mass and number emissions of gasoline Port Fuel Injection (PFI) and Gasoline Direct Injection (G-DI) vehicles available in the literature. Over the second part, the particle mass and number emissions from a range of Euro 4 and Euro 5 gasoline vehicle/engine technology measured at JRC are synopsized. The vehicles have been tested over various driving cycles and ambient temperature conditions according to the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP) methodology. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission Regulations No 692 / 2008 and No 715 / 2007 set the {{regulatory}} framework <b>for</b> <b>type-approval</b> of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 / 6). One of the applicable tests is the low temperature emission test (Type VI), which is conducted at sub-ambient temperature conditions (- 7 °C). The low temperature emission test is currently required only for vehicles with positive ignition engines. However the Type VI test to diesel vehicles is under consideration, {{mainly because of the}} introduction of the new technologies in diesel engines in order to comply with the Euro 5 / 6 emission standards, of which the efficiency in controlling emission may strongly depend on the ambient temperature. This is especially true for Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems and after-treatment systems for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) that are deactivated or not operate in cold weather conditions, may result in elevated NOx emissions. The review should consider whether to extend the low temperature emission test to Euro 6 diesel vehicles and whether emission limit should be introduced in the future. This report provides a picture of the low temperature emission performances of late technology diesel vehicles The main results of the experimental activity carried out at JRC to investigate the behaviour at low temperature of Euro 5 / 6 diesel passenger cars are summarised and discussed.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} CO 2 and {{regulated}} pollutants (NOx, HC, CO, PM) emitted by eight Euro 4 - 6 gasoline and diesel vehicles with six different technologies. The emission factors were repeatedly {{measured on a}} chassis dynamometer bench using Artemis Urban with cold and hot start, Road and Motorway, WLTC and NEDC driving conditions. The influence of driving conditions and approved driving cycles on pollutant emissions was also investigated. The measured emission factors for regulated compounds were compared to the corresponding emission factors of the COPCETE emission model developed by the French Ministry of Ecology. The {{results indicate that the}} NEDC cycle, used <b>for</b> <b>type-approval</b> of emissions of regulated compounds, leads to underestimation of CO 2 (9 - 23 %) and NOx (1. 2 to 2 times) emissions and overestimation of CO and HC (2 to 5 times) in relation to the Artemis cycles, which are real-world simulation driving cycles. The WLTC cycle for the worldwide harmonization of vehicle emissions shows similar HC, NOx and CO emissions with the Artemis average cycle within uncertainty of the measurements. The NOx emissions measured were 1. 6 to 8 times greater than the type-approval limits. These high NOx emissions produced by all the diesel vehicles tested under real-world driving conditions could serve as particle precursors and increase secondary organic aerosol formation. They are also indicative of the significant cause for concern regarding urban air quality and the increase in the portion of Euro 5 and 6 diesel vehicles in France's vehicle fleet. Regarding emission factor assessments, the emission levels measured are overall in fair agreement with the COPCETE predictions within uncertainties for CO 2 and regulated pollutants. Updating the database is vital {{in order to be able}} to produce more representative emission factors and better evaluate the health and environmental effects from vehicle emissions...|$|R
