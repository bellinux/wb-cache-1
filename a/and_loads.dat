5|$|Although {{overall the}} shape of Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different. Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right, <b>and</b> <b>loads</b> Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000kg of new material every second. Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of sulfur dioxide, {{a major part of}} which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, producing ions of sulfur and oxygen: S+, O+, S2+ and O2+. These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus: a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit. The plasma temperature within the torus is 10–100eV (100,000–1,000,000K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10keV (100millionK). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation. The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, <b>and</b> <b>loads</b> could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E

25|$|PCNA loading is {{accomplished}} by the replication factor C (RFC) complex. The RFC complex is composed of five ATPases: Rfc1, Rfc2, Rfc3, Rfc4 and Rfc5. RFC recognizes primer-template junctions <b>and</b> <b>loads</b> PCNA at these sites. The PCNA homotrimer is opened by RFC by ATP hydrolysis and is then loaded onto DNA in the proper orientation to facilitate its association with the polymerase. Clamp loaders can also unload PCNA from DNA; a mechanism needed when replication must be terminated.|$|E
25|$|When {{assessing}} rated amplifier power output, it {{is useful}} to consider the applied load, the signal type (e.g., speech or music), required power output duration (i.e., short-time or continuous), and required dynamic range (e.g., recorded or live audio). In high-powered audio applications that require long cables to the load (e.g., cinemas and shopping centres) it may be more efficient to connect to the load at line output voltage, with matching transformers at source <b>and</b> <b>loads.</b> This avoids long runs of heavy speaker cables.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the influences of <b>load</b> carriage <b>and</b> muscular fatigue on ground reaction forces <b>and</b> ground reaction <b>loading</b> rates during walking. Eighteen healthy males performed the following tasks in order: unloaded <b>and</b> unfatigued walking, <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> unfatigued walking, fatiguing exercise, <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> fatigued walking, and unloaded and fatigued walking. The fatiguing exercise consisted of a series of metered step-ups and heel raises with a 16 -kg rucksack. Loaded walking tasks were performed with a 32 -kg rucksack. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variances were used to determine the effects of fatigue <b>and</b> <b>load</b> carriage on ground reaction forces <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> rates. Muscular fatigue has a significant influence on peak vertical ground reaction force <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> rate (p 3 ̆c 0. 01).

25|$|The Romanesque House is an {{impressive}} piece of evidence of a former grange of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in Halle, Naumburg, Jena and Erfurt. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As {{a result of its}} aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts <b>and</b> <b>loads</b> through the margraviates of Meissen and Lower Lusatia – and thus to Silesia – without being charged taxes or dues.|$|E
25|$|Download {{and execute}} {{is a type}} of remote shellcode that {{downloads}} and executes some form of malware on the target system. This type of shellcode does not spawn a shell, but rather instructs the machine to download a certain executable file off the network, save it to disk and execute it. Nowadays, it is commonly used in drive-by download attacks, where a victim visits a malicious webpage that in turn attempts to run such a download and execute shellcode in order to install software on the victim's machine. A variation of this type of shellcode downloads <b>and</b> <b>loads</b> a library. Advantages of this technique are that the code can be smaller, that it does not require the shellcode to spawn a new process on the target system, and that the shellcode does not need code to clean up the targeted process as this can be done by the library loaded into the process.|$|E

25|$|Another problem {{commonly}} {{faced by}} narrow-gauge railways {{was that they}} lack the physical space to grow: their cheap construction meant they were engineered only for their initial traffic demands. While a standard or broad gauge railway can be more easily be upgraded to handle heavier, faster traffic, many narrow-gauge railways were impractical to improve. Speeds <b>and</b> <b>loads</b> hauled could not increase, so traffic density was significantly limited. In the case of Queensland, Australia, the Queensland Rail passenger network has nearly reached its capacity due to the narrow gauge and an ever-increasing population, as such, new lines are to be built, thus negating the original cost savings. In Japan, a few narrow gauge lines have been upgraded to standard gauge mini-shinkansen to allow through service by standard gauge high-speed vehicles, but due to the alignment of those lines and minimum curve radius of those lines, the maximum speed of those through service {{is still the same}} as the original narrow-gauge rail line.|$|E
25|$|LoADS {{proposed}} placing one interceptor {{in one of}} the decoy shelters, thus every set of 23 shelters {{would have}} one MX, one LoADS and 21 decoys. At first glance it might appear that only one additional enemy warhead would be needed, using up the LoADS interceptor. However, only the defender knew where the MX was, <b>and</b> <b>LoADS</b> would only fire at the single warhead seen approaching that shelter. That meant that the MX would almost definitely survive a single warhead attack. In order to be sure the MX was hit, the Soviets would have to attack every shelter with two warheads, assuming one would be lost to the LoADS. For a typical 23-site MPS, 46 warheads would be needed, so if LoADS remained within the 100-interceptor limit of the ABM treaty, 4,600 warheads would be needed to attack just one-half of the 200-strong MX fleet, leaving 100 missiles and 1,000 warheads in the US counterattack. An attack against the entire fleet would require them to break the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks limits on the number of offensive warheads.|$|E
25|$|The {{intravenous}} tubing {{leads to}} a room next to the execution chamber, usually separated from the condemned by a curtain or wall. Typically, a prison employee trained in venipuncture inserts the needle, while a second prison employee orders, prepares, <b>and</b> <b>loads</b> the drugs into the lethal injection syringes. Two other staff members take {{each of the three}} syringes and secure them into the IVs. After the curtain is opened to allow the witnesses to see inside the chamber, the condemned person is then permitted to make a final statement. Following this, the warden signals that the execution may commence, and the executioner(s) (either prison staff or private citizens depending on the jurisdiction) then manually inject the three drugs in sequence. During the execution, the condemned's cardiac rhythm is monitored. Death is pronounced after cardiac activity stops. Death usually occurs within seven minutes, although, due to complications in finding a suitable vein, the whole procedure can take up to two hours, {{as was the case with}} the execution of Christopher Newton on May 24, 2007. According to state law, if a physician's participation in the execution is prohibited for reasons of medical ethics, then the death ruling can be made by the state medical examiner's office. After confirmation that death has occurred, a coroner signs the condemned's death certificate.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of the film released in some countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, differs. Instead of a pitch, the films are connected {{by a group of}} three teenagers searching for the most banned film in the world, Movie 43, which will ultimately lead to the destruction of civilization. Calvin Cutler (Mark L. Young) and his friend J.J. (Adam Cagley) make a video in the style of MTV's Jackass and upload it on YouTube where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an April Fool's prank from Calvin's younger brother Baxter (Devin Eash), who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on Google, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop <b>and</b> <b>loads</b> it with viruses from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the Internet. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich (Fisher Stevens) and a group of Chinese mobsters (Tim Chou and James Hsu) who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder (Nate Hartley), film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be left to ruins. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only Movie 43, which turns out to involve Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended. As Calvin finishes ruining Baxter's laptop, their mother (Beth Littleford) enters, wearing the same shirt and shorts that the woman in the strip tease video wore, causing Calvin to flip out after realizing that he had masturbated to a video of his mother. He also has visions, and finds semen from his erect crotch on his hand causing him to stare at his hand in shock and horror. Afterward, a deadly earthquake rumbles and mankind is lost. However, a few years later the only survivor, a crippled Calvin, finds Baxter's laptop still working despite viral infections. He watches the last remaining skits on the laptop. This version of the film was released in the U.S. as part of the Blu-ray Disc of Movie 43 as an unrated alternate cut of the film.|$|E
