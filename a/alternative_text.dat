6000|$|This {{edition of}} his [...] "Poetical Works" [...] {{contains}} all Shelley's ascertained poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto appeared in print. In preparing the volume I have worked {{as far as possible}} on the principle of recognizing the editio princeps as the primary textual authority. I have not been content to reprint Mrs. Shelley's recension of 1839, or that of any subsequent editor of the [...] "Poems". The present text {{is the result of a}} fresh collation of the early editions; and in every material instance of departure from the wording of those originals the rejected reading has been subjoined in a footnote. Again, wherever--as in the case of [...] "Julian and Maddalo"--there has appeared to be good reason for superseding the authority of the editio princeps, the fact is announced, and the substituted exemplar indicated, in the Prefatory Note. in the case of a few pieces extant in two or more versions of debatable authority the <b>alternative</b> <b>text</b> or texts will be found at the [end] of the [relevant work]; but it may be said once for all that this does not pretend to be a variorum edition, in the proper sense of the term--the textual apparatus does not claim to be exhaustive. Thus I have not thought it necessary to cumber the footnotes with every minute grammatical correction introduced by Mrs. Shelley, apparently on her own authority, into the texts of 1839; nor has it come within the scheme of this edition to record every conjectural emendation adopted or proposed by Rossetti and others in recent times. But it is hoped that, up to and including the editions of 1839 at least, no important variation of the text has been overlooked. Whenever a reading has been adopted on manuscript authority, a reference to the particular source has been added below.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{people who}} cannot see non-textual web content, such as images, maps or audio files, the <b>alternative</b> <b>texts</b> {{are crucial to}} un-derstand and use the content. Alternate texts are often {{automatically}} generated by web publishing software or not properly provided {{by the author of}} the content. Such texts may impose web accessibility barriers. Automatic accessibility checkers in use today can only detect the pres-ence of <b>alternative</b> <b>texts,</b> but not determine if the text is describing the corresponding content in any useful way. This paper presents a pattern recognition approach for automatic detection of <b>alternative</b> <b>texts</b> that may impose a barrier, reaching an accuracy of more then 90 %. ...|$|R
