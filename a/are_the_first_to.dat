5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be conquered.|$|E
5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second Opium War <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese {{had to be taken}} first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, NECA {{released}} {{the first wave}} of highly detailed human and alien action figures from the respective film. NECA's Reel Toys worked directly with actors from the Alien franchise to release realistic figures based on select characters they portrayed in the films. NECA has released seven-inch figures based on characters such as Corporal Hicks, Private Hudson and Bishop. During winter 2014, it was announced there would be multiple figures of Ripley, Sigourney Weaver’s character from the Alien films. NECA worked directly with Weaver to develop these action figures, which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> feature her likeness.|$|E
50|$|HHCL was {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} <b>firsts</b> in <b>the</b> UK advertising industry. As a major ad agency, they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> offer above <b>the</b> line, below the line and PR. They were online by 1993 and <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> give mobile phones to their staff in 1994. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> embrace hot desking and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> use project teams to create work. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> create an in house TV Show and employ a futurologist and a Shaman.|$|R
50|$|The agency {{also created}} several {{advertising}} <b>firsts.</b> They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> run two different ads concurrently on different channels, for First Direct in 1989. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> advertise on <b>the</b> back of Tube tickets, for Mercury Communications in 1992. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> create a TV ad that viewers needed to record and play back slowly, for Mazda in 1994. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> place a web address on a commercial, for Tango in 1994 and they revolutionised sponsorship idents by using dialogue and live action for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time for Tango's sponsorship of The Word in 1994.|$|R
25|$|Gerhard Herzberg <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{actually}} observe <b>the</b> {{spectrum of}} neutral H3, and this triatomic molecule <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> have a Rydberg spectrum measured where its own ground state was unstable.|$|R
5|$|Other {{threats to}} {{elephants}} include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives {{in areas with}} some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and {{laborious}} study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{archives}} {{are housed}} in a building south of and connected to the main building, which also contains NARA facilities. The Clinton archives <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> include electronic information along with physical documents. The total amount of records is , {{the most of any}} presidential archive. Because Clinton wanted a light-filled library, the archives are kept underground to protect them from damage from ultraviolet degradation.|$|E
50|$|Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali (أبو الأسود الدؤلي) (ca. 603CE/16BH - 688 or 689CE/69AH) {{was a close}} {{companion}} of Ali ibn Abi Talib and an arab grammarian. He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> place consonant-pointing and vowel-pointing (markings) on Arabic letters to clearly identify them. He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> write on Arabic linguistics, and <b>is</b> said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> write a book on Arabic grammar (nahw). Al-Du'ali educated many students.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Harper <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> debut <b>the</b> Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI) {{system in}} Michigan. Also in 2004, {{surgeons}} at Harper <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> perform a kidney transplant on an HIV recipient.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, C-COR {{introduced}} {{the use of}} integrated circuits in amplifiers used on utility poles and in 1969 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> use heat fins on amplifiers. In 1991, C-COR <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> introduce a 1 GHz amplifier.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the Varaha legend {{are found in the}} Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Shatapatha Brahmana. They narrate that the universe was filled with the primordial waters. The earth {{was the size of a}} hand and was trapped in it. The god Prajapati (the creator-god Brahma) in the form of a boar (varaha) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out. He also marries the earth thereafter. The Shatapatha Brahmana calls the boar as Emusha. The epic Ramayana and the Vishnu Purana - considered sometimes as the oldest of the Puranic scriptures - <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> associate Varaha with Vishnu. Various Puranic scriptures including the Agni Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, the Devi Bhagavata Purana, the Padma Purana, the Varaha Purana, the Vayu Purana and the Vishnu Purana narrate the legend of Varaha with some variations.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull, with ossification (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{prevents}} even hereditary {{peers who}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> hold their titles from sitting automatically in the House of Lords. The Government did agree, however, to give life peerages (the titles {{of which are}} indicated in parentheses) to four such new hereditary peers: Toby Low, 1st Baron Aldington (Baron Low), Frederick Erroll, 1st Baron Erroll of Hale (Baron Erroll of Kilmun), Francis Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, 1st Baron Pakenham (Baron Pakenham of Cowley) and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon (Baron Armstrong-Jones). Additionally, life peerages were created for former Leaders of the House of Lords: John Ganzoni, 2nd Baron Belstead (Baron Ganzoni), Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington (Baron Carington of Upton), Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne (Baron Gascoyne-Cecil), George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe (Baron Jellicoe of Southampton), Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd (Baron Shepherd of Spalding) and David Hennessy, 3rd Baron Windlesham (Baron Hennessy).|$|E

5|$|The area a pride {{occupies}} {{is called}} a pride area, whereas that by a nomad is a range. The males associated with a pride tend {{to stay on the}} fringes, patrolling their territory. Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride, and they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.|$|E
