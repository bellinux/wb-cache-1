Harmony in my Head often emphasizes B-sides, live bootlegs and other rarities, and nearly every episode has featured a song {{either by the}} Beastie Boys or British group The Fall.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E

40|$|Many {{research}} projects {{have demonstrated the}} benefits of bimanual interaction {{for a variety of}} tasks. When choosing bimanual input, system designers must select the input device that each hand will control. In this paper, we argue for the use of pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> two-handed input, <b>and</b> describe an experiment in which users were faster and committed fewer errors using pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> input in comparison to using either <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> or pen <b>and</b> pen input while performing a representative bimanual task. We present design principles and an application in which we applied our design rationale toward the creation of a learnable set of bimanual, pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> input commands.

Further {{television}} roles during these five years included women's football team coach John Dolan {{in the first two}} series of Kay Mellor's Playing the Field (appearing alongside his Cold Feet co-star John Thomson), investigative journalists Ryan and David Laney in Resurrection Man (Marc Evans, 1998) <b>and</b> <b>Touching</b> Evil II respectively, and womaniser Stanley in Women Talking Dirty (Coky Giedroyc, 1999).|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{opened the}} 2010 season {{at home against}} the Connecticut Huskies, the first ever meeting between the two schools. Michigan celebrated the re-dedication of Michigan Stadium with a special flyover by a World War II era B-25 bomber from the nearby Yankee Air Museum in Ypsilanti Township, and then another flyover {{immediately}} following the national anthem by two A-10 aircraft. Brock Mealer—the brother of Michigan guard Elliot Mealer—led the team onto the field by walking to the banner <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> it, which sparked a standing ovation from the crowd. Elliot Mealer had only recently regained the ability to walk following injuries in a car crash.|$|E
5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Current {{interfaces}} {{for common}} information visualizations such as bar graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots usually {{make use of}} the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and a Pointer) interface paradigm with its frequently discussed problems of multiple levels of indirection via cascading menus, dialog boxes, and control panels. Recent advances in interface capabilities such as the availability of pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> interaction challenge us to re-think this and investigate more direct access to both the visualizations and the data they portray. We conducted a Wizard of Oz study to explore applying pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> interaction to the creation of information visualization interfaces on interactive whiteboards without implementing a plethora of recognizers. Our wizard acted as a robust and flexible pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> recognizer, giving participants maximum freedom in how they interacted with the system. Based on our qualitative analysis of the interactions our participants used, we discuss our insights about pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> interactions in the context of learnability and the interplay between pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> gestures. We conclude with suggestions for designing pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> enabled interactive visualization interfaces. Index Terms—Pen <b>and</b> <b>touch,</b> interaction, Wizard of Oz, whiteboard, data exploration. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Abstract: Step <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> {{voltages}} play {{an important}} role when designing high voltage substation. Step <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> potentials near high voltage substation due to severe ground faults present a hazard to anyone in proximity to substation when a fault occurs. A primary issue of concern is hazardous step <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> voltage is that arise during fault situations, hence a reliable and efficient solution to the problem is essential. Although personnel safety is of primary concern, effect of electric current, resistance of the human body and tolerable voltage criteria considerations are also essential in the design system to ensure the protection of personnel and equipment. This study will briefly explain the significance of step <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> voltages...|$|R

5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which would either be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
5|$|The second type, {{triggered}} by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a 3D map and passing {{through all of}} a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a Chaos Emerald; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become Super Sonic at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles. Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a post-credits scene in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} the Royal Rumble match. Before the match, Kurt Angle stole Nunzio's {{entrance}} number and replaced {{him in the}} match. The participants divided into their brands and fought against each other, working together to eliminate Muhammad Hassan, the thirteen entrant. Scotty 2 Hotty, the fifteenth entrant, was attacked by Hassan during his entrance and never entered the match. Angle, the twentieth entrant, dominated upon entering until Shawn Michaels eliminated him. Angle came back to eliminate Michaels and attacked him. The final four participants remaining were Batista, United States Champion John Cena, Edge, and Rey Mysterio. Edge fought with Mysterio, executing a spear to eliminate Mysterio. Cena and Batista then eliminated Edge as he was attacking them. Cena tried to perform an FU on Batista but Batista countered. Batista then attempted a Batista Bomb but was countered with a headscissors takedown by Cena, sending both over the top rope <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> the floor at the same time. The referees for the Raw brand believed Batista to be the winner while the SmackDown! referees believed Cena to be winner. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon came to the ring, in the process legitimately tearing both his quadriceps muscles, and ordered the match to be restarted with the final two participants. Batista eliminated Cena following a Spinebuster to win the match.|$|E

40|$|Combined bimanual pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> {{input on}} digital tab-letops is an {{appealing}} interaction paradigm enjoying grow-ing popularity among many HCI researchers. Due to its relative novelty, its properties are still relatively unexplored and many hypotheses emerging from intuition and extrapo-lations from studies about <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> other pointing devices {{remain to be}} verified. We present an empirical evaluation consisting of three experiments aimed at investigating a few important issues of pen <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> interaction on horizontal surfaces. Specifically, we examine the compromise between speed and accuracy for the two input modalities in position-ing and tracing contexts, the influence of palm-resting on pen precision and bimanual coordination for pen mode-switching via postures.

25|$|The {{best known}} case of {{possible}} homosexuality in ancient Egypt {{is that of}} the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 24942345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other <b>and</b> <b>touching</b> their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.|$|E
