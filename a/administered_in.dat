5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may also cause the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment.

In particular, it enhances phagocytosis, {{the process by which}} macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have antitumour effects when <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> combination with a preparation of Propionibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested.

For example, a hypnotic <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> low doses produces anxiety-relieving effects, whereas a benzodiazepine marketed as an anti-anxiety drug at higher doses induces sleep.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Fairley tackled an {{outbreak}} of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered {{of their own accord}} but some cases of shigellosis became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug was administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E

5|$|However, after {{less than}} a month back in York, William died, on 8 June 1154, {{allegedly}} due to poison <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> the chalice at Mass. One of William's clerks accused Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York, of the murder, and Osbert was summoned before the king to be tried at the royal court. Before the trial could take place, however, Stephen died, and the trial never took place. William was buried in York Minster and within a few months of his death, miracles were attributed to his intervention and a sweet smell came from his tomb when it was damaged during a fire. Nor was the body decayed or burnt in the fire. Pope Honorius III then ordered an investigation into the miracles. In 1227, he was canonised in Rome by Pope Honorius III.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the adrenal gland may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E

5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> the form of a radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is <b>administered</b> <b>in</b> a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E
