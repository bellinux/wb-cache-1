5|$|In this {{conception}} of mind no strict distinction is {{made between the}} conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the five senses and sixth for perception of mental phenomena. The arising of cognitive <b>awareness</b> <b>is</b> said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (manovijñāna) and attention (āvartana), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.|$|E

Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their <b>awareness</b> <b>is</b> also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E

Although frequently used interchangeably without that being problematic, these words sometimes appear to have different intended meanings but those meanings are not made explicit or, despite the meanings having been made explicit, they are not adhered to. It is necessary to overcome obscurities when knowledge and <b>awareness</b> <b>are</b> intended to represent different domains. This occurs when they are compared with each other; it also occurs when knowledge and <b>awareness</b> <b>are</b> assessed separately in relation to such variables as health behavior; physical, psychological, or socioeconomic statuses; gender; age; and ethnic backgrounds. For those particular research ventures, recommendations are made that knowledge be {{used to refer to}} information that is, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, detailed and factual, and that <b>awareness</b> <b>be</b> associated with information that is personally relevant. Some suggestions are made, and issues are raised, about how the psychometric foundations for each of those two domains might be established prior to use in empirical research. Adopting the recommendations and suggestions made in this article provides opportunities for greater conceptual and empirical clarity and success...|$|R

5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious <b>awareness</b> <b>is</b> constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E

However, the incidence and effect of anesthesia techniques on awareness in generally healthy, non-critically ill patients during operations {{have yet to}} receive significant attention. This retrospective matched case-control study was conducted between January 2009 to December 2014. Surgical patients (ASA physical status I-III) whom reported intraoperative awareness during this study period were interviewed and their medical records were reviewed. The potential risk factors for <b>awareness</b> <b>were</b> compared with the non-case matched controls, who {{were randomly selected from}} the database.

Compared with the matched controls (n = 80), longer anesthesia time was associated with increased incidence of awareness (odds ratio 2. 04; 95 % CI 1. 30 - 3. 20, per hour increase). Perioperative use of muscle relaxant was also associated with increased incidence of awareness, while significantly lower incidence of <b>awareness</b> <b>was</b> found in patients who were anesthetized with volatile anesthetics. The overall incidence of <b>awareness</b> <b>was</b> 0. 023 % in the ASA≤ III surgical patients who received general anesthesia.

This study examined awareness using a multidimensional approach and applied cluster analytic techniques to identify associations between {{the level of}} awareness and other variables. Methods: Participants were 101 individuals with early-stage dementia (PwD) and their carers. Explicit <b>awareness</b> <b>was</b> assessed at 3 levels: performance monitoring in relation to memory, evaluative judgement in relation to memory, everyday activities and socio-emotional functioning, and metacognitive reflection {{in relation to the}} experience and impact of the condition. Implicit <b>awareness</b> <b>was</b> assessed with an emotional Stroop task. Results: Different measures of explicit <b>awareness</b> scores <b>were</b> related only to a limited extent. Cluster analysis yielded 3 groups with differing degrees of explicit awareness. These groups showed no differences in implicit awareness. Lower explicit <b>awareness</b> <b>was</b> associated with greater age, lower MMSE scores, poorer recall and naming scores,lower anxiety and greater carer stress. Conclusion: Multidi-mensional assessment offers a more robust approach toclassifying PwD according to level of awareness and hence to examining correlates and predictors of awareness...|$|R
