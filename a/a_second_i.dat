5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> glimpsed {{my mother}} and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's hand. I saw them {{disappear}} into the distance; my mother was stroking my sister's fair hair...and I did not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.|$|E
2500|$|According to Lower's account, [...] "...towards {{the end of}} February 1665 [...] {{selected}} one dog {{of medium}} size, opened its jugular vein, and drew off blood, until … its strength was nearly gone. Then, {{to make up for}} the great loss of this dog by the blood of <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> introduced blood from the cervical artery of a fairly large mastiff, which had been fastened alongside the first, until this latter animal showed … it was overfilled … by the inflowing blood." [...] After he [...] "sewed up the jugular veins," [...] the animal recovered [...] "with no sign of discomfort or of displeasure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm {{and he was}} flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios, landing {{by the time of}} a commercial break. After appearing on the show, Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who was [...] "shy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed that he was being open and honest. For <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> was tempted to ask for help...I needed to move on and find a better life for myself. Bart told me later that he tried to call me after the show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls." [...] Of Conner's sudden appearance on the show, Comăneci later commented in her memoir, [...] "There was nothing romantic about [...] motivation. It was based on his desire to help a young woman he'd met once who was an icon in our shared sport." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I {{want to make it}} clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If it was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost our faith in the police. Where were you when we needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E
2500|$|Hawking has {{estimated}} that he studied about a thousand hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, {{and he decided to}} answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) necessary. Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the oral to describe his future plans, he said, [...] "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive <b>a</b> <b>Second,</b> <b>I</b> shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First." [...] He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners [...] "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves". After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in natural science and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.|$|E
2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm; he was flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios and landed during a commercial break. After {{appearing on the}} show with Comăneci and Panait, Conner met with [...] Comăneci in the green room, later saying of the meeting:I think I can understand why Nadia said what she did ... She said, 'He (Panit) is my manager. We don't have a relationship, so it doesn't matter if he's married or not.' But it came off really awful. She regrets it, and I don't think she realized how misunderstood she would be. She really got burned. She said the Miami media was really not nice to her. Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who wasshy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed {{that he was being}} open and honest. For <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> was tempted to ask for help... I needed to move on and find a better life for myself. Bart told me later that he tried to call me after the show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls. Of Conner's sudden appearance on the show, Comăneci later commented in her memoir, [...] "There was nothing romantic about [...] motivation.

60|$|If {{you will}} put {{anything}} in his way, {{you will do}} it <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time, <b>I</b> am certain.|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (waving this aside). I didn't want to forget--not for <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't {{drowning}} my sorrow. I was hilariously celebrating.|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] added Mike, [...] "I shall get in {{next year}} all right. Half <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> just {{want to speak to}} Wyatt about something." ...|$|E
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> was too {{surprised}} {{to move or}} speak. The little girl uttered a piercing scream, and gathering her dolls in her arms huddled into {{a corner of the}} bench.|$|E
60|$|It was at {{this point}} that I felt the need of getting <b>a</b> <b>second</b> opinion. <b>I</b> pressed the bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not when I first fell; {{that was}} only <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> <b>I</b> know. But I must have lain there nearly ten minutes after I recovered." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the space}} of <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>I</b> did some tall thinking. The {{situation}} suddenly became grave. I saw the pennant for the Worcesters fading, dimming.|$|R
6000|$|CAMPBELL. It's Tom Goodall. I'll {{have him}} out of there in half <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> want you to take him home with you, Agnes. He's the best fellow in the world. Which is his berth? ...|$|E
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> {{thought he}} was going to run away. Then he jerked up his head, and rushed on towards the house. At the foot of the {{staircase}} he gripped me by the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|SYLVIA. I {{can only}} stop <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> was riding with the Fergusons and we passed your temple. I thought I'd just run {{in and see}} how you were. I haven't seen you for an age.|$|E
60|$|Leo was round it first, and I {{heard him}} utter an exclamation. In <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>I</b> reached his side, and lo! before us lay our Promised Land.|$|R
60|$|All this {{passed in}} <b>a</b> few <b>seconds.</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> drew her {{down into her}} chair, I was {{conscious}} of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in the room.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Judy wrote a novel, Eloise, {{which became}} a Sunday Times best seller. She had <b>a</b> <b>second</b> novel, <b>I</b> Do Not Sleep, {{published}} in 2015.|$|R
60|$|DR. FRYE (indicating GEORGE). As you see. He {{fell back}} on the {{cushions}} as though he'd been hit--it all happened in <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> have {{the history of the}} case from the army people--he had an attack something like this abroad.|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{with the}} shock of impact I {{reversed}} my engine, but my prow was wedged in the hole it had made in the battleship's stern. Only <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> hung there before tearing away, but that second was amply long to swarm my deck with black devils.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{have this}} trip planned out right," [...] he said regretfully. [...] "I {{ought to have}} got Mamie to come along. I bet a hundred dollars she would have got next to your {{meanings}} in <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> pass. What's your kick, anyway? What's all this about paper?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{rolled away}} {{out of sight}} in <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> and <b>I</b> stood appalled in an agony of {{distress}} and terror {{in the midst of the}} gallery.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>second</b> phase <b>I</b> study, in {{patients}} with a V600E mutation in B-Raf, ~80% showed partial to complete regression. The regression lasted from 2 to 18 months.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt that}} Jack {{glanced at me}} for the {{fraction}} of <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> But <b>I</b> remembered that Gus Sinclair was coming too, and I {{did not look at}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was so knocked silly for <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> couldn't do anything. The man marched out of {{the place}} and joined his friend just round the corner. Then they went so quick up Bullock Street that I couldn't catch them, though I ran round the bars to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is the Duchess of Shropshire! You know her; but not {{a minute}} is to be lost. There is such a noise, they will not hear. Are you afraid to stop here one instant by yourself? I shall not be out of sight, and not away <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> run very quick.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys!" [...] he said, [...] "listen to me <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> {{want to ask}} you something. What {{on earth}} do you think we came here for? Simply and solely because we can't bear to go on seeing you killed day after day, month after month, year after year. That's all, and it's Christ's truth. Amen!" ...|$|E
60|$|COADE: (with gentle regret). I {{have often}} thought, Coady, that if <b>I</b> had <b>a</b> <b>second</b> chance <b>I</b> {{should be a}} useful man instead of just a nice lazy one.|$|R
60|$|The {{folly of}} a man is a thing {{sometimes}} outside his own power of control. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> before <b>I</b> had been wondering of whom and {{what she had been}} thinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on a moment," [...] he cried, as Corliss made {{to come at}} him again. [...] "Just <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> If <b>I</b> lick you, {{will you}} come up the {{hillside}} with me?" ...|$|R
