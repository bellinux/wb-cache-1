5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the larger group Peracarida, which are united by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiation</b> in that environment.

5|$|Several highly {{successful}} insect groups—especially the Hymenoptera (wasps, bees and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies) {{as well as}} many types of Diptera (flies) and Coleoptera (beetles)—evolved in conjunction with flowering plants during the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago). The earliest bees, important pollinators today, appeared in the early Cretaceous. A group of wasps sister to the bees evolved {{at the same time as}} flowering plants, as did the Lepidoptera.

40|$|Diversity is a fundamental, yet threatened, {{property}} of ecological systems. The idea that diversity can itself favour diversification, in an autocatalytic process, is very appealing but remains controversial. Here, we study a generalized model of ecological communities and investigate how {{the level of}} initial diversity influences the possibility of evolutionary diversification. We show that even simple models of intra- and inter-specific ecological interactions can predict a positive effect of diversity on diversification: <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiations</b> may require a threshold number of species before kicking-off.

Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous, as are the first true mantis shrimp. In the Decapoda, prawns and polychelids appear in the Triassic, and shrimp and crabs appear in the Jurassic; however, the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous, particularly in crabs, {{and may have been}} driven by the <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiation</b> of their main predators, bony fish.

5|$|Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a {{paper in}} 1954 on the {{importance}} of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiation.</b> He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species; {{it has been argued that}} contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} {{primates}} (euprimates) {{do not appear}} in the fossil record until the early Eocene (~55mya), at which point they radiated across the Northern Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. These first primates included Cantius, Donrussellia, Altanius, and Teilhardina on the northern continents, as well as the more questionable (and fragmentary) fossil Altiatlasius from Paleocene Africa. These earliest fossil primates are often divided into two groups, adapiforms (sometimes called adapids, or adapoids) and omomyiforms (or omomyids—suspected relatives of tarsiers). Both appeared suddenly in the fossil record without transitional forms to indicate ancestry, and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout the Eocene. Although few fossils of extant primate groups—lemuriforms, tarsiers, or simians—are known from the Early to Middle Eocene, evidence from genetics and newer fossil finds suggest they may have been present during this early <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiation.</b> The divergence between strepsirrhines, simians, and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after primates first evolved.|$|E

40|$|Explosive" <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiations</b> on islands remain one of {{the most}} puzzling {{evolutionary}} phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such radiations remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island radiations suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian Schiedea. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiations...</b>|$|R

5|$|The largest {{terrestrial}} lizard of {{the archipelago}} of Puerto Rico is the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). A subspecies of the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta), it is endemic to Mona Island, {{located in the}} Mona Passage between the main island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Another Cyclura species of similar size, the Anegada ground iguana (Cyclura pinguis), once occurred in the archipelago but it became extirpated due to predation by dogs, cats, and humans, habitat destruction, and competition from goats and pigs, and is now restricted to Anegada. The most common lizard in Puerto Rico is the sharp-mouthed lizard (Anolis pulchellus). The Anolis lizards of Puerto Rico, and the Greater Antilles in general, represent an interesting case of <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiation.</b> Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles are {{more closely related to}} other species within the same island than to species of adjacent islands. Surprisingly, even though species divergence occurred independently on each island, the same set of ecomorphs (habitat specialists) have evolved on each island.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} animal-pollinated {{flowers were}} shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established {{before the first}} appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or {{on the underside of}} their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiation</b> of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} of fossil and living crocodylians {{allow us to}} compare the taxonomic, geographic, and temporal distributions of morpholog-ical features, such as snout shapes. A few basic snout morphotypes—generalized, blunt, slender, deep, and excessively broad (‘‘duck-faced’’) —occur multiple times in distantly-related lineages. Some clades—especially {{those found in the}} Northern Hemisphere or with minimum origination dates in the Cretaceous or lower Ter-tiary—are morphologically uniform, but geographically widespread; crocodylian faunas of the early Tertiary tend to be composite, with sympatric taxa being dis-tantly related, and similar-looking taxa on different continents being close relatives. In contrast, crocodylian faunas of the later Tertiary tend to be more endemic, with local <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiations</b> occurring in Africa and Australia containing members of most basic snout shapes. Endemic radiations in Africa and Australia have largely been replaced by Crocodylus, which can be divided into subclades that may indi-vidually represent endemic <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiations...</b>|$|R

25|$|The genus Calisto {{also shows}} a {{distinctive}} radiation in the Caribbean, {{where it is}} the only representative of the Satyrinae.

40|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>radiations</b> often {{follow the}} {{evolution}} of key traits, such as {{the origin of the}} amniotic egg and the subsequent radiation of terrestrial vertebrates. The mechanism by which a species determines the sex of its offspring has been linked to critical ecological and life-history traits(1 - 3) but not to major <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiations,</b> in part because sex-determining mechanisms do not fossilize. Here we establish a previously unknown coevolutionary relationship in 94 amniote species between sex-determining mechanism and whether a species bears live young or lays eggs. We use that relationship to predict the sex-determining mechanism in three independent lineages of extinct Mesozoic marine reptiles (mosasaurs, sauropterygians and ichthyosaurs), each of which is known from fossils to have evolved live birth(4 - 7). Our results indicate that each lineage evolved genotypic sex determination before acquiring live birth. This enabled their pelagic radiations, where the relatively stable temperatures of the open ocean constrain temperature-dependent sex determination in amniote species. Freed from the need to move and nest on land(4, 5, 8), extreme physical adaptations to a pelagic lifestyle evolved in each group, such as the fluked tails, dorsal fins and wing-shaped limbs of ichthyosaurs. With the inclusion of ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs and sauropterygians, genotypic sex determination is present in all known fully pelagic amniote groups (sea snakes, sirenians and cetaceans), suggesting that this mode of sex determination and the subsequent evolution of live birth are key traits required for marine <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiations</b> in amniote lineages...|$|R

25|$|All of {{the native}} Drosophila and Scaptomyza species in Hawaii have {{apparently}} descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands, probably 20 million years ago.

40|$|The {{diversification}} of neoavian birds {{is one of}} the most rapid <b>adaptive</b> <b>radiations</b> of extant organisms. Recent whole-genome sequence analyses have much improved the resolution of the neoavian radiation and suggest concurrence with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, yet the causes of the remaining genome-level irresolvabilities appear unclear. Here we show that genome-level analyses of 2, 118 retrotransposon presence/absence markers converge at a largely consistent Neoaves phylogeny and detect a highly differential temporal prevalence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), i. e., the persistence of ancestral genetic variation as polymorphisms during speciation events. We found that ILS-derived incongruences are spread over the genome and involve 35 % and 34 % of the analyzed loci on the autosomes and the Z chromosome, respectively.
