Sextus Empiricus <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan described Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens {{collected in}} Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip. He noted {{its lack of}} spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii, and hence <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a distinct and separate species. Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming and gave it the combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964.|$|E

In Dowling v Chicago Options Associates, Inc, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that preemptive retainers used by attorneys were acceptable arrangements with clients.|$|E

Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} {{proposal was}} presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It {{became clear that}} Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbours to {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line. Also, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans, and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area.|$|E

5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} minicomputer at the station. NDRE <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk by buying the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in part because of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology and in part because NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new minicomputer, SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W.

He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
5|$|Janey's {{relationship}} with Rossetti had continued, {{and by the}} late 1860s gossip regarding their affair had spread about London, where they were regularly seen spending time together. Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> likely that Morris had learned of and accepted the existence of their affair by 1870. In this year he developed an affectionate friendship with Aglaia Coronie, the daughter of wealthy Greek refugees, {{although there is no}} evidence that they had an affair. Meanwhile, Morris's {{relationship with}} his mother had improved, and he would regularly take his wife and children to visit her at her house in Leyton. He also went on various holidays; in the summer of 1866 he, Webb, and Taylor toured the churches of northern France.|$|E

5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E
5|$|The DPP <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{never the}} {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security {{and that they were}} allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E
5|$|The {{essay was}} {{extensively}} {{discussed in the}} media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipal}} council voted on 17 February 2011 {{to purchase the}} stadium. The strongest proponents were the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, while three parties, the Progress Party, the Liberal Party and Red Party, voted against. The proponents argued that municipality was purchasing the venue with a much higher value than what they had sold, while the opponents <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not the municipality's responsibility to give financial first-aid to a professional sports club. The cost was NOK16 million, paid for by taking over debt. After taking over the stadium company, the municipality merged it with Bodø Spektrum, which runs an indoor sports complex, including Nordlandshallen. This allows the debt to {{be taken over by}} the municipality without interfering with the municipal accounts.|$|E
5|$|While the Lithuanian side {{considered}} {{the agreement to}} be an enforceable political treaty, the Polish side considered {{it to be a}} minor military agreement, later superseded by a ceasefire agreement between Lithuania and Żeligowski reached on November 29. American historian Alfred Erich Senn has <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a regular political treaty, as it did not require ratification, but the presence of political representatives of both sides indicated {{that it was not a}} mere military agreement. Poland and Lithuania also disagreed about the agreement's relation to the Vilnius question, which was not explicitly addressed in the treaty. The Lithuanian side considered that the agreement assigned Vilnius to Lithuania, while the Polish side argued that it did not concern Vilnius or other territorial claims. Senn has described the agreement as tacitly leaving Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} {{plans to}} connect the Sognsvann Line to the Grorud Line with a new Ring Line. The company also considered building the ring {{as part of the}} tramway, and have combined operation with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher investment costs with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen.

5|$|In {{a series}} of {{published}} and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, J.E.S. Thompson, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis. Whorf <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> exactly the reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within {{the elements of the}} specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by Yuri Knorozov's syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Nordreisa Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to change the}} airport's name from Sørkjosen to Nordreisa. They <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to use the Nordreisa name to market {{the region as a}} tourist destination. The application was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that airports were required by regulation to be named after a settlement rather than a municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. This required the terminal to be slightly rebuilt; while it previously had a common departure and arrivals hall, it had to be separated into two areas. The municipality therefore decided to transfer the ownership of the ground handling service to the three employees. Avinor carried out a major upgrade to the runway safety area and landing lights in 2008 and 2009. The investments cost NOK40 million. The expansion of the safety area resulted in part of the lot of Birkelund Sawmill being expropriated.|$|E
