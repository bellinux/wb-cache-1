40|$|We {{consider}} conditions {{necessary for}} a successful implementation of so-called assisted inflation. We generalize the applicability of assisted inflation beyond exponential potentials as originally proposed to include standard chaotic (λφ 4 or m 2 φ 2) models as well. We also demonstrate that in a purely 4 -dimensional theory, unless the <b>assisted</b> <b>sector</b> is in fact decoupled, the additional fields of the <b>assisted</b> <b>sector</b> actually impede inflation. As a specific example of an <b>assisted</b> <b>sector,</b> we consider a 5 -dimensional KK model for which the extra dimension may be somewhat or {{much larger than the}} inverse Planck scale. In this case, the <b>assisted</b> <b>sector</b> (coming from a KK compactification) eliminates the need for a fine-tuned quartic coupling to drive chaotic inflation. This is a general result of models with one or more “large ” extra dimensions...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of the large initial field values in chaotic {{inflation}} and propose a remedy in the framework of the so-called assisted inflation. We demonstrate that a 4 -dimensional theory of multiple, scalar fields with initial field values considerably below the Planck scale, can give rise to inflation even though none of the individual scalar fields are capable of driving inflation. The problems arising from the presence of possible non-renormalizable interactions is therefore removed. As a concrete example of a theory with multiple scalar fields, we consider a (4 + d) -dimensional field theory of a single, noninteracting massive scalar field whose KK modes play the role of the <b>assisted</b> <b>sector.</b> For the KK modes to assist inflation, the extra dimensions must have a size larger than the inverse (4 D) Planck scale...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} the agricultural policies that Zimbabwe uses to ensure food security and how national efforts affect the future scenarios of regional food security in Southern Africa. The Zimbabwean agricultural {{system is the}} most publicly <b>assisted</b> <b>sector</b> of the economy. Its output does not, however, match {{the extent of the}} support it receives, as the country’s food security situation is worsening. The case study critically analyses field data in the hyperinflationary economic environment that currently pertains in Zimbabwe. The results of the case study indicate that Zimbabwe’s food security is on a steep decline, implying a negative contribution to Southern Africa’s food security. The case study recommends additional domestic and trade policy measures to improve investment and development in agriculture for the benefit of Zimbabweans and the region as a whole...|$|E
