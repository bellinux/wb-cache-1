5000|$|The {{temporal}} delay {{assumption is}} based on the principle of resting <b>potential</b> <b>activation</b> which reflects the frequency of word use by the bilingual such that high frequency words correlate to high resting level <b>activation</b> <b>potentials,</b> and words used with little frequency correlate to low resting level <b>activation</b> <b>potentials.</b> A high resting potential is one that is less negative or closer to zero, the point of activation, and therefore needs less stimuli in order to become activated. Because the less commonly used words of L2 have a lower resting level activation, L1 is likely to be activated before L2 as seen by N400 ERP patterns. [...] This resting level activation of words also reflects the proficiency level of bilinguals and their frequency of usage of the two languages. When a bilingual’s language proficiency is lower in L2 than L1, the activation of L2 lexical representations will be further delayed as more extensive or higher-level brain activation is necessary for language control. Both low and high proficiency bilinguals have parallel activation of the word representations, however the less proficient language, L2, becomes active more slowly contributing to the temporal delay assumption.|$|R

50|$|The potent {{polyether}} brevetoxins {{produced by}} K. brevis activate voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Specifically, brevetoxins bind to site 5 on the alpha-subunit of voltage sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs), which serve as key proteins {{in the structure}} of the cell membrane. The binding of brevetoxin to VSSCs produces three key effects: a lowering of the <b>activation</b> <b>potential</b> to more negative values, the persistent activation of the channel and therefore repetitive firing of nerves, and the inability to reverse this prolonged mean open state. This leads to a number of health problems in both humans and animals alike. The disruption of normal sodium channel function namely results in massive fish kills and the poisoning of marine mammals and other aquatic invertebrates, which in turn are a source of human health problems as well. For instance, pulmonary receptors associated with ligand-gated epithelial Na+ channels and cathepsin inhibition in macrophages have been reported to be affected by brevetoxin exposure.|$|E
50|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} derived from hematopoietic bone marrow {{progenitor}} cells. These progenitor cells initially transform into immature dendritic cells. These cells are characterized by high endocytic activity and low T-cell <b>activation</b> <b>potential.</b> Immature dendritic cells constantly sample the surrounding environment for pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. This is done through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs recognize specific chemical signatures found on subsets of pathogens. Immature dendritic cells may also phagocytose small quantities of membrane from live own cells, in a process called nibbling. Once they have {{come into contact with}} a presentable antigen, they become activated into mature dendritic cells and begin to migrate to the lymph node. Immature dendritic cells phagocytose pathogens and degrade their proteins into small pieces and upon maturation present those fragments at their cell surface using MHC molecules. Simultaneously, they upregulate cell-surface receptors that act as co-receptors in T-cell activation such as CD80 (B7.1), CD86 (B7.2), and CD40 greatly enhancing their ability to activate T-cells. They also upregulate CCR7, a chemotactic receptor that induces the dendritic cell to travel through the blood stream to the spleen or through the lymphatic system to a lymph node. Here they act as antigen-presenting cells: they activate helper T-cells and killer T-cells as well as B-cells by presenting them with antigens derived from the pathogen, alongside non-antigen specific costimulatory signals. Dendritic cells can also induce T-cell tolerance (unresponsiveness). Certain C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) on the surface of dendritic cells, some functioning as PRRs, help instruct dendritic cells as to when it is appropriate to induce immune tolerance rather than lymphocyte activation.|$|E

MethodsEA serum was prepared from six male adult Sprague-Dawley rats that had received EA at bilateral Neiguan (PC 6). Eighteen ventricular myocytes were prepared from six SD rats using an enzy-molysis approach. Myocardial ischemia was mimicked by perfusion of ischemic solution. Whole-cell patch-clamping was used to record three currents evoked from isolated cells. The first current was the control, and recorded in absence of ischemic solution current. The second was the ischemic current, and recorded after perfusion of ischemic solution for 5 min, while the EA current was last, and recorded after perfusion of EA serum for 5 min. Nav kinetic curves were fitted using related formulas. ResultsCompared with those in controls, in the presence of ischemic solution, peak amplitudes of INa significantly increased from – 40 mV to + 30 mV, and half-maximal inactivation potentials of Nav increased significantly, while half-maximal <b>activation</b> <b>potentials,</b> slope factors and the recovery time from inactivation to activation of Nav were unchanged. Compared with those in the ischemic solution, in the presence of EA serum, peak ischemic current amplitudes significantly reduced from − 40 mV to + 40 mV, and half-maximal inactivation potentials were restored, while half-maximal <b>activation</b> <b>potentials,</b> slope factors and the recovery time from inactivation to activation of Nav were unchanged.

Mapping and catheter ablation were performed in sinus rhythm, guided only by the recording of the <b>activation</b> <b>potential</b> of the fiber. RESULTS: Efficacy in ablation was achieved in all patients. The fibers were located in the right lateral region of the tricuspid ring in 3 patients, right posterolateral region in 2, and right anterolateral region in 1.

Here we report the derivation {{and analysis of}} genetically targeted mice harboring a germline mutation in IκBα NES. Mature B cells in the mutant mice displayed nuclear accumulation of inactive IκBα complexes containing a NF-κB family member, cRel, causing their spatial separation from the cytoplasmic IκB kinase. This resulted in severe reductions in constitutive and canonical NF-κB activities, synthesis of p 100 and RelB NF-κB members, noncanonical NF-κB activity, NF-κB target gene induction, and proliferation and survival responses in B cells.

Major discontinuities in slope approximate the ratio 12 / 88 for Cr to Fe in the 20 and 40 % Ni alloy series, and 14 / 86 for Cr to Ni in the 50 and 60 % Ni alloy series. These ratios correspond to observed critical composi-tions for passivity in the Cr-Fe and Cr-Ni binary systems. Additional discon-tinuities occur at the critical binary Cr to Fe ratio in the 50 and 60 % Ni series. This behavior is interpreted in terms of separate lectron interaction in the ternary system between Cr and Fe distinct from interaction between Cr and Ni.

The main control interface is represented by surface electromyography (EMG) : the <b>activation</b> <b>potentials</b> of the remnants of large muscles of the stump are used in a nonnatural way to control one or, at best, two degrees-of-freedom. This has two drawbacks: first, the dexterity of the prosthesis is limited, leading to poor interaction with the environment; second, the patient undergoes a long training time. As more dexterous hand prostheses are put on the market, {{the need for a}} finer and more natural control arises. Machine learning can be employed to this end. A desired feature is that of providing a pre-trained model to the patient, so that a quicker and better interaction can be obtained. To this end we propose model adaptation with least-squares SVMs, a technique that allows the automatic tuning of the degree of adaptation. We test the effectiveness of the approach on a database of EMG signals gathered from human subjects.
