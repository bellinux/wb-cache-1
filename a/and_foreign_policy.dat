5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Sihanouk's {{delicate}} domestic <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> balancing act {{was beginning to}} go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions. He had also agreed to allow {{the use of the}} port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam. These concessions made questionable Cambodia's neutrality, which had been guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954.|$|E

5|$|Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a US bipartisan defense <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E
5|$|Since 1985, Gibraltar has {{undergone}} major changes {{as a result}} of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on tourism, financial services, shipping and Internet gambling.

5|$|In Germany, {{there were}} major {{issues to be}} decided. Germany was still {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, {{made up of the}} zones occupied by the three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E
5|$|In all, Ferraro served three two-year terms, being re-elected in 1980 and 1982.

She broke with her party in favoring an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution. She supported deployment of the PershingII missile and the Trident submarine, although she opposed funding for the MX missile, the B-1B bomber, and the Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economy– not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Since then, many {{scholars}} have operated under {{the belief that}} the Great Wall continually defended China's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand years. For example, the 18th-century sinologist Joseph de Guignes assigned macrohistorical importance to such walls when he advanced the theory that the Qin construction forced the Xiongnu to migrate west to Europe and, becoming known as the Huns, ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Some have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall: Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the Chinese society and economy, Owen Lattimore supposed that the Great Wall demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China, and John K. Fairbank posited that the Wall played a part in upholding the Sinocentric world order.|$|E
5|$|The Device Forts {{emerged as}} a result of changes in English {{military}} architecture <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in the early 16th century. During the late medieval period, the English use of castles as military fortifications had declined in importance. The introduction of gunpowder in warfare had initially favoured the defender, but soon traditional stone walls could easily be destroyed by early artillery. The few new castles that were built during this time still incorporated the older features of gatehouses and crenellated walls, but intended them more as martial symbols than as practical military defences. Many older castles were simply abandoned or left to fall in disrepair.|$|E
5|$|Formerly a {{key figure}} in the Yorkist cause, Warwick {{defected}} to the Lancastrians over disagreements about Edward's nepotism, secret marriage <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Leading a Lancastrian army, the earl defeated his former allies, forcing Edward to flee to Burgundy. The Yorkist king persuaded his host, Charles the Bold, to help him regain the English throne. Leading an army raised with Burgundian money, Edward launched his invasion of England, which culminated at the fields north of Barnet. Under cover of darkness, the Yorkists moved close to the Lancastrians and clashed in a thick fog at dawn. As both armies fought, the Earl of Oxford on the Lancastrian right routed the Yorkists opposite under Lord Hastings, chasing them back to Barnet. On their return to the battlefield, Oxford's men were erroneously shot at by the Lancastrian centre commanded by Lord Montague. As cries of treason (always a possibility in that chaotic period) spread through their line, Lancastrian morale was disrupted and many abandoned the fight. While retreating, Warwick was killed by Yorkist soldiers.|$|E

5|$|From 1514 to 1529, Thomas Wolsey (1473–1530), a {{cardinal}} {{of the established}} Church, oversaw domestic <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> for the young king from his position as Lord Chancellor. Wolsey centralised the national government and extended {{the jurisdiction of the}} conciliar courts, particularly the Star Chamber. The Star Chamber's overall structure remained unchanged, but Wolsey used it to provide for much-needed reform of the criminal law. The power of the court itself did not outlive Wolsey, however, since no serious administrative reform was undertaken and its role was eventually devolved to the localities. Wolsey helped fill the gap left by Henry's declining participation in government (particularly in comparison to his father) but did so mostly by imposing himself in the King's place. His use of these courts to pursue personal grievances, and particularly to treat delinquents as if mere examples of a whole class worthy of punishment, angered the rich, who were annoyed as well by his enormous wealth and ostentatious living. Following Wolsey's downfall, Henry took full control of his government, although at court numerous complex factions continued to try to ruin and destroy each other.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Stevens {{returned}} to the United States and began to study law, taking classes at the American University and Columbia University in international law <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> In 1930, she {{returned to}} Havana in February for {{the first meeting of}} the CIM women which included Flora de Oliveira Lima (Brazil), Aída Parada (Chile), Lydia Fernández (Costa Rica), Elena Mederos de González (Cuba), Gloria Moya de Jiménez (Dominican Republic), Irene de Peyré (Guatemala), Margarita Robles de Mendoza (Mexico), Juanita Molina de Fromen (Nicaragua), Clara González (Panama), Teresa Obregoso de Prevost (Peru). From Cuba, she went to The Hague for the first World Conference on the Codification of International Law held on 13 March. Presenting her data on what had been accomplished in the Americas, Stevens asked that the international community enact laws to protect women's citizenship. She {{returned to the}} United States and her studies. Though she didn't graduate, in 1931 she became the first woman member of the American Institute of International Law. That same year, she, Belmont and Paul attended the League of Nations meeting in September to present their nationality findings.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale {{fighting}} continued {{between the}} two countries throughout 1978, as China tried to mediate peace talks {{between the two}} sides. However, neither country could reach an acceptable compromise at the negotiation table. By the end of 1978, Vietnamese leaders decided to remove the Khmer Rouge-dominated regime of Democratic Kampuchea, perceiving it as being pro-Chinese and too hostile towards Vietnam. On 25 December 1978, 150,000 Vietnamese troops invaded Democratic Kampuchea and overran the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army in just two weeks. On 8 January 1979, the pro-Vietnamese People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) was established in Phnom Penh, marking the beginning of a ten-year Vietnamese occupation. During that period, the Khmer Rouge's Democratic Kampuchea continued to be recognised by the United Nations as the legitimate government of Kampuchea, as several armed resistance groups were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation. Behind the scenes, Prime Minister Hun Sen of the PRK regime approached factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) to begin peace talks. Under heavy diplomatic and economic pressure from the international community, the Vietnamese government implemented a series of economic <b>and</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> reforms, which led to their withdrawal from Kampuchea in September 1989.|$|E
