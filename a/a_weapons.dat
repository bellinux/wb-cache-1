5|$|A damaged, {{unidentified}} vessel {{from the}} Gamma Quadrant docks at Deep Space Nine for repairs. Its reptilian pilot, identified only as Tosk (Scott MacDonald), {{is the first}} known life-form from the Gamma Quadrant to visit the station. Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) suspects Tosk is running from something, due to evidence of weapons fire on his vessel. O'Brien befriends Tosk and tries to help him repair his ship. However, Tosk attempts to steal from <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> locker and is put in a holding cell by Security Chief Odo (René Auberjonois).|$|E
5|$|Howard Stark (portrayed by Dominic Cooper) is <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> {{developer}} who is framed for selling weapons to America's enemies. One {{of the weapons}} he created during the war was Midnight Oil, designed to give soldiers extra stamina during war, but instead it caused psychosis and led to them killing each other. The U.S. military stole Midnight Oil and used it on the Russians, and Fennhoff blames Stark for the ensuing massacre. Fennhoff hypnotises Stark into bombing New York, but Carter is able to convince Stark to stop. He moves on to set up his own film studio in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|One year later, the Alliance hires Katarn again, {{this time}} to {{investigate}} an assault {{on one of their}} bases by a new type of Imperial soldier. His investigation reveals the Imperial Dark Trooper project, led by Human General Rom Mohc (Jack Angel). His mission to stop the project takes him to the sewers of Anoat City on planet Anoat, where he captures Moff Rebus, an Imperial weapons specialist Human who developed the Dark Trooper weapon. Rebus' interrogation leads Katarn to <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> research facility in the mountains of Fest and the Gromas mines where minerals are extracted for the Dark Troopers.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Gene Snitsky and Kane (with Lita). The match was <b>a</b> <b>Weapons</b> of Choice match, {{for which a}} steel chain gained 41% of the vote. The match began with Kane using a chain on Snitsky. Snitsky grabbed the chain and choked Kane with it. The match ended when Snitsky came off the second rope onto a steel chair that was wrapped around Kane's neck and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of his training, Petry {{was assigned to}} 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, in Washington state. Petry had a total of eight deployments: two supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom and six supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. In all, Petry spent a total of 28 months deployed.

5|$|Agents Phil Coulson, Melinda May, and Grant Ward break an {{undercover}} agent {{out of a}} hostile base, receiving classified S.H.I.E.L.D. Level 8 intel. Trainee Skye is frustrated when Coulson refuses to tell the team what the information is, based on their clearance level. At The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility run by Agent Victoria Hand, it is revealed that a South Ossetian separatist group has built a weapon called the Overkill device, which uses sonic vibrations to trigger other weapons from great distances. Ward, a field specialist, and Agent Leo Fitz, <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> technology specialist, are tasked with finding and disabling the device within 24 hours, before the separatists use it to declare independence from Russia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to stream {{in the next few days}} as well.|$|E
5|$|Early F-16s {{could be}} armed {{with up to}} six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking {{short-range}} air-to-air missiles (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> mix. More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, {{a wide variety of}} air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage. Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.787 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon for close range aerial combat and strafing. The 20mm cannon is mounted inside the fuselage {{to the left of the}} cockpit.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{the cane}} as <b>a</b> <b>weapon,</b> as {{originally}} taught in weapons schools, was codified by the Masters of Savate so that the cane was taught as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> of self-defence. The French tradition includes techniques of medieval stick fighting (bâton français), excepting those techniques considered too dangerous {{to be used in}} sport. The medieval stick is too heavy <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> to be used in competition.|$|R
5|$|From {{a handful}} of company designs, Saville {{selected}} Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, {{to lay out the}} desired strategy of the weapons system and to describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville. The Falcon was used successfully for more than a decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra around a large autocannon, but he further refined the concept and made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{death was}} mourned nationwide. Over {{two million people}} joined the five-mile long funeral {{procession}} that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where he was assassinated. Gandhi's body was transported on <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could {{catch a glimpse of}} his body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes manned by 50 people each pulled the vehicle. All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London.|$|E
5|$|In early May 2012, five alleged {{members of}} the Abergil {{organization}} who were suspected of conspiring {{to commit a crime}} and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem, after police had found <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> cache inside a storage room in an apartment building in Jerusalem where one of the suspects' parents live. According to the suspects, they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization. At the suspects’ homes police discovered signs of violence, including ceramic bulletproof vests with bullet holes in them. The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack. According to the suspects, they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident, who owed the organization money.|$|E

5|$|One {{experimental}} two-seat A-10 Night Adverse Weather (N/AW) {{version was}} built by converting an A-10A. The N/AW was developed by Fairchild from the first Demonstration Testing and Evaluation (DT) A-10 for consideration by the USAF. It included a second seat for <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> system officer responsible for electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation and target acquisition. The N/AW version did not interest the USAF or export customers. The two-seat trainer version was ordered by the Air Force in 1981, but funding was canceled by U.S. Congress and the jet was not produced. The only two-seat A-10 built now resides at Edwards Air Force Base's Flight Test Center Museum.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} Croatia {{declared}} its independence, the Yugoslav army and other Serb forces held {{something less than}} one-third of the Croatian territory, mostly in areas with a predominantly ethnic Serb population. The JNA military strategy partly consisted of extensive shelling, at times irrespective of the presence of civilians. As the war progressed, the cities of Dubrovnik, Gospić, Šibenik, Zadar, Karlovac, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Osijek, Vinkovci, and Vukovar all came under attack by Yugoslav forces. The United Nations (UN) imposed <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> embargo; this did not affect JNA-backed Serb forces significantly, as they had the JNA arsenal at their disposal, but it caused serious trouble for the newly formed Croatian army. The Croatian government started smuggling weapons over its borders.|$|E
5|$|Pike's men {{cross the}} Rio Grande and take refuge {{that night in}} the village where Angel was born. The townsfolk are ruled by General Mapache, a corrupt, brutal officer in the Mexican Federal Army, who has been ravaging the area's villages to feed his troops, who have been losing to the forces of revolutionary Pancho Villa. Pike's gang makes contact with the general. A jealous Angel spots Teresa, his former lover, in Mapache's arms and shoots her dead, angering Mapache. Pike defuses the {{situation}} and offers to work for Mapache. Their task is to steal <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> shipment from a U.S. Army train so that Mapache can resupply his troops and appease Commander Mohr, his German military adviser, who wishes to obtain samples of America's armaments. The reward will be a cache of gold coins.|$|E

25|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Japan, many {{scientists}} at Los Alamos rebelled against {{the notion of}} creating <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> thousands of times {{more powerful than the}} first atomic bombs. For the scientists the question was in part technical—the weapon design was still quite uncertain and unworkable—and in part moral: such <b>a</b> <b>weapon,</b> they argued, could only be used against large civilian populations, and could thus only be used as <b>a</b> <b>weapon</b> of genocide.|$|R

5|$|The Army also {{conducted}} <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> demonstration for the Senate Armed Services Committee in early 1972, {{to show off}} the Cheyenne's firepower and garner support for attack helicopter development. The first TOW missile that was fired in the demonstration failed and went into the ground. The second missile was fired and hit the target. Previously, 130 TOW missiles had been fired without failure, but the failure of the first missile was now linked to perception of the aircraft. In April 1972, the Senate published its report on CAS. The report recommended funding of the Air Force's A-X program, which would become the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and limited procurement of the Harrier for the Marine Corps. The report never referred to the Cheyenne by name and only offered a lukewarm recommendation for the Army to continue procurement of attack helicopters, so long as their survivability could be improved.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{broke out}} in the evening of 23 January 1915, when rebels, incited by Chilembwe, {{attacked}} the A. L. Bruce plantation's headquarters at Magomero and killed three white colonists; and a largely unsuccessful attack on <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> store in Blantyre followed during the night. By the morning of 24 January the colonial authorities had mobilised the white settler militia and redeployed regular military forces south. After a failed attack on Mbombwe by troops of the King's African Rifles (KAR) on 25 January, a group of rebels attacked a Christian mission at Nguludi and burned it down. The KAR and militia took Mbombwe without encountering resistance on 26 January after many of the rebels, including Chilembwe, fled, hoping to reach safety in neighbouring Portuguese East Africa (modern Mozambique). About 40 rebels were executed in the revolt's aftermath, and 300 were imprisoned; Chilembwe was shot dead by a police patrol near the border on 3 February.|$|E
5|$|Under the E-series TO from 15 April 1943, {{self-propelled}} {{guns in the}} divisional special weapons battalion {{were replaced}} with eighteen 37mm towed guns in three batteries of six; an infantry regiment had <b>a</b> <b>weapons</b> company with 12, in three platoons of four. The battalion-level AT guns were removed. In total, a division possessed 54 pieces. The F-series TO from 5 May 1944 removed the special weapons battalion from the divisional organization, {{resulting in a total}} of 36 guns per division. The subsequent G-series TO reduced regimental weapon companies to two platoons, meaning 24 pieces per division. Although the G-series TO was only adopted on 4 September 1945, in practice in some divisions this change was introduced early in 1945.|$|E
