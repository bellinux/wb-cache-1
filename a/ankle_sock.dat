40|$|In November 2006 I {{found myself}} staring at item no. 80 from Box 23 of the Greta Garbo {{material}} {{held at the}} Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia. Item 80 is an envelope from the Pont-Royal Hotel {{on the front of}} which is written ‘Greta’s foot Sept. 1958 ’. Inside is a pencil tracing of Garbo’s foot extending across two small sheets of unlined notepaper. I held the two pieces of paper in mid-air and stared at them with what I hoped was a look of sufficient scholarly intensity to satisfy the two archivists looking on. ‘Looks about a size 8 ’, I have written in my notes, but in my excitement I failed to note down whether it was her left or her right foot. Elsewhere in the collection - that of Mercedes de Acosta - I encountered a yellow cotton <b>ankle</b> <b>sock</b> with a lipstick kiss still visible upon it. Further afield in the same papers, there is a single silk stocking that once belonged to Marlene Dietrich. Nowhere present is the pair of slightly used socks that Greta generously offered to Mercedes in a note from 1938. But this is not what took me to Philadelphia; no, this visit was the culmination of a six-year desire to see what ‘nothing’ looked like. What took me on this hiding to ‘nothing’? In April 2000, the world’s press reported on the opening of a long-embargoed cache of letters from Greta Garbo to Mercedes de Acosta, the Spanish-born aristocrat turned screenwriter widely thought to have been Garbo’s lover. At issue was whether the letters would somehow ‘prove’ {{the nature of the relationship}} between the two women...|$|E
