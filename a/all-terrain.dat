5|$|After {{the death}} of his father, a series of events related to Favre's family were {{reported}} in the media. In October 2004, ten months after {{the death of}} Favre's father, his brother-in-law, Casey Tynes, was killed in an <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle accident on Favre's Mississippi property.|$|E
5|$|<b>All-terrain</b> vehicle (ATV) – {{for example}} quad bikes; these {{are used for}} {{response}} off-road, especially at events. ATVs can be modified to carry a stretcher, and are used for tasks such as mountain rescue in inaccessible areas.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance design {{must take}} into account local {{conditions}} and infrastructure. Maintained roads are necessary for road going ambulances to arrive on scene and then transport the patient to a hospital, though in rugged areas four-wheel drive or <b>all-terrain</b> vehicles can be used. Fuel must be available and service facilities are necessary to maintain the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the land}} in the Twomile Run {{watershed}} is used for recreation. Deer hunting and bear hunting are often done in the area. There is also a series <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle trails known collectively as the Whiskey Springs ATV trail complex. These are located in the sub-watersheds of Huling Branch and Middle Branch Twomile Run.|$|E
5|$|Some modern {{activities}} are prohibited in Black Moshannon State Park. The operation of drones and similar radio controlled devices is prohibited. <b>All-terrain</b> vehicle usage is also prohibited and closely monitored by DCNR. Further, removing any natural items is illegal as is firewood cutting without a permit.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors of}} concern for the painted turtles include over-collection from the wild, {{released}} pets introducing diseases or reducing genetic variability, pollution, boating traffic, angler's hooks (the turtles are noteworthy bait-thieves), wanton shooting, and crushing by agricultural machines or golf course lawnmowers or <b>all-terrain</b> vehicles. Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work has not been published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists' traps. Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat.|$|E
5|$|Upper Pine Bottom State Park {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} state parks in Pennsylvania, and is maintained by staff from nearby Little Pine State Park. In addition to picnics, its chief use is as a parking area for local hunters, anglers, hikers, cross-country skiers, snowmobilers, and <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle riders. Upper Pine Bottom Run is state-approved and stocked for trout fishing in season. Second-growth forest now covers the region; the surrounding state forest and park are home to a variety of flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|After a {{succession}} of counterattacks, {{toward the end of}} August the Libyans finally drove the 400 Chadian soldiers out of the town. This victory–the first by Libyan ground forces {{since the start of the}} Toyota War–was apparently achieved through close-range air strikes, which were followed by ground troops advancing cross-country in jeeps, Toyota <b>all-terrain</b> trucks, and light armored vehicles. For the Libyans, who had previously relied on ponderous tracked armour, the assault represented a conversion to the desert warfare tactics developed by FANT. To highlight the victory, Gaddafi flew foreign journalists to the region, so the news of his victory could reach the headlines.|$|E
5|$|Camping is {{available}} at local recreational vehicle parks (RV parks), including Carl Precht Memorial RV Park, Sunset Lakes RV Park (adjacent to Duck Lake), and Margie's R.V. Park. There are over a half-dozen campgrounds in proximity to Omak. The Omak–Okanogan region has been well known for its rock climbing structures since the early 1970s. Nearby communities in Okanogan County offer horseback riding and hunting. Fishing and boating is achievable within short distance, at the nearby Omak Lake. The Omak Pioneers represent Omak High School as their baseball, basketball, football, soccer, volleyball, and wrestling teams. There are separate teams based on age and gender. There are <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle (ATV) courses located nearby, specifically in the Loup Loup Ski Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The force {{deployed}} {{with a large}} {{quantity of}} construction and other equipment, including 24 Land Rovers, 19 Unimog <b>all-terrain</b> vehicles, 26 heavy trucks, 43 trailers, eight bulldozers {{and a variety of}} other road-building equipment such as graders, scrapers and rollers. The support workshop added a further 40 vehicles, and over 1,800 tonnes of stores were shipped with the contingent's equipment. There was a total of over 200 wheeled and tracked vehicles and trailers and a large quantity of dangerous cargo (demolition explosives and ammunition). The UN hired the MV Mistra for the deployment. It departed Sydney on 23 March; the equipment was unloaded at Walvis Bay in mid-April, moving by road and rail to the South African Defence Force Logistics Base at Grootfontein.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set on}} the Southern coastland of England {{during an}} enemy {{invasion}} against the remaining Allied forces. The player takes {{the role of a}} fighter plane pilot, who must defeat the invasion. To accomplish this, the player pilots one of the three available Mark 2.1 AWAT (All-Weather <b>All-Terrain)</b> combat aircraft and is charged with defending the last three Allied airbases being evacuated in front of the enemy's advance. Despite being the lone defender and greatly outnumbered, they must fight enemy forces on all fronts: aerial, ground and naval. The player progresses through the game engaging different contingents of the invaders. Initially, they must intercept enemy fighter planes, helicopters and landing ground forces, including tanks, land bases and SAM sites. Once the enemy is sufficiently driven back, the player can engage the naval fleet.|$|E
5|$|Although Southern California and Mexico were {{considered}} for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected {{for the majority of}} the shooting. Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using <b>all-terrain</b> vehicles, boats, and helicopters. After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{the company}} had a revenue of NOK56 million, up NOK10 million from 2009, {{yielding}} a profit of NOK2 million. The company employed between 51 and 55 people, it is based at Håkons Hall and is entirely owned by Lillehammer Municipality. The company's revenue comes {{from a series of}} sources, the most important being events and tourists. At Lysgårdsbakken, the company operates a chairlift and viewing platform {{at the top of the}} tower, as well as a downhill and bobsleigh simulator. The company tailors events to companies with various activities at the hill, including a ceremony to light to Olympic Flame. Kanthaugen and its lift is rented out for tobogganing. The sledding track serves groups and tourists with activities such as wheelbob and for-man bobsleigh with an authorized pilot, bobrafting, skeleton and skeleton rafting. Next to the track is an activity park with activities such as snowmobile and <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle tracks.|$|E
5|$|City {{recreation}} facilities {{include two}} ice hockey arenas, a curling rink, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor ice rink, and a speed skating oval. The South Peace Community Multiplex, {{a new facility}} completed in 2010, boasts a pool, indoor rodeo grounds and ice rink. Voters approved building the Multiplex in a 2004 referendum which projected its cost at C$21.6 million. The project became controversial when construction began and the cost projection was raised to $35 million. The facility is located close to the city's exhibition grounds, away from residential uses. It features an indoor rodeo arena and a 4,000-seat convention centre/ice arena with skyboxes. Nearby Bear Mountain, located south of the city, provides over 20km (12mi) of snowshoeing and cross-country skiing trails, as well as areas for downhill skiing and about 500km (300mi) of trails for snowmobiles, mountain bikes, and <b>all-terrain</b> vehicles. The city was once home to a North American Hockey League team, the Dawson Creek Rage, beginning in the 2010–11 season until it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of them can actually be landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on-foot or by using an <b>all-terrain</b> infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} a scene of trucks pulling away from a large, brick building. Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and sitting down in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, she stands up and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the five women standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers with curiosity. For the song's refrain, Oh Land rides an <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle, before the video concludes with {{a large group of}} children joining the women for a final dance.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2006, {{shortly after}} the {{beginning}} of the General Assembly's legislative session, Fletcher was hospitalized with abdominal pain. Doctors at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington found a gallstone in his common bile duct and also diagnosed him with an inflamed pancreas and gallbladder disease. After surgery to remove the gallbladder, Fletcher developed a blood infection that slowed his recovery, but was discharged from the hospital on March 1. Days later, he returned to St. Joseph's with a blood clot which had to be dissolved, resulting in another five-day stay in the hospital. Fletcher staffers insisted that his absence did not {{have a negative impact on}} his ability to get legislation passed during the session. A right-to-work law and a repeal of the state's prevailing wage law – both advocated by Fletcher – failed early in the session, but both had been considered unlikely to pass before the session started. Among the bills that did pass the session were a mandatory seat belt law, a law requiring children under 16 years old to wear a helmet when operating an <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle, and legislation allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted on Capitol grounds in a historical context.|$|E
5|$|While passing {{near the}} British Isles on September6 as an extratropical storm, Danielle {{produced}} severe sea {{conditions on the}} western part of the isles. Major beach erosion was observed, and many people required rescuing. Coastal portions of Cornwall were evacuated as high waves inundated many homes, and an <b>all-terrain</b> police vehicle was shoved into the sea by a rogue wave in the Isles of Scilly. An 11‑year-old boy and his father were trapped in a sea cave on the north coast of Cornwall due to rough surf. Two other men from Port Isaac also became isolated in the same location after their boat capsized. All four were eventually rescued by a helicopter that hovered near the entrance of the sea cave. At the West Sands Caravan Park near Selsey, West Sussex, twelve families were evacuated to higher ground. A yacht filled with eight people ran aground near Calshot; they required rescuing by the Solent Coastguards. Flash flooding was reported throughout Wiltshire, especially in the city of Melksham. Numerous motorists were left stranded in inundated streets, while water entered several homes, store basements, a fire station, and the Cooper Avon Tyre Factory.|$|E

25|$|King's Ely has a {{dedicated}} climbing wall and <b>all-terrain</b> course, {{as well as}} access to an even larger obstacle course at nearby Braham Farm. In recent years, the school's climbing club has travelled to Corsica, the Alps and the Himalayas.|$|E
25|$|Brush Fire Unit : A {{vehicle that}} is a four-wheel-drive, <b>all-terrain</b> unit used to reach hilly, remote and marshy areas to {{extinguish}} fires involving weeds, grass and other vegetation. Along with regular firefighting equipment, it carries its own water, as well as rakes, shovels, and backpack extinguishers.|$|E
25|$|The Crosswagon {{was made}} to look more like <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle by unique front and rear bumpers and door sills with steel inserts. After the {{introduction}} of the 159 in 2005 the Crosswagon remained in production, and in 2007 it was the last 156 to be discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Recreational vehicle use also bears monitoring, as <b>all-terrain</b> {{vehicles}} (ATV's) {{and larger}} vehicles can damage streambeds and tear up fragile vegetation. Public vehicles are prohibited {{south and west}} of the existing trail system and from the river bottom and badlands areas, and from the ecological reserve altogether, except for management purposes and fire protection, or education and non-destructive research.|$|E
25|$|In the Dreamcast version, {{there are}} six extreme sports {{including}} bungee jumping and skysurfing. Players {{will have the opportunity}} to skirt down the side of mountain vistas and surf through the air on a snowboard, barrel over rocky trails on an <b>all-terrain</b> vehicle (ATV), hurtle off bridges on a bungee cord, hang glide through canyons and crevices, and race on a mountain bike.|$|E
25|$|JLTV's TD phase lasted 27 {{months and}} in May 2011 it was completed. In February 2011, the JLTV Program Office {{announced}} the award of the follow-on Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase contract would be delayed until January or February 2012 because the Army changed {{requirements for the}} JLTV, requiring it {{to have the same}} level of under body protection as the Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected <b>All-Terrain</b> Vehicle (M-ATV).|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, U.K. cyclists {{began to}} shift from road-only {{bicycles}} to <b>all-terrain</b> models such as the mountain bike. The mountain bike's sturdy frame and load-carrying ability gave it additional versatility as a utility bike, usurping the role previously filled by the roadster. By 1990, the roadster was almost dead; while annual U.K. bicycle sales reached an all-time record of 2.8 million, {{almost all of them}} were mountain and road/sport models.|$|E
25|$|The sport evolved with sub-disciplines such as stadium events {{known as}} supercross and arenacross held in indoor arenas. Classes were also formed for <b>all-terrain</b> vehicles. Freestyle motocross (FMX) events where riders are judged on their jumping and aerial acrobatic skills have gained popularity, {{as well as}} supermoto, where motocross {{machines}} race both on tarmac and off-road. Vintage motocross (VMX) events take place - usually for motorcycles predating the 1975 model year.|$|E
25|$|State Highway 82 is {{the only}} major road that {{provides}} access to Aspen. There are some mountain pass roads {{that lead to the}} city, but those require <b>all-terrain</b> vehicles and are typically impassable during the winter. Highway 82 east of Aspen is also impassable due to persistent snow on Independence Pass, leaving Highway 82 west of Aspen as the only means of motor vehicle access during the winter.|$|E
25|$|Following the Greek {{forest fires}} in 2007, Serbia sent six M-18 Dromader and one Antonov An-2 {{firefighting}} planes, 6 firefighting <b>all-terrain</b> vehicles, 55 firefighters, and put specialized military units on alert {{in case they}} were needed to assist the Greek Army battling fires and clearing out the debris. According to Assistant Minister of Interior Predrag Maric, over 300 firemen signed up for Greece {{in less than an}} hour.|$|E
