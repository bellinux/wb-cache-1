25|$|The {{transport}} layer and lower-level layers are unconcerned with {{the specifics of}} application layer protocols. Routers and switches do not typically examine the encapsulated traffic, rather they just provide a conduit for it. However, some firewall and bandwidth throttling applications must interpret application data. An example is the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). It is also sometimes necessary for network <b>address</b> <b>translator</b> (NAT) traversal to consider the application payload.|$|E

50|$|The {{technical}} {{details of}} many VoIP protocols create challenges in routing VoIP traffic through firewalls and network <b>address</b> <b>translators,</b> used to interconnect to transit networks or the Internet.

50|$|Addresses in {{the private}} space are not {{allocated}} to any specific organization and anyone may use these addresses without approval from a regional Internet registry. However, IP packets addressed from them cannot be transmitted through the public Internet, and so if such a private network needs to connect to the Internet, it must do so via a network <b>address</b> <b>translator</b> (NAT) gateway, or a proxy server.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use of private {{addresses}} is in residential IPv4 networks, since most Internet service providers (ISPs) allocate {{only a single}} publicly routable IPv4 address to each residential customer, but many homes {{have more than one}} computer or other Internet connected device, such as smartphones. In this situation, a network <b>address</b> <b>translator</b> (NAT/PAT) gateway is usually used to provide Internet connectivity to multiple hosts.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the private}} IPv4 address space is {{relatively}} small, many private IPv4 networks {{use the same}} address space. This can create a problem when merging such networks, namely the duplication of addresses on multiple devices. In this case, networks or hosts must be renumbered, often a time-consuming task, or a network <b>address</b> <b>translator</b> must be placed between the networks to masquerade the duplicated addresses.|$|E
5000|$|Network <b>Address</b> <b>Translators</b> {{replace the}} source and/or {{destination}} IP addresses of packets that traverse them. Typically, NATs are deployed to allow multiple end hosts {{to share a}} single IP address: hosts [...] "behind" [...] the NAT are assigned a private IP address and their packets destined to the public Internet traverse a NAT which replaces their internal, private address with a shared public address.|$|R
