It {{has been suggested}} that enteral nutrition enriched with insoluble fibers may increase the risk of this complication. Therefore, we investigate the effect of soluble and insoluble dietary fibers on the coagulation of a casein-based enteral nutrition in an <b>artificial</b> <b>gastric</b> digestion model. A 100 % casein-based enteral nutrition was enriched with increasing concentrations of soluble fibers (acacia fiber, oligofructose and inulin) and insoluble fibers (soy polysaccharide, resistant starch and alpha cellulose). After digestion in an <b>artificial</b> <b>gastric</b> model, the chyme was poured over sequentially placed sieves, separating the coagulate into size fractions of larger than 2 mm, between 1 and 2 mm, and between 0. 25 and 1 mm. Of these fractions we measured wet weight, dry weight and protein content. A significant effect on the fraction larger than 2 mm was considered to be clinically relevant. Addition of high concentrations soy polysaccharide and resistant starch to a casein-based enteral nutrition, did not alter the wet weight, whereas dry weight and protein content of the coagulate was significantly reduced. When high concentrations of soy polysaccharide and resistant starch are added to a 100 % casein-based enteral nutrition, the coagulate consist of more water and less proteins, which may lead to an increased protein digestion and absorption in a clinical setting. The suggestion that insoluble fibers increase the risk of gastrointestinal obstruction in critically ill patients is not supported by these data...|$|R

40|$|A multiple-unit oral {{floating}} {{system was}} prepared using the emulsification-solvent diffusion method {{to prolong the}} gastric emptying time of theophylline. For this purpose, theophylline, ethyl cellulose and dibutyl phthalate were dissolved in an ethanol/dichloromethane mixture, added to 0. 1 M HCl containing NaCl (20 %) or saturated theophylline and/or different concentrations of polysorbate 80 and polyvinyl alcohol. The mixture was stirred at different speeds for 3 h. The resulting microspheres were separated from the solution by filtration. Physical characteristics, including the shape and size distribution, floating capability, drug loading and drug release of the resulting theophylline microspheres were investigated. The prepared microspheres tended to float over the simulated <b>gastric</b> <b>medium</b> for over 12 h. Addition of NaCl (20 %) to the aqueous phase increased the drug loading of microballoons. The mean geometric diameter of microspheres decreased, as the stirring speed rate or the polysorbate 80 concentration were increased. Microballoons prepared at higher stirring rates released their drug content faster. Also, it is concluded that particle size and floating capability of microballoons could be adjusted by altering the stirring rate during microencapsulation...|$|R
40|$|Curcumin (CC), a {{potential}} antimalarial drug, has poor water solubility, stability and oral bioavailability. To circumvent these pitfalls, lipid-based drug delivery systems (LBDDSs) {{with a high}} CC loading (30 mg/g) were formulated. In a biorelevant <b>gastric</b> <b>medium,</b> CC-LBDDSs formed particle sizes {{in the range of}} 30 - 40 nm. During in vitro lipolysis, 90 - 95 % of the CC remained solubilized, whereas 5 - 10 % of the CC precipitated as an amorphous solid, with a high rate of re-dissolution in a biorelevant intestinal medium. The transport of the CC-LBDDS across Caco- 2 monolayers was enhanced compared with the transport of free drug because of the increased CC solubility. In Plasmodium berghei-infected mice, modest antimalarial efficacy was observed following oral treatment with CC-LBDDSs. However, the combination therapy of CC-LBDDS with a subtherapeutic dose of β-arteether-LBDDS provided an increase in protection and survival rate that was associated with a significant delay in recrudescence. These findings suggest that the combination of oral CC and β-arteether lipid-based formulations may constitute a promising approach for the treatment of malaria...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study Ciprofloxacin HCl {{sustained}} release matrix tablet was prepared by utilizing different grades of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) polymers such as Methocel K 4 M CR, Methocel K 4 M Premium & Methocel K 15 M CR by direct compression method. Different amount of Methocel K 15 M CR was used to develop matrix builder in the three proposed formulations (F 1 -F 3) {{for the study of}} release rate retardant effect at 5 %, 6 %, and 7 % of total weight of tablet matrix respectively. The dissolution study of Methocel K 15 M CR based tablet matrices of those proposed formulations were carried out in the simulated <b>gastric</b> <b>medium</b> (pH 1. 3) for 8 hours using USP dissolution apparatus II. Similarly Methocel K 4 M premium was used to develop matrix builder in another three proposed formulations (F 4 -F 6). It was found that formulations F- 4 (15 %), F- 5 (17 %) and F- 6 (18. 3 %) met the desired release rate of Ciprofloxacin HCl for 8 hrs period. Th...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, an {{effort has been}} made to {{evaluate}} of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose HPMC K 15 M as rate retardant polymer to sustain the release of Tramadol HCl from Tramadol HCl sustained release tablet matrix. Different amount of HPMC K 15 M were used in formulation of F 1 to F 5 where drug and polymer ratio were consequently 5 : 6, 5 : 5, 5 : 4, 5 : 3 and 5 : 2 in 200 mg tablet matrix. Tablets were prepared by direct compression. The dissolution study of the tablet matrices of different formulations were carried out in the <b>gastric</b> <b>medium</b> (pH 1. 3) for first 2 hours and then in the intestinal medium (pH 6. 8) for 6 hours using USP dissolution apparatus II. The drug release patterns were simulated in different kinetic orders such as Zero Order release kinetics, First Order release kinetics, Higuchi release kinetics, Korsemeyer-Peppas release kinetics and Hixson-Crowell release kinetics to assess the release mechanism. From the study it was observed that Zero Order release kinetics was the predominant release mechanism than Higuch...|$|R
