40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to determine the}} effect of <b>almond</b> skin <b>extracts</b> on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) replication. Drug-resistant strains of HSV frequently develop following therapeutic treatment. Therefore, the discovery of novel anti-HSV drugs deserves great effort. Here, we tested both natural (NS) and blanched (BS) polyphenols-rich <b>almond</b> skin <b>extracts</b> against HSV- 1. HPLC analysis showed that the prevalent compounds in NS and BS extracts contributing to their antioxidant activity were quercetin, epicatechin and catechin. Results of cell viability indicated that NS and BS extracts were not toxic to cultured Vero cells. Furthermore, NS extracts were more potent inhibitors of HSV- 1 than BS extracts, and this trend was in agreement with different concentrations of flavonoids. The plaque forming assay, Western blot and real-time PCR were used to demonstrate that NS extracts were able to block the production of infectious HSV- 1 particles. In addition, the viral binding assay demonstrated that NS extracts inhibited HSV- 1 adsorption to Vero cells.

Since defatted almond products exhibited antioxidant properties, their crude extracts in ethanol were prepared at 70 °C for 30 min. The total phenolic contents of ethanolic extracts of brown skin and green shell extracts were 10 - and 9 -times {{higher than that}} of the whole seed. Antioxidant activities of whole seed extract (WSE), brown skin extract (BSE) and green shell <b>extract</b> (GSE) of <b>almond</b> were evaluated using Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay, β-carotene-linoleate model and bulk stripped corn oil systems. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA scission and human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation by WSE, BSE and GSE was monitored. Different free radical trapping assays were used to investigate the free radical-scavenging activity of the extracts. TEAC assay revealed that the antioxidant capacities of BSE and GSE were 13 - and 10 - times greater than that of seed extracts at the same extract concentration. These extracts were then tested at 100 and 200 ppm phenolics as quercetin equivalents. Retention of β-carotene in a β-carotene-linoleate model system by WSE, BSE and GSE was 84 - 96, 74 - 83 and 71 - 93 % respectively, as compared to 2 % retention in the control. In a bulk stripped corn oil system, GSE performed better than BSE and WSE in inhibiting the formation of both primary and secondary oxidation products. In a cooked comminuted pork model system GSE and BSE inhibited formation of TBARS, total volatiles and hexanal more effectively than WSE. The scavenging activity of the superoxide radical by almond seed, skin and shell cover extracts at 100 and 200 ppm was 76, 89 and 97 % (100 ppm), and 85, 95 and 99 % (200 ppm), respectively. The corresponding reduction of hydrogen peroxide concentration was 59, 63 and 66 % (100 ppm), and 86, 91 and 91 % (200 ppm), respectively. The hydroxyl radical-scavenging capacities at 100 and 200 ppm were 16 and 42 % for WSE, 57 and 100 % for BSE and 40 and 56 % for GSE, respectively. A 100 % scavenging activity of the DPPH radical was achieved by both BSE and GSE at 100 and 200 ppm levels. WSE scavenged 21 and 73 % of the DPPH radical at 100 and 200 ppm, respectively. A total DNA retention was given by GSE at 50 ppm level against peroxyl-induced strand scission, whereas BSE and WSE reached the same at 100 ppm.

40|$|We {{report that}} {{amphiphilic}} counterions can enable DNA {{to act as}} cation carrier, enzyme detector and biosensor. Calf thymus DNA is used as example throughout the study. Evaluation {{of a series of}} counterion activators suggests that strong amphiphilicity, alkyl or calix[4]arene tails and guanidinium cations give best results, whereas weak amphiphilicity, bola-amphiphilicity, planar aryl tails and ammonium cations are less satisfactory for various reasons. In the U-tube, DNA-counterion complexes can carry cations such as safranin O or p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) across bulk chloroform membranes, whereas anions such as carboxyfluorescein (CF) and (8 -Hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulfonate (HPTS) are not transported. Uptake of DNA-counterion complexes into intact vesicles is demonstrated by DNA trapping experiments with internal polylysine. Comparison of results from different assays suggests that DNA-counterion complexes act as cation carriers under mild conditions, whereas pore formation and lysis dominate at higher concentrations. Applicability of DNA-counterion transporters for the detection of enzyme activity is demonstrated with phytate as an inactivating substrate and phytase as a reactivating enzyme.

40|$|Background: The {{antimicrobial}} {{effects of}} the extracts {{of different kinds of}} plants have been demonstrated in several studies.

Aliquots of the extracts at variable concentrations were then incubated with different bacterial strains, and the antimicrobial activities of the extracts from seeds were determined by MIC.

In almond, hydrolysable tannin content was 54. 7 ± 2. 3 mg ellagic acid and 27. 4 ± 7. 3 mg gallic acid per 100 g almond among varieties. Resveratrol- 3 -O-glucoside was identified in <b>almond</b> <b>extracts,</b> with 7. 19 – 8. 52 μg/ 100 g almond.

Third, we determined the association between aronia polyphenol metabolites and changes in key biomarkers of CVD risk in an intervention study. Former smokers, which were at greater risk for CVD, consumed aronia berry extract for 12 wk. Aronia consumption reduced fasting plasma total cholesterol (TC) level by 8 % during the 12 -week treatment compared with placebo group, and reduced plasma LDL-C level by 7 % and 11 % at both 6 wks and 12 wks compared with placebo group.
