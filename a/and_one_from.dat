5|$|A new {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, and the committee {{concluded that there was}} sufficient traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold.|$|E
5|$|A reoccurring {{theme in}} legend and folktale {{consists}} of a man or, more often, {{a woman who is}} challenged to gain as much land as can be traveled within a limited amount of time. This motif is attested by Livy around 1 CE, 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, and in folktales from Northern Europe. In six tales from Jutland, Denmark <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> Germany a plough is used similarly as in Livy's account, though the conditions are often met by walking or riding.|$|E

5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen).

This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be substantiated {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{receiving}} the order, Shimon Avidan called an emergency meeting at Hatzor. Yehoshua Goldrat, the only {{officer in the}} brigade who had experience from the British Army operating a combined force of infantry, armor, artillery and air, wrote the operational order. The order was in English, as Goldrat was not fluent in Hebrew, and was handed out to the battalion commanders on June 1. The battalion commanders translated the document into Hebrew for the company commanders. According to the plan, six companies (3 Palmach and 3 Irgun) would attack the Egyptians from the south. Three companies (2 from the 52nd <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> the 51st battalions) would attack from the north, and two companies (one from the 53rd Battalion <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> Irgun) would prevent a retreat to the east. A company from the 53rd Battalion would block reinforcement from Majdal. Only senior officers knew of the full plans however. Simha Shiloni, commander of the Palmach forces (Negev Beasts Battalion), commented that his forces came exhausted and completely unprepared to the assembly points, and he had given consent for their deployment only after being assured that they would serve as the operational reserve (the plan in fact called for these forces to lead the southern assault).|$|E
