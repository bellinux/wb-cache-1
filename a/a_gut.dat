5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, {{but all the}} {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which {{the fate of a}} cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E

25|$|All bilaterians have a {{gastrointestinal}} tract, {{also called}} <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> or an alimentary canal. This is a tube that transfers {{food to the}} organs of digestion. In large bilaterians, the gastrointestinal tract generally also has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of feces (solid wastes). Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means (for example, through the mouth).|$|E

[...] Rolling Stones David Fricke, reviewing Doolittle, said [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was [...] "a corrosive, compelling meditation on God and garbage." [...] The critical success of [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was also reflected commercially; the song reached number five on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, marking the Pixies' debut in the American charts. However, the song did not perform {{as well in the}} British charts, reaching a peak position of number 60 and falling off the charts after three weeks.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} some mixed reviews, however. Louis Pattison, reviewing for NME, {{said that the}} album would {{not be considered a}} classic, but complimented the material for a reduced emphasis on shock value. A reviewer for Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "A lack of 'oomph' prevents the album from landing <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> punch that would cover all of its flaws. Like an aging boxer, Manson lands jabs and the occasional uppercut, but he never topples his opponent." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph compared the record to the early work of English gothic rock band Bauhaus, and said that while it was [...] "undeniably effective [...] in small bursts," [...] he found the whole [...] "wearingly abrasive". Daniel Sylvester of Exclaim!, although he admired the ambition of the album, complained it was [...] "lazy when it can get away with it".|$|E
500|$|Mullally {{revealed}} that the show's writing team was [...] "notorious for tinkering with the script's laugh lines", even during the actual taping of the episodes. She hoped they would resist that urge for the live episode. Messing, however, was sure that the writers would interfere during the broadcasts; [...] "I have <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> feeling that, like, 10 minutes before we go they'll be like, 'Oh, no, no, you know what? Change this line to this. Now we're locked – go.'" [...] Prior to the live episode, the cast had shot the second, third and fourth episodes of the season. Shortly before this episode, Mullally injured her foot {{and was unable to}} walk without crutches. The writers therefore had to put Mullally's character, Karen, in a cast and a motorized scooter, ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe.|$|E

500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination". [...] However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: [...] "Just cos {{you are one of}} the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know." [...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E
500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|The zygote (fertilised egg) divides by spiral {{cleavage}} {{and grows}} by determinate development, {{in which the}} fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. The planuliform larva stage may be short-lived and lecithotrophic ("yolky") before becoming a juvenile, or may be planktotrophic, swimming for some time and eating prey larger than microscopic particles. However, many members of the order Heteronemertea and the palaeonemertean family Hubrechtidae form a pilidium larva, which can capture unicellular algae and which Maslakova describes as like a deerstalker cap with the ear flaps pulled down. It has <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> which lies across the body, a mouth between the [...] "ear flaps", but no anus. A small number of imaginal discs form, encircling the archenteron (developing gut) and coalesce to form the juvenile. When it is fully formed, the juvenile bursts out of the larva body and usually eats it during this catastrophic metamorphosis.|$|E

After 30 min, however, most (> 93 %) larvae had <b>an</b> engorged <b>gut</b> regardless of their larval stage. The likelihood of red material in the gut of third stage larvae increased over time (46 % after 30 min, 70 % after 60 min, and 86 % after 240 min) while that of first and second stage larvae remained relatively low...|$|R

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a grade of B-, calling it [...] "offbeat and cute". Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was mixed, writing that [...] "the {{handling of the}} rape case left a bad taste in my mouth" [...] and that the resolution was [...] "a bit fuzzy". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a 6/10, noting [...] "Overall, this episode focused on a very interesting concept, but the execution of that concept is so hopelessly convoluted that it’s lost in the shuffle. However, using the disturbing and abusive atmosphere of a nursing home as a setting provides chills without the addition of sinister spirits, so on <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> level, the episode works well." [...] Sarah Stegall awarded the episode three stars out of five and noted [...] "could have gotten five [...] out of five", but that the episode's lack of closure {{and the presence of}} too many questions left unresolved caused it to be less than one of [...] "the best episodes". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a largely critical review and rated it one star out of five. The two referred to the entry as [...] "the idiot's version" [...] of the earlier episode [...] "One Breath". Shearman and Pearson derided the handling of the rape, noting that [...] "there's a sour atmosphere to the whole proceedings", pointing out that [...] "only Scully shows the slightest concern that a woman's been sexually assaulted." [...] However, the two called the ghost effects [...] "eerie", but concluded that the scripting was [...] "very stupid".|$|E
