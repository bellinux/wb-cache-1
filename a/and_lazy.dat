5|$|After its release, Music Box {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. The album faced criticism regarding Carey's more mellow <b>and</b> <b>lazy</b> tone {{in comparison to}} her previous work. Despite some unfavorable reviews, the album became a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 and becoming Carey's first number-one album in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it Diamond, for shipments of ten million copies across the United States. Music Box remains Carey's highest seller with 28 million copies sold worldwide {{and is one of}} the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|Various {{scenes in}} the series also show {{existing}} tension between {{the upper and lower}} classes. Anatoray's nobility and military officers generally believe that commoners do not understand their codes of chivalry. On the other hand, the lower class also despise the aristocracy for their monopoly on resources. This tension extends to the accessibility of clean water, which varies in price according to purity grades. In the larger story, the advanced Guild society is portrayed as degenerate <b>and</b> <b>lazy,</b> while the people of Anatoray and Disith are creative and industrious.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax <b>and</b> <b>lazy</b> and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E
50|$|As 2002 came, {{the team}} began to struggle. The influx of former CART teams had begun <b>and</b> <b>Lazier</b> only managed an 8th-place finish in points and only {{registered}} {{a pair of}} top five finishes. 2003 was even worse as the team struggled with under-powered Chevrolet engines compared to the new Honda and Toyota powerplants <b>and</b> <b>Lazier</b> finished a dismal 19th in series points, prompting Delta Faucets to leave the team.|$|R

5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy <b>and</b> <b>lazy</b> life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E

25|$|Whether a term is {{normalising}} or not, and {{how much}} work {{needs to be done}} in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used.

25|$|Sloths are mammals {{classified}} in {{the families}} Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloths). There are six extant species of sloths. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow <b>and</b> <b>lazy</b> at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy. Aside from their surprising bursts of speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body, the ability to swim, {{and the fact that}} they host symbiotic algae on their fur.|$|E

Despite that, he still maintains his childish <b>and</b> <b>lazy</b> personality. He later starts to mature after living together with his three children, whom he reluctantly adopted. Seigi often quotes The Rolling Stones member Keith Richards to justify his decisions.|$|E
25|$|Salmon was the {{preferred}} food of the Stó:lō and {{was seen as}} superior to other types of meat. Meat and salmon were classified differently and salmon was said to give individuals energy while meat makes you feel heavy <b>and</b> <b>lazy.</b> In order to have salmon through the off seasons it was preserved through two different methods. In the summer salmon was wind dried with salt in the Fraser Canyon. In the fall salmon was smoked, this was traditionally done {{for a week or}} two but with modern refrigeration technology smoking is only done for a few days. Dried salmon was then either boiled or steamed before eating.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the initial}} plot {{in the first}} few episodes {{develops}} around an agent called Alan Ford, he is later just one of the central group of characters: Group TNT is an assembly of misfit secret agents, who operate from a flower shop in New York City, United States, which they use as a front for their secret headquarters. They are incompetent <b>and</b> <b>lazy,</b> yet intelligent and cunning, especially when it suits their own personal interests. Their outlandish biographies are dwarfed by that of their iron-fisted and shrewd leader, the wheelchair-ridden Number One, a Methusalem character who embezzles the millions paid to the group by American government or city fathers for secret missions, while paying a pittance to his agents.|$|E

She collected {{a few of her}} many adult tales into volumes, Miss Eyre of Boston and Some Women's Hearts. It is in Boston that she did the greater part of her work, including her books of travel, Random Rambles <b>and</b> <b>Lazy</b> Tours, published her four volumes of poetry, and edited and prefaced biographies, A Last Harvest and Garden Secrets, and the Collected Poems of Philip Bourke Marston, as well as a selection from Arthur O'Shaughnessy's verses.|$|E
25|$|Maria Pavlovana {{childhood}} {{was spent in}} splendor. Her early memories were of magnificent palaces <b>and</b> <b>lazy</b> country estates populated by armies of servants. Until she was six, Maria spoke Russian badly as all of her governesses and the immediate family spoke English. Later she had another governess, Mademoiselle Hélène who taught her French and stayed with her until her marriage. At {{the age of seven}} she traveled in her own personal railway car accompanied by her governess to visit Germany and France. On Sundays, she and her brother were allowed to play with children from aristocratic families. Growing up without a mother and with a frequently absent father, Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri became very close, relying on each other for affection and companionship.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, {{after the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler, {{who had been}} imprisoned for treason, {{appointed}} Rosenberg {{as the leader of}} the National Socialist movement, a position he held until Hitler's release. Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak <b>and</b> <b>lazy,</b> was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.|$|E

25|$|Dev {{constantly}} takes Paro's {{love and}} affection for granted. He grows up to be arrogant <b>and</b> <b>lazy,</b> which causes his father {{to send him to}} London to complete his education. While separated by distance, Paro and Dev's youthful love only blossoms more, despite Dev becoming increasingly more egotistical and entitled. After finishing his studies, Dev returns to Chandigarh and meets Paro, and they rekindle their romance. After some time, Dev overhears scandalous rumours about Paro concerning her reputation and sexual history, which he immediately believes. Paro is shocked to see Dev's chauvinist attitude towards her, even after she claims innocence. Dev hypocritically passes judgement on Paro and does not approve {{of the things that he}} has heard. Paro turns her back on him when she hears him insult her and rashly agrees to marry a man of her parents' choice. On her wedding day, Dev learns that the rumors were false but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets Paro marry someone else.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{after the}} turnips, {{the earth was}} grown with rice plants. The first rice plants were without husk and kernels. The sweet and honey-like rice flourished seeds abundantly. The people {{consumed}} them {{for a very long}} time. But there are people who became greedy <b>and</b> <b>lazy.</b> They took more rice than they needed for one day's meals. They began to take two, four, eight, and sixteen days' of rice reserves as they were too lazy to take rice everyday. Owing to this, many other creatures began to store and hoard the rice. The generation time for rice plants became slower and slower. Usually, it took only one night for the plant to grow and be ready to be consumed, but by the karmic power the plant began to grow more and more slowly. Also the rice grew in kernels and husks, scattered, which the creatures must work, nurse, maintain, harvest, and cook in order to obtain the white rice.|$|E

40|$|Students {{have trouble}} {{understanding}} {{the difference between}} <b>lazy</b> <b>and</b> strict programming. It is difficult to compare the two directly, because popular strict languages <b>and</b> popular <b>lazy</b> languages differ in their syntax, in their type systems, and in other ways unrelated to the lazy/strict evaluation discipline. While teaching programming languages courses, we have discovered that an extension to PLT Scheme allows the system to accommodate both <b>lazy</b> <b>and</b> strict evaluation in the same system. Moreover, the extension is simple and transparent. Finally, the simple nature of the extension means that the resulting system provides a rich environment for both <b>lazy</b> <b>and</b> strict programs without modification.
