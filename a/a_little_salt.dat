Clausen believed that the Warm Mineral Springs site had been significantly disturbed by Royal, rendering it useless for archeology.

25|$|Authors such as Eusebius (3rd Century) and Augustine (4th century) {{provide further}} details of these minor exorcisms, prayers and ceremonies {{performed}} over adults preparing for baptism.

Mostly those in the minor order of exorcist performed the ceremony of exorcism, then a priest signed the catechumens with the cross and laid hands upon them.

It is also found in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, where it is known as harina tostada and is employed {{in a wide variety of}} recipes. The gofio commercially available in the Canary Islands is always finely ground, like ordinary flour, despite the definition given in the Spanish Dictionary of the Royal Academy.|$|R
