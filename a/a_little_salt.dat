25|$|Authors such as Eusebius (3rd Century) and Augustine (4th century) {{provide further}} details of these minor exorcisms, prayers and ceremonies {{performed}} over adults preparing for baptism.

It is also found in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, where it is known as harina tostada and is employed {{in a wide variety of}} recipes. The gofio commercially available in the Canary Islands is always finely ground, like ordinary flour, despite the definition given in the Spanish Dictionary of the Royal Academy.|$|R
