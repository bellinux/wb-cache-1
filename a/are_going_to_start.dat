500|$|Sam Raimi was {{repeatedly}} praised for his direction. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} film was [...] "lean, elegant, and emotionally complex – a marvel of backwoods classicism" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "proof that Raimi, after the splatterific Evil Dead series and the lushly operatic Darkman, has now grown into a filmmaker of ravishing maturity and skill." [...] Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, said that the film was [...] "an exceedingly well-directed genre picture by ... does an excellent job of presaging the lethal violence that follows. From his very first images we know that bodies <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> to pile up." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film a [...] "quietly devastating thriller directed by ...who makes a flawless segue into mainstream storytelling." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "... for Raimi, whose mastery of visual effects has driven all of his previous films, A Simple Plan marks a tremendously successful break from the past. He's drawn lovely, complex performances from Paxton and Thornton and proven that he can work effectively – and movingly – in a minor emotional key." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{characters}} that Clare {{has tried to}} seduce for their wealth have included Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood), and her former sugar daddy, Arnold (Richard Lumsden) — a guest character who was introduced in a storyline that saw Clare steal all his wife's expensive jewellery. In May 2008, Bissix revealed that the [...] "depths to Clare <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> to be unraveled", which she welcomed as, in her words, she'd had [...] "enough of [...] maneating for a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{commentators}} {{complained that}} because Pietersen changed {{from being a}} right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. Gideon Haigh said that [...] "A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming {{will depend on the}} placement of the off stump". Ian Healy seconded this by saying [...] "It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit {{to one side of the}} field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups." [...] Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued [...] "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 12, an armed crowd rallied under a banner that read [...] "Liberty Freedom For God We Stand". [...] Most had signs, many of which chided [...] "government thugs". Addressing the protesters, Bundy said, [...] "We {{definitely}} don't recognize [...] jurisdiction or authority, his arresting power or policing power in any way" [...] and [...] "We're about {{ready to take the}} country over with force!" [...] After the BLM announced a suspension of the roundup, Bundy suggested blocking a highway. Armed protesters blocked a portion of Interstate 15 for more than two hours, causing traffic backups for three miles in both directions. Protesters also converged at the mouth of Gold Butte, the preserve where the cattle were corralled, and a tense, hour-long standoff ensued. BLM rangers warned over loudspeakers that they were prepared to use tear gas. Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, who was with the protesters, said that they were [...] "strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> shooting, it's going to be women {{that are going to be}} televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers". Protestors with rifles took positions on a highway overpass, seemingly offering cover as horse-mounted wranglers led protesters to face off against heavily equipped BLM rangers and snipers. Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who officially traveled to the Bundy standoff to convey that Utah did not want the cattle, put the number of federal agents present at over 200. According to Las Vegas assistant sheriff Joe Lombardo, there were 24 BLM rangers and Las Vegas deputy sheriffs present at the standoff. Las Vegas police were not allowed to wear protective gear because of fear that it would be seen as a provocation. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie blames the escalation of the situation on the BLM, stating to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the BLM has lied to him about having a place to take the cattle and the BLM did not attend town-hall meetings and disregarded his advice as County Sheriff.|$|E

6000|$|... "Your case is {{different}} from that of the others," [...] he said.

It is a private business, and there is no occasion whatever for you to take part in it. You are free either to choose an officer among yourselves; or to rejoin the army, find Monsieur de la Rochejaquelein, and tell him that I sent you to him in order that he might find a suitable leader for you, among the gentlemen with him.

"I {{told you}} when I wrote from Denver {{that he was}} called 'Straight Harry,' because he always acted straightforwardly, and now I know him I can quite {{understand}} their calling him so.

Leaping Horse is a first-rate fellow, and so is Hunting Dog, though of course {{he does not know}} nearly as much as the chief does, but he knows a lot. The other three are all nice fellows, too, so we were a very jolly party. They know a tremendous lot of stories about hunting and red-skins and that sort of thing. Some of them would make all you girls' hairs stand on end. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> off in two or three days to hunt up a gold mine uncle found three years ago. The Indians are going, too; they will hunt {{while the rest of us}} work. It will be quite a different journey to the last, and I expect it will be just as hot this time as it was cold last.
