Recently, the Codex Alimentarius Commission established a maximum limit of 200 µg kg– 1 for inorganic arsenic (iAs) in rice. Because the maximum content of As in water has been reduced to 10 µg L– 1, intoxication through rice and rice-based products can be considered an important source of As poisoning. The chronic effects of this iAs exposure can be lung and bladder cancer, skin lesions, or other noncarcinogenic diseases. There is clear evidence of high levels of iAs in rice and rice-based products. Different solutions for the reduction of As intake are proposed at different levels: 1) during the plant-growing process through agronomic practices, 2) pretreatment of rice before its use in the food industry, 3) optimization of the conditions of unit operations during processing, and 4) by cooking.

Evidence from beef processing technologies confirms {{that the presence of}} a bioactive component or safety-enhancing benefit associated with the technology fuels consumer concern. Communication challenges are discussed, in particular the challenge to find the right balance between informing markets in a transparent way without overloading them with too much information detail...|$|R
30|$|It has however {{been argued}} that {{undertaking}} investments that are supportive of pro-poor value chains in most sub-Saharan countries is fraught with high risks of transaction failure and hence high transaction costs are incurred in obtaining protection against such risk (Poulton et al. 2006). Yumkella et al. (2011) have also shown that the transformation of agricultural raw materials into higher value products does depend not only on investments in new <b>agro-food</b> <b>technologies</b> but also on value chain systems and capacities that are {{put in place to}} reduce transaction costs.|$|R

40|$|Socio-economic {{research}} on biotechnology is dealing mainly with the sectors of biopharmaceuticals, <b>agro-food</b> or environmental <b>technologies.</b> In contrast, {{the equipment and}} supplies sector seems to be largely ignored. This is surprising because this sector provides important input in terms of technology and material {{for the development of}} biotechnology in general. Our comparative analysis of the sector in eight countries indicates that there exists no specefic science base for the sector and that it is largely neglected by public research funding. Commercial activities are concentrated in countries with a large general science base in biotechnology and strong multinational pharmaceutical or chemical companies. There is a rather broad diversity in the way the sector has developed in the eight countries. Our data support the notion that national peculiarities seem dominant for explaining this picture. We anticipate growing business opportunities for European firms to step into large markets of equipment and supplies for functional genomics and protein analysis where Europe maintains a strong science base...|$|R
50|$|Shortly after {{retiring}} his Senate seat, Jennings Randolph assumed {{the chairmanship of}} AER and visited AID Administrator M. Peter McPherson to request program assistance to enable the Roundtable to develop its task force and subcommittee activities for more substantive focus in various <b>agro-food</b> processing, distribution, <b>technology</b> and finance sectors. This approach would have insured greater private sector participation as well which appealed to the Reagan Administration. However, just as the AID interest in the proposal seemed to gel, a reorganization at the White House undercut higher level encouragement at a critical juncture and AID’s Bureau for Science and Technology (S&T) itself underwent a sharp downsizing- which effectively left AER’s proposal shelved and unnoticed. It {{is worth noting that}} AID was under pressure to terminate its ongoing support for a USDA backed group called the Joint Agricultural Consultative Committee (JACC) after internal reviews cited poor performance and other issues. JACC was considered competitive with AER.|$|R
40|$|The {{foresight}} study 'Delivering on EU {{food safety}} and nutrition in 2050 - future challenges and policy preparedness' aims to aid policy makers in their assessment of the resilience of the current food policy and regulatory framework with a time horizon to 2050, contributing to ensuring that EU citizens continue to enjoy high standards of safe, nutritious and affordable food. The study employed the methodology of scenario development. The scenarios were constructed based on different developments of specific drivers that can significantly impact and bring change to the food system; these are global trade, EU economic growth, <b>agro-food</b> chain structure, <b>technology</b> uptake, social cohesion, food values, climate change, depletion {{of natural resources and}} world population growth. For each scenario, a number of {{food safety and}} nutrition challenges were identified and prioritised based on their importance and likelihood to occur. On this basis, scenario-specific policy options were developed as suggestions to policy-makers on how to address these challenges to ensure the resilience of the future EU food safety and nutrition regulatory framework. Research needs were also identified to complement the proposed policy options, as well as a set of food-chain related indicators that could inform in advance if the EU is headed towards one of the study’s scenarios.

40|$|Hydrogen {{is widely}} {{considered}} as the most promising energetic carrier. At an industrial scale, steam reforming of methane is currently the major hydrogen producing process. But {{it may also be}} produced from renewable biomass. Indeed, the fermentative production of hydrogen from renewable biomass using anaerobic bacteria could at least partially reduce our dependence on fossil fuel, decrease the carbon dioxide emissions and produce “green” energy. It offers the potential production of usable hydrogen from a variety of renewable resources such as carbohydrates wastes from agriculture or <b>agro-food</b> industries. This <b>technology</b> is based on anaerobic fermentation, called dark fermentation, by chemotrophic bacteria. The investigations carried out at CWBI involve selection and characterization of bacteria strains able to produce biohydrogen efficiently and {{with a wide range of}} substrate. The selected strains at the laboratory has been characterised as Clostridium sp. In order to produce hydrogen at high yields and production rates, the biotechnological process needs to be further optimized and efficient bioreactors must be designed. At CWBI, a new reactor called “horizontal rotating cylinder bioreactor” allows the production of biohydrogen from glucose with our Clostridium sp. strain with a high yield and production rate. This reactor, working continuously, has an internal volume of 2. 3 l but a working volume (liquid phase) of 300 ml. Firstly, it enhances the hydrogen production rate by partially fixing the bacteria on the porous cylinder and thus increasing the cell concentration in the bioreactor. Secondly, the rotative cylinder enables efficient gas transfer (mainly hydrogen) from the liquid phase where it is produced by the bacteria. This is an important way to enhance hydrogen production yield by allowing the bacteria metabolism to shift in a fermentation type that produces more hydrogen. This was confirmed by increasing or decreasing the total pressure in the bioreactor and observing the influence of hydrogen production. The liquid to gas hydrogen transfer is possibly an important factor to enhance the biogas production. Our investigation confirmed this by testing different liquid to gas transfer condition in BHP test (batch fermentation in 250 ml serum bottles). This was made either by decreasing total and partial pressure or by increasing the mixing state of the media. Our work concludes the importance of providing good liquid to gas transfers in the biohydrogen producing reactors to enhance the hydrogen production and reach higher yields and production rates.
