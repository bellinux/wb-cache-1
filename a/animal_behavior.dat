5|$|Delayed {{gratification}} or deferred gratification is an <b>animal</b> <b>behavior</b> {{that can}} be linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as capuchin monkeys, tamarins, marmosets, rats, and pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of <b>animal</b> <b>behavior</b> (particularly that of social animals such as {{primates}} and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} humans {{must have}} had and passed on knowledge about plants and animals to increase their chances of survival. This may have included knowledge of human and animal anatomy and aspects of <b>animal</b> <b>behavior</b> (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants for farming, then livestock animals to accompany the resulting sedentary societies.|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an <b>animal</b> <b>behavior</b> characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
25|$|The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) {{recommends}} that animal caretakers {{first attempt to}} address <b>animal</b> <b>behavior</b> problems with humane behavior modification techniques and/or with a treatment protocol set up by an <b>animal</b> <b>behavior</b> specialist. The ASPCA recommends surgery only if behavior modification techniques have failed, and the animal is at risk of losing its home or its life.|$|E

40|$|The {{manner in}} which the nervous system regulates <b>animal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in natural environments is a {{fundamental}} issue in biology. To address this question, C. elegans has been widely used as a model animal for the analysis of various <b>animal</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Previous behavioral assays have been limited to two-dimensional (2 -D) environments, confining the worm motion to a planar substrate that does not reflect three-dimensional (3 -D) natural environments such as rotting fruits or soil. Here, we develop a 3 -D worm tracker (3 DWT) for freely moving C. elegans in 3 -D environments, based on a stereoscopic configuration. The 3 DWT provides us with a quantitative trajectory, including the position and movement direction of the worm in 3 -D. The 3 DWT is also capable of recording and visualizing postures of the moving worm in 3 -D, which are more complex than those in 2 -D. Our 3 DWT affords new opportunities for understanding the nervous system function that regulates <b>animal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in natural 3 -D environments...|$|R

40|$|The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans is {{a widely}} used model for genetic dissection of <b>animal</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Despite extensive technical advances in imaging methods, it remains challenging to visualize and quantify C. elegans behaviors in three-dimensional (3 -D) natural environments. Here we developed an innovative 3 -D imaging method that enables quantification of C. elegans behavior in 3 -D environments. Furthermore, for the first time, we characterized 3 -D-specific behavioral phenotypes of mutant worms that have defects in head movement or mechanosensation. This approach allowed us to reveal previously unknown functions of genes in behavioral regulation. We expect that our 3 -D imaging method will facilitate new investigations into genetic basis of <b>animal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in natural 3 -D environments...|$|R
40|$|Information {{regarding}} {{cruelty to}} <b>animal</b> <b>behaviors</b> is emerging {{in greater numbers}} in recent years. However, {{little research has been}} conducted regarding specific assessments and interventions used with children who are cruel to animals. The current scope of literature tends to emphasize differing viewpoints on theory, with miniscule attention being paid to methods used to treat this population. No empirically validated treatment protocols have been researched and even fewer efficacious studies exist in the limited number of existing interventions being utilized by outpatient mental health professionals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if children with <b>animal</b> cruelty <b>behaviors</b> were being seen in outpatient settings by mental health professionals, and to determine which interventions methods were being used with children exhibiting <b>animal</b> cruelty <b>behaviors.</b> A questionnaire was sent to mental health providers in the Portland Metropolitan area in order to gather information about children exhibiting cruelty to animals being seen in outpatient treatment facilities. It was found that children exhibiting cruelty to <b>animal</b> <b>behaviors</b> are being seen by outpatient mental health providers. Additionally, a variety of intervention techniques were reported.
