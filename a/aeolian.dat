5|$|Winds can shape landforms, via {{a variety}} of <b>aeolian</b> {{processes}} such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names {{in various parts of}} the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.|$|E

5000|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts, in the mid-1840s John Ordway and {{his father}} Aaron opened a music store in Boston. John was also a music {{publisher}} and composer; his song Twinkling Stars are Laughing, Love (1855) was recorded by the Hayden Quartet as late as 1902 and 1904. Dreaming of Home and Mother (1851) was a popular sentimental song of the Civil War era, {{and continues to be}} played; it is popular in China and Japan in translated versions. Around 1845 he organized Ordway's <b>Aeolians,</b> a blackface minstrel troupe which performed at Ordway Hall in Boston and also nationally to promote Ordway's publishing business. Future bandleader/composer Patrick Gilmore worked in Ordway's store and also appeared with the <b>Aeolians.</b> James Lord Pierpont's first major composition [...] "The Returned Californian" [...] in 1852 was written expressly for Ordway and his troupe. A number of 19th century songs were written for the <b>Aeolians</b> and/or dedicated to Ordway, including Jingle Bells.|$|R

5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (<b>Aeolian)</b> sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} {{discussion of the}} Trossingen Plateosaurus finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed {{the preservation of the}} single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene interpreted the sediment as <b>aeolian</b> deposits, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of ephemeral water holes. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen, and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling. Seemann developed a different scenario, in which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed to get free, while heavy individuals got stuck and died.|$|E
5|$|Satellite {{tracking}} {{revealed that}} {{those found in}} Pelagos Sanctuary migrate southward to off Tunisia, Malta, Pantelleria, and Sicily, and also possibly winter off coastal southern Italy, Sardinia, within the Strait of Messina, <b>Aeolian</b> Islands, and off Catalonia, Cabrera Archipelago, Libya, Kerkennah Islands, Tuscan Archipelago, Ischia and adjacent gulfs (e.g. Naples and Pozzuoli), winter feeding ground of Lampedusa, and whales may recolonize out of the Ligurian Sea to other areas such as in Ionian and in Adriatic Sea. Biology of the species along southern and southeastern parts of the basin such as off Libya, Algeria, and northern Egypt, is unclear due to lacks of scientific approaches although whales have been confirmed off the furthermost of the basin such as along in shore waters of Levantine Sea including Israel, Lebanon, and Cyprus. Documented records within Turkish waters have been in very small numbers; one sighting off Antalya in 1994 and 5 documented strandings as of 2016.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} period that the Dorians moved on the Peloponnese, others carried out their own {{movements}} within Greece proper. The Thessalians, from their first appearance {{in the area of}} Thesprotia, moved into to the area of Thessaly, displacing the earlier Aeolophone tribe who inhabited that area. Among these tribes who lived in Thessaly before the establishment of the Thessalians were the Boeotians, who moved southward and established the area of Boeotia. Other populations of Thessaly and the previous inhabitants of Boeotia fled to the region of the Northeast Aegean after the loss of their territories and established themselves first in Lesbos and Tenedos and the Moschonesi (Fragrant Isles). These inhabitants were later called <b>Aeolians</b> from the name of a Thessalic tribe who had taken part in the migration. The <b>Aeolians</b> next colonised the opposite shore of Asia Minor, which was named Aeolis. Herodotus relates the founding of twelve cities in that section of Asia Minor. They were as follows:Aegae, Aegiroessa, Gryneion, Cilla, Cyme, Larissa, Myrina, Neonteichos, Notion, Pitane, Smyrna and Temnus. In the 7th century B.C., the <b>Aeolians</b> also expanded into the Troad, founding the cities of Gargara Assos, Antandros, Cebre, Scepsis, Neandreia and Pitya. The Achaeans of the Peloponnese who followed the Aeolic speakers participated in the Aeolic resettlement. The received tradition records Orestes as an instigator of the relocation of the <b>Aeolians,</b> and the royal family of the Penthilides on Mytilene claimed descent from Orestes.|$|R

5|$|West's {{arguments}} {{have been}} highly influential, but other scholars {{have arrived at}} different conclusions using the same evidence. Fowler thinks that the Sicyon genealogy would more likely reflect a composition before Cleisthenes' death (c.575 BCE) and dates the poem to the period closely following the First Sacred War (595–585 BCE), connecting its content to the growing influence of the Amphictyonic League and placing its author in <b>Aeolian</b> Thessaly because of the Aeolid family-trees centered around that region which dominate the earlier portions of the poem. Hirschberger, on the other hand, takes this focus upon the Aeolids and the Catalogue poet's perceived interest in eastern peoples to be indicative of a poet from Aeolis in Asia Minor; she proposes that the Catalogue was composed there between 630 and 590 BCE, viewing {{the composition of the}} Shield of Heracles and an apparent allusion to the poem by Stesichorus (died c.555 BCE) as providing the ultimate terminus ante quem.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Baltimore {{was home to}} several African American classically {{oriented}} music institutions which drew on a rich tradition of symphonic music, chamber concerts, oratorios, documented {{in large part by}} the Baltimore Afro-American, a local periodical. Inspired by A. Jack Thomas, who had been appointed conductor of the city's municipally supported African American performance groups, Charles L. Harris led the Baltimore Colored Chorus and Symphony Orchestra from 1929 to 1939, when a strike led to the company's dissolution. Thomas {{had been one of the}} first black bandleaders in the U.S. Army, was director of the music department at Morgan College, and was the founder of Baltimore's interracial <b>Aeolian</b> Institute for higher musical education. Charles L. Harris, as leader of the Baltimore Colored City Band, took his group to black neighborhoods across Baltimore, playing marches, waltzes and other music, then switch to jazz-like music with an upbeat tempo, meant for dancing. Some of Harris' musicians also played in early jazz clubs, though the musical establishment at the time did not readily accept the style. Fred Huber, Director of Municipal Music for Baltimore, exerted powerful control over the repertoire of these bands, and forbade jazz. T. Henderson Kerr, a prominent black bandleader, emphasized in his advertising that his group did not play jazz, while the prestigious Peabody Institute debated whether jazz was music at all. The Symphony Orchestra produced renowned pianist Ellis Larkins and cellist W. Llewellyn Wilson, also the music critic for the Afro-American. Harris eventually replaced Harris as conductor of the Orchestra and has since become a city musical fixture who is said to have, at one point, taught every single African American music teacher in Baltimore.|$|E
