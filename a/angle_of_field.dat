The rays with an angle of aperture smaller than u* would not have the same distance of intersection and the same sine ratio; these deviations are called zones, and the constructor endeavors to reduce these to a minimum. The same holds for the errors depending upon the angle of the field of view, w: astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion are eliminated for a definite value, w*, zones of astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion, attend smaller values of w. The practical optician names such systems: corrected for the angle of aperture u* (the height of incidence h*) or the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> of view w*. Spherical aberration and changes of the sine ratios are often represented graphically as functions of the aperture, in the same way as the deviations of two astigmatic image surfaces of the image plane of the axis point are represented as functions of the angles of the field of view.|$|E

Measurements of this effect were performed with L-band and X-band radiometers mounted on a mobile truck on a bare 40 m x 45 m row tilled field; the soil moisture content during measurements ranged from 10 to 30 % by dry weight. Results showed that the variations of the antenna temperatures with incident angle changed with the azimuth angle measured from the row direction.

40|$|Recent {{observation}} {{from the}} Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory shows that gamma-ray emission after a solar flare {{can last for}} as long as 8 hours. There is also evidence that electrons and protons are accelerated only during the impulsive phase of the flare and are subsequently mirror trapped in coronal magnetic loops. This poses the following dilemma: if the magnetic field lines in the loop are simple plane arches, the protons will drift across the cross section of the loop in seconds to minutes, rather than hours. To solve the dilemma, we use guiding center theory to show that long-term containment of energetic protons in a coronal loop is possible if magnetic field lines have enough twist. We also find that in the trapped region of the loop, the twist <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> lines between the mirror points of a bounce orbit is approximately 2 pi...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{need for}} a wide <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> and high resolution {{has led to the}} use of spatially variant sensors in active vision systems. The use of such sensors however necessitates the existence of gaze control mechanisms for guiding the foveal high resolution region of the sensor to points of interest in the visual world. While bottom-up alerting cues such as motion have previously been used for this purpose, tasks such as visual search are better facilitated by top-down guidance mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the use of iconic scene descriptions for top-down foveal targeting. These descriptions {{take the form of a}} vector of responses of a bank of steerable filters at multiple scales and orientations. Such a representation has a number of useful properties such as rotation and scale invariance, partial view-insensitivity and tolerance to occlusions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [38]- 39) Introducing columnar defects {{into high}} Tc superconductors by heavy ion irradiation {{is known to}} be {{the most effective way to}} suppress dissipation in the vortex state. It was found tha t even above Tc columnar defects still have a noticeable influence on the conductivity. To account for this effect we calculated the correction to the fluctuation conductivity due to the defects using a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach, with the defects modeled as cylindrical regions with suppressed Tc. For zero magnetic field and for fields far from Hc 2) parallel to the columns, we calculated the induced correction with logarithmic accuracy and found tha t it does not depend on the defect strength in the vicinity of Tc. For fields close to Hc 2 and parallel to the columnar, defects we obtained the correction exactly within the lowest Landau level approximation (LLL). We analyzed the dependence of the conductivity on the tilting <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> within a LLL approximation and found that the defect-induced angular dependence is opposite to the anisotropy-induced dependence. We were also able to obtain a logarithmically accurate dependence of the conductivity for large tilting angles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a basic data on {{conservation}} planning of a traditional residential area by analysing the visual effects of townscapings. First, a certain residential area designated as a conservation area by Nagano City was considered. The characteristics of the area were analysed by the investigation of the scenes. Then the scenes were classified into eleven groups. And the physical elements which make up the visual environment were abstracted. Secondly, for drawing the perspectives, the width of the visual <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> was investigated by making a comparison between the classifications on the scenes and those of five photographs groups taken on them by fisheye lens and lenses with focal lengths of 21 mm, 28 mm, 35 mm and 50 mm respectively. Judging from the degree of correspondence in the classifications, the 35 mm lens's width was found the most suitable to the visual field. Using this width, fifteen drawings of typical scenes of the area were made. Then sixty-five altered drawings were made, under the following four transfiguration measures : i) to remove the street installations such as road-signs and utility poles, ii) to remodel the walls, gates and house into traditinal style, iii) to reconstruct the water ways along the street, and iv) to transfigure i) to iii) simultaneously. Lastly, the changes of the visual effects of the scenes from the present to the altered were evaluated using the seven bipolar semantic scales.
