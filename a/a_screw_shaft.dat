50|$|A vacuum {{variable}} capacitor uses {{a set of}} plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid {{in or out of}} an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. <b>A</b> <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio as well as high powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient since the elements are under a vacuum the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>screw</b> is <b>a</b> {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force.

When the <b>shaft</b> of the <b>screw</b> is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating <b>a</b> wood <b>screw</b> forces it into wood.

40|$|The Twin-Screw Configuration Problem (TSCP) {{consists}} {{in identifying the}} best location {{of a set of}} available screw elements along <b>a</b> <b>screw</b> <b>shaft.</b> Due to its combinatorial nature, it {{can be seen as a}} sequencing problem. In addition, different conflicting objectives may have to be considered when defining a screw configuration and, thus, it is usually tackled as a multi-objective optimization problem. In this research, a multi-objective ant colony optimization (MOACO) algorithm was adapted to deal with the TSCP. The influence of different parameters of the MOACO algorithm was studied and its performance was compared with that of a previously proposed multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and a two-phase local search algorithm. The experimental results showed that MOACO algorithms have a significant potential for solving the TSCP.

50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller screw are the <b>screw</b> <b>shaft,</b> nut and planetary roller. The <b>screw,</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the screw and encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction transmission elements between screw and nut. The rollers typically have a single-start thread with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with screw and nut. The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers. As with <b>a</b> lead <b>screw</b> or ball screw, rotation of the nut results in screw travel, and rotation of the screw results in nut travel.|$|R

Bartola also manufactured organ lifts, recognizable by their distinctive four posts—one at each corner of the lift, and topped by metallic spheres.
