The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) made the provision of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> data a mandatory requirement for the carriage of bulk liquid chemicals transported by sea in tank ships, thereby creating the need for inhalation data on many hundreds of chemicals in bulk maritime transport. Taking note of previously published proposals for estimating <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> hazards for chemicals, and the paucity of measured experimental data, an extrapolation method has been developed by the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) to partly fulfil this need. This method {{should be seen as}} a pragmatic approach to the challenge of missing measured experimental test data, with the added benefit of reducing tests in experimental animals. The method is based on a route-to-route (i. e. between-route) extrapolation of information on acute oral and/or dermal toxicity, in combination with data on the potential for irritation and/or corrosion to skin and eyes. The validation of this method was based on the individual evaluation of <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies for 330 chemicals, including mixtures and many important chemical groups, for which the IMO holds public and industryconfidential data.

A September 2016 workshop, “Alternative Approaches for <b>Acute</b> <b>Inhalation</b> <b>Toxicity</b> Testing to Address Global Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Data Requirements”, explored current testing requirements and ongoing efforts to achieve global regulatory acceptance for non-animal testing approaches.

40|$|New {{surface-active}} {{agents in}} waterproofing sprays are often tested for <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> in vivo {{on the basis}} of OECD Test Guideline 403. A screening test using the isolated perfused rat lung (IPRL) is proposed {{in order to reduce the}} number of acute inhalation tests and to refine these. The test comprises exposure of IPRLs to aerosolised formulations of the water proofing agents and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters. Substances revealing harmful effects on the IPRL, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis formation, did also show changes in respiratory parameters up to mortality in in vivo tests with rats. Thus, pre-testing in the IPRL allows the identification of surface-active substances causing <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> To assess the potential lung toxicity of seven formulations, each tested in two male and two female IPRLs, we evaluated changes in the respiratory parameters tidal volume, compliance, and resistance, edema and atelectasis formation, taking into account the inhaled doses. These IPRL results were compared with available in vivo results and a good or excellent correlation in six out of seven cases was revealed. In conclusion, the use of the IPRL is well suited for screening substances showing <b>acute</b> "physical" <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Therefore, for future assessment of surface active substances, it is suggested to use this test prior to in vivo inhalation tests. Formulations with no acute harmful effects on the IPRL need to be further investigated in vivo for complete risk assessment.

40|$|Cell-based {{in vitro}} methods using the “air-lifted interface” culture {{technique}} have been applied to test the biological activity of airborne materials from different sources such as environmental, workplace or chemical compounds, also, in their relevant inhalable state. A good predictability for <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> testing could be demonstrated in a pre-validation study using relatively high toxic chemical gases such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone and inert gases. To extend this range of substances, a set of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was tested for applicability using this short-exposure in vitro test. Therefore, a test matrix of different VOCs was set up from the database of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), including VOCs differing in <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> and hydrophobicity. Cell-based in vitro testing was carried out using vaporized compounds, an improved air-liquid interface in vitro procedure (PRIT ExpoCube) using a human lung cell line (A 549 cells) and measurement of cytotoxicity (WST- 1). In vitro ED 50 values were estimated from dose-response curves and correlated to in vivo <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> data.

In order to refine {{and reduce the}} number of acute inhalation tests performed, we propose a screening test that uses isolated lungs. The test consists of the exposure of isolated, ventilated and perfused rat lungs, to aerosolised formulations of waterproofing agents (mass median aerodynamic diameter = 1 mu m), and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters and gross pathology analysis. A pilot evaluation of the isolated perfused rat lung model for use in a screening test was carried out by blind testing 12 surface-active substances. The results obtained compared well with data available from in vivo acute inhalation studies. Substances that triggered harmful effects, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis of the isolated perfused lung, were also found to cause changes in respiratory parameters, some of which would be severe enough to lead to death in in vivo tests with rats. The changes in respiratory parameters suggest that the mode-of-action is associated with impairment of the surfactant layer.

It begins with a sighting study that precedes the main FCP study and is used to determine the main study starting concentration. In this paper, we propose a modification to the sighting study and suggest that it should be conducted using both male and female animals, rather than just animals of a single gender. Statistical analysis demonstrates that, when females are more sensitive, the new procedure is likely to give the same classification as the original FCP, whereas, if males are more sensitive, the new procedure is much less likely to lead to incorrect classification into a less toxic category. If there is no difference in the LC 50 for females and males, the new procedure is slightly more likely to classify into a more stringent class than the original FCP. Overall, these results show that the revised sighting study ensures gender differences in sensitivity do not significantly impact on the performance of the FCP, supporting its use as an alternative test method for assessing <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity...</b>|$|R

Two new methods, the recently adopted acute toxic class method (ATC; OECD TG 436) and a proposed fixed concentration procedure (FCP), have recently been considered, but statistical evaluations of these methods did not investigate the influence of differential sensitivity {{between male and female}} rats on the outcomes. This paper presents an analysis of data from the assessment of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> for 56 substances. Statistically significant differences between the LC 50 for males and females were found for 16 substances, with greater than 10 -fold differences in the LC 50 for two substances.

With TG 403, a gender difference leads to a slightly greater chance of under-classification. This is also the case for the ATC method, but more pronounced than for TG 403, with misclassification of nearly all substances from Globally Harmonised System (GHS) class 3 into class 4. As the FCP uses females only, if females are more sensitive, the classification is unchanged. If males are more sensitive, the procedure may lead to under-classification.

The basic ALI procedure has been successfully prevalidated as a short-exposure test (1 hour exposures) for chemical gases. However, although a good predictability for highly toxic gaseous compounds or non-toxic inert gases could be demonstrated, {{it was not clear}} until now, if highly hydrophobic or low-toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can also be assessed by cell based methods in vitro under these conditions with regard to a relevant estimate of their <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> characteristics in vivo.

The new design {{consists of a}} range-finding test, which is compatible with a conventional limit test, and can be followed by determination of a concentration-time-mortality relationship, enabling calculation of LC 50 (50 % mortality exposure concentration) values. By exposing pairs of rats for different periods of time to about four different test concentrations in a nose-only exposure unit, LT 50 (50 % mortality exposure time) values were obtained for five pairs of animals per concentration. The mortality data of the approximate 20 time-concentration combinations were {{used to calculate the}} probit relationship. Estimated mortality responses from these probit relations were compared with mortality figures obtained by exposing groups of five male rats and five female rats whole-body according to conventional toxicity testing. In general, there was good correspondence between the estimated and the observed mortality response. In our hands, the determination of the concentration-time-mortality relationship takes about the same number of animals (40 - 50) as the conventional LC 50 procedure according to the OECD guideline 403. However, the new method has several additional advantages such as: (A) LC 50 values are obtained over a 10 -fold range in time, with the potential of decreasing the number of animals used when regulations require <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> data for different periods of exposure. (B) The obtained relationship contains considerably more valuable information for risk assessment than the LC 50 value. (C) The method is less sensitive to small fluctuations in test substance concentrations which is important especially for substances with steep concentration-response curves.

Since the <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> cannot be predicted a priori based on the physical and chemical properties of the formulation, proper test strategies are required to ensure consumer safety.

This is carried out by spraying defined quantities of the product into a control volume and measuring the concentration of health related size fractions. This procedure takes into account spray ageing, especially size reduction of the droplets due to solvent evaporation.

40|$|AbstractAcute oral, dermal and <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> classifications of {{chemicals}} under the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) should typically {{be based on}} data from rats and rabbits, with the tacit assumption that such characterizations are valid for human risk. However this assumption is not appropriate in all cases. A case in point is the <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> classification of ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether (EGBE, 2 -butoxyethanol, CAS 111 - 76 - 2), where <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> data from rats or rabbits leads to an overly conservative assessment of toxicity. Hemolysis is the primary response elicited in sensitive species following EGBE administration and the proximate toxicant in this response is 2 -butoxyacetic acid (BAA), the major metabolite of EGBE. The sensitivity of erythrocytes to this effect varies between species; rats and rabbits are sensitive to BAA-mediated hemolysis, whereas humans and guinea pigs are not. In this publication, a weight of evidence approach for the acute hazard classification of EGBE under GHS is presented. The approach uses <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> data from guinea pigs with supporting mechanistic and pharmacokinetic data in conjunction with human experience and shows that adopting the standard method results in over-classification...|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} {{toxicology}} studies, an attractive {{feature of the}} worm as a model {{is its ability to}} predict mammalian toxicity. The order of <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> of some metallic salts to C. elegans has been demonstrated to be comparable to the order of their <b>acute</b> <b>toxicities</b> to rats and mice (Williams & Dusenbery, 1988). Cole et al. (2004) determined the <b>acute</b> behavioral <b>toxicities</b> of 13 organophosphorus insecticides to C. elegans and compared the values to <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> values of the same insecticides for rats and mice. They reported that the order of toxicity in C. elegans significantly correlated with that of rats and mice. A similar correlation between the toxicities in C. elegans and rats has been reported for ten OPIs (Rajini, Melstrom, & Williams, 2008). Our data on <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> of monocrotophos to C. elegans (LC 50 of 35.5  mM) is in close agreement with other studies that evaluated <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> of monocrotophos in C. elegans (Leelaja & Rajini, 2013; Rajini et al., 2008).|$|R

Intoxications were confirmed with immunoassays and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which also detected novel psychoactive substances.
