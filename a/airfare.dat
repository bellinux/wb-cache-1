40|$|Government and {{industry}} are exploring approaches, such as technology (e. g. SESAR/NextGen) and market-based methods, {{to address the}} pervasive delays in the air transportation system. Resistance {{to some of the}} proposed market-based strategies are based on uncertainties of the societal and economic outcomes; specifically, there is a concern that fewer markets might be served, that service within existing markets might be decreased, that <b>airfares</b> might rise significantly and that airline profitability will suffer. This paper describes a comparison of the behavior of the air transportation system (e. g. markets served, <b>airfares,</b> delays, load factors, aircraft size) during the recent run-up in fuel prices at capacity-limited New York airports and non-slot controlled San Francisco and Philadelphia airports. The results of the modeled airline behavior shows: i. <b>Airfares</b> change in proportion to changes in fuel prices. ii. Flights per day and markets served change in proportion to changes in airport capacity limits. iii. Average aircraft size changes in proportion to changes in <b>airfares,</b> number of markets served, and number of flights per day. iv. Airline profitability changes in proportion to flights per day, <b>airfares,</b> and average aircraft size. The implications of these results are discussed in this paper...|$|R

This quarter ended a five-year streak of placing in the top 3 highest priced airports in the country. Later, in the 4th Quarter of 2015, CVG dropped to the 22nd most expensive airport, placing it at its lowest ranking since the DOT began keeping track of <b>airfares</b> in 1995.

40|$|While the US airline {{industry}} has been substantially transformed {{in recent years by}} the growth of low-cost airlines, the cost-saving benefits of lower <b>airfares</b> are difficult to gauge empirically. There are two important ways in which this paper contributes to the existing literature on the impact of the low-cost carriers (LCCs). First, the availability of route-level panel data allows us to examine the role of the LCCs in the long-run adjustment of <b>airfares</b> as well as the responses of the incumbent carriers to LCC entry and exit in a dynamic setting. Second, we capitalize on recent developments in spatial econometrics and explicitly model the spatial dependence among adjacent airline routes, an issue often ignored by previous studies. Although most of the pro-competitive effects of LCC entry take place after entry, we find evidence that the incumbent carriers also cut <b>airfares</b> in anticipation of entry by the LCCs. Moreover fares remain lower even after Southwest Airlines exits. Our empirical analysis confirms the spatial dependence among <b>airfares</b> in adjacent routes, provides estimates of the consumer benefits from lower <b>airfares</b> in routes affected by LCCs, and shows that there are substantial indirect benefits, i. e. lower fares in spatially-linked, nearby routes.

40|$|We {{calculate}} mutual-best-response route {{networks for}} profit maximizing airlines serving large US air-traffic-hub cities. A simulated annealing algorithm determines which of over ten thousand potential routes receive direct or hub-and-spoke service. DOT’s Origin and Destination Survey {{is used to}} calibrate airline revenue and cost functions. Simulated route structures, <b>airfares,</b> passenger flows, and market concentration levels closely approximate actual US networks comprising over seventy percent of domestic air travel. The results support several controversial positions regarding airline competition. Average <b>airfares</b> by route are consistent with price-taking behavior. Existing industry concentration levels can be justified by cost-reducing economies of scale and scope. Control of multiple airports by individual airlines currently has minimal effects on <b>airfares</b> or passenger flows. Socially optimal route structures would concentrate traffic at fewer and larger airports—but reduce costs only modestly. Airport pricing and capacity can significantly affect network traffic patterns. Investigation of strategic pricing is left for future research.

40|$|Travelers {{residing}} in communities having either small or medium-sized airports often avoid using the local airports in their regions, and use other (out-of-region) airports {{to take advantage}} of lower fares and more convenient airline services. This phenomenon is generally referred to as airport leakage. Airport leakage can exist even in regions where the nearest substitute (airport) is over 150 miles away (i. e., in single-airport regions). This paper argues that airlines may have under-estimated the airport-leakage tendencies of travelers in single-airport regions, and consequently their current <b>airfares</b> in these regions may be higher than the optimal, or revenue-maximizing, levels. To test the validity of this argument, a simulation experiment was conducted by using the data for Des Moines International Airport (DSM), a medium airport serving the single-airport region in central Iowa (USA). The results imply that, for most airlines, current <b>airfares</b> in DSM may be higher than the optimal, and that they may increase revenues (or profits) by reducing <b>airfares</b> in DSM.

The study was based on quantitative research methods using automated internet data collection and statistical analysis (ANOVA tests). During the study, we created a database containing more than 31 thousand ticket prices over a 182 -day period for the three selected destinations. Empirical findings showed that no single website offered lowest <b>airfares</b> consistently and metasearch sites outperformed OTAs in almost any cases by offering lower <b>airfares.</b> Results also indicated the best time to book flights on the selected sites, <b>airfares</b> for shoulder season were significantly cheaper than for high season and ticket prices tend to be more expensive on Mondays and Sundays...|$|R
