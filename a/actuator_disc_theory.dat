40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance of}} the low solidity curved-bladed Darrieus {{vertical axis wind turbine}} has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. Initial studies showed the need for an engineering prediction scheme sufficiently accurate to give blade forces as functions of rotational position which did not require excessive computational time. The scheme proposed here develops a suggestion first made by Lapin in 1975, to treat the turbine as two <b>actuator</b> <b>discs,</b> one upwind and the other down-wind. This suggestion, combined with a multiple streamtube approach, the momentum equations in the freestream direction and blade element theory enables the system of equations to be solved. A continuity argument connects the flow between the two <b>discs.</b> The <b>theory</b> does not rely on analytic formulations for aerofoil force coefficients and can therefore use data obtained from experiment, tabulated for a range of Reynolds numbers, thereby including the effects of stall and drag. Comparison with the power coefficients obtained from experiments, using a two-bladed wind tunnel turbine at a Reynolds number of 28, 000 (based on free wind speed and blade chord) shows that the theory is accurate enough to detect the effect of dynamic stall. It is also shown that the continuity argument is essential for improved power output predictions, over earlier single <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> <b>theories.</b> The new theory also indicates large differences between air speeds on the upwind and downwind sides of the turbine. These were also confirmed by experiment. Comparison of blade force predictions with those obtained using a computationally expensive time-marching discrete vortex theory shows that good estimates are obtained over the normal turbine operating range. At present only a uniform freestream is treated and turbulence is not accounted for...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEmbedding tidal {{turbines}} within {{simulations of}} realistic large-scale tidal flows {{is a highly}} multi-scale problem that poses significant computational challenges.

40|$|A {{versatile}} {{numerical model}} for the simulation of flow past horizontal axis tidal turbines has been developed. Currently most large-scale marine models employed to study marine energy use the shallow water equations and therefore can fail to account for important turbulent physics. The model presented here is based on <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> momentum (ADM) <b>theory,</b> uses a RANS model to account for turbulence and utilises mesh optimisation {{in order to address}} the multi-scale nature of the problem. Furthermore, a series of laboratory experiments were carried out in the hydrodynamics laboratory of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Imperial College London which were used to help validate the numerical model. Turbulence correction terms have been used to capture the short circuiting of the turbulence cascade due to the presence of the disc and thereby improve the match with the experimental data. This model has been developed with the aim that it will be seamlessly combined with larger numerical models simulating tidal flows in realistic domains, e. g. the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth. This is where the adaptive meshing capability is a major advantage as it enables the mesh to be refined only in the locations required, thus making optimal use of limited computational resources.

40|$|AbstractHydrodynamic {{modelling}} is {{an important}} tool {{for the development of}} tidal stream energy projects. Many hydrodynamic models incorporate the effect of tidal turbines through an enhanced bottom drag. In this paper we show that although for coarse grid resolutions (kilometre scale) the resulting force exerted on the flow agrees well with the theoretical value, the force starts decreasing with decreasing grid sizes when these become smaller than the length scale of the wake recovery. This is because the assumption that the upstream velocity can be approximated by the local model velocity, is no longer valid. Using linear momentum <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> <b>theory</b> however, we derive a relationship between these two velocities and formulate a correction to the enhanced bottom drag formulation that consistently applies a force that remains close to the theoretical value, for all grid sizes down to the turbine scale. In addition, {{a better understanding of the}} relation between the model, upstream, and actual turbine velocity, as predicted by <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> <b>theory,</b> leads to an improved estimate of the usefully extractable energy.

One of the key findings from applying LMADT to open channel flow is that the efficiency of an arbitrary array of turbines can be determined relative to the total power extracted from the channel flow, including the effects of downstream mixing.

40|$|A new {{theoretical}} approach is proposed to predict a practical upper {{limit to the}} efficiency {{of a very large}} wind farm. The new theory suggests that the efficiency of ideal turbines in an ideal very large wind farm depends primarily on a non-dimensional parameter λ/C_f 0, where λ is the ratio of the rotor swept area to the land area (for each turbine) and C_f 0 is a natural friction coefficient observed before constructing the farm. When λ/C_f 0 approaches to zero, the new theory goes back to the classical <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> <b>theory,</b> yielding the well-known Betz limit. When λ/C_f 0 increases to a large value, the maximum power coefficient of each turbine reduces whilst a normalised power density of the farm increases asymptotically to an upper limit.

40|$|The {{helicopter}} project CHANCE contains, {{among other}} developments, the quasi-steady approximation to modelling rotors with <b>actuator</b> <b>discs.</b> This reduces {{the cost of}} an unsteady simulation down to a stationary one. In testing existing approaches in the literature, the source term implementation proved to perform best especially in forward flight: source terms located on the disc bottom side impart impulse and energy to the fluid. These are obtained from a loose coupling between two DLR codes: the flow solver FLOWer and the rotor code S 4. The latter provides a rotor map, a radial and azimuthal force distribution, to the former converting it to the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> map (source terms).

40|$|Most {{state of}} the art rotor design methods are based on the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> <b>theory</b> {{developed}} about one century ago. The actuator disc is an axisymmetric permeable surface carrying a load that represents the load on a real rotor with a finite number of blades N. However, the mathematics of the transition from a real rotor load to an axisymmetrically loaded disc is not yet presented in literature. By formulating an actuator disc equation of motion in which the Bernoulli constant H is expressed in kinematical terms, a comparison of the power conversion and load on the disc and rotor is possible. For both the converted power is expressed as a change of angular momentum times rotational speed. The limits for N ? ? while the chord c ? 0, the rotational speed ? ? ?, the load F becoming uniform by ?F/?r ? 0 and the thickness ? ? 0 confirm that the classical disc represents the rotor with an infinite number of blades.

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new {{automatic}} procedure to generate hybrid meshes to simulate turbulent flows for wind farm design and management. In particular, numerical modeling of wind farms involves a RANS simulation of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flow and modeling the turbines using the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> <b>theory.</b> Therefore, the generated meshes have to fulfill several geometrical requirements {{to answer to}} the different modeling features. They must: capture the topography features that can influence the wind flow; have a boundary layer close to the terrain to resolve the ABL; be conformally adapted to the disc (turbine) to simulate the turbine effects on the wind flow; be adapted around the disc to capture the wake effect; and present a smooth mesh size transition around the disc to conform the mesh size of the ABL mesh, in which the turbines are immersed. We highlight that the mesh generation procedure is fully automatic once given the mesh size, a topography description, the wind inflow direction, a list of turbine insertion points, and the turbine models.

40|$|Linear {{momentum}} <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> <b>theory</b> (LMADT) {{is extended}} {{to address the}} power available to a tidal turbine array spanning the cross-section of an open channel flow. A generalised formulation is presented which relaxes constraints in previous models on the Froude number of the flow and geometry of the turbine array, and also considers the effects of far-wake mixing on the overall power removed from the flow. In the limiting case of no free surface deformation, the rigid-lid model of Garret and Cummins (2007) is recovered. Blockage, the ratio of turbine frontal area to the cross-sectional area of the surrounding flow passage, has the greatest effect on available power, with the peak power coefficient increasing by 55 % from 0. 60 to 0. 93 as the blockage ratio increases from 0. 05 to 0. 20. A further 3 % increase in peak power coefficient is achieved as the Froude number increases from 0. 05 to 0. 20.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} the summary of 3 years of {{research}} on the wake aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbine at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. In particular, the main results and the conclusions of two experimental campaigns are collected. The underlying research question is: how do the near-wake turbulent flow structures affect the re-energising of the far wake and to what extend is the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> assumption valid for the representation of the near wake dynamics? In the first experiments, stereo particle image velocimetry is used for analysing the turbulent velocity field in the near and transition wake of a small two-bladed wind turbine model. The results showed the important role of the tip-vortex helix instability (leapfrogging) in the mixing process and in the re-energising of the wake. The tip-vortex instability and breakdown, in fact, give rise to a more efficient turbulent mixing.

The limitations of this approach in reproducing the wake losses in wind farm simulations have been proven by a previous research. The present study is aimed at providing an experimental analysis of the near-wake turbulent flow of a wind turbine (WT) and a porous <b>disc,</b> emulating the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> numerical model. The general purpose is to highlight the similarities and to quantify the differences of the two models in the near-wake region, characterised by the largest discrepancies. The velocity fields {{in the wake of}} a wind turbine model and a porous disc (emulation of the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> numerical model) have been measured in a wind tunnel using stereo particle image velocimetry. The study has been conducted at low turbulence intensity in order to separate the problems of the flow mixing caused by the external turbulence and the one caused by the turbulence induced directly by the AD or the WT presence. The analysis, as such, showed the intrinsic differences and similarities between the flows in the two wakes, solely due to the wake-induced flow, with no influence of external flow fluctuations. The data analysis provided the time-average three-component velocity and turbulence intensity fields, pressure fields, rotor and disc loading, vorticity fields, stagnation enthalpy distribution, and mean-flow kinetic-energy fluxes in the shear layer at the border of the wake. The properties have been compared in the wakes of the two models.

It is found that three rows of turbines extending across the entire width of the Pentland Firth and blocking a large fraction of the channel can theoretically generate 1. 9 GW, averaged over the spring-neap cycle. However, generation of significantlymore power than this is unlikely to be feasible as the available power per additional swept area of turbine is too small to be viable.

A significant shift in the characteristics of the machine, associated to a slight enlargement of the wake, is made possible in the frame of the new model. Comparison reveals a better fit with experimental data...|$|R

The RANS equations of an uncompressible flow are solved with a multigrid coupled solver (MIGAL); turbulence is closed with the RNG k-ɛ model. The rotor of a wind turbine is modeled by an <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> providing a resistive force which is calculated from the thrust coefficient curve of wind turbine. The axial thrust can be distributed over the swept area in three different manners: by a uniform, parabolic or a polynomial distribution. A wake is therefore generated downstream of each turbine with wake deficit and induced turbulence. When using the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> technique it is also interesting to observe how the wake-wake, wake-terrain interactions are predicted; moreover, also simulations with <b>actuator</b> <b>discs</b> and flows with thermal effects can be carried out. In this work we present first a series of simulations over a single turbine for a grid sensitivity study, {{in the second part}} a validation against production data from the offshore wind farm Horns Rev is presented...|$|R
