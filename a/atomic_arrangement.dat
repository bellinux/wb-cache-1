25|$|Crystals are {{commonly}} recognized by their shape, consisting of flat faces with sharp angles. These shape characteristics are {{not necessary for}} a crystal—a crystal is scientifically defined by its microscopic <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement,</b> not its macroscopic shape—but the characteristic macroscopic shape is often present and easy to see.|$|E
25|$|The {{inspection}} of the LEED pattern gives a qualitative picture of the surface periodicity i.e. {{the size of the}} surface unit cell and to a certain degree of surface symmetries. However it will give no information about the <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement</b> within a surface unit cell or the sites of adsorbed atoms. For instance if the whole superstructure in figure 5.b is shifted such that the atoms adsorb in bridge sites instead of on-top sites the LEED pattern will be the same.|$|E
40|$|The <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> in {{zinc blende}} {{structured}} GaNxAs 1 −x thin films coherently grown on V-grooved substrates are theoretically investigated using empirical interatomic potentials and Monte Carlo simulation. The resultant <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> in GaNxAs 1 −x strongly depend on concentration x and substrate lattice parameter asub. Surface segregation of As or N is mainly found in GaNxAs 1 −x with large lattice mismatch to the substrate. On the other hand, the novel <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> such as layered segregation or ordered structure {{are found in}} GaNxAs 1 −x at the specific region such as (x, asub) = (0. 5, 5. 3), (0. 3, 5. 3), and (0. 3, 5. 1). This specific region corresponds to that with negative excess energy and with sufficient N and As atoms remaining in thin film layers even after their surface segregation. The formation of the novel <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> is {{discussed in terms of}} bond lengths in the surface layers. These results suggest that various novel <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> in alloy semiconductor thin films appear depending on x and asub which control degree of lattice constraint...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical, optical, {{magnetic}} {{and electronic}} properties of amorphous materials hold great promise towards current and emergent technologies. We distinguish {{at least four}} categories of amorphous (glassy) materials: (i) metallic; (ii) thin films; (iii) organic and inorganic thermoplastics; and (iv) amorphous permanent networks. Some fundamental questions about the <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> remain unresolved. This paper focuses on the models of <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> in amorphous materials. The earliest ideas of Bernal {{on the structure of}} liquids were followed by experiments and computer models for the packing of spheres. Modern approach is to carry out computer simulations with prediction that can be tested by experiments. A geometrical concept of an ideal amorphous solid is presented as a novel contribution to the understanding of <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> in amorphous solids...|$|R

25|$|Due to spin-orbit coupling, undoped GaAs {{single crystal}} {{exhibits}} much larger Faraday rotation than glass (SiO2). Considering the <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement</b> is different along the (100) and (110) plane, {{one might think}} the Faraday rotation is polarization dependent. However, experimental work revealed an immeasurable anisotropy in the wavelength range from 880–1,600nm. Based on the large Faraday rotation, one {{might be able to}} use GaAs to calibrate the B field of the terahertz electromagnetic wave which requires very fast response time. Around the band gap, the Faraday effect shows resonance behavior.|$|E
25|$|Crystals {{can have}} certain special electrical, optical, and {{mechanical}} properties that glass and polycrystals normally cannot. These properties {{are related to}} the anisotropy of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement.</b> One such property is the piezoelectric effect, where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is birefringence, where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, and Young's modulus, may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, graphite crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.|$|E
2500|$|Ordered <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement.</b> This {{generally}} means crystalline, however, crystals {{are also}} periodic, so the broader criterion is used instead. An ordered <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{gives rise to}} a variety of macroscopic physical properties, such as crystal form, hardness, and cleavage. There have been several recent proposals to classify biogenic or amorphous substances as minerals.

2500|$|The {{flat faces}} (also called facets) of a {{euhedral}} crystal are oriented {{in a specific}} way relative to the underlying <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the crystal: they are planes of relatively low Miller index. This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower surface energy). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.) ...|$|E
2500|$|By definition, {{minerals}} have {{a characteristic}} <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Weakness in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness, and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage. The quality of cleavage {{can be described}} based on how cleanly and easily the mineral breaks; common descriptors, in order of decreasing quality, are [...] "perfect", [...] "good", [...] "distinct", and [...] "poor". In particularly transparent mineral, or in thin-section, cleavage can be seen a series of parallel lines marking the planar surfaces when viewed at a side. Cleavage is not a universal property among minerals; for example, quartz, consisting of extensively interconnected silica tetrahedra, {{does not have a}} crystallographic weakness which would allow it to cleave. In contrast, micas, which have perfect basal cleavage, consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together.|$|E
2500|$|In general, the {{g factor}} {{is not a}} number but a second-rank tensor {{represented}} by 9 numbers arranged in a 3×3 matrix. The principal axes of this tensor {{are determined by the}} local fields, for example, by the local <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement</b> around the unpaired spin in a solid or in a molecule. Choosing an appropriate coordinate system (say, x,y,z) allows one to [...] "diagonalize" [...] this tensor, thereby reducing the maximal number of its components from 9 to 3: gxx, gyy and gzz. For a single spin experiencing only Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field, the position of the EPR resonance is given by the expression gxxBx + gyyBy + gzzBz. Here Bx, By and Bz are the components of the magnetic field vector in the coordinate system (x,y,z); their magnitudes change as the field is rotated, so does the frequency of the resonance. For a large ensemble of randomly oriented spins, the EPR spectrum consists of three peaks of characteristic shape at frequencies gxxB0, gyyB0 and gzzB0: the low-frequency peak is positive in first-derivative spectra, the high-frequency peak is negative, and the central peak is bipolar. Such situation is commonly observed in powders, and the spectra are therefore called [...] "powder-pattern spectra". In crystals, the number of EPR lines is determined by the number of crystallographically equivalent orientations of the EPR spin (called [...] "EPR center").|$|E

60|$|The {{prevalent}} natural {{philosophy of}} the present day is that which is called corpuscular, because it assumes {{the existence of a}} first matter, consisting of corpuscula or atoms, which are supposed to be definite, though extremely small, quantities, invested with the qualities of extension, impenetrability, and the like; and from certain combinations of these qualities, Life is considered, by some persons, to be a necessary result. This philosophy Mr. Coleridge combats. The supposed atoms, he says, are mere abstractions of the mind; and Life is not a thing, the result of <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangement</b> or action, but is itself an act, or process. He refutes various definitions of Life, such as, that it is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted; or, that it depends on the faculty of nutrition, or of anti-putrescence. His own definition he proposes merely as an hypothesis. Life, he says, is “the principle of Individuation,” that is to say, it is a power which discloses itself from within, combining many qualities into one individual thing. This individualising principle unites, as he conceives, with the cooperating action of magnetism, electricity, and chemistry. At least, such is the inference to be drawn from the present state of science; though it is easily conceivable that future discoveries may bring us acquainted with powers more directly connected with Life. The most general law governing the action of Life, as a tendency to individuation, is here designated polarity; for instance, the power termed magnetism (not meaning that there is necessarily an actual tangible magnet in the case) has two poles, the negative, answering to attraction, rest, carbon, &c., and the positive, answering to repulsion, mobility, azote, &c.; and as the magnetic needle which points to the north necessarily indicates thereby the south, so the power disposing to rest has necessarily a counteracting influence disposing to mobility, between which lies the point of indifference. Now this quality, to which Mr. Coleridge gives the name of polarity, is in truth nothing more than an exemplification of the doctrine of opposites, the πρός ἂλληλα ἀντικειμένω ἀντίθεσις, which the Eleatic Philosopher, in Plato’s “Sophist,” applies to the idea of existence and non-existence, and which accompanies every other idea as its shadow, whether in physics, in intellect, or in morals; for the finite is opposed to the infinite, the false to the true, the evil to the good, and so forth; which we say, not to derogate from the value of Mr. Coleridge’s application of the doctrine, of which he has very ably availed himself; but merely to explain the term polarity, by referring it, as a species, to a higher genus of intellectual conceptions.|$|E

30|$|The triclinic {{structure}} of OCP displays apatitic layers (with <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> of calcium and orthophosphate ions {{similar to those}} of HA) separated by hydrated layers (with <b>atomic</b> <b>arrangements</b> of calcium and orthophosphate ions similar to those in DCPD) (LeGeros 1991; Elliott 1994; Amjad 1997; Suzuki 2010 a). A similarity in crystal structure between OCP and HA (Brown 1962; Brown et al. 1962) is one reason that the epitaxial growth of these phases is observed. It is generally assumed that, in solutions, the hydrated layer of the (100) face is the layer most likely exposed to solution. The water content of OCP crystals is ~ 20  % that of DCPD and this is partly responsible for its lower solubility.
