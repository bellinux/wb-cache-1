40|$|Despite several {{full-scale}} {{applications in}} Canada, the vibrational characteristics {{and performance of}} aluminium pedestrian bridges have not been studied comprehensively in the literature. There is a large degree of variability between design codes and standards, particularly in North America and Europe. This is {{in part due to}} a lack of comprehensive experimental test data on full-scale pedestrian bridges. This is compounded by a lack of agreement between researchers on the characterization of pedestrian induced loads and the interaction between loads and the structure. This thesis aims to bridge this gap by building and testing full-scale aluminum pedestrian bridges in a controlled laboratory test program. Results from the experimental program are presented, discussed in detail, and used to estimate the vibration characteristics of an aluminium pedestrian bridge of various lengths. These characteristics include the modal properties [...] natural frequency, damping ratio, and mode shapes [...] and human-structure interactions measured using accelerometers, load cells, and strain gauges. Using multiple signal processing techniques, these characteristics were extracted from the data. The results from the pedestrian loading tests were then used to assess the bridge specimens through the above-mentioned design codes. Finite element models of each specimen were built and used for parameter studies and model verification. These data from full-scale pedestrian bridges are likely to shed new light on their vibrational behaviour and performance, and <b>allow</b> <b>aluminium</b> bridge designers to create competitive alternatives to bridges constructed with conventional materials. It is also anticipated that these tests will form a foundation for future research in the area of pedestrian bridge load modelling...|$|E

50|$|Nikasil was {{introduced}} by Mahle in 1967, initially developed to allow rotary engine apex seals (NSU Ro 80, Citroën GS Birotor and Mercedes C111) to work directly against the aluminium housing. This coating <b>allowed</b> <b>aluminium</b> cylinders and pistons to work directly against each other with low wear and friction. Unlike other methods, including cast iron cylinder liners, Nikasil allowed very large cylinder bores with tight tolerances and thus allowed existing engine designs to be expanded easily. The aluminium cylinders also gave a much better heat conductivity than cast iron liners, an important attribute for a high-output engine. The coating was further developed {{as a replacement for}} hard-chrome plated cylinder bores for Mercury Marine Racing, Kohler Engines, and as a repair replacement for factory-chromed snowmobiles, dirt bikes, ATVs, watercraft and automotive V8 liners/bores.|$|R

As an environmentally friendlier alternative, hydrides or other reducing agents can often be used to accomplish the same synthetic result. Another environmentally friendly alternative is an alloy of aluminium and gallium which similarly renders the aluminium more reactive by preventing it from forming an oxide layer.|$|R
50|$|Aluminium has a {{stronger}} affinity for oxygen than most elements, {{which is most}} visible in aluminothermic reactions such as thermite. This <b>allows</b> <b>aluminium</b> to burn with a large release of heat in substances that one normally considers to be inert, such as carbon dioxide and water. However, aluminium combustion is normally hindered {{by the presence of}} a durable oxide layer that forms on the surface of aluminium particles, requiring significant heat to overcome. Additionally, aluminium oxide condenses out of the exhaust stream at high temperature, leaving it (and its heat of condensation) unable to contribute to expansion unless there is another gas present to function as a working fluid. This generally has relegated aluminium's role in rocketry to that of being an additive to solid rocket propellants, increasing their density and combustion temperature and stabilizing the burn.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{accuracy}} and reliability of nominal stresses, hot-spot stresses, effective notch stresses, notch-stress intensity factors (N-SIFs) and material length scale parameters in estimating fatigue lifetime of aluminium welded joints. This comparative assessment {{was based on a}} large number of experimental data taken from the literature and generated by testing, under either cyclic axial loading or cyclic bending, a variety of aluminium welded structural details. Whenever it was required, stress analyses were performed by solving bi-dimensional linear-elastic finite element models. The obtained results demonstrate that the effective notch stress method, the N-SIF approach, and the Theory of Critical Distances (TCD) provide a more accurate fatigue life estimation in comparison with the other methodologies. In this context, the TCD was seen to be easier to adopt, requiring less computational effort than the effective notch stress method and the NSIF approach. Finally, based on the experimental results being re-analysed, a unifying value of 0. 5 mm is proposed for the TCD critical distance, with this value <b>allowing</b> <b>aluminium</b> welded connections to be designed accurately irrespective of joint geometry’s complexity. ...|$|R

The distribution pattern followed a similar global trend in molluscs regardless of the spatio-temporal variability, with the predominance of Zn (80 % of total metals) followed by Cu and Cd. However, strong differences of metal bioavailability and bioaccumulation in biota were demonstrated, revealing the requirement of employing a suite of organism bioindicators to monitor metal contamination in mangrove ecosystems. From an ecotoxicological point of view, trace metal levels in sediments from the Petite Côte and the Sine-Saloum Estuary were below the effects range-low (ERL) threshold limit of the sediment quality guidelines for adverse biological effects (SQGs).

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} a laser-based method for joining aluminium and steel was a possible weight reduction in automobile body constructions. In conventional welding technology, no method exists that <b>allows</b> to join <b>aluminium</b> and steel sheets as continuous seal welds to one another. By exploiting both the differences in the material characteristics of aluminium and steel, and the characteristics of Nd:YAG laser radiation, it was possible to develop a technology that allows for the first time to form fusion joints of aluminium-steel joints. This joints exhibit sufficient properties regarding strength and formability and will find applications for car body manufacturing. The brittle intermetallic phases, formed at temperatures above approx. 350 C on the contact plane of the two materials, are the most severe problem during thermal joining of aluminium and steel. The thickness of the intermetallic phases has a decisive effect upon the fitness characteristics of the joint. If the phase margins are less than about 10 mm, no harmful effect on the strength and workability must be expected. Using a newly developed, three-part FEM-calculation model, the thickness of the intermetallic phases is estimated as a function of the laser joining parameters; in this way statements regarding the expected fitness characteristics are possible. The calculation model was verified by testing. The laser-made aluminium-steel joints produced in this way have good shear tension and fatigue strength as well as sufficient workability. Therefore e. g. deep-drawing blanks from aluminium and steel or three-dimensional composite structures for the automobile body can be produced. The first tests on original components have been successfully performed. (orig.)

The macroscopic response of the metasurfaces is controlled via {{the properties of the}} isolated Al nanohole-disk pair at the nanoscale. In addition, the optical field confinement at the scatterers and their random distribution of sizes results in a strongly enhanced Raman signal for broadly tuneable excitation using a single substrate.

40|$|SUMMARY: Silcrete of Cenozoic age {{associated}} with deep weathering profiles occurs on residual surfaces along the coastal belt of southern Cape Province. Petrographic and geochemical evidence indicates loss of aluminium and enrichment of silica and titanium during silcrete formation. Silica released locally within the weathering profile was appar-ently precipitated in {{a zone of}} restricted drainage close to the water-table where a low pH environment <b>allowed</b> theremoval of <b>aluminium</b> and the migration and concentration of titanium. Silcrete formation probably occurred in a humid tropical or subtropical envi-ronment with minimal local relief. The numerous reports of silcrete now available in the literature indicate {{the wide range of}} sedimentological and environmental settings with which it is associated (Langford-Smith 1978; Summerfield 1983). Work in southern Africa and north-west Europe has indicated that silcretes {{associated with}} kaolinitic weathering profiles possess a typical suite of petrographic and geochemical characteristics, including authigenic glaebules (Brewer 1964, pp. 259 - 60), colloform features and relatively high concentrations of TiO a (> 0. 2 %), which are not present in non-weathering profile occurrences (Summerfield 1978, 1979, 1982). In southern Africa, non-weathering profile silcretes, including silicified sands, pan sedi-ments, calcrete and bedrock, occur predomin-antly in the Kalahari Basin in Botswana, north-ern Cape Province and eastern Namibia (Sum-merfield, 1982). This paper describes the weathering profile silcretes of southern Africa, which are confined to a relatively narrow coastal belt (Cape coastal zone) extending from the Oliphants River valley in the west to the Transkei n the east (Fig. 1). A limited number of non-weathering profile silcretes also occur within this area but these are considered else-where (Summerfield 1981). There {{have been a number of}} previous studies of silcrete in the Cape coastal zone, but none of these have pro-vided detailed geochemical data on associated weathering profile materials (Bosazza 1936...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{study of}} the garnet system Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG) prepared by different sample preparations (solid-state sintering and sol-gel) is reported. Different sample preparations were investigated to find a suitable method for obtaining pure YAG. 27 Al and 89 Y MAS NMR were used to investigate the short range structure and results are compared to long-range order information from x-ray diffraction (XRD). These two techniques are comlementary in detecting phase composition and disorder in samples. There is a challenge in preparing pure Y 3 Al 5 O 12 since intermediate phases easily grow when sintered at high temperature, i. e. YAlO 3 (YAP), Y 4 Al 2 O 9 (YAM), Y 2 O 3 (Yttria) and Al 2 O 3 (Corundum). Therefore structural information on these impurity phases was obtained to compare with samples under study. Different sample preparations were also {{used to try to}} obtain pure YAP and YAM. Since it is difficult to obtain pure YAG by high temperature solid-state sintering, the sol-gel technique was used to produce pure YAG at low temperature. In this work, pure YAG has been obtained at temperatures as low as 800 oC using a sol-gel citrate-nitrate with combustion process (SGCNCT). Other sol-gel syntheses used are: sol-gel glycolate (SGG), citrate-nitrate (SGCN) and modification of the citrate-nitrate ratio with combustion process (SGCNCT). The modification of the citrate to nitrate ratio and controlling the mixing temperature as low as 50 - 60 oC is a novel route to produce pure YAG at low as 800 oC. This technique was then used to prepare different garnet systems, i. e. Y 3 Ga 5 O 12 (YGG) and also garnet solid solution system, Y 3 Al 5 -xGaxO 12. Again, information from NMR was compared with results from XRD to determine different phase distribution and disorder. The 27 Al chemical shift range for different structural units (e. g. AlO 4, AlO 5 and AlO 6) in YAG <b>allowed</b> the <b>aluminium</b> distribution in these materials to be refined. This is important when dealing with low temperature amorphous phases. For example, the AlO 5 site cannot be traced using XRD. The work was extended to study different nuclei, i. e. 89 Y and 71 Ga NMR. 27 Al and 71 Ga is a quadrupolar nuclei with spin, I= 5 / 2 and 3 / 2, respectively. Extensive broadening of the NMR signal was observed at some sites due to the quadrupolar interaction and the effect of this on the quantitation of 27 Al and 71 Ga NMR is discussed. The substitution of Al and Ga in the garnet system was investigated. The different distribution of next nearest neighbour atom (nnn) produces a peak shift in 27 Al, 71 Ga NMR and also XRD...|$|R
40|$|Spin-based {{electronics}} or magnetoelectronics (short spintronics) {{intends to}} use and control the electron spin in semiconductors for switching purpose. The two possible orientations of the electron spin respective to a defined direction in space make the spin to be an ideal bit for information technology. The crystal structure of nitrides {{is characterized by a}} lack of inversion symmetry. The later is important, as it leads to a spin-splitting of the energy spectrum, inducing the intended spin precession. Such an asymmetric potential can also be induced by making use of a heterostructure with an asymmetric potential profile in the quantum well. In this case the advantage is that one can control the asymmetry of the potential by varying an applied gate voltage. By this way, one can control the spin-splitting, an effect also known as Rashba-effect. In contrast to conventional III/V-semiconductors, the spin-orbit coupling arising from the crystal and the one from the macroscopic electric field of the heterostructure are of the same kind, so that they both can be considered as Rashba-like. Therefore, two new definitions will be introduced in this work: crystal Rashba effect and two-dimensional Rashba effect. Because of the large band gap in nitride semiconductors a weaker spin-orbit coupling is expected compared to conventional III/V-semiconductors. On the other side, nitride semiconductors are characterized by high polarisation fields, enhancing the spin-orbit coupling. The answer of the question, if spin-orbit coupling is present in nitrides, and if this one is arising much more from the crystal or from the heterostructure, {{is the subject of this}} thesis. In the theoretical part of this work the strength of the two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling (i. e. arising from the heterostructure) was calculated by making use of the k. p-formalism. This calculation stated the strength of spin-orbit coupling in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures. As an estimation of the crystal Rashba effect showed to be very complex, no conclusion about the dominant spin-orbit coupling process could be done. Experimental measurements and the observation of weak antilocalisation demonstrated the presence of spin-orbit coupling in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures. The strength of the spin-orbit coupling parameter was determined by fitting the curves with the ILP-Model. The change of the gate-voltage did not induce any change of the spin orbit coupling parameter, so that crystal Rashba effect could be considered as the dominant one in our structures. Moreover, nodes at high magnetic fields were observed in the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, as a possible indication of spin-orbit coupling. However a discrepancy between the spin orbit coupling parameter obtained from the weak antilocalisation measured and the one from the nodes in the SdH-oscillations was stated. Nevertheless, the influcence of <b>Aluminium</b> <b>allow</b> fluctuations in the quantum well potential could also be explaining the observation of such nodes...|$|R
40|$|Alumina {{coatings}} {{have been}} deposited on AA 6082 T 6 aluminium alloy (table 1) using a novel technique {{based on a}} Fluidized Bed (FB). Custom made FB system consisted of a fluidization column, 1. 2 m in height with a square cross section of 400 mm made from stainless steel, a section for air flux homogenization and a porous plate distributor. The air feed was provided by a blower. A flow meter, a hygrometer and a thermocouple set were also used to monitor the process and to assure optimal environmental conditions (Q = 650 m 3 /h, T = 20 °C, RH = 40 %). Aluminum substrates were mounted on a rotating shaft (Rotating speed = 1 Hz). Four samples have been prepared with processing times ranging from thirty minutes to four hours (table 2) {{in order to understand}} the effect of process time on the tribological and corrosion resistant properties. Processing times were chosen on the basis of mass growth preliminary tests. The corrosion behaviour of the Al 2 O 3 coatings was investigated in NaCl solution (3 % and 0. 5 %). by means of Open Circuit Potential (O. C. P), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Localized Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (LEIS) and Electrochemical Noise Analysis (ENA). Blank corrosion tests were performed on uncoated substrate. FB process <b>allowed</b> to coat <b>aluminium</b> alloy substrates with a tough and well-adherent Al 2 O 3 coating as evidenced by microindentation and scratch tests. Figure 1 shows OCP trend for samples 2 and 4. A 20 mV decreasing was detected after 6 days of immersion and it may be presumably connected to the onset of a corrosion attack. Very similar trends were detected for all samples. EIS spectra, evaluated by the use of equivalent circuits, evidenced an increasing of charge transfer resistance (Rct) with immersion time, as shown in figure 2 for sample 2. Figure 3 reports a comparison between the Rct trend of sample 2 and 4 that showed the best and the worst behaviour of all samples. Rct values for the blank test are also reported. The slight increase in Rct observed at the end of tests, is given by the occlusion of the pores by corrosion products. LEIS is a new electrochemical technique that, using a 5 electrodes configuration and a motorized probe, permits to acquire impedance maps of coating surface, able to reveal local degradation events. Figures 4 reports impedance maps of sample 3 at two different immersion times. Maps evidenced the presence of a defect on coating (Fig. 4 a) and followed by the onset of a pit (Fig. 4 b). The analysis of noise acquisition confirmed the findings of EIS and LEIS. Figures 5 report the potential standard deviation (a) trend of samples 1 and 4. Sample 1 showed strong fluctuations representative of a transient stage at the beginning of test. The further reduction of fluctuation amplitude indicates a good behavior of the sample. Sample 4 confirmed the poor corrosion resistance features. ENA permitted to discriminate three stages (Fig. 5 b). The first stage takes place in the first 10 days of test and is due to the permeation of solution through pore coating. During the second stage, between 10 th and 15 th day the onset of a pitting attack occurred. The third stage, from 15 th day until the end of test a pit propagation took place. Current Power Spectral Density (PSD) obtained by the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) confirmed the occurrence of a pit attack (Fig. 6 e 7). FB allowed the preparation of tough and adherent Al 2 O 3 coatings. EIS and LEIM demonstrated the best corrosion resistant performances were obtained with process time of 60 min (sample 2) ...|$|R
