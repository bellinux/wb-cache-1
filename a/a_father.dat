5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although <b>a</b> <b>father</b> was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, <b>A</b> <b>father</b> would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
