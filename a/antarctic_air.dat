25|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of ice cores from continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers {{have been developed}} as temperature proxies since the 1950s. Samuel Epstein {{was one of the}} first to demonstrate the applicability of this proxy by measuring oxygen isotopes in Antarctic snow, and also pointed out complications in the stable isotope-temperature correlation caused by the history of the air masses from which the snow formed. Ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica can be thousands of meters thick and record snow {{isotopic composition}} of the past few glacial-interglacial cycles. Ice cores can be dated by layer counting on the top and ice flow modeling at depth, with additional age constraints from volcanic ash. Cores from Greenland and Antarctica can be aligned in age at high-resolution by comparing globally well-mixed trace gas (e.g. CH4) concentrations in the air bubbles trapped in the cores. Some of the first ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica with age estimates go back to the last 100,000 years, and showed a depletion in δD and δ18O in the last ice age. The ice core record has since been extended to the last 800,000 years in Antarctica, and at least 250,000 years in Greenland. One of the best δD-based ice core temperature records is from the Vostok ice core in Antarctica, which goes back to 420,000 years. The δD-temperature (of the inversion layer where snow forms) conversion in east Antarctica based on modern spatial gradient of δD (9‰/°C) is ΔTI=(ΔδDice-8Δδ18Osw)/9, which takes into account variations in seawater isotopic composition caused by global ice volume changes. It should be noted that many local effects can influence ice δD in addition to temperature. These effects include moisture origin and transport pathways, evaporation conditions and precipitation seasonality, which can be accounted for in more complicated models. Nevertheless, the Vostok ice core record shows some very important results: (1) A consistent δD depletion of ~70‰ during the last four glacial periods compared to interglacial times, corresponding to a cooling of 8°C in Antarctica; (2) A consistent drop of atmospheric CO2 concentration by 100 ppmv and CH4 drop by ~300 ppbv during glacial times relative to interglacials, suggesting a role of greenhouse gases in regulating global climate; (3) <b>Antarctic</b> <b>air</b> temperature and greenhouse gas concentration changes precede global ice volume and Greenland air temperature changes during glacial terminations, and greenhouse gases may be an amplifier of insolation forcing during glacial-interglacial cycles. Greenland ice core isotope records, in addition to showing glacial-interglacial cycles, also shows millennial-scale climate oscillations that may reflect reorganization in ocean circulation caused by ice melt charges. There have also been ice core records generated in alpine glacials on different continents. A record from the Andes Mountains in Peru shows a temperature decrease of 5-6°C in the tropics during the last ice age. A record from the Tibetan plateau shows a similar isotope shift and cooling during the last ice age. Other existing alpine glacial isotope records include Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Altai and West Belukha Plateau in Russia, Mount Logan in Canada, the Fremont Glacier in Wyoming, USA, and the Illimani Ice Core in Bolivia, most of which cover an interval of the Holocene epoch.|$|E

This occurs exclusively during post-cyclonic airflow after the passage of a cold front connected to a mid-latitudinal cyclone and subsequent ridging in of the South Atlantic Anticyclone behind the cold front, or when a series of low pressure systems passes over the island.

Summer soil frost on Marion Island is driven by a complex interaction between the latitudinal position of the passing cyclone, the latitudinal position of the ridging anticyclone as well as the trajectory of the air mass circulation.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the chemical mixing of stratospheric air over spatial scales from tens of kilometers to meters. Photochemistry, molecular diffusion, and strain (the stretching of air parcels due to wind shear) {{are combined into}} a single one-dimensional model. The model {{is applied to the}} case in which chemically perturbed air parcels from the Antarctic stratosphere are transported to mid-latitudes and strained into thin ribbon-like filaments until they are diffusively mixed with the ambient stratosphere. We find that the parcels may be treated as evolving in chemical isolation until the final mixing. When parcels reach a transverse thickness of 50 – 100 m in the lower stratosphere, they are rapidly dispersed by the combination of molecular diffusion and strain. The rapidity of the final mixing implies a lower limit to the vertical scales of inhomogeneities observed in the lower stratosphere. For this sensitivity study we consider four types of Antarctic air: a control case representing unprocessed polar air; heterogeneous processing by polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) that has repartitioned the Cl x  and NO y  families; processing that also includes denitrification and dehydration; and all processing plus 90 % ozone depletion. Large abundances of ClO, resulting initially from heterogeneous processing of stratospheric air on PSCs, are sustained by extensive denitrification. (One exception is the case of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>air</b> with major ozone depletion in which ClO is converted rapidly to HCl upon release of small amounts of NO x  as a result of the extremely nonlinear Cl x -NO y  chemical system.) ClO concentrations in the mid-latitude stratosphere should be enhanced by as much as a factor of 5 due to the mixing of air processed around the Antarctic vortex and will remain elevated for most of the following season. Chemical propagation of the Antarctic ozone hole occurs in two phases: rapid loss of ozone in the heterogeneously processed parcels as they evolve in isolation, and more slowly, a relative recovery of ozone over the following months. Another important effect is the transport of denitrified <b>Antarctic</b> <b>air</b> reducing NO x  and hence the total catalytic destruction of ozone throughout the southern mid-latitudes. In <b>Antarctic</b> <b>air</b> that has already been depleted of ozone within the vortex, little additional loss occurs during transport, and the propagation of chemically perturbed air acts partially to offset the deficit at mid-latitudes caused by dynamical dilution of the ozone hole. In air which has not experienced substantial ozone loss, chemical propagation can generate a net ozone deficit of order 2 – 3 % at mid-latitudes...|$|E
