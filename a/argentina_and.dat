5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, <b>Argentina</b> <b>and</b> the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived <b>Argentina</b> (<b>and</b> to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
