5|$|Duquesne {{was unable}} to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis, as they lost 59–69. Bill Clark led the team with 17points and Saunders grabbed four steals, enough to raise his per-game average to 2.9, a nation-leading figure. With this, Saunders had at one point {{led the nation in}} double-doubles, rebounds, and steals. The Dukes lost again, 80–92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure. The loss put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on Duquesne's hopes for a home game {{in the first round of}} the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1873 put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on this growth, and in {{the interim}} the city's steel {{industry}} began to decline, squeezed by competition from newer, more efficient producers in Western Pennsylvania and the Midwest {{on one side and}} labor unrest at home. But the textile industry remained strong, and even grew. Accordingly, its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture. The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated cast iron storefront and curved windows showing the influence of the Queen Anne Style. Further down Second Street, industrialist Jonas Heartt's house built that same year {{is one of the best}} residential applications of the same style.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the battle}} was {{received}} in England shortly after news {{of the fall of}} Louisbourg, putting <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on the celebrations marking that victory. The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing the conquest of New France. Had Carillon also fallen in 1758, the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759; as it happened, Montreal (the last point of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego, Quebec, and Carillon, which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffrey Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg.|$|E

5|$|While {{the rain}} had stopped come race time, the track was still wet and {{slippery}} and all drivers opted to start on intermediate tyres. Hamilton got away better at the start, entering the first corner alongside pole-sitter Rosberg and, by forcing the German wide, took the lead exiting turn one. Getting off track saw Rosberg lose additional positions, running fifth behind Hamilton, Kvyat, Ricciardo and Pérez. Further back, a collision involved Alonso, Massa, the two Sauber cars of Ericsson and Nasr as well as Bottas, who made a pit stop after the first lap, as did Nasr, who was the first to fit slick tyres, as the track was starting to dry. Will Stevens was touched from behind by teammate Alexander Rossi, breaking his rear wing and forcing him to retire. Having started {{from the back of the}} grid, Carlos Sainz profited from the incidents and was up to tenth by the end of the first lap. While Rosberg soon took back fourth from Pérez, Hamilton in front came under pressure from Kvyat, with the Red Bull drivers running fast in the damp conditions. With Kvyat just half a second behind the championship leader, a virtual safety car period was declared on lap five to clear the debris from the first corner incident. On lap 7, Valtteri Bottas retired with <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> failure caused by the turn one contact. When the virtual safety car ended on lap 8, Rosberg made an immediate move on Ricciardo to move into third, overtaking Kvyat for second on the same lap. Romain Grosjean became another victim of the accident on lap one, when he came into the pit lane for a second time on lap 12 and retired. By the same time, Sebastian Vettel had moved up into sixth place from thirteenth on the grid. Up front, Kvyat went wide while trying to overtake Rosberg, allowing teammate Ricciardo through into third; Ricciardo in turn made a successful manoeuvre on Rosberg to move up into second.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Operation Momentum brought about more {{extensive}} {{training for the}} Hmong and other hill tribes recruits such as the Lao Theung. Further training of Special Operating Teams of ADC graduates was begun in August 1961, {{with the aim of}} gradually replacing foreign trainers with Lao instructors. In July 1962, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on Momentum operations until the following April. During this lull, Colonel (later Major General) Vang Pao gathered five ADC companies into a battalion-sized Special Guerrilla Unit. In later years, he would take the next step of organizing makeshift regiments of SGUs.|$|E
25|$|The Cold War, {{especially}} in the 1950s and 1960s, put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on the Esperanto movement as well, as there were fears on both sides that Esperanto {{could be used for}} enemy propaganda. However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in Iran in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.|$|E

Vittorio Brambilla retired with <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> problem, Wilson Fittipaldi blew his engine, and Jacky Ickx, Mark Donohue and Carlos Pace all broke their driveshafts. Mass was in rapid pursuit of Hunt and Lauda – by the last lap he was only 2.4 seconds behind them. However, a superb lapping manoeuvre gave Hunt the space he needed. On the last corner, Lauda slid offline, but held on to win by 1.6 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Although mining had {{provided}} foreign exchange, {{the vast majority}} of Hondurans gained their livelihoods from agriculture, usually on a subsistence level. Periodic efforts were made to develop agricultural exports, but they met with little success. Some tobacco, cattle, and hides were exported, mostly to neighboring countries. The recurring civil conflicts and the resultant confiscation of stock by various military commanders, however, put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on efforts to develop the cattle industry and contributed to its rather backward status. Some bananas and other fruits were exported from the Islas de la Bahía, much of this trade going to New Orleans, but the volume was small and the benefit {{for the rest of the}} nation almost imperceptible.|$|E
25|$|The {{neutrality}} of the United States {{was tested}} during the Napoleonic Wars. After the Chesapeake–Leopard affair, President Thomas Jefferson {{was faced with}} a decision to make regarding the situation at hand. In the end, he chose an economic option: the Embargo Act of 1807. Jefferson essentially closed all the ports overnight, putting <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> on the seaport town of Salem. The embargo of 1807 was the starting point on the path to the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Both Great Britain and France imposed trade restrictions in order to weaken each other's economies. This also had the effect of disrupting American trade and testing the United States' neutrality. As time went on, harassment of American ships by the British Navy increased. This included impressment and seizures of American men and goods.|$|E

25|$|Guests board an Enhanced Motion Vehicle (EMV) {{intended}} {{to appear as}} a battered military troop transport. EMVs ride on neoprene filled tires (for operational precision) driven by hydraulic rotors that provide forward motion, hydraulic pressure is applied on-board each vehicle at 3,000 psi using DC pressurizers. The vehicle has four wheel steering atop {{the surface of a}} slotted roadbed. The track has only three switches: a left/right split switch just before loading/unloading, a left/right combine switch just after safety check station/dispatch and a compound switch to swap vehicles in/out of the maintenance bay, behind the mirrors. Beneath the slot a tubular guideway guides the front wheelset and <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> for the rear wheelset, and three electrical buss bars provide the EMV 480 volts AC. The power is divided among the two motion systems, control, safety and audio systems. Each transport can accommodate twelve guests with three rows of seats, four across, with the front left seat behind a non-operational steering wheel.|$|E
