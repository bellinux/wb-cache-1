5|$|A {{new church}} was needed because the old church needed {{significant}} repair <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> {{the growth of}} Brynsiencyn meant that more people lived there than in Llanidan itself. Like its predecessor, it is dedicated to Nidan, a 7th-century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|For the {{transformed}} children's safety - <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> it {{is painful}} {{for their parents}} {{to see what they}} had become - they are segregated on a continent of their own. No more human children are born, and many parents die or commit suicide. The members of New Athens destroy themselves with a nuclear bomb.|$|E
5|$|After grave {{difficulties}} in rehearsal, Tristan und Isolde premiered at the National Theatre Munich on 10 June 1865, the first Wagner opera premiere in almost 15 years. (The premiere {{had been scheduled}} for 15 May, but was delayed by bailiffs acting for Wagner's creditors, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, was hoarse and needed time to recover.) The conductor of this premiere was Hans von Bülow, whose wife, Cosima, had given birth in April that year to a daughter, named Isolde, a child not of Bülow but of Wagner.|$|E

5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, {{a shortage}} of funds forced Johnson to leave Oxford without a degree, and he returned to Lichfield. Towards the end of Johnson's stay at Oxford, his tutor, Jorden, left Pembroke {{and was replaced by}} William Adams. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father because he could not afford to transport them, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> he hoped to return to Oxford soon.|$|E
5|$|Bilateral {{relations}} with the United States are strained because the U.S. Department of State supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> the Belarusian government has made it increasingly difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E
5|$|H.gammarus is {{the type}} species of the genus Homarus Weber, 1795, as {{determined}} by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Prior to that direction, confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names, including Astacus marinus Fabricius, 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H.Milne-Edwards, 1837, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> Friedrich Weber's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun, rendering any prior assignments of type species (for Homarus H.Milne-Edwards, 1837) invalid for Homarus Weber, 1795.|$|E
50|$|The {{study is}} unique {{partly because of}} the long time span of the cohort, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> partly <b>because</b> of the high social status of some of the study participants.|$|R
50|$|These ARX {{operations}} are popular {{because they are}} relatively fast and cheap in hardware <b>and</b> software,and <b>also</b> <b>because</b> they run in constant time, and are therefore immune to timing attacks.The rotational cryptanalysis technique attempts to attack such round functions.|$|R
25|$|Steve Wozniak, {{a co-founder}} of Apple Inc., has been using $2 {{banknotes}} separated from 4-bill uncut sheets (glued together into pads), to surprise merchants <b>and</b> waiters; <b>also,</b> <b>because</b> of notes' unusual appearance, he has been interviewed by a Secret Service agent.|$|R
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|He was {{assigned}} to a civil flying school at RAF Prestwick which was run by Scottish Aviation Limited. He formally began his training on 29 June 1936. He progressed well in his theory examinations, gaining 99 percent for gunnery and 91 percent for airmanship. He flew a single-engined De Havilland Tiger Moth training biplane and gained his A Licence {{at the end of}} July, partly because he was a capable pilot <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> the Air Ministry was anxious to produce trained pilots. He completed his training within two months and was classified as above average after passing his examination with ease.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was {{appointed}} president, becoming Argentina's fifth president in two weeks. Roberto Lavagna, who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002, was credited for the ensuing {{recovery of the}} economy, having stabilised prices and the exchange rate in a moment when Argentina was at risk of hyperinflation. Since the default in 2001, growth has resumed, with the Argentine economy growing by over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011. This was achieved {{in part because of}} a commodity price boom, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> the government managed to keep the value of the currency low, boosting industrial exports.|$|E
50|$|He is {{also able}} to dematerialize and rematerialize his U-2 when needed, flying it both to {{conserve}} his vast powers for when they are needed <b>and</b> <b>also</b> simply <b>because</b> he still enjoys being a pilot.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album four stars and said [...] "all {{of the songs}} sound quite fresh, {{partly due to the}} unusual {{instrumentation}} <b>and</b> <b>also</b> partly <b>because</b> of the players' inventiveness".|$|R
50|$|The trains {{have been}} criticised for {{providing}} insufficient space for luggage <b>and</b> bicycles. <b>Also,</b> <b>because</b> the units {{are designed to}} tilt, the carriages have a tapered profile that narrows towards roof level, resulting in a less spacious interior than the conventional carriages they replaced.|$|R
5|$|In November 1888, Karim {{was given}} four months' leave {{to return to}} India, during which time he visited his father. Karim wrote to Victoria that his father, who was due to retire, had hopes of a pension and that his former employer, John Tyler, was angling for promotion. As a result, {{throughout}} {{the first six months}} of 1889, Victoria wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne, demanding action on Waziruddin's pension and Tyler's promotion. The Viceroy was reluctant to pursue the issues because Waziruddin had told the local governor, Sir Auckland Colvin, that he desired only gratitude <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> Tyler had a reputation for tactless behaviour and bad-tempered remarks.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle {{group who}} {{were looking for}} someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could {{transition}} from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942 the Australian Government sought Drummond for the {{position}} of Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) of the RAAF, to succeed Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett {{at the completion of}} the latter's two-year term. Although initially supportive of the plan, the British Air Ministry eventually declined to release Drummond from his role in the Middle East, partly to avoid disruption to the region's command <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> it did not believe that Drummond's operational abilities would be put to sufficient use in the largely administrative role of CAS. Drummond himself was reportedly dubious about the appointment because of the division of authority between RAAF Headquarters and Allied Air Force Headquarters, South West Pacific Area (SWPA).|$|E

5|$|In the 2012–13 Iraqi Premier League, {{under the}} {{management}} of Nazar Ashraf, Al-Talaba returned to their poor performance of the 2010–11 season, finishing in the 14th place with 35 points, only one point away from relegation, with only nine wins, eight draws, and 17 losses. They saved the club from being relegated in the 33rd round against Al-Naft where they won 2–1 <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> of Al-Kahraba's loss to Zakho in the last round. Al-Talaba passed the round of 32 of the 2012–13 Iraq FA Cup where they were up against Al-Zawra'a, drawing 0–0 in the first leg and winning 3–1 in the second leg before the tournament was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} of Kanye West's planned four education-themed studio albums. Following the major success of The College Dropout, the album reveals his {{progression}} in writing lyrics and an incorporation of {{a wider range of}} musical styles. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, {{due in part to the}} acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E
60|$|I {{was awake}} longest that night. My cousins slept, the sleep of faith {{on either side}} of me. I decided I would whisper my prayers, and stopped midway because I was ashamed, <b>and</b> perhaps <b>also</b> <b>because</b> I had an idea one didn't square God like that.|$|R

2500|$|Harriot's accomplishments remain {{relatively}} obscure {{because he}} did not publish any of his results <b>and</b> [...] <b>also</b> <b>because</b> many of his manuscripts have been lost; those that survive are in the British Museum and in the archives of the Percy family at Petworth House (Sussex) and Alnwick Castle (Northumberland).|$|R
5|$|That day at Belmont Park $7.9 {{million was}} wagered on the nine races that were held during the day, which {{includes}} $2.2 million from off-track betting. A total of $5.6 million was bet through the mutuels that day. The Stakes itself had $519,689 bet on it. Bettors holding 5,617 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> the $2 was worth $2.20.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{administration}} {{wanted to}} expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, {{who was in charge}} of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.|$|E
5|$|The princes {{arrived in}} Constantinople with little food and {{expected}} provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his {{experiences with the}} People's Crusade, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>because</b> the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, Robert Guiscard, and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.|$|E
50|$|Judy Jordan's book, Carolina Ghost Woods, is {{a startling}} first {{collection}} of poems--startling {{because of the}} bone-crushing violence and poverty, <b>and</b> startling <b>also</b> <b>because</b> of the beautiful and precise language the poet brings to bear on these scenes, violent or not. She is a poet first and foremost.|$|R
