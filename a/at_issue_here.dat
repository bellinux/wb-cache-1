25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E

Tam) involving a denial of trademark registration to the Asian-American band The Slants. The majority opinion stated, in part, that [...] "hatever our personal feelings about the mark <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here,</b> or other disparaging marks, the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find speech likely to offend others."

With respect to the point <b>at</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here,</b> different times and different places — even highly liberal times and places — have struck that balance in different ways. Some Western democracies currently permit the Executive a period of detention without impartially adjudicated cause. In England, for example, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, 14(4), 5, permits suspects to be held without presentation and without charge for seven days. 12 Halsbury's Stat. 1294 (4th ed. 1989). It was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to put this matter beyond time, place and judicial predilection, incorporating the traditional common-law guarantees against unlawful arrest. The Court says not a word about these guarantees, and they are determinative. Gersteins approval of a [...] "brief period" [...] of delay to accomplish [...] "administrative steps incident to an arrest" [...] is already a questionable extension of the traditional formulation, though it probably has little practical effect and can perhaps be justified on de minimis grounds. [...] To expand Gerstein, however, into an authorization for 48-hour detention related neither to the obtaining of a magistrate nor the administrative [...] "completion" [...] of the arrest seems to me utterly unjustified. Mr. McLaughlin was entitled to have a prompt impartial determination that there was reason to deprive him of his liberty — not according to a schedule that suits the State's convenience in piggybacking various proceedings, but as soon as his arrest was completed and the magistrate could be procured.” ...|$|E

Was it in good taste, that I may use the mildest term, for Earl Russell to expound our own Constitution to President Lincoln, or to make a new and fallacious application of an old phrase for our benefit, and tell us that the Rebels were fighting for independence and we for empire? As if all wars for independence were by nature just and deserving of sympathy, and all wars for empire ignoble and worthy only of reprobation, or as if these easy phrases in any way characterized this terrible struggle,--terrible not so truly in any superficial sense, as from the essential and deadly enmity of the principles that underlie it.

40|$|This paper applies Markov chain {{analysis}} {{to examine the}} empirical dynamics of sectoral specialization in open economies. <b>At</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>here</b> persistence and the hypothesis of hysteresis in national patterns of industrial specialization, often claimed as an implication of strong path dependence {{in the evolution of}} high-technologies specific to certain industries. The evidence from twelve OECD member countries' time series of value added in 17 manufacturing industries and from corresponding patent count data does not support the hypothesis of hysteresis based on nationally restricted knowledge spillovers from industrial research and development activities. On the contrary, there seems to be generally lower persistence in patterns of technological specialization than in the corresponding production specialization. Moreover, high persistence in some parts of manufacturing mostly disappears when taking into account changes in countries' relative factor endowments, which form the basis of dynamic comparative advantages. These findings cast doubt on the popular belief that a government can — by making cleverly designed and appropriately timed industrial policy interventions — secure a permanently larger share of certain industries for the national economy which are supposed to lock in first mover advantages in terms of particularly high rates of technological innovation and productivity growth. ...|$|R
