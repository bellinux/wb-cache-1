5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> Banksia {{in his classic}} 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subgenus Banksia, and was divided into three sections. George placed Banksia coccinea in its own series—Banksia series Coccineae—within the section B.section Banksia on account of a unique combination of characters, namely the vertical <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> flowers on the spike, combined with the branched open habit, broad leaves and very small follicles. Members of the series Quercinae and five species within the series Spicigerae share the vertically aligned flowers, but do not wholly exhibit the other characters.|$|E

40|$|We discuss <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> equal minors of totally {{positive}} matrices. More precisely, {{we investigate}} {{the structure of}} equalities and inequalities between the minors. We show that <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> equal minors of largest value are in bijection with sorted sets, which earlier appeared {{in the context of}} alcoved polytopes and Gröbner bases. Maximal <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> this form correspond to simplices of the alcoved triangulation of the hypersimplex; and the number <b>of</b> such <b>arrangements</b> equals the Eulerian number. On the other hand, we prove in many cases that <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> equal minors of smallest value are exactly weakly separated sets. Weakly separated sets, originally introduced by Leclerc and Zelevinsky, are closely related to the positive Grassmannian and the associated cluster algebra. However, we also construct examples <b>of</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> smallest minors which are not weakly separated using chain reactions of mutations of plabic graphs. Comment: 41 page...|$|R

Contrary to standard randomized incremental algorithms, theselazy randomized incremental algorithms are suited for computing structures that have a 2 ̆ 2 nonlocal 2 ̆ 2 definition. In order to analyze these algorithms we generalize some results on random sampling to such situations. We apply our techniques to obtain efficient algorithms for the computation of single cells in <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> segments in the plane, single cells in <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> triangles in space, and zones in <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> hyperplanes...|$|R
