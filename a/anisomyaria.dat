Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. <b>Anisomyaria</b> consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{digestive}} diverticula of the <b>Anisomyaria</b> and Eulamellibranchia revealed certain features hitherto undescribed. The diverticula consist of blind-ending tubules which open into ciliated main ducts by way of short, non-ciliated secondary ducts. The main ducts open into the intestinal groove. In all the species examined the ciliated epithelium of the main ducts was restricted to a well-defined groove, the re-mainder of the lumen being surrounded by a non-ciliated, brush-border epithelium. Each tubule {{is surrounded by a}} system of smooth muscle fibres. Cilia associated with the darkly staining cells of the crypts were demonstrated in sections of the tubules. After feeding with titanium dioxide in suspension, this substance was later found in the large vacuolated cells of the tubules. The particles of titanium dioxide were larger than o-i^t. A continuous circulation is maintained within the main ducts solely as a result of ciliary activity. The exhalant current in the ciliated portion of the main ducts produces an inhalant counterpart current in the non-ciliated portion. It is suggested that fresh fluid is drawn into the tubules {{as a consequence of the}} absorptive functions of the large vacuolated cells. Indigestible material accumulates in the large vacuolated cells and is extruded into the main ducts where it is conveyed out of the diverticula by the exhalant ciliary current. In both the <b>Anisomyaria</b> and Eulamellibranchia the flap-like major typhlosole prevents material entering the mid-gut except by the intestinal groove, and isolates the rejectory currents of the intestinal groove from the general circulation of particles in the stomach. In the Eulamellibranchia the major typhlosole also acts as a valve which controls the entry and exit of material into and out of the inhalant and exhalant portions of the main ducts...|$|E
40|$|The wide {{distribution}} of chitin in the shells of Mollusca {{was confirmed by}} {{the application of a}} quantitative and specific enzymatic method. Chitin was found not only in cephalopod shells, but also in mother-of-pearl, pseudonacreous layers, and in many cases, in periostracum and prismatic layers of gastropod and bivalve shells. The presence and the proportion of chitin are highly variable in the periostracum of the bivalve species studied so far. Its permanent presence in the organic matrix, associated with mother-of-pearl, emphasizes the homology of this structure in the whole phylum of Mollusca. The more or less important participation of chitin in the building of the organic matrix of the different shell structures may be related to taxonomic and/or ecological characteristics. Chitin distribution is in good agreement with the classification grouping Arcidae and Glycimeridae among the Filibranchia Taxodonta and isolating Nuculidae in the Protobranchia, but the lower rate of chitin observed in the inner calcified shell layers of seven species of <b>Anisomyaria</b> and the high chitin rate in those of four species of Adapedonta may be a further indication of the homogeneity of both taxa. From an ecological point of view, chitin constitutes an important fraction of the shell organic matter in burrowing species, while this polysaccharide is practically lacking or in very low proportions in the shells of fixed or free species...|$|E
