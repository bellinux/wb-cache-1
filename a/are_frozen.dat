5|$|Pizza cheese {{encompasses}} several {{varieties and}} types of cheeses and dairy products that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on pizza. These include processed and modified cheese such as mozzarella-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza. The most popular cheeses used {{in the preparation of}} pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and Parmesan. Emmental, Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced. Some mass-produced pizza cheeses <b>are</b> <b>frozen</b> after manufacturing and shipped frozen.|$|E
5|$|In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue {{receives}} a Charmander from his grandfather Professor Oak. It evolves into a Charmeleon, and when Blue is possessed by a Gastly in the Lavender Tower, so is Charmeleon. Blue's Charmeleon is eventually released from its possession {{only to be}} faced down by an Arbok, owned by Koga. Charmeleon tricked Koga by using a zombie Psyduck to deflect Arbok's acid attack before literally slicing the Arbok in half with his tail. Blue later appears with an evolved Charizard and gains access to Saffron City by helping to disable a barrier created by a Mr. Mime. Later, Red and Blue face off against Koga's Articuno and <b>are</b> <b>frozen</b> by its Ice Beam, but they ultimately defeat the Team Rocket Executive with Charizard's Flamethrower. It then teams up with Red's newly evolved Venusaur, Saur, and Green's Blastoise, Blasty, to defeat Sabrina's monster Pokémon. They end Team Rocket's control of Saffron City, splitting apart the three birds in the process.|$|E

25|$|The ice extent {{depends on}} whether the winter is mild, moderate, or severe. Severe winters can lead to ice {{formation}} around southern Sweden {{and even in the}} Danish straits. According to the 18th-century natural historian William Derham, during the severe winters of 1703 and 1708, the ice cover reached as far as the Danish straits. Frequently, parts of the Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland <b>are</b> <b>frozen,</b> in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the Gulf of Riga. This description meant that the whole of the Baltic Sea was covered with ice.|$|E
25|$|About 60% {{crystallization}} is {{the upper}} limit for commercial products, {{with the exception of}} polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below Tg glass transition temperature to form an amorphous solid. Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules <b>are</b> <b>frozen</b> in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above Tg, they begin to move again, allowing crystals to nucleate and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization.|$|E

50|$|A piece {{which is}} {{adjacent}} in any cardinal direction to a stronger opposing piece <b>is</b> <b>frozen,</b> unless it <b>is</b> also {{adjacent to a}} friendly piece. Frozen pieces may not be moved by the owner, but may be dislodged by the opponent. A frozen piece can freeze another still weaker piece. The silver rabbit on a7 <b>is</b> <b>frozen,</b> but the one on d2 is able to move because it is adjacent to a silver piece. Similarly the gold rabbit on b7 <b>is</b> <b>frozen,</b> but the gold cat on c1 is not. The dogs on a6 and b6 do not freeze each other because they are of equal strength. An elephant cannot <b>be</b> <b>frozen,</b> since there <b>is</b> nothing stronger, but an elephant can be blockaded.|$|R

25|$|Before any procedures, the oreo cookies <b>are</b> <b>frozen</b> for 3 {{hours and}} the oil is {{preheated}} to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

The coated oreo cookies are then dropped into hot oil until the cookies turn golden brown. The cookies are removed from the oil and placed on a sheet pan with paper towels for draining the excessive oil. In the meantime, the tops of the fried oreos are dusted with confectioners sugar.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{method for}} mind uploading is serial sectioning, {{in which the}} brain tissue and perhaps {{other parts of the}} nervous system <b>are</b> <b>frozen</b> and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer, which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome, thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections. The exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded, and then the surface layer of tissue removed. While this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process, research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections. The scans would then be analyzed, and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into.|$|E
25|$|Ubuntu {{packages}} {{are based on}} packages from Debian's unstable branch. Both distributions use Debian's deb package format and package management tools (e.g. APT and Ubuntu Software). Debian and Ubuntu {{packages are}} not necessarily binary compatible with each other, however; packages {{may need to be}} rebuilt from source to be used in Ubuntu. Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within Debian. Ubuntu cooperates with Debian by pushing changes back to Debian, although there has been criticism that this does not happen often enough. Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, had expressed concern about Ubuntu packages potentially diverging too far from Debian to remain compatible. Before release, packages are imported from Debian unstable continuously and merged with Ubuntu-specific modifications. One month before release, imports <b>are</b> <b>frozen,</b> and packagers then work to ensure that the frozen features interoperate well together.|$|E

25|$|Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to {{describe}} a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them. This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at {{the hands of a}} single country. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum are shadow states that <b>are</b> <b>frozen</b> within the influence of a single power. The United States' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.|$|E
25|$|Cryoablation: Cryoablation is a {{technique}} used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe {{into the center of}} the tumor. Liquid nitrogen is circulated through the end of this device. The tumor and a half inch margin of normal liver <b>are</b> <b>frozen</b> to -190nbsp&°C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then re-frozen to -190nbsp&°C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient will spend the first post-operative night in the intensive care unit and typically is discharged in 3 – 5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory in order to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.|$|E

This had been achieved despite very low temperatures, typically around , and small scale mishaps including {{the loss of the}} sledgemeter that recorded mileage. However, as the surfaces became uneven and made skiing more difficult, their speeds slowed. A sextant reading on 29 March of 85°56′N indicated that a week's travel had brought them [...] nearer to the pole, but also showed that their average daily distances were falling. More worryingly, a theodolite reading that day suggested that they were at only 85°15′N, and they had no means of knowing which of the readings was correct.
