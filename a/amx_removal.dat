40|$|Introduction: Amoxicillin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} groups of pharmaceuticals that benefits humans and animals. However, antibiotics excertion in wastewaters and environment have emerged as a serious risk to the biotic environment, and their toxic effects can harm the organisms. Iron-based metallic nanoparticles have received special attention in regard with remediation of groundwater contaminants. In the typical nZVI-based bimetallic particle system, Fe acts as the reducing agent. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the synthesis and characteristics of nZVI in regard with degrading AMX. Methods: In this study, nZVI nanoparticles were synthesized using the liquid-phase reduction method by EDTA as a stabilizer material. Structure and properties of nanoparticles were characterized by BET, SEM, XRD and EDX analysis. A multi-variate analysis was applied using a response surface methodology (RSM) in order to develop a quadratic model as a functional relationship between <b>AMX</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency and independent variables (initial pH values, dosage of nZVI, contact time and amoxicillin concentration). The four independent variables of solution pH (2 – 10), AMX concentration (5 - 45 mg/l), contact time (5 - 85 min) and nanoparticles dose (0. 25 – 1. 25 g) were transformed to the coded values. Results: The study results demonstrated that more than 69 % of AMX was removed by nZVI. The optimal <b>AMX</b> <b>removal</b> conditions using nZVI were found as 1. 25 g of nZVI, pH 4, contact time of 80 min and concentration of 30 mg/l. Conclusions: The ability of nZVI in degradation of AMX revealed that these materials can serve as a potential nano material with respect to the environmental remediation...|$|E
