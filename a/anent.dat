2500|$|Macdonald, Finlay A. J. (May 2001). [...] Deliverances of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: Special Commission <b>Anent</b> Review and Reform in the Church.|$|E
2500|$|The Lord Provost was {{refunded}} [...] "£65 {{as half of}} {{his charges}} in going to and coming from London <b>anent</b> obtaining the Act of Parliament ... {{the other half of}} such expense being chargeable on the proprietors of the Monkland Canal".|$|E
2500|$|After {{prolonged}} {{years of}} struggle, in 1834 the Evangelicals {{gained control of}} the General Assembly and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted [...] "intrusive" [...] presentations to livings by patrons and the Chapels Act, which put the ministers of Chapels of Ease {{on an equal footing}} with ordinary parish ministers. The following [...] "Ten Years' Conflict" [...] of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts, reaching the Court of Session and then finally the House of Lords in 1839, which declared the acts unconstitutional. In 1842 Evangelicals presented to the General Assembly a Claim, Declaration and Protest <b>anent</b> the Encroachments of the Court of Session, known as the Claim of Right, that questioned the validity of civil jurisdiction over the church. When the Claim of Right was rejected by the General Assembly the result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Thomas Chalmers, known as the Great Disruption of 1843. Some 454, roughly a third, of the 1,195 clergy of the established church, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate Free Church of Scotland. The Free Church was more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly in the Highlands and Islands, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{with the}} news <b>anent</b> milor Eglinton's {{resignation}} of the General Control of Finance.|$|E
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders, and murmured {{something}} very uncomplimentary <b>anent</b> the ultimate destination of those neighbours.|$|E
60|$|R. C. {{resigned}} himself, {{not without}} some remarks <b>anent</b> the insatiable nature of his host and boatman.|$|E
60|$|Déroulède {{felt this}} magnetism, and {{therefore}} did not resent the implied suggestion, <b>anent</b> the saint {{whom he was}} still content to worship.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will use}} the {{certificate}} of safety for myself or {{one of my friends}} if you break your word to me <b>anent</b> Mademoiselle Lange." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what matters}} have you to speak <b>anent,</b> then?" [...] said his master, whom {{circumstances}} had inured to tolerate {{a good deal}} of freedom from his attendant.|$|E
60|$|But {{this opinion}} the married men present were not {{prepared}} to endorse, {{and one or two}} minor arguments and lectures ensued <b>anent</b> a woman's duty of obedience.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: This {{was written}} before the Act <b>anent</b> the [...] Scotch distilleries, of session 1786, for which Scotland and [...] the author return their most {{grateful}} thanks.--R.B.] ...|$|E
60|$|MACKESY. With the rupee at one and sixpence. The little Doones {{would be}} little Debra Doones, with a fine Mussoorie chi-chi <b>anent</b> to bring home for the holidays.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Norman, he {{suffered}} enough <b>anent</b> Randall's Alley," [...] said Dr. May; [...] "but {{as to the}} Market Cross, that came down a year before he was born." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{may tell}} of his ain affairs what he likes," [...] {{answered}} Jeanie; [...] "but {{my family and}} friends have nae right to hae ony stories told <b>anent</b> them without their express desire; and, as they canna be here to speak for themselves, I entreat ye wadna ask Mr. George Rob--I mean Staunton, or whatever his name is, ony questions <b>anent</b> me or my folk; for I maun be free to tell you, that he will neither have the bearing of a Christian or a gentleman, if he answers you against my express desire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was still}} in {{practice}} in Birmingham, however, and, of course, knew the ancient family tradition <b>anent</b> the twin succession. Whether he was prompted by revenge or merely self-advertisement no one knows.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{creature}} {{will prove}} fause-hearted, after a'," [...] said the Bailie, who {{by this time}} had planted himself close behind me; [...] "it's lucky I didna pit mysell to expenses <b>anent</b> him." ...|$|E
60|$|Some of the rumours <b>anent</b> Lady Ursula's mysterious nightly wanderings {{had already}} reached her; she had placed {{the other girls}} under severe cross-examination, and finally {{elicited}} from them the confirmation of her worst fears.|$|E
60|$|To which obvious {{fact the}} {{stranger}} heartily assented. It {{was certainly a}} preposterous suggestion that anyone could ever upset Mr. Jellyband's firmly-rooted opinions <b>anent</b> the utter worthlessness of {{the inhabitants of the}} whole continent of Europe.|$|E
60|$|The wiseacres {{and learned}} men, the more wealthy burgesses, {{and people of}} more consideration, were content with a few {{philosophical}} reflections <b>anent</b> the instability {{of human nature and}} the evil influences of Court life and of great wealth.|$|E
6000|$|See sodger Hugh,^10 my {{watchman}} stented, [...] If poets e'er are represented; [...] I ken if {{that your}} sword were wanted, [...] Ye'd lend a hand; [...] But when there's {{ought to say}} <b>anent</b> it, [...] Ye're at a stand.|$|E
6000|$|He {{accumulated}} wrath for {{a moment}} or so, then seized the plate in one hand, and the biscuits in another, and went in search of the Prince, breathing vile words <b>anent</b> [...] "grub" [...] and his intimate interior. He approached without saluting.|$|E
60|$|Neither {{of these}} two giants had taken part in these {{deliberations}} <b>anent</b> the new religion and the new goddess. Danton gave signs now and then of the greatest impatience, and muttered something about {{a new form of}} tyranny, a new kind of oppression.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly Lydie {{felt her}} limbs stiffen and her throat close as if iron fingers had gripped it. She {{had been saying}} the usual platitudes <b>anent</b> the wife, sister or aunt of some worthy general or country squire, when Monsieur de Louvois called out a name: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Full power, an it {{like your}} gracious Majesty," [...] {{answered}} Richie Moniplies; [...] "and I am maist willing to subscrive to whatsoever may in ony wise accommodate your Majesty <b>anent</b> the redemption-money, trusting your Majesty's grace will {{be kind to}} me in one sma' favour." ...|$|E
60|$|All Sue's questionings <b>anent</b> {{the young}} man only brought forth violent vituperations from Sir Marmaduke, and cold words of {{condemnation}} from Mistress de Chavasse; therefore, she soon desisted, storing up in her heart pathetic memories of the one true friend she had in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have looked}} into my commission,' said Mr. Gilfillan,' subscribed by a worthy and professing nobleman, William, Earl of Glencairn; nor do I find it therein set down that I am to receive any charges or {{commands}} <b>anent</b> my doings from Major William Melville of Cairnvreckan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} to say, prisoner, {{to the charge}} made against you? In {{consideration}} of our good friend Bailie Anderson, {{known to be a}} worthy citizen and loyal subject of his majesty, we would be glad to hear {{what you have to say}} <b>anent</b> this charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So please you, Sir," [...] {{interrupted}} the beggar, [...] "keep truth with you. What did {{the child or}} I ever profess, save what we were? No foul words here. I trysted you to meet me here, <b>anent</b> her marriage. Have you any offers to make me?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she kept}} up her part, {{rallying}} Heron for the shortness of his visit, begging him to tarry {{for another five}} minutes at least, throwing out--with subtle feminine intuition--just those very hints <b>anent</b> little Capet's safety that were most calculated to send him flying back towards the Temple.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marry, Will, that is {{more like}} a maiden than a statesman! But be content, comrade, I know no more than thou what {{purposes}} there may be <b>anent</b> my sister's marriage," [...] he added. [...] "Only if thou canst give me my father's letter, I should be beholden to thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{neighbour}} bonnet maker, be patient; thou mayst do {{the smith}} a kind turn, an thou takest this matter the right way. I have chosen thee {{to consult with}} <b>anent</b> this matter--not that I hold thee the wisest head in Perth, for should I say so I should lie." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a week}} or {{two later}} that the parlour-maid gave notice, having been terrified almost to tears by an {{outbreak}} of sudden temper {{on the part of the}} master <b>anent</b> some underdone cutlets. [...] "'E gnashed 'is teeth at me, 'e did reely," [...] she informed a sympathetic kitchen audience.|$|E
6000|$|THE SECOND PART: In {{which are}} set forth his Misfortunes <b>anent</b> the APPIN Murder; his Troubles with Lord Advocate GRANT; Captivity on the Bass Rock; Journey into Holland and France; and Singular Relations with JAMES MORE DRUMMOND or MACGREGOR, a Son of the notorious ROB ROY, and his Daughter CATRIONA ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] replied Jeanie, whose {{judgment}} was too accurate {{not to see}} the sophistry of this argument, [...] "I shall be man-sworn in the very thing in which my testimony is wanted, {{for it is the}} concealment for which poor Effie is blamed, and you would make me tell a falsehood <b>anent</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Headworth was {{accustomed}} to receive visitors <b>anent</b> boarders, so when Lady Kirkaldy's card was brought to her, the first impression was that some such arrangement was to be made. She was sitting in her pretty little drawing-room alone, for Nuttie {{and her mother had}} gone out for a walk with Miss Nugent.|$|E
