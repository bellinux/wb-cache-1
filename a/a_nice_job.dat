Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe noted similarities between [...] "One" [...] and Sheeran's 2011 single [...] "The A Team" [...] for their tunefulness; she described the former as [...] "burbling". Dave Hanratty of Drowned in Sound had the same opinion: [...] "'One' [...] cut from the exact same cloth as 'The A Team'", although he favored [...] "One" [...] as better.

500|$|Mitchell was {{selected}} by the Philadelphia Eagles {{in the first round}} (25th overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft. He was the fifth wide receiver taken in the draft. He worked out with his new quarterback Donovan McNabb in Arizona and Los Angeles before mini-camp started. Because of NCAA rules regarding graduation, Mitchell was unable to attend the Eagles' mini-camp until after UCLA's senior class graduated. He studied the Eagles' playbook in the meantime. He asked the NFL for an exemption, but the league refused, and he arrived for his first practice on June 18, 2001. Mitchell signed a five-year, $5.5million contract with the Eagles on July 26, in time for the start of training camp. During training camp, Mitchell practiced as a backup behind James Thrash and Todd Pinkston. Special teams coordinator John Harbaugh asked Mitchell if he was willing to practice as a kickoff returner in practice, but Mitchell declined, citing the fracture of his femur on a kickoff return in college. Nonetheless, he still practiced on the kickoff coverage team, and on the punt coverage team as a gunner. Mitchell suffered a hip pointer during the morning session on July 31, but returned for the afternoon session without limitation. A hamstring injury limited him at the end of training camp. Before the start of the 2001 season, head coach Andy Reid said, [...] "Mentally, [...] right there. He's picked everything up, he's a smart kid. He's wide-eyed, ready to learn. He's done <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>job</b> when he's been in there." ...|$|E

He praised the cast's skill and attractiveness {{as well as the}} show's ability to [...] "come up with a few smart deviations from the genre norm". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized the plot for being too predictable, but praised Adam Brody as Seth, stating that [...] "he talks too much and too fast, he mumbles, and he projects zero physical confidence. In short, his character is adorable." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] " [...] McKenzie, at times, is prone to overdramatizing scenes", and considered the young characters [...] "so detestable and yet bland" [...] that it made the show [...] "almost painful" [...] to watch. He nevertheless affirmed that the show had [...] "positive attributes" [...] that made it enjoyable. Andrew Grossman of The Boston Globe commented that [...] "Brody is instantly likable as Seth" [...] and that Barton [...] "does <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>job</b> with Marissa's torn-between-two-worlds angst", but stated that Ryan [...] "doesn't seem to have many clear personality traits".

[...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale" [...] and [...] " [...] appendicitis [...] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. [...] Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost." [...] Jensen also [...] "liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of [...] least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack-Juliet smooch". [...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello wrote that [...] "Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts" [...] and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying that he was [...] "shocked and baffled" [...] and writing that [...] "Lost â€¦ can give me an exciting, well-done episode while making me fear where the series is going â€¦ [...] ghosts aren't my thing."
