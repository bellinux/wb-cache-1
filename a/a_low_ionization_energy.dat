We use ab initio calculations to evaluate a polymorphism of the crystal structure of the proposed halide hybrid perovskite, its stability and electronic properties in comparison to the mainstream perovskites, such as the methylammonium and formamidinium lead iodide.

50|$|Hollow cathodes emit a dense {{cloud of}} plasma by first {{ionizing}} a gas. This creates a high density plasma plume which makes {{contact with the}} surrounding plasma. The region between the high density plume and the surrounding plasma is termed a double sheath or double layer. This double layer is essentially two adjacent layers of charge. The first layer is a positive layer {{at the edge of}} the high potential plasma (the contactor plasma cloud). The second layer is a negative layer {{at the edge of the}} low potential plasma (the ambient plasma). Further investigation of the double layer phenomenon has been conducted by several people. One type of hollow cathode consists of a metal tube lined with a sintered barium oxide impregnated tungsten insert, capped at one end by a plate with a small orifice, as shown in the below figure. Electrons are emitted from the barium oxide impregnated insert by thermionic emission. A noble gas flows into the insert region of the HC and is partially ionized by the emitted electrons that are accelerated by an electric field near the orifice (Xenon is a common gas used for HCs as it has <b>a</b> <b>low</b> specific <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> (<b>ionization</b> potential per unit mass). For EDT purposes, a lower mass would be more beneficial because the total system mass would be less. This gas is just used for charge exchange and not propulsion.). Many of the ionized xenon atoms are accelerated into the walls where their energy maintains the thermionic emission temperature. The ionized xenon also exits out of the orifice. Electrons are accelerated from the insert region, through the orifice to the keeper, which is always at a more positive bias.|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} of a novel charge-transporting polymer based on the charge-transport unit N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis(3 -methylphenyl) -[1, 1 '-biphenyl]- 4, 4 '-diamine (TPD). Introducing approximately 30 wt % of the liquid electro-optic molecule 4 -(N,N-diethylamino) - 2 -fluoro-(Z) -β-methyl-(E) -β-nitrostyrene (FDEAMNST) and small amounts of C 60 makes this polymer photorefractive. A full photorefractive characterization is presented. In this composite a rather large electro-optic effect is observed due to the efficient plasticization by the electro-optic molecules of the host polymer. The diffraction efficiency and gain coefficient (3. 4 % and 50 cm- 1, respectively) are rather low. This is attributed to a low space-charge field due to a very low trap density, which is in agreement with a 90 ° phase-shift between the illumination pattern and the refractive index grating.

Enabling clusters to become electron donors with low ionization energies or electron acceptors with high electron affinities usually requires changing the valence electron count. Here we demonstrate that a metal cluster may be transformed from an electron donor to an acceptor by exchanging ligands while the neutral form of the clusters has closed electronic shells.

40|$|Evidence for {{dark matter}} (DM) has been {{reported}} using astronomical observations in systems such as the Bullet cluster. Weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs), in particular the lightest neutralino, {{are the most popular}} DM candidates within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Many groups in the world are focussing their attention on the direct detection of DM in the laboratory. The detectors should have large target masses and excellent noise rejection capabilities because of the small cross section between DM and ordinary matter (σWIMP−nucleon < 4 · 10 − 8 pb). Noble liquids are today considered {{to be one of the}} best options for large-size DM experiments, as they have <b>a</b> relatively <b>low</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>energy,</b> good scintillation properties and long electron lifetime. Moreover noble liquid detectors are easily scalable to large masses. This thesis deals with the development of a large (1 ton) LAr WIMP detector (ArDM) which could measure simultaneously light and charge from the scintillation and the ion- ization of liquid argon. Argon vacuum ultra violet (VUV) scintillation light has to be converted with wavelength shifter (WLS) materials such as TetraPhenyl Butadiene (TPB) in order to be detected by photomultipliers with bialkali photocathodes. This thesis de- scribes the research and developments performed to detect the 128 nm VUV light with high efficiency and low threshold. The scintillation light from α particles in gaseous (GAr) and liquid argon (LAr) was used for the development of an optimal WLS coated reflector. Different coating techniques were investigated and optimized. The best results were achieved using the evaporation technique, a teflon membrane (Tetratex) as reflector material, and a WLS surface density of 1 mg/cm 2 (TPB). The LAr scintillation light was studied for different projectiles. The relative intensities of the scintillation components were measured for α−particles, electrons and muons. Neutron induced argon nuclear recoils were also measured. An evaporator chamber was constructed for the evaporation of the WLS on large surfaces. This research and development was preparatory for the construction of the ArDM light readout which is composed mainly of two parts: the side reflector and the light detector. The side reflector was segmented in panels which were coated using the large evaporator. The light detector is composed of an array of 14 × 8 ” cryogenic photomultipliers (PMTs). Different cryogenic PMTs were tested in the laboratory. A light readout system with the side reflector and 8 PMT modules with different coatings on the photocathodes, was assembled at CERN at the end of 2007. The data acquisition (DAQ) system was developed and tested. The performances of the light readout were measured in GAr and LAr using a movable internal Am α−source and external radioactive sources in different configurations. A light yield of 0. 50 ± 0. 05 p. e. /keVee (photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent) was obtained for 7 out 14 PMTs. The Hama- matsu R 5912 - 02 mod PMT was chosen for the construction of the 1 ton LAr detector which was assembled and tested in October 2009...|$|R
