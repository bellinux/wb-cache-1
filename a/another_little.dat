25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>little</b> known {{aspect of}} the Japanese {{occupation}} {{was the use of}} George Town's harbour facilities as a major U-boat base by Nazi Germany. Between 1942 and 1944, the Port of Penang was utilised by submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Kriegsmarine and the Regia Marina (of the Kingdom of Italy).Between 1944 and 1945, Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Force bomber squadrons based in India repeatedly bombed George Town, seeking to destroy the naval facilities and administrative centres. The destruction of the Penang Secretariat building by the Allied bombardment caused the loss of the greater part of the British and Japanese records concerning Penang Island, complicating post-war efforts to compile a comprehensive history of Penang. The Penang Strait was also mined to impede Japanese shipping.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} three sections to fulfill the established criteria. The first section, projecting outwards, had various workshops, cloakrooms and the foyer {{on the ground floor}} while upstairs it had a restaurant and a scenography studio. The second section housed the theatre proper. The boxes contained separate dressing rooms while the audience area was flat so that the hall could also be used as a ballroom. The third section, the stage, was designed in three sweeps with two lateral compartments large enough for backstage requirements. In his design for the horseshoe-shaped auditorium, Piermarini was inspired by the architecture of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples but changed the degree of curvature so as to improve visibility and the acoustics. The acoustics were further enhanced by a number of subsequent modifications. For the ceiling, a finely decorated wooden facing served as a natural sounding board, ensuring almost perfect sound in every part of the hall. It was considered to be among the best of the times. <b>Another</b> <b>little</b> trick was to reduce significantly the size of the usually huge columns separating the various stages. For the hall's decor, Piermarini worked with prominent artists such as Giuseppe Levati and Giocondo Albertolli while also consulting the poet Giuseppe Parini. The theatre underwent many alterations during the Napoleonic period after which it lost its Neoclassical interiors as a result of work carried out by artists such as Francesco Hayez.|$|E
500|$|Octavius's death devastated his father; Walpole wrote [...] "the King {{has lost}} <b>another</b> <b>little</b> child; a lovely boy, they say, of whom their Majesties were dotingly fond." [...] Shortly afterward, King George said [...] "There {{will be no}} Heaven for me if Octavius is not there." [...] The day after his son's death, the King passed through a room where artist Thomas Gainsborough was {{completing}} {{the finishing touches on}} a portrait of the family. The King asked him to stop, but when he found out that the painting was of Octavius, allowed the painter to continue. When this same painting was exhibited a week later, Octavius' sisters were so upset that they broke down and cried in front of everyone. Three months after Octavius' death, his father was still dwelling on his son, writing to Lord Dartmouth that every day [...] "increases the chasm I feel for want of that beloved object [...]" [...] In later years, King George imagined conversations with his two youngest sons. During one of the king's bouts of madness in 1788, George mistook a pillow for Octavius, who by that time had been dead for five years.|$|E
500|$|Procter {{showed a}} love of poetry from an early age, {{carrying}} with her while still a young child a [...] "tiny album ... into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother's hand before she herself could write ... as <b>another</b> <b>little</b> girl might have carried a doll". Procter published her first poem while still a teenager; the poem, [...] "Ministering Angels", appeared in Heath's Book of Beauty in 1843. In 1853 she submitted work to Dickens's Household Words under the name [...] "Mary Berwick", wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to Dickens's friendship with her father; Dickens did not learn [...] "Berwick's" [...] identity till the following year. The poem's publication began Proctor's long association with Dickens's periodicals; in all, Procter published 73 poems in Household Words and 7 poems in All the Year Round, {{most of which were}} collected into her first two volumes of poetry, both entitled Legends and Lyrics. She was also published in Good Words and Cornhill. As well as writing poetry, Procter was the editor of the journal Victoria Regia, which became the showpiece of the Victoria Press, [...] "an explicitly feminist publishing venture".|$|E

2500|$|Only one of {{the ships}} of Saint-Jean-de-Luz was allowed to fish in Spitsbergen by the Muscovy Company, while all the others went up to try and break their monopoly. One of the Saint-Jean-de-Luz ships, the Grace-de-Dieu (700–800 tons), under Mignet de Haristiguy, sailed into [...] "Schoonhoven" [...] (modern Recherche Fjord), Bellsund on 16 June (OS), where they found the Dutchmen Willem Cornelisz. van Muyden. The Dutch {{cartographer}} Hessel Gerritsz (1613) says they agreed to fish together, and drive off any other vessels that came into their harbor, as they later did to a small ship of Saint-Jean-de-Luz. They were discovered by the English on 11 July (OS). Van Muyden was detained; while the great ship of Saint-Jean-de-Luz agreed to give half the oil they made to the English. The smaller vessel from Saint-Jean-de-Luz previously forbidden to fish by Van Muyden also agreed to give some of the oil they made to the English. <b>Another</b> <b>little</b> pinnace of Saint-Jean-de-Luz {{was said to be}} behind Eders Island in the mouth of [...] "Zaandam Bay" [...] (Van Keulenfjorden).|$|E
2500|$|During the Turkish {{occupation}} (1541–1686), Islamic culture {{flourished in}} Budapest, multiple mosques and baths {{were built in}} the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture, which was influenced by Muslims from around the world not limited to Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After Holy Army conquered Budapest they turned most of the mosques with Churches, Minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point in time distinct sloping central square in Budapest became an bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with “the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India”. Budapest is in fact {{one of the few places}} in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Király Baths. <b>Another</b> <b>little</b> known fact is that Budapest is home to the northernmost place where a Tomb of an influential Islamic [...] Turkish Sufi Dervish, the Tomb of Gül Baba, a dervis could be found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary’s own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city’s self-conscious is the top section of the city’s main square, currently named as Szechenyi. In medieval time. When Turks came to the city, they built Mosque here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church. The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—“two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon”.|$|E
