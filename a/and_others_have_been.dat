5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme.

In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear and tear on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E
5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants.

25|$|Norethisterone (NET), {{also known}} as norethindrone, is a {{medication}} that is used in combination with estrogen or alone in hormonal contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and {{in the treatment of}} gynecological disorders.

In addition to its progestogenic activity, NET also has weak androgenic and estrogenic effects at high dosages. In addition to NET itself, several prodrugs of NET, such as norethisterone acetate (NETA), norethisterone enanthate (NETE), <b>and</b> <b>others,</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> marketed and have similar effects and uses.|$|E
25|$|The Italian Renaissance scholar Geralomo Cardano (1501–1575) {{considered}} {{him one of}} the twelve greatest minds of the Middle Ages.

His influence in the fields of physics, mathematics, medicine, philosophy and music were far-reaching and lasted for several centuries. Although most of his books have been lost over the centuries, a few have survived in the form of Latin translations by Gerard of Cremona, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rediscovered in Arabic manuscripts; most importantly, twenty-four of his lost works were located in the mid-twentieth century in a Turkish library.|$|E

25|$|Arguably, {{the most}} common Xing Yi Quan lineage in the West today is of the Yi Zong branch, which came down from Zhang Junfeng. Many of Zhang's {{students}} and grand-students, such as Kenneth Fish (martial artist), Hung I-Hsiang, Su Dongchen, Luo Dexiu, Xu Hongji <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> teaching his Xing Yi to Westerners since the 1980s - especially Americans. This branch became the most popular because Taiwan was open to Westerners during the 20th century, while throughout most of that century, the Communist regime on mainland China did not allow Westerners to visit regularly, and thus people were not exposed to branches of the art from the mainland. Contrary to popular belief, spread by some Taiwanese teachers, the art had not 'died out' on the mainland, but was simply inaccessible to outsiders for several decades (proof {{of this is that}} many lineages of the art discussed and referenced on this page had survived The Great Leap Forward and The Cultural Revolution). Another popular Taiwanese branch in the West is Wang Shujin's lineage, which was chiefly transmitted by his student Wang Fulai.|$|E

The Force has suffered heavily in protecting {{both sides of the}} community from danger – 302 officers {{have been killed in the}} line of duty and thousands more injured, many seriously. Many officers have been ostracised by their own community <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> forced to leave their homes in the face of threats to them and their families.
