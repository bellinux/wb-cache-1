5|$|It {{is perhaps}} no <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> factuality of the Italian Renaissance {{has been most}} vigorously {{questioned}} {{by those who are}} not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine {{had died in}} apartment 5A {{as a result of}} an <b>accident,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.|$|E

The Narcissus story tells of love corrupted by inward-looking selfishness, rather than by jealousy. It may be no <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Youth in the poem has connections to flower-imagery (the Narcissus being the Wild Daffodil).|$|E

25|$|Pacioli's {{treatise}} gave {{instructions on}} recording barter transactions and transactions {{in a variety}} of currencies – both of which were far more common than today. It also enabled merchants to audit their own books and to ensure that the entries in the accounting records made by their bookkeepers complied with the method he described. Without such a system, all merchants who did not maintain their own records were at greater risk of theft by their employees and agents: it is not by <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first and last items described in his treatise concern maintenance of an accurate inventory.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely known work {{associated}} with Marie de Romieu, her Brief discourse on the superiority of woman over man, {{was a response to}} an anti-feminist text penned by her brother, Jacques. Some critics attribute Jacques as the actual author of the Discourse, but this theory has been mostly rejected due to stylistic differences. Featured as the first piece in Premières Oeuvres, de Romieu’s discourse on the superiority of women builds itself by praising the courage, wit and virtue of women. It argues that women were visibly more beautiful than their male counterparts because they were a refined product from man, who had been made with clay. In her discourse, de Romieu asserts that women were superior to men in their sacrifices and charity work. She condemns men who fault women for their failings and for leading them astray, claiming they are responsible for their own actions. She also accuses men of trying to deliberately deceive women with ‘fine words’ and goes into great detail elaborating the different types of deception perpetrated by men: those who cite God's will and authority, those who pose as protectors of female virtue, or those who pretend to 'serve' women. Furthermore, she illustrates women as the source of learning, both in ancient times and her own. In her conclusion, she reasons that life without women would be lacking in social graces and virtues; she also points out that it is not by <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> classical virtues are depicted as women.|$|E

25|$|It wasn't by <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world's {{second and}} third grain {{elevators}} were built in Toledo, Ohio and Brooklyn, New York, in 1847. Fledgling American cities, they were connected through an emerging international grain trade of unprecedented proportions. Grain shipments from farms in Ohio were loaded onto ships by elevators at Toledo; these ships were unloaded by elevators at Buffalo that transshipped their grain to canal boats (and, later, rail cars), which were unloaded by elevators in Brooklyn, where the grain was either distributed to East Coast flour mills or loaded for further transshipment to England, the Netherlands, or Germany. But this eastern flow of grain was matched by an equally important flow of people and capital in the opposite direction, that is, from East to West. Because {{of the money to}} be made in grain production and, of course, because of the very existence of an all-water route to get there, increasing numbers of immigrants in Brooklyn came to Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to become farmers. More farmers meant more prairies turned into farmlands, which in turn meant increased grain production, which of course meant that more grain elevators would have to be built in places like Toledo, Buffalo, and Brooklyn (and Cleveland, Chicago, and Duluth). It was precisely through this feedback loop of productivity — set in motion by the invention of the grain elevator — that America itself became an agricultural and economic colossus on the world stage: the planet's single largest producer of wheat, corn, oats, and rice, a distinction it claims to this day.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E

André Bazin said [...] "as a conventional love story, the film {{could have been a}} success if the scenario had respected the rules of the movie game. But Renoir wanted to make his own style of drame gai, and the mixture of genres proved disconcerting to the public." [...] Film critic Claude Beylie called it [...] "the cornerstone of the work of Jean Renoir, the point of arrival and the swan song of the French cinema of the thirties...The Rules of the Game is a rare combination of satire, vaudeville and tragedy." [...] It was a major source of inspiration for Alain Resnais, who said seeing the film was [...] "the single most overwhelming experience I have ever had at the cinema";and [...] Louis Malle, who said [...] "for all of us, my generation of French filmmakers, La Regle du jeu was the absolute masterpiece." [...] François Truffaut articulated the film's enormous influence and said [...] "it isn't an <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Rules of the Game inspired a large number of young people who had first thought of expressing themselves as novelists to take up careers as filmmakers." [...] He also said [...] "It is the credo of movie lovers, the film of films, the film most hated when it was made and most appreciated afterwards, {{to the extent that it}} ultimately became a true commercial success." ...|$|E
