5|$|He {{successfully}} {{defended his}} championship belt at , defeating former Shooto Middleweight Champion Hayato Sakurai via TKO due to strikes at 3:01 {{of the fourth}} round. In {{the first round of}} the fight, Hughes spent all the time either clinching Sakurai up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> or ripping his feet out from under him. In round 2, Sakurai landed a right hand that sent Hughes to the mat; despite this, Matt won the round by spending three minutes hitting Sakurai with elbows from the top position. At the start of the third round, Hughes quickly slammed Sakurai to the ground, again staying three minutes on top. He looked too strong for Sakurai. Hughes finished the bout in the 4th round, by taking down Sakurai and transitioning to full mount. After one minute of ground-and-pound onslaught, the contest was over as Sakurai had no answer for the champion.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{third in}} the 1996 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Atlético Mineiro qualified for the 1997 Copa CONMEBOL.

Poirier rocked Alvarez in {{the second}} round, but was {{subsequently}} dropped when Alvarez landed two illegal knees while Poirier was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> With the Texas commission not operating under the new unified rules, referee Herb Dean declared the fight a No Contest as {{he did not believe}} Alvarez knew Poirier was a grounded opponent at the time.|$|E

25|$|Poirier {{challenged}} Jim Miller on February 11, 2017 at UFC 208. Poirier punched Miller <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> {{which appeared}} to hurt Miller. In return, Miller repeatedly kicked Poirier's legs. Later on, Miller swept Poirier onto the mat and failed a kimura attempt. Poirier won the back-and-forth fight via majority decision. The win also earned Poirier $50,000 and his third Fight of the Night bonus award. Due to injuries sustained during the fight, Poirier was suspended indefinitely.|$|E
500|$|On 10 September, {{the police}} arrested a notorious local called John Pizer, dubbed [...] "Leather Apron", {{who had a}} {{reputation}} for terrorising local prostitutes. His alibis for the two most recent murders were corroborated, and he was released without charge. At the inquest one of the witnesses, Mrs Elizabeth Long, testified that she had seen Chapman talking to a man at about 5:30am just beyond the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street, where Chapman was later found. Baxter inferred that the man Mrs Long had seen was the murderer. Mrs Long described him as over forty, a little taller than Chapman, of dark complexion, and of foreign, [...] "shabby-genteel" [...] appearance. He was wearing a brown deer-stalker hat and a dark overcoat. Another witness, carpenter Albert Cadosch, had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street at about the same time, and heard voices in the yard followed by the sound of something falling <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{project has}} {{received}} controversy after accusations by their investors and conservationists of manipulating the behaviour of the tigers {{for the purpose}} of a film production, Living with Tigers, with the tigers believed to be unable to hunt. Stuart Bray, who had originally invested a large sum of money in the project, claimed that he and his wife, Li Quan, watched the film crew [...] " [...] the prey up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> and into the path of the tigers {{just for the sake of}} dramatic footage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1966, {{the newly}} {{relocated}} Atlanta Braves were reportedly desperate for pitchers. Geiger, Rico Carty and Gene Oliver were outfielders mentioned as possible [...] "trade bait". [...] But Geiger was {{still with the}} Braves on July 28, 1967 when they rose to 3rd place in the National League. Filling in for an injured Mack Jones, he was a whiz in center field with a fine catch in the 6th inning to help the Braves out of a bases-loaded jam and then, the next inning, [...] caught a fly ball <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With the win Florian {{established}} himself as the #1 contender for the Lightweight Championship. Florian said [...] "I want B.J.'s belt. B.J., you're {{one of the best}} fighters out there. I'm here to test myself. I think you're a great fighter, someone I look up to. I consider you a master. It's time to kill that master." [...] Florian faced off against Penn at the UFC 101 Main Event for the title. During the fight, Florian repeatedly pushed Penn <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> and attempted to take him down but was never successful. During the 4th round Penn took him down and mounted him. Penn eventually took his back and locked up a Rear Naked Choke, submitting Florian and defending his title. [...] Florian was visibly crying as he left the octagon after his loss to Penn.|$|E

2500|$|With this {{painting}}, Munch met his {{stated goal}} of [...] "the {{study of the}} soul, {{that is to say}} the study of my own self". Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, Mantle batted [...]321 in 123 games. He was {{selected}} an All-Star for the eleventh consecutive season and {{played in the}} first game, but due to a former injury acting up, he didn't play in the second All-Star game. In 1963, he batted [...]314 in 65 games. On June 5, he tried to prevent a home run by Brooks Robinson in Baltimore and got his shoe spikes caught in the center field chain link fence as he leaped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> for the ball and was coming down. He broke his foot and didn't return playing again until August 4 when he hit a pinch-hit home run against the Baltimore Orioles in Yankee Stadium. He returned to the center field position on September 2. On June 29, he had been selected an All-Star as a starting center fielder, {{but for the first}} time, he didn't make the 25-player team due to the foot injury. In 1964, Mantle hit [...]303 with 35 home runs and 111 RBIs, and played center field in the All-Star game. In {{the bottom of the ninth}} inning of Game 3 of the 1964 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Mantle blasted Barney Schultz's first pitch into the right field stands at Yankee Stadium, which won the game for the Yankees 2–1. The homer, his 16th World Series round tripper, broke the World Series record of 15 set by Babe Ruth. He hit two more homers in the series to set the existing World Series record of 18 home runs. The Cardinals ultimately won the World Series in 7 games.|$|E
