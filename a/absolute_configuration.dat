50|$|Until 1951 {{it was not}} {{possible}} to obtain the <b>absolute</b> <b>configuration</b> of chiral compounds. It was at some time decided that (+)-glyceraldehyde was the (R)-enantiomer. The configuration of other chiral compounds was then related to that of (+)-glyceraldehyde by sequences of chemical reactions. For example, oxidation of (+)-glyceraldehyde (1) with mercury oxide gives (−)-glyceric acid (2), a reaction that does not alter the stereocenter. Thus the <b>absolute</b> <b>configuration</b> of (−)-glyceric acid must be the same as that of (+)-glyceraldehyde. Nitric acid oxidation of (+)-isoserine (3) gives (-)-glyceric acid, establishing that (+)-isoserine also has the same <b>absolute</b> <b>configuration.</b> (+)-Isoserine can be converted by a two-stage process of bromination and zinc reduction to give (-)-lactic acid, therefore (-)-lactic acid also has the same <b>absolute</b> <b>configuration.</b> If a reaction gave the enantiomer of a known configuration, as indicated by the opposite sign of optical rotation, it would indicate that the <b>absolute</b> <b>configuration</b> is inverted.|$|E
