25|$|Their gross {{appearance}} is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors {{are characterized by}} the presence of Schiller-Duval bodies (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> and can be immunohistochemically stained for its presence; the level of <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of A-T is usually suspected by {{the combination of}} neurologic clinical features (ataxia, abnormal control of eye movement, and postural instability) with telangiectasia and sometimes increased infections, and confirmed by specific laboratory abnormalities (elevated <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> levels, increased chromosomal breakage or cell death of white blood cells after exposure to X-rays, absence of ATM protein in white blood cells, or mutations {{in each of the}} person’s ATM genes).|$|E
25|$|Embryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type {{usually found}} in mixed tumors, develop {{directly}} from germ cells {{but are not}} terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further {{into a variety of}} other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> (in 75% of cases) and hCG.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} germ-cell tumors, {{follow-up}} tests generally include <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> (AFP) and/or human chorionic gonadotropin. For women with stromal cancers, tests for hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and inhibin are sometimes helpful. Inhibin {{can also be}} useful for monitoring the progress of sex-cord tumors, along with mullerian inhibiting substance. AFP {{can also be used}} to monitor Sertoli-Leydig tumors. In dysgerminomas, lactate dehydrogenase and its two isozymes (LDH-1 and LDH-2) are used to test for recurrence.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosing {{germ cell}} tumors may be {{difficult}} because the normal menstrual cycle and puberty can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of teen pregnancy. Blood tests for <b>alpha-fetoprotein,</b> karyotype, human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign ovarian cyst.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancer's {{early stages}} (I/II) are {{difficult}} to diagnose because most symptoms are nonspecific and thus of little use in diagnosis; as a result, it is rarely diagnosed until it spreads and advances to later stages (III/IV). Additionally, symptoms of ovarian cancer may appear similar to irritable bowel syndrome. In patients in whom pregnancy is a possibility, BHCG level should be measured during the diagnosis process. Serum <b>alpha-fetoprotein,</b> neuron-specific enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase should be measured in young girls and adolescents with suspected ovarian tumors as younger patients {{are more likely to}} have malignant germ cell tumors.|$|E
25|$|In {{a person}} {{where there is}} higher {{suspicion}} of HCC, such as a person with symptoms or abnormal blood tests (i.e. <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> and des-gamma carboxyprothrombin levels), evaluation requires imaging of the liver by CT or MRI scans. Optimally, these scans are performed with intravenous contrast in multiple phases of hepatic perfusion {{in order to improve}} detection and accurate classification of any liver lesions by the interpreting radiologist. Due to the characteristic blood flow pattern of HCC tumors, a specific perfusion pattern of any detected liver lesion may conclusively detect an HCC tumor. Alternatively, the scan may detect an indeterminate lesion and further evaluation may be performed by obtaining a physical sample of the lesion.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{germ cell}} tumors are {{the type of}} ovarian cancer most likely to occur during pregnancy. They are {{typically}} diagnosed when an adnexal mass is found on examination (in 1–2% of all pregnancies), a tumor is seen on ultrasound, or the parent's level of <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> is elevated. Dermoid cysts and dysgerminomas {{are the most common}} germ cell tumors during pregnancy. Germ cell tumors diagnosed during pregnancy are unlikely to have metastasized and can be treated by surgery and, in some cases, chemotherapy, which carries the risk of birth defects. Yolk sac tumors and immature teratomas grow particularly quickly and are usually treated with chemotherapy even during pregnancy; however, dysgerminomas that have been optimally debulked may be treated after childbirth.|$|E
25|$|Spina bifida is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. After having one child with the condition or if one of the parents has the condition, there is a 4% chance that the next child will also be affected. Not having enough folate in the diet before and during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born. Before birth if a blood test or amniocentesis finds a high level of <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> (AFP), there is a higher risk of spina bifida. Ultrasound examination may also detect the problem. Medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth. It is a type of neural tube defect with other types including anencephaly and encephalocele.|$|E
25|$|Germ cell {{tumors of the}} ovary develop {{from the}} ovarian germ cells. Germ cell tumor {{accounts}} for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are teratomas and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, {{when one of the}} germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma. Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s–30s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group. Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas, when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an isochromosome 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other. Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They {{are more likely to be}} stage I at diagnosis. Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: choriocarcinomas are monitored with beta-HCG and endodermal sinus tumors with <b>alpha-fetoprotein.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{basic premise}} of the eu-FEDS {{hypothesis}} is that both soluble and cell surface associated glycoproteins, present in the reproductive system and expressed on gametes, suppress any potential immune responses, and inhibit rejection of the fetus.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{method of testing}} for hepatoblastoma is a blood test {{checking}} the <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> level. <b>Alpha-fetoprotein</b> (AFP) {{is used as a}} biomarker to help determine the presence of liver cancer in children. At birth, infants have relatively high levels of AFP, which fall to normal adult levels by the first year of life. The normal level for AFP in children has been reported as lower than 50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) and 10 ng/ml. An AFP level greater than 500 (ng/ml) is a significant indicator of hepatoblastoma. AFP is also used as an indicator of treatment success. If treatments are successful in removing the cancer, the AFP level is expected to return to normal.|$|E
50|$|His main {{research}} has been in antenatal screening of pregnant women for congenital malformations.

50|$|Open {{spina bifida}} {{can usually be}} {{detected}} during pregnancy by fetal ultrasound. Increased levels of maternal serum <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> (MSAFP) should be followed up by two tests - an ultrasound of the fetal spine and amniocentesis of the mother's amniotic fluid (to test for <b>alpha-fetoprotein</b> and acetylcholinesterase). AFP tests are now mandated by some state laws (including California). and failure to provide them can have legal ramifications. In one case, a man born with spina bifida was awarded a $2-million settlement after court found his mother's OBGYN negligent for not performing these tests. Spina bifida {{may be associated with}} other malformations as in dysmorphic syndromes, often resulting in spontaneous miscarriage.
