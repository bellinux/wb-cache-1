5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E
5|$|Hemmings {{conducted}} <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> surveyed 102 progressive heads—broadly defined—of infant, elementary, {{and secondary}} schools about Neill's influence. Their responses indicated that Neill had significant impact on how the profession perceived teacher–pupil relations. The respondents also reported significant influence from Neill on moral and sex education. Contrarily, Neill had little impact on school curriculum and classroom teaching methods. Hemmings received little response from heads of state comprehensive schools.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} Apatosaurus have been {{designated}} from scant material. Marsh named as many species as he could, {{which resulted in}} many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005 Paul Upchurch and colleagues published <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> analyzed the species and specimen relationships of Apatosaurus. They found that A.louisae was the most basal species, followed by FMNHP25112, and then a polytomy of A.ajax, A.parvus, and A.excelsus. Their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015, which resolved the relationships of Apatosaurus slightly differently, and also supported separating Brontosaurus from Apatosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Misbah Al-Khayr and Hashim Al-Samira'i, in {{an article}} from the 1995 book Children in the Muslim Middle East, {{reported}} on <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> sought to evaluate the influence of Iftah Ya Simsim on its Baghdad viewers' knowledge about language, general information, mathematics, science, and moral principles. The study found that 85% of all children residing in Baghdad had watched it and that they interacted with and were attached to many of its characters, who exposed viewers to the accents of the region. The most popular segments were those that contained cartoons, songs, and puppets. The show's viewers demonstrated an increase in their understanding and knowledge in all areas, especially information about their social and natural environment.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1699, {{other members}} of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> it was Newton who was the true {{discoverer}} and labelled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Diplodocidae, a clade of {{gigantic}} sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including Diplodocus, Supersaurus, and Barosaurus. Apatosaurus is sometimes classified in the subfamily Apatosaurinae, which may also include Suuwassea, Supersaurus, and Brontosaurus. Othniel Charles Marsh described Apatosaurus as allied to Atlantosaurus within the now-defunct group Atlantosauridae. In 1878 Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including Apatosaurus, Atlantosaurus, Morosaurus (=Camarasaurus) and Diplodocus. He classified this group within Sauropoda, a group he erected in the same study. In 1903 Elmer S. Riggs said the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names; he grouped Apatosaurus within Opisthocoelia. Sauropoda is still used as the group name. In 2011, John Whitlock published <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> placed Apatosaurus a more basal diplodocid, sometimes less basal than Supersaurus.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the shuttle will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this part of the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The cost of this part of the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E

5|$|In 1903 Elmer Riggs {{published}} <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> {{described a}} well-preserved {{skeleton of a}} diplodocid from the Grand River Valley near Fruita, Colorado, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age {{to those of the}} Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described Brontosaurus. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus ajax, Riggs realized that the holotype of A.ajax was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since Apatosaurus was the earlier name, Brontosaurus should be considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus. Because of this, Riggs recombined Brontosaurus excelsus as Apatosaurus excelsus. Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to Apatosaurus, Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to A.excelsus.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, {{political}} friction increased {{between the}} Army and the Air Force over the {{close air support}} (CAS) mission. The Air Force asserted that the Cheyenne would infringe on the Air Force's CAS mission {{in support of the}} Army, which had been mandated with the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> concluded that the Air Force's A-X program, the Marine Corps' Harrier, and the Cheyenne were significantly different that they did not constitute a duplication of capabilities. On 22 October 1971, the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Tactical Air Power conducted hearings to evaluate the CAS mission and the pending programs. The most damaging testimony for the Army's program came from the commander of the Air Force's Tactical Air Command, General William W. Momyer, who cited helicopter casualty statistics of Operation Lam Son 719.|$|E
