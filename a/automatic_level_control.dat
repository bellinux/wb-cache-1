Frequency variations smaller than 0. 0001 ppm/s for each oscillator and a frequency drift of about 2. 5 ppm/year of the frequency difference are the measured performance concerning, respectively, the short-term (1 s) and long-term frequency stability of these integrated high performance crystal oscillators over the 30 degrees C- 225 degrees C temperature range. Other important characteristics are the very stable and constant oscillation levels (~ 1. 1 Vpp), the small second-harmonic distortion (~ 60 dR), and the phase noise (~ 95 dB at 50 kHz shift). The characteristics of these oscillators make them also suitable for many other measurement systems (time, temperature, and other physical and chemical quantities), especially if they are constrained to operate under severe temperature condition...|$|R

Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that obese people (n= 27) would show more sensitivity to the palatability of (high-fat) palatable foods than unrestrained lean controls (n= 27) would. However, results suggested that the priming effect was based on health concerns, in that participants showed a preference for low-fat palatable foods over high-fat palatable foods. Average speed of responding and context are discussed as variables influencing the affective priming effect. Taken together, results suggest that food evaluations at a relatively <b>automatic</b> <b>level</b> are <b>controlled</b> by an interaction between participant characteristics, stimuli characteristics, and the specific context...|$|R
