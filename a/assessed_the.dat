5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, {{the giant}} {{freshwater}} stingray inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys on small fishes and invertebrates. Females give live birth to litters {{of one to}} four pups, which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat, recreation, and aquarium display, as well as extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation. These forces have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central Thailand and Cambodia. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> giant freshwater stingray as Endangered.|$|E
5|$|Early on April15, Sudal passed {{very near}} the {{uninhabited}} Japanese island of Iwo Jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April15, the JTWC <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on April18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E

5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Late on November14, Podul made {{landfall}} {{in southeastern}} Vietnam near Phan Rang–Tháp Chàm and quickly weakened into a tropical depression. The JTWC <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> circulation was dissipating near the coast, and the JMA declared Podul dissipated at 1200UTC on November15. Operationally, the agency tracked the system into the Gulf of Thailand, and the Thai Meteorological Department tracked Podul to near the Malay Peninsula on November16, before ceasing advisories on the storm. The remnants later redeveloped into Cyclonic Storm Helen in the Bay of Bengal, which later struck southeastern India on November22 before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> bluespotted ribbontail ray as Near Threatened. Although still {{relatively}} common and widely distributed, this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range, from development and destructive fishing practices using cyanide or dynamite. In addition, its populations are under heavy pressure by artisanal and commercial fisheries, and by local collecting for the aquarium trade.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> {{epaulette}} shark as of Least Concern.

Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks. Off New Guinea, the {{epaulette shark}} has been assessed as Near Threatened, as there it faces habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices, and over-exploitation by artisan fishers.|$|E
