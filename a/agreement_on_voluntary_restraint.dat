40|$|This paper uses an {{experimental}} design {{to assess the}} effectiveness of calls on cooperation in managing the shortage of a vital commodity through non-price mechanisms. Using the large unexpected shortage of flu-vaccines in the Fall 2004, we observed {{the responses of the}} members of a campus population to two distinct randomized treatments: providing information about a sharply reduced number of vaccination clinics and their schedule, and providing the same information plus an appeal <b>on</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraints</b> to favor priority groups. We find that information about the reduced number of clinics induced a 119 % increase in demand. Appeals to cooperation helped reduce this demand by only 19 %. Information about scarcity was effective in increasing the vaccination of priority individuals by 54 %, with virtually no exclusion errors among those who came to the clinic. However, a disconcerting result is that people not in priority groups responded even more to the information about scarcity than members of priority groups and, despite some screening done at the clinic itself, largely managed to be vaccinated. For every four legitimate additional vaccinations, three were given to non-priority persons. Furthermore, this number is certainly an underestimation, as it is based on self-declared membership in priority groups, and we have evidence that there was cheating on these declarations. The sobering conclusion is that broad-scale calls on cooperation, complemented by soft-screening, to manage the vaccine shortage were largely defeated by rising salience of vaccination and reduced procrastination among non-priority groups and by extensive cheating...|$|R

Their econometric estimates indicate a limited ability to redirect sales to unrestricted markets and a sharp fall in the marginal revenue during the period the OMA was in effect. They found that the marginal revenue product of factors employed in leather footwear declined as much as 9 percent because of OMA. Based on illustrative counterfactual simulations, the authors show that a VER is likely to produce a welfare loss if demand is relatively elastic and supply is not.

40|$|The {{realization}} of a multifaceted self {{is an ideal}} one strives to realize. One realizes such a self in large part through interaction with others in various social roles. Such realization requires a significant degree of informational privacy. Informational privacy {{is the ability to}} determine for yourself when others may collect and how they may use your information. The {{realization of}} multifaceted selves requires informational privacy in public. There is no contradiction here: informational privacy is a matter of control, and you can have such control in public. Current information processing practices greatly reduce privacy in public thereby threatening the realization of multifaceted selves. To understand way this is happening and {{to figure out how to}} respond, we analyze the foundations of privacy in public. Privacy in public consists in privacy by obscurity and privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> Privacy by obscurity is essentially a matter of getting lost in the crowd. Privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> was perhaps first explicitly discussed by the great nineteen century sociologist, Georg Simmel. He was impressed by the fact that people voluntary limit their knowledge of each other as interact in various social roles. Merchants and customers, students and teachers, restaurant customers and waiters, for example, typically exchange only the information necessary to their interaction in those roles and voluntarily refrain from requesting, disclosing, or otherwise discovering more. Advances in information processing have greatly reduced both privacy by obscurity and privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> We focus <b>on</b> the latter. One reason is that, as privacy by obscurity declines, the need for privacy in public by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> increases. We confine our attention to the private sector; however, given the current corporate-government surveillance partnership, constraining private information processing is an essential part of constraining governmental processing. Unlike privacy by obscurity, you need the cooperation of others to realize privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> We explain the cooperation by appeal to informational norms, norms that define contextually varying permissions and restrictions on the collection, use, and distribution of information. Norm-implemented coordination is essential to privacy in public (in the form of <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint),</b> and it is this coordination that advances in information processing and related business practices undermined. This happens in two ways. First, businesses exploit existing norms to create a debased form of “coordination” that serves their interests while eroding privacy in public. Second, technology-driven business innovation has created new forms of interaction not governed by relevant information norms. This lack of norms means the lack the coordination essential to privacy in public. As privacy in public disappears, multifaceted selves face the threat of disappearing—literally—from the scene. The solution is to establish norms that ensure sufficient privacy in public. We conclude by considering the prospects for doing so. Our results are highly relevant to the proper legal approach to privacy. A critical task for legal regulation, as well as public policy generally, is the creation of appropriate informational norms. One of our primary motives is to reorient privacy regulation toward that task...|$|R

That relieves some of the competitive pressure on domestic suppliers, and both they and the foreign suppliers gain {{at the expense of}} a loss to consumers, and to the domestic economy, in addition to which there is a deadweight loss to the world economy. When quotas were banned under the rules of the General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the United States, Britain and the European Union made use of equivalent arrangements known as <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> agreements (VRAs) or <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraints</b> (VERs) which were negotiated with the governments of exporting countries (mainly Japan) - until they too were banned.

First, culpability requires that the actus reus as a whole (rather than merely one element of the actus reus) be voluntary. Second, the voluntariness requirement is an affirmative element of every offense, with the prosecution bearing the burden of proving voluntariness.
