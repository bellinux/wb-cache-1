5|$|Every year on Bennington Battle Day {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> of the Molly Stark Cannon, the oldest firing cannon in the United States. The cannon was {{captured}} at the Battle of Bennington.|$|E
5|$|In Tyrol, Andreas Hofer led a {{rebellion}} against Bavarian rule and French domination {{that resulted in}} early isolated victories, but the uprising was suppressed after the French won at Wagram. Hofer was executed in 1810 by <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> squad.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>fire</b> whirl – also colloquially {{known as}} <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> devil, fire tornado, firenado, or fire twister – is a {{whirlwind}} induced by <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> and often {{made up of}} flame or ash.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>fire</b> hose (or firehose) is a {{high-pressure}} hose that carries water or other fire retardant (such as foam) to <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> to extinguish it. Outdoors, it attaches either to <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> engine or <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> hydrant. Indoors, it can permanently attach to a building's standpipe or plumbing system.|$|R
50|$|Without {{sufficient}} oxygen, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> cannot begin, and it cannot continue. With a decreased oxygen concentration, {{the combustion}} process slows. Oxygen can be denied to <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> using <b>a</b> carbon dioxide <b>fire</b> extinguisher, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> blanket or water.|$|R
5|$|As the French approached, the British lines {{held their}} fire. Wolfe had devised <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> method for {{stopping}} French column advances in 1755 {{that called for}} the centre—in this case, the 43rd and 47th Foot regiments—to hold fire {{while waiting for the}} advancing force to approach within , then open fire at close range.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1917, 114 {{officers}} and 1156 {{men of the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC) Armament School moved into Hillingdon House, with the RFC making a donation of £2289 12s 9d to the Canadian Red Cross. Needing a site for the training of recruits in ground gunnery, the RFC used parts of the estate not required by the Canadian hospital and established <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> range {{on the opposite side}} of the river from the house.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie Lee Gardner (January 16, 1961 – June 18, 2010) was an American {{criminal}} {{who received}} {{the death penalty for}} murder in 1985, and was executed by <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> squad by the state of Utah in 2010. Gardner's case spent nearly 25years in the court system, prompting the Utah House of Representatives to introduce legislation {{to limit the number of}} appeals in capital cases.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>fire</b> blanket is <b>a</b> {{safety device}} {{designed}} to extinguish incipient (starting) fires. It {{consists of a}} sheet of <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> retardant material which is placed over <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> in order to smother it.|$|R
50|$|Threats to {{fire safety}} are {{commonly}} referred to as <b>fire</b> hazards. <b>A</b> <b>fire</b> hazard may include a situation that increases the likelihood of <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> or may impede escape in the event <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> occurs.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the night}} of 18April, Turret Two's crew {{conducted}} a major overhaul of their turret in preparation for <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> exercise scheduled to take place the next day. The center gun's compressed air system, which cleansed the bore of sparks and debris each time the gun was fired, was not operating properly.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{returned}} to creating fictional nations as allusions to real countries in subsequent Adventures, such as Syldavia and Borduria (based largely on Yugoslavia and Nazi Germany) in King Ottokar's Sceptre and Sondonesia (based on Indonesia) in Flight 714 to Sydney. He also re-used other elements pioneered in The Broken Ear {{in his later}} Adventures: a parrot in The Castafiore Emerald, a ravine crash in The Calculus Affair, a fireball and vivid dream in The Seven Crystal Balls, and <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> squad in Tintin and the Picaros. Tintin {{returned to}} San Theodores in Tintin and the Picaros, in which the characters Pablo and Ridgewell also made a reappearance.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>fire</b> barrier wall, or <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> partition, is <b>a</b> {{fire-rated wall}} {{assembly}} that provides {{lower levels of}} protection than typically provided by <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> wall. The main differences are that these fire resistant walls are not structurally self-sufficient.|$|R
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E
5|$|Most Shogunate troops used Büchse (Gewehr) smoothbore guns, {{which had}} been {{imported}} in Japan since around 1840, initially from the Netherlands by Takashima Akiho. These guns were rather ancient and had limited capabilities, with an effective lethal range of about 50 meters, and <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> rate of about 2 rounds per minute. The daimyō of Nagaoka however, an ally of the Shogun, possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles. The Shogunate {{is known to have}} placed an order for 30,000 modern Dreyse needle guns in 1866. Napoleon III provided Tokugawa Yoshinobu with 2,000 state-of-the-art Chassepot rifles, which he used to equip his personal guard. Antiquated Tanegashima matchlock guns are also known to have been used by the Bakufu however.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>fire</b> {{extinguisher}} is <b>an</b> active <b>fire</b> {{protection device}} used to extinguish or control small fires, often in emergency situations. It {{is not intended}} for use on <b>an</b> out-of-control <b>fire,</b> such as one which has reached the ceiling, endangers the user (i.e., no escape route, smoke, explosion hazard, etc.), or otherwise requires the expertise of <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> department. Typically, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> extinguisher consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> Fire extinguishers manufactured with non-cylindrical pressure vessels also exist, but are less common.|$|R
50|$|The {{triangle}} {{illustrates the}} three elements <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> needs to ignite: heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent (usually oxygen). <b>A</b> <b>fire</b> naturally {{occurs when the}} elements are present and combined in the right mixture, meaning that <b>fire</b> is actually <b>an</b> event rather than <b>a</b> thing. <b>A</b> <b>fire</b> can be prevented or extinguished by removing {{any one of the}} elements in the fire triangle. For example, covering <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> with <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> blanket removes the oxygen part of the triangle and can extinguish <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> In large fires where firefighters are called in, decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area.|$|R
5|$|Officers found <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> range {{inside a}} disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher. An earlier version of the rocket launcher, the RPG-7, {{had been in the}} possession of the Provisional IRA from as early as 1972, {{but this was the first}} time the RPG-18 had been found in the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland. Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|She was {{transferred}} to the I Division in 1897, where she participated in the annual fleet exercises in August and September. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, the Maneuver Squadron returned to its home port in Wilhelmshaven. She served in the defending squadron during the AugustSeptember 1900 maneuvers. In 1904, Jagd was withdrawn from active service and used as a harbor ship. Jagd was stricken from the naval register on 14 May 1910 and subsequently hulked. She was based in Friedrichsort outside Kiel and used as <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> platform for torpedo training until she was broken up for scrap in 1920 at Rüstringen.|$|E
5|$|The Second Boer War had {{alerted the}} army to the dangers posed by fire zones that were covered by long-range, magazine-fed rifles. In the place of volley firing and frontal attacks, there was a greater {{emphasis}} on advancing in extended order, the use of available cover, the use of artillery to support the attack, flank and converging attacks and fire and movement. The Army expected units to advance as far as possible in <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> line without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>fire</b> ring is {{designed}} to contain <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> that is built directly upon the ground, such as <b>a</b> campfire. <b>Fire</b> rings have no bottom, and are simply circles made of forged metal, stones, concrete, etc. which surround and contain <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> Manufactured steel fire rings are available in various sizes to suit every need.|$|R
5000|$|On October 13, 2016, the {{historic}} structure was reopened, {{in a public}} ceremony -- but as <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> education center, not <b>an</b> active <b>fire</b> station. [...] While it will be capable of operating <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> engine, no engine will be stationed there. Rather <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> captain and six fire educators will conduct fire safety outreach.|$|R
50|$|The 20th century {{brought with}} it a new school {{building}} in 1906, and new financial help for Wallenborn from <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> insurance institution as “aid”. In 1910, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> brigade was founded, and also <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> brigade orchestra. Waterworks came in 1921.|$|R
5|$|The Third of May also depicts an execution, {{an early}} {{event in the}} {{so-called}} Peninsular War between France and Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain in 1808, capturing its royal family and replacing them with his brother, Joseph. The French were as unpopular in Spain as they later were in Mexico, and they encountered a fierce insurrection, which ultimately triumphed. The Third of May execution was an indiscriminate killing of civilians by French soldiers in reprisal for a guerrilla attack the previous day. Goya's painting of the massacre, which shows terrified civilians facing <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> squad, was intended to arouse anger and hatred {{on the part of}} Spanish viewers. Goya's is a highly romantic picture of a deeply emotional episode.|$|E
5|$|The castle design {{formed an}} inner and an outer ward, {{surrounded}} in turn by a moat, now partially filled. The main {{entrance to the}} castle was the Gate next the Sea, next to the castle's tidal dock that allowed it to be supplied directly by sea. The dock was protected by a wall later named the Gunners Walk and <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> platform that may have housed a trebuchet siege engine during the medieval period. The Gate next the Sea led into an outer barbican, protected by a drawbridge, arrow slits and murder-holes, leading on into the outer ward.|$|E
5|$|The film Il giorno di San Sebastiano (Saint Sebastian's Day) (1993), {{directed}} by Pasquale Scimeca, {{is based on}} the Caltavuturo massacre on January 20, 1893, when during the celebration of Saint Sebastian, <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> squad killed 15 peasants who claimed their right to state-owned land. It won a Golden Globe and was presented at the Venice film festival. The play, a monologue depicting a peasant woman whose husband was killed in the events at Caltavuturo, was written by Rosario Garibaldi Bosco and first performed on February 2, 1893, in Palermo {{to raise money for the}} victims.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>fire</b> alarm box, {{fire alarm}} call box, or fire alarm pull box is a device used for notifying <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> {{department}} of <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> Typically installed on street corners, {{they were the}} main means of summoning firefighters before the general availability of telephones.|$|R
