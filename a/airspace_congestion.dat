Responses from the ATC Service Provider go to the HF radio operator who contacts the airplane. The voice quality of the connection is often poor, leading to repeated messages.

This leads to procedures which keep airplanes separated {{by as much as}} 100 nmi km laterally, 10 minutes in trail, and 4000 ft in altitude. These procedures reduce the number of airplanes which can operate in a given airspace.

Finally, the cooperative co-evolution (CC) algorithm combined with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is introduced for each population. Empirical studies using the real air traffic data of the Chinese air route network and daily flight plans show that our method outperforms the existing approaches, multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), CC-based multi-objective algorithm (CCMA) as well as other two MPEAs with different migration interval strategies...|$|E

40|$|With the {{objective}} of handling the <b>airspace</b> sector <b>congestion</b> subject to continuously growing air traffic, we suggest to create a collaborative working plan during the strategic phase of air traffic control. The plan obtained via a new decision support tool {{presented in this article}} consists in a schedule for controllers, which specifies time of overflight on the different waypoints of the flight plans. In order to do it, we believe that the decision-support tool shall model directly the uncertainty at a trajectory level in order to propagate the uncertainty to the sector level. Then, the probability of congestion for any sector in the airspace can be computed. Since air traffic regulations and sector congestion are antagonist, we designed and implemented a multi-objective optimization algorithm for determining the best trade-off between these two criteria. The solution comes up as a set of alternatives for the multi-sector planner where the severity of the congestion cost is adjustable.

Trials of the DWR system have shown that significant delay savings are possible. However, some DWR advised routes are also rejected by dispatchers or modified before being accepted. Similarly, of those sent by dispatchers to flight crews as proposed route change requests, many are not accepted by air traffic control, or are modified before implementation as Center route amendments. Such actions suggest that the operational acceptability of DWR advised route corrections could be improved, which may reduce workload and increase delay savings. This paper analyzes the historical usage of different flight routings, varying from simple waypoint pairs to lengthy strings of waypoints incorporating jet routes, {{in order to improve}} DWR route acceptability. An approach is developed that can be incorporated into DWR, advising routings with high historical usage and savings potential {{similar to that of the}} nominal DWR advisory. It is hypothesized that modifying a nominal DWR routing to one that is commonly used, and nearby, will result in more actual savings since common routings are generally familiar and operationally acceptable to air traffic control. The approach allows routing segments with high historical usage to be concatenated to form routes that meet all DWR constraints. The relevance of a route's historical usage to its acceptance by dispatchers and air traffic control is quantified by analyzing historical DWR data. Results indicate that while historical usage may be less of a concern to flight dispatchers accepting or rejecting DWR advised route corrections, it may be important to air traffic control acceptance of DWR routes...|$|R

The project shows how economic signals could be given to airspace users and air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to improve capacity-demand balancing, airspace design and usage, and what the benefits would be of a centralised planner compared with those of decentralised maximisation of self interests (by the ANSPs and/or airspace users) ...|$|R

40|$|Delay banking {{has been}} invented to enhance air-traffic {{management}} {{in a way}} that would increase the degree of fairness in assigning arrival, departure, and en-route delays and trajectory deviations to aircraft impacted by congestion in the national airspace system. In delay banking, an aircraft operator (airline, military, general aviation, etc.) would be assigned a numerical credit when any of their flights are delayed because of an air-traffic flow restriction. The operator could subsequently bid against other operators competing for access to congested airspace to utilize part or all of its accumulated credit. Operators utilize credits to obtain higher priority for the same flight, or other flights operating at the same time, or later, in the same airspace, or elsewhere. Operators could also trade delay credits, according to market rules that would be determined by stakeholders in the national airspace system. Delay banking would be administered by an independent third party who would use delay banking automation to continually monitor flights, allocate delay credits, maintain accounts of delay credits for participating airlines, mediate bidding and the consumption of credits of winning bidders, analyze potential transfers of credits within and between operators, implement accepted transfers, and ensure fair treatment of all participating operators. A flow restriction can manifest itself in the form of a delay in assigned takeoff time, a reduction in assigned airspeed, a change in the position for the aircraft in a queue of all aircraft in a common stream of traffic (e. g., similar route), a change in the planned altitude profile for an aircraft, or change in the planned route for the aircraft. Flow restrictions are typically imposed to mitigate traffic congestion at an airport or in a region of <b>airspace,</b> particularly <b>congestion</b> due to inclement weather, or the unavailability of a runway or region of airspace. A delay credit would be allocated to an operator of a flight that has accepted, or upon which was imposed, a flow restriction. The amount of the credit would increase with the amount of delay caused by the flow restriction, the exact amount depending on which of several candidate formulas is eventually chosen. For example, according to one formula, there would be no credit for a delay smaller than some threshold value (e. g., 30 seconds) and the amount of the credit for a longer delay would be set at the amount of the delay minus the threshold value. Optionally, the value of a delay credit could be made to decay with time according to a suitable formula (e. g., an exponential decay). Also, optionally, a transaction charge could be assessed against the value of a delay credit that an operator used on a flight different from the one for which the delay originated or that was traded with a different operator. The delay credits accumulated by a given airline could be utilized in various ways. For example, an operator could enter a bid for priority handling in a new flow restriction that impacts one or more of the operator s flights; if the bid were unsuccessful, all or a portion of the credit would be returned to the bidder. If the bid pertained to a single aircraft that was in a queue, delay credits could be consumed in moving the aircraft to an earlier position within the queue. In the case of a flow restriction involving a choice of alternate routes, planned altitude profile, aircraft spacing, or other non-queue flow restrictions, delay credits could be used to bid for an alternative assignment...|$|R

40|$|Passenger airline delays have {{received}} increasing attention {{over the past}} several years as <b>airspace</b> <b>congestion,</b> severe weather, mechanical problems, and other sources cause substantial disruptions to a planned flight schedule. Adding to this challenge is the fact that each flight delay can propagate to disrupt subsequent downstream flights that await the delayed flights ’ aircraft and crew. This potential for delays to propagate is exacerbated by a fundamental conflict: slack in the planned schedule is often viewed as undesirable, as it implies missed opportunities to utilize costly perishable resources, whereas slack is critical in operations as a means for absorbing disruption. In this paper, we show how delay propagation can be reduced by redistributing existing slack in the planning process, making minor modifications to the flight schedule while leaving the original fleeting and crew scheduling decisions unchanged. We present computational results based on data from a major U. S. carrier, showing that significant improvements in operational performance can be achieved without increasing planned costs. ...|$|E
