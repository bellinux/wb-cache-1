25|$|Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion (2002) makes {{a similar}} {{argument}} and adds {{examination of the}} socially coordinating aspects of shared belief. In Minds and Gods: The Cognitive Foundations of Religion, Todd Tremlin follows Boyer in arguing that universal human cognitive process naturally produces {{the concept of the}} supernatural. Tremlin contends that an agency detection device (ADD) and a theory of mind module (ToMM) lead humans to suspect an agent behind every event. Natural events {{for which there is no}} obvious agent may be attributed to God (c.f. <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>God).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between God's absolute Unity and Divine manifestations, may {{be compared to}} a man in a room - there is the man himself, and his presence and relationship to others in the room. In Hebrew, this is known as the Shekhinah. It is also the concept of God's Name - it is His relationship and presence in the world towards us. The Wisdom (literally written as Field of Apples) in kabbalistic terms refers to the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence. The Unknowable One (literally written as the Miniature Presence) refers to events on earth when events can be understood as natural happenings instead of God's act, although it is actually the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> This is known as perceiving the Shekhinah through a blurry, cloudy lens. This means to say, although we see God's Presence (not God Himself) through natural occurrences, it is only through a blurry lens; as opposed to miracles, in which we clearly see and recognize God's presence in the world. The Holy Ancient One refers to God Himself, Who is imperceivable. (see Minchas Yaakov and anonymous commentary in the Siddur Beis Yaakov on the Sabbath hymn of Askinu Seudasa, composed by the Arizal based on this lofty concept of the Zohar).|$|E

500|$|Similarly, {{the churches}} in the holiness {{movement}} emphasize entire sanctification as a definite experience linked to Spirit baptism. According to the Articles of Faith of the Church of the Nazarene, sanctification {{is a work of}} God after regeneration [...] "which transforms believers into the likeness of Christ" [...] and is made possible by [...] "initial sanctification" [...] (which occurs simultaneously with regeneration and justification), entire sanctification, and [...] "the continued perfecting work of the Holy Spirit culminating in glorification". Entire sanctification (as opposed to initial sanctification) is an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> in which a believer is made free from original sin and able to devote him or herself entirely to God: ...|$|E

[...] The 16th Brigade arrived at Templeton's Crossing on 19 October, just three days behind the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions, whom they relieved. The following day the 16th Brigade continued the advance but found that the Japanese had withdrawn to Eora Creek, where they had established a strong defensive position.|$|E
500|$|No Doubt {{released}} their self-titled {{debut album}} in 1992, {{a year after}} being signed to Interscope. The group's blend of upbeat brass-dominated songs and funk-style bass riffs {{came at a time}} when most of the United States was in the thrall of grunge music, a genre whose angst-ridden lyrics and dirty sound could not have contrasted more with the atmosphere of most of the songs on No Doubt's pop-oriented album. Not surprisingly, the band lost out to the now-ubiquitous grunge music and the album was a commercial failure, with only 30,000 copies sold. In the words of the program director of KROQ, a Los Angeles radio station on which it was one of the band's driving ambitions to be played: [...] "It would take an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> for this band to get on the radio." ...|$|E
500|$|After Hayes' falling-out {{with the}} Republican Party and a {{perceived}} desire {{on the part}} of the United States' electorate for a strong man in the White House, Grant returned to the United States ahead of schedule, in hopes of seeking a third term in office. With the backing of the Stalwarts and calls for a [...] "man of iron" [...] to replace the [...] "man of straw" [...] in the White House, Grant was confident that he would receive the Republican nomination for the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, the leader of the Stalwart faction, formed a [...] "triumvirate" [...] with J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of Illinois to lead the campaign for Grant's return to the White House. With a Grant victory, Conkling and other Stalwarts would have great influence in the White House. Grant knew he could count on the Stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a Grant victory. Conkling was so confident in Grant's nomination that he said, [...] "Nothing but an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> could prevent Grant's nomination." [...] An aide to the ex-president, Adam Badeau, commented that Grant had become [...] "extremely anxious to receive the nomination" [...] and did not think that there was any chance of failure.|$|E

500|$|No Doubt {{released}} their self-titled {{debut album}} in 1992, {{a year after}} being signed to Interscope. The album's pop-oriented sound sharply contrasted with grunge music, a genre which was very popular {{at the time in}} the United States. The album sold 30,000 copies; {{in the words of the}} program director of KROQ, a Los Angeles radio station on which it was one of the band's driving ambitions to be played, [...] "it would take an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> for this band to get on the radio." [...] The band began work on their second album in 1993, but Interscope rejected most of the material, which was written by Gary Angle, and paired the band with producer Matthew Wilder. Keyboardist Eric Stefani did not want to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording and rehearsing. He encouraged other members of the band to write songs, but sometimes felt threatened when they did. Eric became increasingly depressed, and in September 1994, he stopped attending rehearsals, though they were usually held at his house. He soon left the band to pursue an animation career on the animated sitcom The Simpsons. Bassist Tony Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen Stefani.|$|E
500|$|At 9:08 pm, Chicago {{police in}} full riot gear arrived to the applause of the {{baseball}} fans remaining in the stands. Those on the field hastily dispersed upon seeing the police. [...] Thirty-nine people were arrested for disorderly conduct; estimates of injuries to those at the event range from none to over thirty. Bill Veeck wanted the teams to play the second game once order was restored. [...] However, the field was so badly torn up that umpiring crew chief Dave Phillips {{felt that it was}} still not playable even after White Sox groundskeepers spent an hour clearing away debris. [...] Tigers manager Sparky Anderson refused to allow his players to take the field in any event due to safety concerns. Phillips called American League president Lee MacPhail, who postponed the second game to Sunday after hearing a report on conditions. [...] Anderson, however, demanded that the game be forfeited to the Tigers. [...] He argued that under baseball's rules, a game can only be postponed due to an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> and that, as the home team, the White Sox were responsible for field conditions. The next day, MacPhail forfeited the second game to the Tigers 9‚Äì0. In a ruling that largely upheld Anderson's arguments, MacPhail stated that the White Sox had failed to provide acceptable playing conditions.|$|E
