5|$|During the Internet bubble {{that led}} up to 2000, heavy {{investments}} in undersea fibre-optic cables linked Asia {{with the rest of the}} world. The fall that followed the economic boom resulted in the auction of cheap fiber optic cables at one-tenth of their original price. This development resulted in widely available low-cost communications infrastructure. All of these investments and events, not to mention a swell of available talent, resulted in India becoming <b>almost</b> <b>overnight</b> the centre for outsourcing of Business process. Within this sector and events, the ITES-BPO sector has become a big employment generator especially amongst young college graduates.

40|$|As in most {{countries}} rail transport {{was the most important}} means of conveyance in South Africa. It was a logical step because the country (and the world) was heavily burdened by economic depressions, wars and natural disasters. The motorcar industry was in its infancy and motorcar ownership only allotted for the rich. From 1960 until 1980 private motor vehicle ownership flourished, and rail transport as most important public means of transportation moved to the background. Economic prosperity lead to every middleclass family owning an average of two cars per family, and as result of the socio-political changes in South Africa private car ownership <b>almost</b> doubled <b>overnight.</b> Urban roads can not handle this increase in traffic. Alternative means of transport must, as {{in the rest of the}} world, be investigated and implemented. Rail transport is presently the most cost effective alternative and it will likely experience a Renaissance as in the rest of the world. This thesis focuses on facilitating the movement of people. Its aim is not to solve the transport problems, but rather to address the possibilities that would lead to an improved environment within the context of public transport. The idea is that the proposed design for the new Gautrain station and accompanying intermodal exchange would serve as catalyst for urban renewal within Hatfield.

50|$|The {{company began}} {{life as the}} Alexander Film Company that {{specialized}} in film advertising, and the younger J. Don Alexander decided that his salesmen could sell more film advertising if they had airplanes. He wrote to plane manufacturers around the country asking for a price {{on a lot of}} 50 planes. But the builders, who were happy to get an order for one craft in those days, thought his letter was the work of a crackpot. It went into the wastebasket. This angered Alexander. He decided to build his own planes. He moved his operation to Englewood, Colorado and set up the aircraft company. He sent Justin McInaney to Marshall, Missouri (then a center of aviation manufacturing) to buy a plane and learn to fly. Justin's instructor was the great Ben O. Howard, who later became famous as a plane racer and test pilot. Justin soloed after only ten hours of instruction. He bought a Swallow airplane for $2,300 and proceeded to fly back to Denver. That trip involved so many forced landings and other aerial adventures that he ended it <b>almost</b> an <b>overnight</b> veteran. Justin began teaching other men to fly, among them Vern Simmons; O.R. Ted Haueter (past vice president of Continental Airlines); Ray Shrader (past vice president of Braniff Airlines); Red Mosier (past vice president of American Airlines); Jack Frye (past president of TWA); plane designer Al Mooney. As the national sales manager, Justin helped build the firm to the top producer in the United States (eight planes a day, just before the depression). Originally headquartered in Englewood, the film-turned-aircraft company was forced to move to Colorado Springs in order to expand.|$|R

As additional 747-200s arrived they were placed on routes to London, Paris and Rome, Australia and the long cherished USA with service to Los Angeles. The DC-10s lasted only a couple of years in the SIA fleet. In 1977, Singapore Airlines took delivery of its first Boeing 727-200 Advanced, flying it on its inaugural service from Singapore to Manila. The B727 was Singapore Airlines' successor to the B737-100s that it had inherited from MSA.|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} against Walker intensified in 1965 when Colin Jordan {{took to the}} stage of a public meeting addressed by Denis Healey, who punched Jordan. Membership of the group fell to <b>almost</b> nothing <b>overnight,</b> after the arrest of several members accused of burning synagogues and convictions for such incidents in Clapton, Ilford, Bayswater and Kilburn. Even Dior was imprisoned for such an attack in 1968 and in all during the 1960s, NSM supporters organised 34 arsons attacks against Jewish owned buildings. By this time Dior's marriage to Jordan had ended {{and as a result}} her funding of the NSM had ended. The movement was affected by new race relations legislation. Jordan was arrested under the new laws and gaoled for eighteen months in January 1967 for distributing a leaflet entitled The Coloured Invasion which was described as [...] "a vituperative attack on black and Asian immigrants" [...] in Jordan's 2009 obituary in The Times. Regardless of Jordan's status as imprisoned or otherwise there had been no intention of including the NSM in negotiations going on at the time between the BNP, LEL, GBM and Racial Preservation Society as one of LEL leader A. K. Chesterton's stipulations for the formation of any new party was that neo-Nazis should have to be excluded, a condition that ensured that the GBM as a group were excluded and even initially kept Bean out of the leading positions in the new National Front. Following Jordan's release from prison in 1968 he held a secret meeting with Tyndall and Webster at Denis Pirie's house and informed those present that the NSM was no longer in existence.|$|R

Measurements of the protein content of whole nuclei or mitochondria and of the enzyme extracts from these organelles indicated that the decrease in enzyme activity on starvation was not caused by incomplete extraction of the enzyme from the starved animals.

The first stirrings of protest against the war occurred in late 1964. In December, the Wesleyan Council of Student Affairs voted to send a letter to President Lyndon B.

A state district court enjoined Chávez personally and the UFW as an organization from engaging in picketing, but both Chávez and the union refused to obey the court's orders. In late September 1970, the UFW asked consumers to join in a nationwide boycott of all lettuce which had not been picked by members of the United Farm Workers. Violence, sporadic at first but increasingly widespread, began to occur in the fields. On November 4, 1970 a UFW regional office was bombed.|$|E
25|$|However, the 1988–89 season {{would be}} a big turning point for the franchise. In 1987, coin {{collector}} Bruce McNall purchased the Kings from Buss and turned the team into a Stanley Cup contender <b>almost</b> <b>overnight.</b> On August 9, 1988, McNall acquired the league's best player, Wayne Gretzky, in a blockbuster trade with the Edmonton Oilers. The trade rocked the hockey world, especially north of the border where Canadians mourned the loss of a player they considered a national treasure. McNall changed the team colors to silver and black. Gretzky's arrival generated much excitement about hockey and the NHL in Southern California, and the ensuing popularity of the Kings is credited with the arrival of another team in the region, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (later renamed to Anaheim Ducks in 2006), and the NHL's expanding or moving into other Sun Belt cities such as Dallas, Phoenix, Tampa, Miami and Nashville.|$|E
40|$|Lactose {{synthesis}} and {{fatty acid}} synthesis in intact lactating-rat mammary gland were measured simultaneously by incorporation of [U- 14 C]glucose and of both [U- 14 C]glucose and 3 H 2 O respectively. Both processes were <b>almost</b> abolished by <b>overnight</b> starvation. Self-re-feeding caused recovery of lipogenesis to 100 % of normal by 2 h and to 170 % by 5 h. Lactose synthesis recovered to 80 % of normal by 5 h. Food intubated to starved rats caused partial recovery in 3 h, standard diet favouring lactose synthesis and sugars favouring lipogenesis. Casein and starch were ineffective. Olive oil intubated to fed rats suppressed lipogenesis greatly and lactose synthesis slightly. Paraffin oil or water partly mimicked these effects. Adrenaline (subcutaneous) decreased lipogenesis from glucose, whereas insulin (subcutaneous) caused hypoglycaemia associated with loss of lactose synthesis but unchanged fatty acid synthesis. Streptozotocin and 2 -bromo-alpha-ergocryptine (CB- 154) impaired lipogenesis but not lactose synthesis.
