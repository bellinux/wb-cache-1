5|$|Joust is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. While {{not the first}} game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.|$|E
5|$|Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E
5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E

5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes <b>a</b> <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she {{had to go back to}} New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{mourning}} {{version of}} the square cap to mourn friends and family relatives. Instead of <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> tassel, two wide ribbons are drawn from corner to corner of the top board forming and 'X'. Where the ribbons intersect a rosette of ribbon is attached. There could also be 9 ribbon 'butterflies' at the back part of the skull to indicate mourning for the Sovereign, {{another member of the}} Royal Family, or the University Chancellor.|$|E

Using the same diagram for the conduit-metaphor paradigm instead, the hub is a duplicator that can transfer actual materials and constructions among sectors, ending the isolation. No guesswork or construction is needed: Alex puts the rake {{in a special}} chamber, pushes <b>a</b> <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> precise replicas appear instantly in similar chambers for Bob, Curt and Don.|$|E

25|$|The {{front of}} the iPod Shuffle had buttons for Play/Pause, Next Song/Fast Forward, Previous Song/Fast Reverse, {{and up and down}} volume adjustment. On the reverse, it had a battery level {{indicator}} light (activated by <b>a</b> <b>button)</b> <b>and</b> a three-position switch to turn the unit off or set it to play music in order or shuffled. It plugged directly into a computer's USB port (either 1.1 or 2.0), through which it also recharged its battery, which has an expected life of around 12 hours. The USB plug is hidden beneath a cap. The unit also comes with a lanyard that attaches to the iPod Shuffle via an attached cap and this allows the user to wear the iPod Shuffle around his or her neck.|$|E
25|$|In , a {{different}} {{version of the}} Batmobile retains its classic-shape and designs; but is heavily influenced by The Dark Knight Trilogy Tumbler. The car is heavier than a tank, its ability to absorb impact makes it nearly indestructible, and affected anything it collided with in similar fashion. It can be called to Batman instantly with the press of <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> can eject Batman hundreds of {{feet in the air}} to instantly begin gliding. Batman can also control the Batmobile remotely using his Batmobile Remote gadget and it can even support Batman while he is fighting free flow combat via a Batmobile assisted Special Takedown. Like the Batsuit and gadgets, the Batmobile can be upgraded and even has its own alternate skins (such as one based on the Batmobile from 1960 TV series). The game also features Batmobiles from the 1960 TV Series and the films appear as DLC and are used in special Racing AR Challenges.|$|E
25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, I told him I was not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} {{discover that}} the true force behind the war has been the supercomputer Hactar. Previously built to serve a war-faring species, Hactar was tasked to build a supernova-bomb that would link the cores of every sun in the Universe together at the press of <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> cause {{the end of the}} Universe. Hactar purposely created a dud version of the weapon instead, causing his creators to pulverise him into dust, which thus became the dust cloud around Krikkit. However, Hactar was still able to function, though at a much weaker level. Trillian and Arthur speak to Hactar in a virtual space that he creates for them to explain himself. Hactar reveals that he spent eons creating the spaceship that crashed on Krikkit to inspire their xenophobia and incite them to go to war, also influencing their thoughts. However, when the Slo-Time envelope was activated, his control on the population waned. As he struggles to remain functional, Hactar apologises to Trillian and Arthur for his actions before they leave for their ship.|$|E
500|$|The player {{controls}} the on-screen character, {{a member of}} the killer7 group, from a third-person view using the gamepad. The gameplay consists of elements of first-person shooter and action-adventure game with restricted movement (i.e. [...] "on rails")—rather than allow free motion, the game limits the on-screen character to predetermined paths through the environment. The on-screen character moves forward by holding <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> reverses direction with another button press. At intersections, the player may choose which path to take. Progress is made by navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Some puzzles require the talents of a specific killer7 member. The player may switch between available members via a menu in the pause screen at any time. Other puzzles require magical rings or other items collected throughout the game.|$|E
500|$|After {{stopping}} {{the beating of}} Czolgosz, McKinley's next concern was for his wife, urging Cortelyou to take care how she was told of the shooting. [...] The initial crowd reaction had been panic, and an attempt to flee the hall, which was frustrated by others surging inwards {{to see what had}} occurred. [...] As McKinley was carried out on a stretcher to an electric-powered ambulance, there was a moan from the crowd {{at the sight of the}} President's ashen face. [...] Foster rode with him on the way to the fair's hospital. [...] On the way there, McKinley felt in his clothing and came out with a metal object. [...] "I believe that is a bullet." [...] McKinley had been shot twice; one bullet had deflected off <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> only grazed him; the other had penetrated his abdomen.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of John F. Kennedy's death and {{favorable}} economic circumstances, Lyndon Johnson was the favorite candidate {{early on in the}} general election campaign. In light of Nelson Rockefeller's rebuke of Goldwater's political ideology at the Republican Convention, which was televised nationally, the media speculated {{as to whether or not}} Rockefeller would endorse Goldwater in the general election, barring the Goldwater campaign with more negative publicity. In addition to this, Johnson was known for his ability to manipulate the press in order to provide favorable coverage of his own campaign. [...] Johnson, along with the media, who also had a generally unfavorable opinion of Goldwater, portrayed his opponent as a political extremist. Johnson also used Goldwater's speeches to imply that he would willingly wage a nuclear war, quoting Goldwater: [...] "by one impulse act you could press <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> wipe out 300 million people before sun down." [...] In turn, Goldwater defended himself by accusing Johnson of making the accusation indirectly, and contending that the media blew the issue out of proportion.|$|E

Oswald walked over to Tippit's car and apparently exchanged words with him through an open vent window. Tippit opened his car door and as he walked {{toward the front of}} the car, Oswald drew his handgun and fired four shots in rapid succession. One bullet hit Tippit in the chest, one in the stomach, another in his right temple (one bullet hit <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> did not penetrate his skin). Tippit's body was transported from the scene of the shooting by ambulance to Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:25 p.m. by Dr. Richard A. Liguori.|$|E
2500|$|On April Fools' Day 2015, {{a social}} {{experiment}} {{was launched in}} the form of a subreddit called /r/thebutton. It featured <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> a 60-second countdown timer. User accounts created before that day were eligible to participate. A user could only ever click the button once, or opt not to click it. If a user clicked the button the timer was globally reset to 60 seconds, and the user's [...] "flair" [...] (an icon next to the user's name) changed color. Colors were assigned based on a gradient from purple to red with purple signifying up to 60 seconds and red as low as 0 seconds. The countdown prematurely reached zero several times due to technical problems but eventually expired without further problems on June 5, 2015, after which the subreddit was archived.|$|E
2500|$|... was {{released}} in 2002 and its expansion pack, , {{was released}} in 2003. The release of these two games brought with them {{a number of new}} features to the online service. The most significant feature to be added was probably the concept of Anonymous Matchmaking. This feature allowed a user who wanted to play a game to simply press <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> automatically be matched up with one or more other players who were similar in skill (based on ranking) and also wanted to play a game. This allowed for people to get into games quickly and easily. It also reduced win-trading, where two people would purposely win and lose games to artificially raise their rank on the ladder. The matchmaking concept was also expanded to team games in a feature called [...] "Arranged Teams". In an arranged team game, you could make a team with one or more friends, which was then anonymously matched up with another team of the same size and rank. However, a strategy was introduced on how to cheat the automated 'fair' matchups, called 'Abusing', simply by someone losing the Arranged Team Games intentionally with one ally so that with another ally (who wants to gain wins easily) won't find it difficult because the automatic matchups would put the two players up against relatively unskilled players. Automated tournaments were added in the expansion, where players would compete to be crowned tournament champion in a series of games played throughout the day. In addition to the new game styles, a slew of other features were added including selectable chatroom icons unlocked based on the player's number of wins, a friends list, and clan support.|$|E
