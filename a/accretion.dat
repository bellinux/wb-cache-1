5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway <b>accretion</b> begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is {{proportional}} to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway <b>accretion</b> lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the <b>accretion</b> is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
5|$|However, that meaning {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the process of <b>accretion</b> forming the planets. In this context, <b>accretion</b> refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains of dust and ice orbiting the protostar in the protoplanetary disk, colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{have failed}} to note signs of <b>accretion</b> leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought to be because the star is first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very high rate by the same process. Once the <b>accretion</b> stops the star {{gradually}} slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) at NASA Glenn Research Center to obtain castings of ice <b>accretions</b> formed on a 28 deg. swept GLC- 305 airfoil that is representative of a modern business aircraft wing. Because {{of the complexity of}} the casting process, the airfoil was designed with three removable leading edges covering the whole span. Ice <b>accretions</b> were obtained at six icing conditions. After the ice was accreted, the leading edges were detached from the airfoil and moved to a cold room. Molds of the ice <b>accretions</b> were obtained, and from them, urethane castings were fabricated.

5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is {{sometimes}} referred to as an <b>accretion</b> disk, because while the young T Tauri-like protostar is still contracting, gaseous material may still be falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk's inner edge. In an <b>accretion</b> disk, there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii.|$|E
5|$|The {{white dwarf}} {{companion}} could also accrete matter from {{other types of}} companions, including a subgiant or (if the orbit is sufficiently close) even a main sequence star. The actual evolutionary process during this <b>accretion</b> stage remains uncertain, as it can depend both on the rate of <b>accretion</b> and the transfer of angular momentum to the white dwarf companion.|$|E
5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by <b>accretion</b> or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass <b>accretion</b> that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E

5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. <b>Accretion,</b> the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, {{is thought to be}} responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, <b>accretion</b> can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow <b>accretion</b> from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual <b>accretion</b> and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E
5|$|In general, in the Solar System, {{planetary}} {{formation is}} thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets. During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an <b>accretion</b> process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals. This gravitational <b>accretion</b> {{led to the formation of}} the planets.|$|E

5|$|Oberon's <b>accretion</b> {{probably}} {{lasted for}} several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied <b>accretion</b> caused heating of the moon's outer layer. The maximum temperature of around 230K was reached at {{the depth of}} about 60km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Oberon heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust leading to cracking. The present-day system of canyons may {{be a result of}} this process, which lasted for about 200million years, implying that any endogenous activity from this cause ceased billions of years ago.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than <b>accretion.</b> This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by <b>accretion</b> around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E

5|$|TY Coronae Borealis is a {{pulsating}} {{white dwarf}} (of ZZ Ceti) type, which is around 70% as massive as the Sun, yet has only 1.1% of its diameter. Discovered in 1990, UW Coronae Borealis is a low-mass X-ray binary system {{composed of a}} star less massive than the Sun and a neutron star surrounded by an <b>accretion</b> disk that draws material from the companion star. It varies in brightness in an unusually complex manner: the two stars orbit each other every 111 minutes, yet there is another cycle of 112.6 minutes, which corresponds to the orbit of the disk around the degenerate star. The beat period of 5.5 days indicates the time the <b>accretion</b> disk—which is asymmetrical—takes to precess around the star.|$|E
5|$|The <b>accretion</b> process {{probably}} {{lasted for}} several thousand {{years before the}} moon was fully formed. Models suggest that impacts accompanying <b>accretion</b> caused heating of Ariel's outer layer, reaching a maximum temperature of around 195K {{at a depth of}} about 31km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Ariel heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust reaching estimates of 30 MPa, which may have led to cracking. Some present-day scarps and canyons may be a result of this process, which lasted for about 200million years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>accretion</b> process, {{by which}} 1km planetesimals grow into 1,000km sized bodies, is well {{understood}} now. This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high, and proceeds in a runaway manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic <b>accretion.</b> The {{end result is}} formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes, which depend on {{the distance from the}} star. Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of terrestrial planets is now considered to be an almost solved problem.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} gas a super-Earth that formed in situ acquires {{may depend on}} when the {{planetary}} embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to the dissipation of the gas disk. If the mergers happen after the gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form, if in a transition disk a super-Earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form. If the mergers happen too early runaway gas <b>accretion</b> may occur leading {{to the formation of}} a gas giant. The mergers begin when the dynamical friction due to the gas disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions, a process that will begin earlier in a higher metalicity disk. Alternatively gas <b>accretion</b> may be limited due to the envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead gas may flow through the envelope slowing its growth and delaying the onset of runaway gas <b>accretion</b> until the mass of the core reaches 15 Earth masses.|$|E

40|$|Zinc (Zn) {{pollution}} negatively affects {{human and}} ecosystem health. We quantified atmospheric Zn inputs at six remote mountain-top {{locations in the}} Czech Republic (Central Europe), and used δ 66 Zn isotope ratios to identify Zn from different pollution sources. The study sites were located at an elevation of approximately 1000 m near the state borders with Germany and Poland. During two winter seasons (2009 - 2010), over 400 samples of vertical deposition (snow) and horizontal deposition (ice <b>accretions)</b> were collected. Zinc pollution levels were generally low. Zinc concentrations in snow and ice <b>accretions</b> were less than twice higher in the east, compared to the west. Across the sites, over 90 % of Zn was present in a weak-acid soluble form. Zinc concentrations were 5 times higher in ice <b>accretions,</b> which formed from small droplets originating in the basal cloud layer, rich in pollutants, than in snow. In contrast, droplets resulting in snow formation were larger and scavenged less pollution due to their smaller surface area. δ 66 Zn of Pribram sphalerite (west) and smelter-derived fly ash (west) were low, - 0. 23 and - 0. 47 ‰, respectively. Olkusz sphalerite (east) had a higher δ 66 Zn of 0. 02 ‰. δ 66 Zn of snow ranged from - 0. 60 to 0. 68 ‰. Ice <b>accretions</b> had δ 66 Zn between - 0. 67 and 0. 14 ‰. At the three eastern sites, δ 66 Zn of ice <b>accretions</b> were lower than δ 66 Zn of snow, suggesting the presence of volatilized smelter derived or coal-burning derived Zn. δ 66 Zn of ice <b>accretions</b> at {{two of the three}} western sites were higher than δ 66 Zn of snow. Different δ 66 Zn values of snow and ice <b>accretions</b> from the same site reflected different pollution sources, which may have been situated at different distances from the receptor site. δ 66 Zn of the soluble Zn fraction was higher than δ 66 Zn of the insoluble Zn fraction, possibly also indicating a different origin of these two Zn fractions.
