5|$|Oldham's Old Town Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo-classical {{town hall}} built in 1841, {{eight years before}} Oldham {{received}} its borough status. One of the last purpose-built town halls in northwest England, it has a tetrastyle Ionic portico, copied from the temple of Ceres, on the River Ilissos, near Athens. Winston Churchill made his inaugural acceptance speech from {{the steps of the}} town hall when he was first elected as a Conservative MP in 1900. A Blue Plaque on the exterior of the building commemorates the event. Long existing as the political centre of the town, complete with courtrooms, the structure has stood empty since the mid-1980s and has regularly been earmarked for redevelopment as part of regeneration project proposals, but none have been <b>actioned.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{passing of}} the Land Drainage Act 1930 held promise for the future. The many bodies {{responsible}} for small parts of Somerset's flood defences were swept away, and replaced by the Somerset Catchment Board. More importantly, perhaps, {{they did not have}} to prove that benefits would occur to a particular community in order to issue rates for drainage work, but could raise rates based on the rateable values of properties. This should have worked, but they soon became apprehensive, and reverted to producing reports, which were not <b>actioned.</b> However, inactivity gave way to action in 1939, when a new engineer was appointed, who saw it as his job to direct what needed to be done. Work began on improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain in 1939. The items to be addressed were the size of the channel, the size of the bridges, and the size of Dunball clyse, all of which were too small. The onset of the Second World War, just a few months later, threatened to stop the scheme, but did not.|$|E

500|$|John Watkins, {{chairman}} of the investigation panel, told the inquiry the evidence supporting the theory that inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot caused the accident was that its control box was recovered from the wreckage and its gyroscope was still caged. The speed valve unit was also recovered and it indicated the automatic pilot was operating {{at the time of}} impact. [...] Inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot with the gyroscope caged could explain a sudden descent by a DC-3.

500|$|Having {{joined the}} Luftwaffe in 1935 and {{completed}} his pilot training, {{at the start}} of the war Specht was a Leutnant in 3./ZG 26 [...] "Horst Wessel" [...] (the 3rd squadron of the 26th Heavy Fighter Wing). In 1939 he was wounded by an RAF tail gunner and blinded in one eye. He returned to active duty and was shot down six times during the war. After his recovery in 1939, he chose to return to active service but was shot down again in France and was seriously injured. These injuries kept him grounded for the next two years. In 1942 he returned to active duty with 1st Fighter Wing (Jagdgeschwader 1 Oesau; JG 1). He was then made Group Commander (Gruppenkommandeur) of II Group of JG 11 (II./JG 11) and promoted to Major. He was appointed as Wing Commander (Geschwaderkommodore) of JG 11 and was listed as missing in action during the attack on the Allied bases at Asch and Ophoven as part of Operation Bodenplatte.

40|$|Many every-day life {{situations}} require {{two or more}} {{individuals to}} execute <b>actions</b> together. Assessing brain activation during naturalistic tasks to uncover relevant processes underlying such real-life joint <b>action</b> situations has remained a methodological challenge. In the present study, we introduce a novel joint <b>action</b> paradigm that enables the assessment of brain activation during real-life joint <b>action</b> tasks using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We monitored brain activation of participants who coordinated complex <b>actions</b> with a partner sitting opposite them. Participants performed table setting tasks, either alone (solo <b>action)</b> or in cooperation with a partner (joint <b>action),</b> or they observed the partner performing the task (<b>action</b> observation). Comparing joint <b>action</b> and solo <b>action</b> revealed stronger activation (higher [oxy-Hb]-concentration) during joint <b>action</b> {{in a number of}} areas. Among these were areas in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) that additionally showed an overlap of activation during <b>action</b> observation and solo <b>action.</b> Areas with such a close link between <b>action</b> observation and <b>action</b> execution have been associated with <b>action</b> simulation processes. The magnitude of activation in these IPL areas also varied according to joint <b>action</b> type and its respective demand on <b>action</b> simulation. The results validate fNIRS as an imaging technique for exploring the functional correlates of interindividual <b>action</b> coordination in real-life settings and suggest that coordinating <b>actions</b> in real-life situations requires simulating the <b>actions</b> of the partner...|$|R

2500|$|Phishing on AOL {{was closely}} {{associated}} with the warez community that exchanged unlicensed software and the black hat hacking scene that perpetrated credit card fraud and other online crimes. AOL enforcement would detect words used in AOL chat rooms to suspend the accounts individuals involved in counterfeiting software and trading stolen accounts. The term was used because '<><' is the single most common tag of HTML that was found in all chat transcripts naturally, and as such could not be detected or filtered by AOL staff. The symbol <>< was replaced for any wording that referred to stolen credit cards, accounts, or illegal activity. Since the symbol looked like a fish, and due to the popularity of phreaking it was adapted as 'Phishing'. AOHell, released in early 1995, was a program designed to hack AOL users by allowing the attacker to pose as an AOL staff member, and send an instant message to a potential victim, asking him to reveal his password. In order to lure the victim into giving up sensitive information, the message might include imperatives such as [...] "verify your account" [...] or [...] "confirm billing information". Once the victim had revealed the password, the attacker could access and use the victim's account for fraudulent purposes. Both phishing and warezing on AOL generally required custom-written programs, such as AOHell. Phishing became so prevalent on AOL that they added a line on all instant messages stating: [...] "no one working at AOL will ask for your password or billing information". A user using both an AIM account and an AOL account from an ISP simultaneously could phish AOL members with relative impunity as internet AIM accounts could be used by non-AOL internet members and could not be <b>actioned</b> (i.e., reported to AOL TOS department for disciplinary action).. In late 1995, AOL crackers resorted to phishing for legitimate accounts after AOL brought in measures in late 1995 to prevent using fake, algorithmically generated credit card numbers to open accounts. Eventually, AOL's policy enforcement forced copyright infringement off AOL servers, and AOL promptly deactivate accounts involved in phishing, often before the victims could respond. The shutting down of the warez scene on AOL caused most phishers to leave the service.|$|E

40|$|Human <b>action</b> {{categories}} exhibit significant intra-class variation.

40|$|<b>Action</b> priming {{following}} <b>action</b> {{observation is}} thought to be caused by the observed <b>action</b> kinematics being represented in the same brain areas as those used for <b>action</b> execution. But, <b>action</b> priming can also be explained by shared goal representations, with compatibility between observation of the agent’s gaze and the intended <b>action</b> of the observer. To assess the contribution of <b>action</b> kinematics and eye gaze cues in the prediction of an agent’s <b>action</b> goal and <b>action</b> priming, participants observed <b>actions</b> where the availability of both cues was manipulated. <b>Action</b> observation was followed by <b>action</b> execution, and the congruency between the target of the agent’s and observer’s <b>actions,</b> and the congruency between the observed and executed <b>action</b> spatial location were manipulated. Eye movements were recorded during the observation phase, and the <b>action</b> priming was assessed using motion analysis. The results showed that the observation of gaze information influenced the observer’s prediction speed to attend to the target, and that observation of <b>action</b> kinematic information influenced the accuracy of these predictions. Motion analysis results showed that observed <b>action</b> cues alone primed both spatial incongruent and object congruent <b>actions,</b> consistent with the idea that the prime effect was driven by similarity between goals and kinematics. The observation of <b>action</b> and eye gaze cues together induced a prime effect complementarily sensitive to object and spatial congruency. While observation of the agent’s <b>action</b> kinematics triggered an object-centered and kinematic-centered <b>action</b> representation, independently, the complementary observation of eye gaze triggered a more fine-grained representation illustrating a specification of <b>action</b> kinematics towards the selected goal.
