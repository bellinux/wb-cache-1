500|$|For the 1981 season, a BT49C {{specification}} {{was produced}} with a chassis lightened through {{increased use of}} carbon composite materials. Five of this variant were built {{and two of the}} previous year's cars converted to this specification. That year a minimum ride height of [...] was introduced and sliding skirts were banned, with the intention of limiting ground effect and slowing the cars. The BT49C regained its front wings to compensate in part for the downforce lost. More significantly, Murray devised a hydropneumatic suspension system for the BT49C in which soft <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary. At speed, where the ride height could not be measured, downforce compressed the air and the car settled to a much lower height, creating more downforce. Because the skirts now had to be fixed, the suspension had to be very stiff to allow them to consistently seal around the sides of the car: {{by the end of the}} 1981 season, total suspension movement was only , half of which came from the compression of the tyres. A lightweight qualifying chassis was produced, featuring a small fuel tank and lighter reinforced carbon-carbon brake discs and pads.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{axisymmetric}} {{finite element}} (FE) model of an <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> {{was carried out}} with the software ABAQUS to design its target vertical stiffness. The bellows was simulated by the reinforced surface element. The compressed gas in the cavity of the <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> was represented by the hydrostatic fluid element. The target stiffness is obtained by modifying the valid area of the cross section. At last, the results of experiment coincided well with the simulation data.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{approximate}} analytic {{method of obtaining}} the mechanical impedance of <b>air</b> <b>spring.</b> The sound pressure distribution in cylindrical <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> {{is calculated based on}} the linear air wave theory. The influences of different boundary conditions on the acoustic pressure field distribution in cylindrical <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> are analysed. A 1 -order ordinary differential matrix equation for the state vector of revolutionary shells under internal pressure is derived based on the non-moment theory of elastic thin shell. Referring to the transfer matrix method, a kind of expanded homogeneous capacity high precision integration method is introduced to solve the non-homogeneous matrix differential equation. Combined the solved stress field of shell with the calculated sound pressure field in <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> under the displacement harmonic excitation, the approximate analytical expression of the input and transfer mechanical impedance for the <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> can be achieved.
