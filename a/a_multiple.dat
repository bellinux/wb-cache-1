Based on the directional derivatives of <b>a</b> nondefective <b>multiple</b> eigenvalue of <b>a</b> nonsymmetric matrix pencil analytically dependent on several parameters, different condition numbers of <b>a</b> nondefective <b>multiple</b> eigenvalue are introduced.

5|$|Adding <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> of any row {{to another}} row, or <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> of any column to another column, {{does not change}} the {{determinant}}. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E

5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce {{multiple}} and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, kilo- denotes <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> of a thousand and milli- denotes <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E
