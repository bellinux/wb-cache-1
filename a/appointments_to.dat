5000|$|Friedrich Ehrbar (1827-1905) {{took over}} the company in 1857 after the passing of Eduard Seuffert (1819-1855). In 1876 he had the Palais Ehrbar with its own concert hall constructed, in which renowned artists such as Johannes Brahms, Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler performed. For the {{excellence}} of his products he was awarded an imperial and royal warrant of <b>appointment</b> <b>to</b> the Emperor and King of Austria-Hungary. He was also awarded an warrant of <b>appointment</b> <b>to</b> Archduke Otto, imperial warrant of <b>appointment</b> <b>to</b> the Ottoman Sultan, a royal warrant of <b>appointment</b> <b>to</b> the King of Greece, the King of Serbia, the King of Portugal, and many others.|$|R

5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} judges {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E
50|$|Sanborn's {{first law}} clerk after his <b>appointment</b> <b>to</b> the Eighth Circuit was future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun. Later, he and Warren E. Burger were {{instrumental}} in advocating for Blackmun's <b>appointment</b> <b>to</b> replace Sanborn on the Eighth Circuit.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the initial}} <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the Order were largely political, from the 1770s <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the Order were {{increasingly}} made for naval, military or diplomatic achievements. This is {{partly due to}} the conflicts Britain was engaged in over this period. The Peninsular War resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of Extra Knights in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military note to the Order. Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period not exceeding 42 days in any year, to serve in any part of Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four trumpeters, and was also to appoint eight officers for this body, however the statute was never invoked.|$|E
5|$|Grant and Hayes {{had both}} {{advocated}} civil service reform, and by 1881, civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation. Garfield sympathized with them, {{believing that the}} spoils system damaged the presidency and distracted from more important concerns. Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> his old friends, but many remained loyal and supported Garfield.|$|E
5|$|Harrison oversaw {{changes in}} the railway's Board of Directors. Until 1915 most {{of the members of}} the board were from the {{northern}} United States but, after 1915, a majority of the board members were southerners. In 1914 there were two unusual <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the board: Edwin Alderman and John Kilgo. Alderman was the president of the University of Virginia and Kilgo was a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, a {{trusteeship}} {{was established}} by the United Nations, with Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as trustees. Under those arrangements, the UK, Australia and New Zealand were a joint administering authority. The Nauru Island Agreement provided for the first Administrator to be appointed by Australia for 5 years, leaving subsequent <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> {{be decided by the}} three governments. However, in practice, administrative power was exercised by Australia alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the schools' Board of Regents, White was also appointed by the West Virginia Legislature to the state boards of trustees of Capon Springs and Berkeley Springs. He resigned {{his position on the}} board of trustees of Berkeley Springs, but he remained a member of Capon Springs's board until at least 1897.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{powers are}} {{enumerated}} {{in the state}} constitution. There have been four constitutions of Kentucky—adopted in 1792, 1799, 1850, and 1891, respectively—and each has enlarged the governor's authority. Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons, veto legislation, and call the legislature into session. The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state. The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch, limited somewhat by {{the adoption of a}} merit system for state employees in 1960. Because Kentucky's governor controls so many <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> commissions, the office has been historically {{considered one of the most}} powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, the governor's influence has been augmented by wide discretion in awarding state contracts and significant influence over the legislature, although the latter has been waning since the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|At the 1898 election, Millen was {{defeated}} by nine votes by a National Federal candidate. Having overcome his opposition to Federation, he {{was appointed to the}} New South Wales Legislative Council on 8 April 1899 as one of Premier George Reid's twelve <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> guarantee the passage of legislation for the 1899 referendum. At the first federal election in March 1901, Millen stood for the Senate as a Free Trade candidate and was elected as the second of six senators for New South Wales. He resigned his Legislative Council seat in May of that year.|$|E
5|$|Booker's mayoralty and {{personal}} celebrity drew much media attention to Newark. While he enjoyed high ratings from city residents, his legacy has received mixed reviews. During his tenure, {{millions of dollars}} were invested in downtown development, but underemployment and high murder rates continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods. Despite legal challenges initiated during his term, Newark Public Schools has remained under {{control of the state}} for nearly twenty years. Newark received $32 million in emergency state aid in 2011 and 2012, requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligates the city to request and the state to approve <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> city hall administrative positions.|$|E

Heng Swee Keat and Chan Chun Sing, both elected to Parliament {{for the first}} time, were respectively assigned the posts of Minister for Education, and Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports.|$|E

5|$|Gould's {{career as}} justice {{minister}} {{was marked by}} consolidation of the law, tightening of licensing laws and reforms relating to police courts. A supporter of Federation, he nevertheless opposed the 1898 bill, which he believed deprived New South Wales of adequate recognition. He was defeated in the election of that year, but in 1899 {{he was one of}} Premier Reid's twelve <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the Legislative Council that enabled the passage of the legislation for a referendum on Federation.|$|E

On December 4, 2009, Bouchard's No. 3 was retired by the Canadiens as part of their 100th anniversary celebrations. On December 30, 2009, Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, announced Bouchard as among the <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the Order of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{appointed}} to the office of Sheriff of Surrey early in the reign of King Richard I. He was also Sheriff of Kent during Richard's reign, in 1190 as well as one of the Sheriffs of London from 1187 to 1189. Henry was only one of six sheriffs that retained office after the accession of Richard I. He owed his <b>appointments</b> <b>to</b> the influence of William Longchamp, Richard's chancellor. He was also Warden of the Mint in 1191. Henry lost his offices when Longchamp fell from favour in 1192. He died sometime between Michaelmas 1192 and Michaelmas 1193.|$|E
