50|$|As a {{precursor}} to <b>Astana</b> 5 peace <b>talks,</b> on 9 July 2017 at 0900 GMT, an American-Russian-Jordanian brokered ceasefire commenced, though on July 14, opposition groups participating in the Quneitra offensive rejected the ceasefire, with clashes resuming across Southern Syria. Besides minor violations from all sides involved, as of 15 July, the ceasefire as held. The Southern Front boycotted these talks.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 December 2016, a Syrian {{opposition}} delegation {{that included}} twelve rebel factions, and Syria’s government delegation headed by Bashar Jaafari convened in <b>Astana</b> for indirect <b>talks</b> titled the International Meeting on Syrian Settlement, sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran. Astana was agreed {{on as the}} venue, since it was viewed as neutral by all the parties involved. The opposition side included Mohammed Alloush, the political leader of Jaysh al-Islam, which Russia had proposed designating as a terrorist organisation. The start of <b>talks</b> in <b>Astana</b> was described as the [...] "Astana-isation" [...] of the Geneva talks, implying a shift towards the Syrian opposition conducting military operations and away from Syrians with only political influence. [...] The talks are taking place on 23 and 24 January; the first day ended without the sides reaching an agreement. The [...] "Astana Process" [...] talks aimed to support the framework {{in accordance with the}} UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and ended on the 24th with an agreement between Iran, Russia, and Turkey to form a joint monitoring body to work to enforce the Resolution 2254 ceasefire.|$|R

50|$|The third {{meeting of}} the Astana Process talks {{concluded}} in Astana on 25 March 2017. All parties that participated remained committed to the ceasefire agreement in place from {{the second round of}} <b>Astana</b> <b>talks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The UN Resolution 2254 was invoked by Iran, Russia, and Turkey as {{the legal}} {{basis for the}} {{political}} process required to solve the Syrian conflict, at {{the first round of}} the <b>Astana</b> <b>Talks</b> in January 2017." ...|$|E
5000|$|The fifth {{round of}} peace talks {{initially}} planned for 5-7 July 2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan {{were moved to}} 12-15 July 2017. The Astana Process {{has the support of}} the UN's Staffan de Mistura who said the <b>Astana</b> <b>talks</b> are making [...] "clear progress" [...] to reducing violence in Syria. The Southern Front boycotted these talks.|$|E
50|$|Since 2016, the {{opposition}} local council of {{towns in the}} eastern Qalamoun Mountains have negotiated a ceasefire agreement with Syrian government forces. As a result, the group abided by it and focused their fighting on ISIL. As part of the Southern Front, the group also abided by a ceasefire in effect since the January 2017 <b>Astana</b> <b>talks.</b> In {{an interview with the}} group's commander in February 2017, he announced that the group will support an international attempt at a ceasefire in Syria.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between HTS and Ahrar al-Sham is complex. While {{there is some}} enmity between them, the groups are not at war. According to a leading scholar in Tahrir al-Sham, the groups do not particularly hate {{one another in the}} political or social battlefield. Certain members, however, do believe that a war between the two would be possible, since Ahrar al-Sham's attendance at the <b>Astana</b> <b>talks</b> labels it as a [...] "moderate" [...] faction, often seen as blasphemy within groups such as Tahrir al-Sham.|$|E
5000|$|A {{new round}} of talks between the Syrian {{government}} and some groups of Syrian rebels concluded on 24 January 24, 2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan, with Russia, Iran and Turkey supporting the ceasefire agreement brokered in late December 2016. The Astana Process talks was billed by a Russian official as a complement to, rather than replacement, of the United Nations-led Geneva Process talks. On 4 May 2017, at the fourth round of the <b>Astana</b> <b>talks,</b> representatives of Russia, Iran, and Turkey signed a memorandum whereby four [...] "de-escalation zones" [...] in Syria would be established, effective of 6 May 2017.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2016, after 4 {{years of}} siege in Daraya and an {{agreement}} with the Syrian Armed Forces, all the remaining 700 fighters from the Martyrs of Islam Brigade evacuated from Daraya to the Idlib Governorate to the north. Since then, its commander, Capt. Saeed Enker, denounced the Southern Front and cut all links with it, with sources stating that the group is planning to join Jaysh al-Islam instead. The commander denied this and emphasized that the it will become an independent faction. Immediately after the group's arrival in Idlib, some of its [...] "best fighters" [...] were captured by al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front. They were eventually released, and the group gradually disintegrated. Capt. Enker briefly participated in the <b>Astana</b> <b>talks</b> in January 2017, but soon withdrew.|$|E
5000|$|On 4 May 2017, at {{the fourth}} round of the <b>Astana</b> <b>talks,</b> representatives of Russia, Iran, and Turkey signed a {{memorandum}} to establish four [...] "de-escalation zones" [...] in Syria. The largest one of those included the Idlib Governorate and adjoining districts of Hama, Aleppo and Latakia Governorates; the other three zones were {{set up in the}} northern rebel-controlled parts of the Homs Governorate, the rebel-controlled eastern Ghouta, and along the Jordan-Syria border. In those areas, combat operations would be halted as of 6 May 2017; it also envisaged suspension of flights of military aircraft in those areas, as well as the creation of conditions for humanitarian access, medical assistance, the return of displaced civilians to their homes and the restoration of damaged infrastructure. The memorandum was concluded for six months and could be extended automatically.|$|E

Helpdesk reports are not rigorous or systematic reviews; {{they are intended}} to provide an introduction to the most important evidence related to a research question. They draw on a rapid desk-based review of published literature and consultation with subject specialists. The Syrian conflict is now in its seventh year and involves a wide range of both national and international parties. Crucially, no party {{is in a position to}} establish control over the entire country. This has implications for efforts at stabilisation. There is increasing recognition that the Assad regime cannot be displaced and hence must factor in efforts to find a political solution. The recent focus has been on ways to reduce the fighting, paving the way for transition talks. Two major processes have been underway to find a solution to the Syrian conflict: the ‘Geneva process’ under the auspices of the UN, and the ‘Astana process’ led by Russia, Iran and Turkey. The latter differs from the former in that it involves armed groups and seeks to find a way to end the fighting before then working on a political settlement. Progress was made at the latest round of <b>Astana</b> <b>talks</b> in May, with endorsement of four ceasefire zones in the country which would allow the return of displaced civilians and provision of humanitarian aid to those areas...|$|E
