40|$|The {{security}} {{mechanism of the}} ship lift has the needs of increasing the friction and being anti-corrosive. This article tried an <b>antirust</b> <b>grease</b> used on wire rope with high friction coefficient (Alice IRIS- 400 M grease) and rayed it with ultraviolet. We find that ultraviolet rays can effectively accelerate the speed of solidification. It needs to ray at least 12 h before the friction coefficient of the surface can meet the requirements (more than 0. 1) ...|$|E
