This placed Legat in the awkward situation where Government wanted Forestry to be profitable, {{yet at the same time}} make use of the most expensive labour. The onset of World War I delayed implementation of the scheme, but in 1916 it was revived and two settlements were proposed - one at French Hoek just outside Franschhoek and the other at Jonkersberg north of Great Brak River. The workers were to be provided with a house on a small plot of land, free medical care and paid a wage, while soldiers returning from World War I, many of whom were classed as poor whites, also prompted the launching of the program.|$|E

40|$|In many {{developed}} countries forest cover is growing and forestry policy is increasingly focused on the provision of nonmarket benefits such as recreation, biodiversity, and visual amenity. The amount of benefit provided by new woodland is not only dependent on the (site level) design of the woodland, but also on its location in the wider landscape. This poses a challenge for policymakers, who, in order to allocate limited resources efficiently, have to target areas in which the efforts or costs of planting are relatively low {{and the benefits of}} planting are relatively high. The adoption by policymakers of such methods of spatial targeting has been hampered by a lack of established methods with which to map the various nonmarket benefits in a policy-relevant way. In this paper I develop a new GIS (geographic information system) -based method to map the potential visual-amenity benefits of new small-scale woodlands, on the basis of criteria of visibility, size, and location of the viewing population, and public preference for wooded landscapes. A case study in Scotland, relating to an existing publicly funded <b>afforestation</b> <b>scheme,</b> is used to demonstrate how this map can serve as an important criterion for the selective allocation of planting subsidies, thus helping to provide a better (visual-amenity) value for (taxpayers’) money. ...|$|E

The implications of not making proper choices on climate change issues and challenges were highlighted. The paper concluded that although some effort has been made to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the country (such as the restriction placed on logging in the Cross River High Forest and nationwide <b>afforestation</b> <b>schemes),</b> such efforts are largely fragmentary and much remains to be done especially in the area of strategic planning and capacity building (for instance, dredging of inland rivers and lakes, construction of sea defenses, etc.) to mitigate climate change and adapt to potential and real-time impacts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTree {{planting}} {{for carbon}} sequestration is a commonly proposed {{climate change mitigation}} strategy, with afforestation projects forming part of voluntary and mandatory carbon offset trading <b>schemes.</b> <b>Afforestation</b> is often promoted as a new economic opportunity for private landholders. While multiple studies have identified physical and economic opportunities for afforestation, few have examined the willingness of private landholders to adopt afforestation, and {{the factors that influence}} this willingness. We examine this using data from a survey of Australian landholders. The willingness of landholders to adopt afforestation for carbon sequestration varies substantially depending on how this afforestation is designed and implemented: landholders prefer small plantings on less productive land, which minimise the disturbance afforestation presents to land management, and to landholder values about appropriate uses of agricultural land. Landholders are less willing to consider afforestation if it involves planting the large areas required by many current carbon <b>afforestation</b> <b>schemes.</b> Willingness to adopt afforestation is influenced in particular by landholder's perceptions of its potential to provide a diversified income stream, and its impacts on flexibility of land management. More broadly, it is influenced by their views about the social acceptability of afforestation, particularly whether the landholder believes trees should be planted on agricultural land, and how they believe others in the community view afforestation. Our results suggest that widespread adoption requires designing afforestation so it (i) provides a range of socio-economic benefits that go beyond provision of income; (ii) minimises disruption to land management flexibility; and (iii) is compatible with landholder beliefs about appropriate use of agricultural land...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Forest {{resources}} support livelihood {{of people}} in jurisdictions in which forest is located. However, the forest size is gradually depleting continuously. The lack {{of information about the}} specific agents and forces of forest depletion is worrying. This is due to the inter-generational and intra-generational equity notions that affect mankind. As such, there is the need to maintain such resources on a non-declining value basis so as to maintain human welfare over time. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} empirically examine the determinants of forest depletion in Ghana over the 1970 - 2012 period in Ghana. This study employs multiple regression concepts to examine the effects of the determinants on forest depletion. The findings of the study indicate that gold extraction for export, population growth and logging increase the rate of forest depletion for the study period. More significantly, population growth reflected in settlement expansion, agriculture purposes, increased use of fuel wood, etc have greater effect on forest loss in Ghana. This suggests that, protection of the forest is necessary and sufficient condition for economic growth. As a result of these, both government and policy-makers need to safeguard the forest estate, by increasing <b>afforestation</b> <b>schemes</b> and also using part of the returns from gold exports to regenerate the forest...|$|R
30|$|The Native Woodland Scheme (NWS) was {{launched}} in 2001 and provides support to landowners through grants, annual premium payments, and partial subsidies for deer fencing. The NWS consists of two elements; 'NWS 1 Conservation' providing an incentive {{for the restoration of}} degraded woodlands and 'NWS 2 Establishment' supporting new plantings. This scheme has been complemented by other schemes, such as the Woodland Improvement Scheme, which aims to improve the condition of existing woodland for timber output, and the Neighbourwood Scheme, which encourages applications from communities for amenity plantings. In addition, the standard <b>Afforestation</b> <b>Scheme,</b> which is focused on commercial plantings, contains a 10 % requirement for broadleaf forest. Between 2002 and 2011, 2, 542 hectares of existing native woodland were restored and 1, 053 hectares of new native woodlands planted. However, state financial support has been inconsistent and this has discouraged foresters and landowners. Element 1 of the NWS has been suspended even though the problems of invasive species and deer browsing remain as serious as ever. Rhododendron removal is expensive (€ 2, 500 - 3, 500 ha- 1) and its profuse seeding means that regular inspection is needed to ensure control is effective. Deer control is also expensive because as the animals re-colonise woodlands where fencing is inadequate. Culling is both difficult and expensive, especially when uncoordinated amongst neighbouring landowners.|$|E
40|$|In Poland, 82 % {{of forests}} are State-owned, and only 17 % of forests {{constitute}} private property. Each year, forests are converted to other land-use types, mainly for road construction. The afforestation rate on privately-owned low-productivity land is decreasing steadily. The owners and perpetual usufructuaries {{of this kind}} of land are eligible to government subsidies to cover establishment expenditures in whole or in part, provided that the <b>afforestation</b> <b>scheme</b> complies with the local zoning plan or an outline planning permission. The above creates a dilemma for farmers—is this a profitable option of managing low-productivity land? Owners of small farms particularly often face such dilemmas. Owners of small farms, which consist of low-yield agricultural land, can be regarded as investors operating on the real estate market, but those investors have features characteristic of agricultural producers. This study relied on the net present value (NPV) criterion, which is popularly used to assess the effectiveness of investments on the real estate market. A financial feasibility assessment performed with the use of such method in view of afforestation statistics and the 5 % discount rate on the Polish forest market revealed the highest increase in net cumulative cash flows in the first five years, followed by a gradual decrease in successive years. The first negative cash flow was reported in year 20. NPV would remain negative because farmers would be charged with periodic maintenance expenditures until the stand reaches harvestable age at approximately 40 years. The longer the investment period, the lower the profits, even if discount rate is excluded. Investments of the type are difficult to terminate because forests younger than 20 years are difficult to sell at a price that covers growing outflows. Afforestation projects are also influenced by other economic and non-economic factors.

The long evolutionary process coupled with genetic drift within populations, rather than contemporary gene flow, are the major forces shaping genetic structure of P. cathayana populations. Moreover, there was no correspondence between geographical and genetic distances in the populations of P. cathayana, seldom gene exchange among the populations and different selection pressures may be the causes.

Area of study : The experimental field was established near Macedo de Cavaleiros, Northern Portugal, at 700 m elevation, mean annual temperature 12 ºC and mean annual rainfall 678 mm. Material and Methods : The experimental layout includes three replicates, where the different treatments corresponding to different tillage intensities were randomly distributed (high, moderate and slight intensity), in plots with an area of 375 m 2 each. Twenty six months after forest stand installation, samples of herbaceous vegetation (0. 49 m 2 quadrat), forest species (8 PM and 8 CS) and mineral soil (at 0 - 5, 5 - 15, 15 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm depth) were collected in 15 randomly selected points in each treatment, processed in laboratory and analyzed for carbon by elemental carbon analyzer. Main results : The results obtained showed that: (i) more than 90 % of the total carbon stored in the system {{is located in the}} soil, increasing in depth with tillage intensity; (ii) the contribution of herbaceous vegetation and related roots to the carbon storage is very low; (iii) the amount of carbon per tree is higher in CS than in PM; (iv) the global carbon storage was affected by soil tillage generally decreasing with the increase of tillage intensity.

New schemes indicate a trend towards lowland <b>afforestation</b> <b>schemes</b> which are a very new concept in Britain. One such scheme is agroforestry whereby trees and a crop are grown together on the same unit of land. Very {{little is known about}} the impact of agroforestry on soil hydrology and soil water nitrate distribution of trees planted at a regular spacing into grazed grassland. In this case a lowland grazed silvopastoral agroforestry system in Devon, UK, was monitored to determine the impact upon the soil by the trees planted at a regular spacing. An innovative detailed programme of monitoring was conducted as a baseline study using six year old ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) planted at 400 stems per hectare into perennial ryegrass pasture, from 1993 to 1994. Comparisons were made with adjacent grazed grassland and farm forestry sites. The above and below ground hydrology and fluxes of soil water nitrate were examined for temporal and spatial patterns on a seasonal and storm basis. In addition detailed measurements on soil water nitrate distribution were investigated on a storm and pulse basis. The main findings of the research were that interception by the trees was minimal and stemflow accounted for 1 % of precipitation. Overland flow was a dominant flow process. In winter approximately 70 % of net precipitation flowed overland. Soils were at or above field capacity from September 1993 until May 1994 and infiltration rates were low at about 28 - 35 mm dayˉ¹. The soil saturated rapidly from 300 mm depth during the winter indicating a lack of storage. There was no difference in quantities of overland flow between the agroforestry and the grassland treatments, but storm hydrographs were affected slightly. Flows along root surfaces or old root channels conducted the water rapidly to 300 mm depth. Considerable amounts of nitrate (35 %) were lost by overland flow in April and May 1993. There was no significant difference of nitrate in either overland flow or soil water during storms. A tracer experiment conducted in May I 994 showed the presence of trees in grazed pastures influenced the dynamics of soil water movement and transport of nitrate.

Despite {{having one of the}} most {{suitable}} climates for growing trees, previous <b>afforestation</b> <b>schemes</b> have been unsuccessful and forest cover has increased by a mere 1. 2 % since 1980. This thesis provides a detailed synopsis of forestry in Northern Ireland with a focus on identifying current forestry perceptions, factors affecting planting decisions and mechanisms to encourage the transfer of land from agriculture. The evaluation process examines perceptions and attitudes from the general public and other stakeholder groups such as those from industry and environmental nongovernment organisations as well as the exploration ofthe motivations and barriers to planting in Northern Ireland from a local landowner's perspective. All results collated as an outcome of questionnaires and interviews are detailed. The information wiII be of use to the development process of private sector forestry, providing an insight into the needs and requirements of private landowners, the general public, industry groups and other stakeholders. The results identified a strong need for further forest cover to support the local environment, social needs and rural development. The challenges facing private sector development were highlighted and included a lack of insight and knowledge into forestry perceptions, a lack ofa forestry tradition as well as a lack of a coherent and structured policy and suitable incentive tools. Overall a positive attitude to forestry was found with regional differences in attitudes detected. The study highlighted the importance of considering the perceptions of society in policy formation and the need for regional specific considerations. In terms of planting decisions the study identified a number of principle factors associated with the decision to plant. The findings suggest that local landowners appear to hold a complex relationship between a desire to improve the environment and the necessity to maintain adequate business decisions. Interestingly, finances were a key issue to many landowners; however, it was not considered the main motivation to plant. The study suggests that in order to improve forest reserves landowners need to be encouraged beyond the draw of financial aid and the barriers to planting must be removed. Further promotion and active involvement from the Forest Service and associated bodies need to be conducted in order to highlight the financial and extension services available to support private sector planting. The results of the case studies stressed the complexities of private sector planting, further highlighting the need for improved education, stable and coherent polices and a wider use of enabling incentives mechanisms such as research and training in the region. A suitable incentive program for private afforestation in Northern Ireland would foster the principles of sustainability, enabling forestry to be considered a viable option against other land use options such as agriculture. This thesis is an original contribution to this field of knowledge and it equips policy makers and associate stakeholder groups with a full understanding of the needs, challenges and potential of private forestry in Northern Ireland and provides it with a basis on which to ensure forestry provides the region with unique environmental, economic and social benefits.

30|$|Nationally, about 1.45 million {{hectares}} (Mha) of marginal pastoral land {{are suitable for}} afforestation/reforestation by indigenous shrubs or forests (Trotter et al. 2005). The enactment of the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) and <b>Afforestation</b> Grant <b>Schemes</b> (AGS) in 2008 and 2015, respectively (Ministry for Primary Industries 2015), {{and the introduction of}} forestry to the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) have strongly incentivised the planting in new areas of indigenous shrublands and/or successional tall forest species as a means of further reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring that New Zealand meets both its short- and long-term obligations under the Framework Convention for Climate Change (FCCC). Given the current interest in the retirement of economically and environmentally unsustainable pastoral steep lands, the planting of successional indigenous forest species with a longer rotation and higher wood value may become an alternative and viable land use option for these areas. Furthermore, a species change to indigenous shrubs and/or forest trees could potentially alleviate issues currently associated with harvesting non-native species (predominantly Pinus radiata D.Don) that were originally established for erosion control, particularly in terrain with a high risk of storm-induced landslides. Issues include excessive amounts of sediment and associated woody debris, damage to infrastructure and the degradation of stream habitats. However, more fundamental knowledge is required on the differences in relative growth rates between indigenous shrubland, conifer and broadleaved species and more specifically on the contribution of their root systems towards shallow soil reinforcement, especially during their formative years. Such data will assist in evaluating the potential effectiveness of various species both as plantings on marginal land degraded by erosion and as a longer-term land-use option for areas retired from exotic forest production. As is the case for old-growth indigenous forests, such data for the early-growth period of the majority of indigenous shrub and forest species have not been collected to date. Such data are essential for the development of allometric relationships for measuring the live-tree carbon sequestration for: (i) planted areas of juvenile shrubs and mixed species of indigenous conifer and broadleaved forests; (ii) areas of abandoned pasture currently in the juvenile stage of reverting to shrubland; and (iii) areas of exotic forest with ‘high environmental risk’ and likely to be converted (planted or by natural reversion) to a longer-term, and more sustainable, mix of indigenous shrubland and conifer/broadleaved forest.|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{large-scale}} industrial plantations {{are rapidly}} expanding {{as a source}} of industrial wood and fuel and are also often used as part of <b>afforestation</b> and reforestation <b>schemes.</b> The article explores how appropriate design and management of natural forest corridors and remnant patches may be used to mitigate or reduce the negative impacts of large-scale industrial plantations on native biodiversity and towards maintenance of environmental and social functions of the original natural forest landscape. First, plantation landscapes should be designed so that the landscapes are penetrable and permeable for those biodiversity components which are of conservation concern in the area under consideration, but impenetrable and impermeable for pests, weeds, and invasive. Second, from a human/social standpoint, the priority must be to design plantation and manage landscapes in a way that minimizes the adverse impacts on the local people and communities living in and around these areas. This paper presents work conducted in Riau, Sumatra, Indonesia. Incentives for better landscape/spatial design and management of those areas that are set aside from production for corridors and conservation areas are identified. Corridors have been considered as merely constraints to maximizing short-term earnings. Potential short-term economic incentives and benefits include: minimizing plantation damage caused by wind throw, fire and insect pest attack (by functioning as windbreaks, firebreaks, and providing habitat for biological control organisms), protecting and maintaining water quality and supply to both the plantation stands and the people living there, providing resources such as beneficial plants, and other NTFPs, for those local people who live within and around the plantation landscape, and, decreasing the plantation establishment and maintenance cost. The paper also describes improved sets of criteria and indicators for sustainable management of large-scale plantations, by i) suggesting increasing emphasis on landscape scale and conservation and socio-economic issues, and, ii) ensuring that the criteria and indicators are sufficiently linked to practical management, specifically by establishing explicit links between the criteria and indicator sets and codes of practice...|$|R
