40|$|The {{basis for}} this {{research}} project was that copper is lost in the Leaching Plant of the Nyrstar Budel zinc smelter. In {{the section of the}} Leaching Plant copper is lost, iron and aluminium are precipitated. Sampling of this process showed that the removal of copper from the solution is a function of pH and is mainly linked to the removal of aluminium. Tests with process fluids at stable pH levels showed that ferric ion and aluminium are mainly removed as jarosites at pH = 2 and pH = 2, 5. Copper is also removed at those pH values and is thus precipitated in jarosite form. This is the actual loss of copper. At pH = 3 and 3, 5 more aluminium was removed, but now also in the form of <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxides.</b> It was found that copper is adsorbed onto these hydroxides and hence more copper is removed from the solution. At these pH values also jarosites are formed which permanently remove copper, but it is assumed that the adsorption onto <b>aluminium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> prevails. The result of the adsorption of copper onto these hydroxides is that it eventually returns to the FeP in which it has another chance to get lost to jarosites. Hence the only way to prevent copper from being lost is to prevent copper from reaching the FeP. One way to prevent copper from reaching the FeP is not using calcine to neutralise the acid from the SiHALO, but with alternative neutralising agents which do not contain copper. Another way is to prevent copper from leaving the SiHAL. Copper cementation is a method which can totally remove the copper dissolved in the SiHALO. Copper cementation with iron was found to yield the highest recovery and is thus also the most cost effective.
