500|$|In a Washington Post op-ed, DeRay Mckesson {{endorsed}} Hillary Clinton, {{because her}} [...] "platform on racial justice is strong". He articulated that voting {{alone is not}} the only way to bring about [...] "transformational change". He said that [...] "I voted my entire life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> tear-gassed in the streets of St. Louis and Baltimore. I voted my entire life, and those votes did not convict the killers of Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray or Michael Brown".|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside was that I was published and I got a readership, ... downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> like, 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E
500|$|The episode further {{illustrates}} the greed of corporate culture by portraying Mickey as capitalizing on religion for profit, while secretly mocking it {{in a particularly}} contemptuous tone: [...] "I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now! And do you know why? Because Christians are retarded! They believe in a talking dead guy!" [...] "The Ring" [...] ends with a tongue-in-cheek cautionary message against engaging in oral sex, depicting Kenny's death from a sexually transmitted disease in the final moments of the episode. When asked whether Stone really believed purity rings were [...] "lame", as they were portrayed in [...] "The Ring", he said, [...] "Well, I don't know. I didn't have one in high school, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> lame." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Cork from Game Informer {{scored the}} game an 8/10, saying: [...] "Creation and {{discovery}} are at Tearaways foundation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> pleasantly {{surprised at the}} steady drip of new abilities, gameplay elements, and other novelties delivered throughout. Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close to my face, it felt as though I was privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule. I’m glad to see the adventure on the big screen, but the console experience feels less personal, and the journey loses {{a little bit in the}} transition. That said, Tearaway Unfolded is still a great game for families or anyone else who’s looking for an uplifting change of pace." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> writhing in the depths, {{when the}} door opened and Jeeves appeared.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to {{interrupt}} you, my dear sir, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> more sorry for the cause. My good, my worthy friend, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> deceived.' ...|$|R

60|$|We {{had taken}} our places, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{busy trying to}} fathom the joke, when a stout lady {{appeared}} on the scene, and demanded to know her place.|$|E
60|$|At last {{we got out}} of England, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a free man. The chaise (we were posting again) {{brought us}} into a dirty town, and drew up at the door of a shabby inn. A shock-headed girl {{received}} us.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{remains to}} be seen whether your {{daughter}} absolutely withdraws. Your daughter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> very good friends; nothing is changed in that. As I say, I will talk it over with her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Former HBO Sports President Seth Abraham concurs, saying, [...] "I think, if Lou (DiBella) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> at HBO, we'd be in {{the same}} pickle as far as the exodus of fights to {{pay-per-view}} is concerned." ...|$|R

60|$|When I and Nettie {{had been}} sixteen {{we had been}} just of an age and contemporaries altogether. Now we were a year and three-quarters older, and she--her {{metamorphosis}} was almost complete, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> only {{at the beginning of}} a man's long adolescence.|$|E
60|$|The whole {{incident}} {{had lasted}} only a few seconds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> standing there when I {{was aware of the}} other man approaching. He had apparently given up the pursuit, for he was walking quite slowly. He stopped within a few feet of me and I heard him swearing softly to himself.|$|E
6000|$|I had no {{immediate}} answer to give, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> very much amused at {{the absurdity of}} the situation. Had any one ever before paid his bill in such fashion? At this moment the stable-man approached us {{from one of the}} outbuildings. [...] "This is my hostler," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps he can suggest something." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It was pleasurable {{working with}} them. Some {{of them have}} become good friends <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> in contact with them till this day," [...] Eziashi says {{on the number of}} Hollywood top stars he has worked with.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] said he, {{jumping up}} from the throne, where he had seated himself. [...] "That <b>is</b> my call, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> the Royal Chamberlain, <b>and</b> will <b>be</b> until <b>I</b> appoint another in my place." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have thought}} it over again, and have gone over the play again with an {{imaginary}} stage and actors before me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> of the same mind. Shall I keep the MS. till you come to town? ...|$|R
60|$|Neither his {{distress}} nor yet {{the sheer}} absurdity {{of it was}} able to disarm me. It was the first instance of harm being attempted to be done to me--at any rate, the first I had ever found out. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> young enough, still too much {{on this side of the}} shadow line, not to be surprised and indignant at such things.|$|E
6000|$|... "Queequeg," [...] said I, {{when they}} had dragged me, the last man, to the deck, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water; [...] "Queequeg, my fine friend, does {{this sort of thing}} often happen?" [...] Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to {{understand}} that such things did often happen.|$|E
6000|$|There came a ring at {{the door}} that made my own heart jump into my mouth. I knew it was Tedham come back again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{in the throes of}} {{buttoning}} on my collar when my wife burst into my room. I smiled round at her as gayly as I could with the collar-buttoning grimace on my face. [...] "All right, I'll be down in a minute. You just go and talk to him till--" ...|$|E
60|$|Sixteen {{years had}} passed since that night vigil in the old Cumberland house, and, behold! we two, Leo <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> travelling, still searching for that {{mountain}} peak shaped like the Symbol of Life which never, never could be found.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} living somewhere else," [...] I said, [...] "although my {{opinions}} on that matter differ from yours. But I {{do know that}} you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> on earth in {{what remains of the}} saloon of the Star of the South." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, Ed," [...] I rapped to him. [...] "You and Jake keep quiet, and I'll {{tell you}} about it. Smith can't prevent you from listening, and he can't prevent me from talking. They have done their worst, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> here." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{intoxicated}} with joy. I {{was afraid}} {{it was too}} happy to be real, and that I should wake in Buckingham Street presently, and hear Mrs. Crupp clinking the teacups in getting breakfast ready. But Dora sang, and others sang, and Miss Mills sang--about the slumbering echoes in the caverns of Memory; {{as if she were}} a hundred years old--and the evening came on; and we had tea, with the kettle boiling gipsy-fashion; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> as happy as ever.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! Exactly,' {{said the}} old man. 'You tell him so now. You hadn't told him so before, and you tell him so now. Ay, ay! That's right! You know I stood between you and his father so long, that {{it seems as if}} death had made no difference, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{standing}} between you. So I will, and so in fairness I require to have that plainly put forward. Arthur, you please to hear that you have no right to mistrust your father, and have no ground to go upon.' ...|$|E
60|$|Next came Carlyle's French Revolution {{and at last}} Gibbon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> deep in the Decline and Fall when {{disaster}} came to us: {{my father}} was practically ruined, owing, as I have said in a former chapter, to his childlike trust in his fellow-men, and we quitted the home he had counted as a permanent one, which in due time would have become his property had he but made his position secure by a proper deed on first consenting {{to take over the}} place in its then ruinous condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> eminently respectable, but find other respectable people tiresome." [...] The man who wrote the {{foregoing}} certainly had me guessing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> wondering whether or not he'd have found me tiresome, or what the deuce he did mean.|$|R
5000|$|Carrey met {{model and}} actress Jenny McCarthy in 2005 {{and made their}} {{relationship}} public in June 2006. In April 2010, the two ended their near five-year relationship. Despite the split and media circulations, McCarthy stated in October 2010 that, [...] "Jim <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> good friends".|$|R
6000|$|... "She remembers not the sorrows {{which have}} befallen us," [...] the Doña Maria would say with tearful eyes, that each day grew larger as the rings of sorrow deepened beneath them.
