6000|$|In conclusion, I shall beg {{to add a}} {{few words}} on the Fungi of the Himalayas, so far as they have at present been investigated. As regards these there is a marked difference, as might be {{anticipated}} from {{the nature of the}} climates between those parts of Tibet investigated by Dr. Thomson, and the more southern regions. The fungi found by Dr. Thomson were but few in number, {{and for the most part}} of very ordinary forms, differing but little from the produce of an European wood. Some, however, grow to a very large size, as for instance, Polyporus fomentarius on poplars near Iskardo, exceeding in dimensions anything which this species exhibits in Europe. A very fine <b>AEcidium</b> also infests the fir trees (Abies Smithiana), a figure of which has been given in the [...] "Gardeners' Chronicle," [...] 1852, p. 627, under the name of <b>AEcidium</b> Thomsoni. This is allied to the Hexenbesen of the German forests, but is a finer species and quite distinct. Polyporus oblectans, Geaster limbatus, Geaster mammosus, Erysiphe taurica, a Boletus infested with Sepedonium mycophilum, Scleroderma verrucosum, an <b>AEcidium,</b> and a Uromyces, both on Mulgedium Tataricum, about half-a-dozen Agarics, one at an altitude of 16,000 feet above the Nubra river, a Lycoperdon, and Morchella semilibera, which is eaten in Kashmir, and exported when dry to the plains of India, make up the list of fungi.|$|E

40|$|Endophyllum osteospermi is an autoecious, endocyclic rust fungus, {{which has}} only been {{recorded}} on Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera (Asteraceae, Calendulae), a perennial woody shrub. Both organisms are indigenous to South Africa. Because E. osteospermi is being considered for release in Australia as a biocontrol agent against C. monilifera ssp. monilifera, {{it was necessary to}} determine its host range and natural distribution in South Africa. To address this, natural stands of Chrysanthemoides species, as well as other South African asteraceous plants, were monitored for E. osteospermi between 1992 and 2003. A morphological and molecular comparison of specimens referable to Endophyllum was undertaken. Based on these results, E. osteospermi was recorded on C. monilifera sspp. monilifera, pisifera, rotundata, canescens, and subcanescens, C. incana, and an undescribed taxon. E. osteospermi was also recorded on Osteospermum ciliatum, O. pollgaloides, and O. potbergense. Furthermore, a closely related but previously undescribed species, E. dimorphothecae sp. nov. is described on Dimorphotheca cuneata. <b>Aecidium</b> elytropappi is transferred to Endophyllum as E. elytropappi comb. nov., being recorded on Elytropappus rhinocerostis and Stoebe plumosa. This study shows that in South Africa E. osteospermi is restricted to a small group of related plant species in the Calenduleae. This rust is therefore considered suitable as a candidate agent for the biocontrol of C. monilifera ssp. monilifera, and pending the results of host specificity testing, would most likely be safe to introduce into Australia...|$|E
40|$|The phylogenetic {{validity}} of Puccinia and Uromyces, Pucciniaceae, and closely related genera was evaluated using nucLSU rDNA sequences. Using {{a wide range}} of rust species with different life cycles and with different host specificities, Puccinia and Uromyces were shown to be highly polyphyletic and to also include representatives of the genera <b>Aecidium,</b> Cumminsiella, Dietelia, Endophyllum, Miyagia, and Uredo. Furthermore, the structure of the phylogenetic data did not reflect previous sub-generic delimitations based on teliospore pedicel structure, but rather suggests that at least two major lineages have evolved within Puccinia/Uromyces: Rusts with telial states on Poaceae were exclusively found in one of these groupings and those with telial states on Cyperaceae resided in the other lineage. This might suggest that the two lineages evolved in close association with these host groups in different biomes.

40|$|The {{work began}} with an {{endeavour}} to find a technique for inoculating the host plants of the Uredineae with single sporidia of their specific rust, with precision and certainty. This has been achieved, and single sporidia have been isolated {{by means of the}} microdissection apparatus of Dr. Chambers. The most favourable conditions for sporidial infection were then determined, and cultures kept under controlled conditions. The rust used was Puccinia malvacearum, chosen because its teleutospores germinate immediately they are ripe so that a constant supply is available over a long period. This facilitated preliminary experimentation. Results show that this fungus is homothallic: a single sporidium being sufficient to cause infection, and the production of teleutospores. This was to be expected since there is no pycnidium or <b>aecidium</b> in the life cycle. The method of Inoculation has universal application for the rusts and it is hoped to demonstrate this at once in a long cycled form. Reviewing the literature on Puccinia malvacearum several problems in the life-cycle were found to be as yet unsolved. A study of the complete life history by means of examination of infections of known age, made under controlled conditions, has helped to elucidate these points. Infected plants in the field have also been under observation day by day throughout the winter, {{to solve the problem of}} hibernation. The results from these experiments show that there is a retardation in the cycle consequent on the less frequent occurrence of suitable conditions for germination and infection, but new infections do occur whenever these favourable conditions prevail. <p...|$|E
40|$|According to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Art. 23, the {{nomenclature}} of the Uredinales, Ustilaginales and Gasteromycetes {{begins with}} Persoon’s “Synopsis Methodica Fungorum”, published in 1801. His descriptions, however, are partly not very explicit and as, {{according to the}} Code, Art. 69, rust names are valid solely {{in so far as}} they refer to “spores giving rise to basidia”, i. e. the teleuto-stage, the present author found it desirable to examine Persoon’s collection of rusts preserved in the Rijksherbarium, Leiden. Through the courtesy of Dr. R. A. Maas Geesteranus, Mycologist of the Rijksherbarium, all specimens of the genera <b>Aecidium,</b> Uredo and Puccinia were lent to the Botanical Museum of the University of Oslo, where the author got the opportunity of examining them. The collection contained 792 numbers, comprising 221 species of rusts, 19 species of smuts, and 14 species of other fungus groups. A complete list of determinations is filed in the Rijksherbarium. The main aim was to find suitable lectotypes for Persoon’s taxa of 1801, among specimens containing teleuto. And owing to the type method now being established (Code, Art. 18) it seems natural to consider a Uredo name valid if the type contains teleuto, even if this stage has not been mentioned in the author’s description of the species in question (cp. D. P. Rogers, Mycologia, 45 pp. 250 — 251, 1948, and D. B. O. Savile, Canadian Journ. Bot., 3 p. 490, 1955). This view makes Persoon’s names Uredo betae and U. viciae-fabae valid. However, most of the specimens had clearly been collected after 1801 and were consequently unsuitable as material for lectotypes. This younger material contains many species that are not mentioned in Syn. Meth. Fung. and consequently not treated in the present publication. For the taxa established by Persoon in 1801 have particularly been taken into consideration those specimens that in Persoon’s handwriting are solely furnished with the same name (or sometimes with a somewhat differing one) as in Syn. Meth. Fung. and without author name, or sometimes with Persoon’s own. Most of the other specimens of the same taxa are also labeled solely or partially by Persoon, but have not been taken into consideration as material for lectotypes because the names do not correspond with those in Syn. Meth. Fung., or are obviously younger than 1801 (e. g. if published by De Candolle, Link, or other contemporary authors). Many of these specimens Persoon had received from other botanists, particularly Chaillet, Balbis, and Mougeot. Only one specimen presumably older than 1801 is mentioned as having been received from another person, viz. Smith (presumably J. E. Smith in England); it is labeled Uredo linearis β. Polypodii and contains Hyalopsora polypodii (Diet.) Magn...|$|E
