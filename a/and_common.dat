40|$|Li-Chen Hsu* Abstract: We examine {{cooperation}} in threshold public goods <b>and</b> <b>commons</b> games by considering different group sizes and contribution mechanisms. Our experimental evidence shows first that cooperation is significantly different between public goods <b>and</b> <b>commons</b> experiments when group size {{is small and}} when contributions are continuous. Second, continuous contributions greatly raise {{cooperation in}} both public goods <b>and</b> <b>commons</b> experiments when group size is large. Third, continuous contributions greatly alleviate the incentive of complete free-riding in both public goods <b>and</b> <b>commons</b> experiments, regardless of the group size. Finally, threshold Nash equilibria are reached more often in all experiments than the complete free-riding Nash equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStrategy theory {{positions}} {{technology as}} a crucial resource of private value creation while commons theory provides governance structures pertinent to resource utilisation. The widening disconnect in the approach towards leveraging a resource and its governance increases the pressure on intellectual property that links strategy <b>and</b> <b>commons.</b> We discern in this work {{the existence of an}} implicit relationship between strategy <b>and</b> <b>commons.</b> Based on a multidisciplinary study of strategy, <b>commons,</b> <b>and</b> intellectual property theories, we propose patent pools in the form of semicommons as a strategic appropriation mechanism that balances technology strategy, IP strategy <b>and</b> <b>commons</b> in the pursuit of value creation...|$|R

5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) <b>and</b> <b>common</b> snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) <b>and</b> <b>common</b> gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
