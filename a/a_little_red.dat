The Thunderdome (which was {{generally}} advertised as a Techno night) in Miles Platting {{was at the}} epicenter of the scene and gave rise to acts like 808 State, Jam MC's, Steve Williams and Jay Wearden. The genre was extremely popular with the city's football hooligans. According to Manchester United football hooligan Colin Blaney in Hotshot: The Story of <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Red</b> Devil, the acid house venues were the only place where rival hooligan gangs would mix without coming to blows with one another.|$|E
500|$|In {{the post-war}} era, Margie Day with the Griffin Brothers {{recorded}} {{a song in}} 1950 titled [...] "Little Red Rooster" [...] in an updated jump blues style. [...] It is a boisterous, uptempo piece performed by a small combo group. [...] Day's lyrics include [...] "Got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>red</b> rooster, and man how he can crow... He's a boss of the barnyard, any ol' place he goes"; Dixon's song uses the line [...] "Keep everything in the barnyard, upset in every way". The original Dot Records single lists the songwriters as [...] "Griffin-Griffin". [...] Day's song was a hit, reaching number five on Billboard's Best Selling Retail Rhythm & Blues Records chart in 1951.|$|E
500|$|Although Wyman noted {{some early}} {{criticism}} of their rendition, Janovitz {{described it as}} [...] "a fairly faithful version [...] ". It is performed as a moderately slow (74 bpm) blues in the key of G. [...] Although AllMusic reviewer Matthew Greenwald describes their arrangement as having a straight I-IV-V twelve-bar blues progression, they sometimes vary the changes, {{but not in the}} same manner as Howlin' Wolf. [...] Jagger uses the lyrics from the original (omitting Cooke's extra verse), but makes one important changeâ€”instead of [...] "I got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>red</b> rooster", he sings [...] "I am the little red rooster", although the later verse reverts to [...] "If you see my little red rooster". Instrumentally, Bill Wyman generally follows Dixon's bass lines. Charlie Watts later admitted that his drum part was inspired by Sam Cooke's version, which was played by Hal Blaine. Keith Richards adds a rhythm guitar part; according to Egan, [...] "the juxtaposition of acoustic guitar and electric slide all make for something richer and warmer than any blues they had ever attempted before".|$|E

It is an organization established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to raise awareness about heart disease in women, and how to prevent the condition. She serves in the honorary position of ambassador for the program leading the federal government's effort to give women a [...] "wake up call" [...] {{about the risk of}} heart disease. She commented on the disease: [...] "Like many women, I assumed heart disease was a man's disease and cancer was what we would fear the most. Yet heart disease kills more women in our country than all forms of cancer combined. When it comes to heart disease, education, prevention, and even <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>red</b> dress can save lives." [...] She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition. This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E
500|$|Sir Lucious Left Foot was {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of three years, beginning on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2007. Big Boi has said that he [...] "always start working on albums on Martin Luther King Day. It's a good luck charm". The album was primarily recorded at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta, Georgia, the studio used by OutKast for their previous albums. Additional recording took place at The Dungeon Recording Studios, The Slumdrum Dreamhouse, and King of Crunk in Atlanta, Dungeon East Studios in Decatur, Georgia, Instrumental Zoo in Miami, Florida, and Kush Studios in Palm Island, Florida. Big Boi discussed the Stankonia studio's environment in an interview for The Guardian, calling it [...] "comfortable but gritty enough to get you in a state of mind of being raw and ready to kill stuff", while noting that the sessions were accompanied by [...] "some candles, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>red</b> light, maybe some crunk juice and a cigar; every now and then perhaps a little 'purple'". While searching for a new record label, he completed recording for the album. The album was mastered on May 27, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Willie Dixon's [...] "The Red Rooster"/"Little Red Rooster" [...] uses {{elements}} from several earlier blues songs. [...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What you want with a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know my dog anywhere I hear him bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>red</b> rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If You See My Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If you see my rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If you see my little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} in the 1896 season, Hogan {{apparently}} secured his release from the Browns. Once again, however, his physical speed offered no guarantee of consistency on the playing field. [...] On July 21, 1896, the St. Paul (Minneapolis) Globe reported that Hogan had performed poorly in a contest between the Hoosiers and the local ball club. [...] "Marty Hogan...made a bad fumble, and then {{looked up at the sky}} to see if it had moved while he was locating the ball", the paper reported. [...] "It was a good bluff, but the crowd discovered Marty's weakness before the end of the game". [...] In January 1897, the Vindicator reported that the Hoosiers had sold Hogan to a club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [...] The article called Hogan [...] "one of the fastest outfielders and baserunners in the Western League" [...] and predicted he would [...] "greatly strengthen the Grand Rapids outfield". [...] The following month, however, the paper described the previous report as a [...] "mistake", indicating instead that Hogan had signed a contract with baseball executive John T. Brush to play with the Hoosiers for another year. [...] The paper also reported that the contract granted Hogan [...] "the largest salary he has ever drawn". [...] Despite this lucrative contract, Hogan established and maintained his own advertising distribution agency in Indianapolis. [...] "He goes about the streets dressed much like an English costermonger", Sporting Life reported in January 1897. [...] "Marty can be seen with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>red</b> wagon full of signs and advertising matter chasing up and down streets nailing the signs to buildings and convenient places and distributing advertising literature in the reel-dance portion of Indianapolis". [...] Less than four months later, in May 1897, he was released by the Indianapolis ball club. In June 1897, the Kansas City Journal indicated Hogan had moved on to the Dayton (Ohio) Old Soldiers, a team affiliated with the Class B Interstate League, where he was [...] "playing a sensational center field". In October of the same year, Sporting Life speculated Hogan would remain with Dayton during the upcoming 1898 season. [...] "Marty Hogan's contract with Dayton is such that he cannot be reserved, as are the rest of the players", the article stated. [...] "Unless Marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with Dayton next year". [...] Further research is required to determine how long Hogan continued to play as an outfielder in the minor leagues. [...] (His obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer.) [...] During his playing career, he apparently received at least one serious injury. [...] In February 1903, Sporting Life reported that the former baseball player's friends were [...] "anxious to get him appointed on the staff of American League umpires". [...] The article added, [...] "Hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone, which was injured in a collision during a baseball game".|$|E

To prepare the barrel, the inside of the barrel is de-charred (top layer of wood is removed), torched, and cleaned, to minimize the presence of any residual whiskey. The barrels are then used in warehouses on Avery Island for aging the mash.|$|E

I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction.
