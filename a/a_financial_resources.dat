This article uses a qualitative approach with three new ventures within the product design industry that used the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The findings showed that new ventures in this particular kind of industry use crowdfunding only as a marketing and sales channel rather than as <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>resource.</b> It turned out that crowdfunding especially helps to facilitate external liabilities that are visible to the crowd, whereas internal liabilities that are not visible to the crowd are not affected...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the role of {{networks}} in both identifying and accessing <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers by technology-based ventures. We explore the role of networks by taking into account several specifications. We (1) acknowledge that new ventures can access <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers both directly and through referral, (2) make an analytical distinction between the identification of financial opportunities and the access to <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers, and (3) study the contingencies that influence the effectiveness of certain network positions and relationships in the new venture financing process. In order to explore the role of networks in financing, we conducted case studies in four technology-based ventures. Our findings show that for identifying <b>financial</b> opportunities and <b>resource</b> providers, a positional network that is rich in structural holes is favourable for new ventures. In a relational sense, for new ventures that directly access <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers, having weak network ties are most effective. When new ventures use a referral to access <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> provider, referrals from referral sources that are strongly tied to the venture are the most effective. Furthermore, our results show that the effectiveness of certain network positions and relations largely depends on contingencies. Based on our findings, we shape several propositions that provide new directions for future research.
