5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary critics gave {{mixed reviews}} of the DVD. Some were {{disappointed}} with the low quality {{and the lack of}} clarity of the videos, while others praised the collection for being a reminder of Madonna as the visual artist. Celebration: The Video Collection debuted {{at the top of the}} Billboard Top Music Videos <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the DVD charts in Australia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain and Switzerland. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 100,000 copies across United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the figure with items such as radishes, pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on manhole covers, beer steins <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the tower of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E
25|$|The tower, {{containing}} five bells, is ashlar-faced and surmounted by battlements. The spire contains three {{tiers of}} lucarnes.

5|$|Other species within Mutabiles include X.campanelloides, {{which can}} be {{differentiated}} by {{the shape of the}} thin-walled caulocystidia and yellow flesh in the stem. X.cornui grows in softwood forests with Sphagnum moss. Both the cap <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> stem sport yellow grains. X.fraxinophila produces larger mushrooms and has yellow gills. X.parvibulbosa, while potentially featuring similar caulocystidia to X.setulipes, has a bitter or sour taste.|$|E

50|$|Fabrikoid {{consists}} of cotton cloth coated with nitrocellulose. Among other uses {{it has been}} used for luggage, bookbinding, upholstery and dress trimmings. By the 1920s Fabrikoid was used heavily in both automobile seat covers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> covertible automobiles. Some of the early experiments on its uses in upholstery were conducted by Gilbert Rohde.|$|R
50|$|In later years, a {{concrete}} parapet {{was added to}} <b>the</b> bridge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> some arches were reinforced with concrete. Catenary poles {{were added to the}} bridge with electrification in the 1930s. Ownership of the bridge passed, {{with the rest of the}} Main Line, to Penn Central in 1968 and Amtrak in 1976.|$|R
5|$|William {{also began}} to {{reconstruct}} {{the inside of the}} inner bailey, a programme of work that was continued by his descendants over the next few decades. The work included a chapel, a hall and solar, and various service buildings. An open-backed square tower was built in stone along the wall on top of the motte; this tower was later rebuilt, possibly because of pressure on it from the motte earthworks, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the motte was relaid with flagstones to form pathways around the top. A stone gatehouse was built {{on the west side of}} the wall, leading from the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|Central Basingstoke has two further {{shopping}} areas: The Malls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> Town. The Malls {{area had}} declined since {{the opening of}} Festival Place and the closure of its Allders department store, though still home to several major retailers. The leasehold was purchased in 2004 by the St Modwen development group {{in partnership with the}} Kuwait property investment company Salhia Real Estate, with provision for redevelopment The redevelopment of The Malls started in late 2010, and the shopping centre was given a major facelift. The existing canopies were removed and a clear roof canopy installed, to protect the centre from bad weather, but still allow natural light and air in. The whole shopping centre has been repaved and new street furniture installed. A new gateway entrance to The Malls links it to the rail station. The redevelopment was completed {{in the last quarter of}} 2011. The redevelopment work has been carried out by Wates Group using a variety of subcontractors.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
50|$|Lepidochrysops pterou is a {{butterfly}} in the Lycaenidae family.

5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces {{successfully}} besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the motte landscaped to its current form.|$|E
5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|Scenes not {{involving}} the main apartments were all filmed in London {{during the week}} beginning March 30, 1998. Location shooting was done mostly for scenes featuring Joey and Chandler; outside the London Marriott, Grosvenor Square, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> an open-top London bus as it crosses Tower Bridge (this scene was excised from the final cut but features in the opening titles of the next episode). Interiors, such as the restaurant, the Waltham's hallway and the hotel rooms, were all filmed on purpose-built sets at The Fountain Studios, Wembley. The reaction from the audience when Monica came out from under Chandler's bed covers meant the actors had to hold their position for 27 seconds. When filming ran late one evening, the production team ordered pizzas for the audience.|$|E

5|$|St Andrew's Anglican Church {{has three}} {{distinctive}} internal transept arches, and {{was designed by}} a Presbyterian, Alexander Leckie Elphinstone Junior. The foundation stone was laid in 1883, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the spire completed in 1906. The fast construction period, unusual for that time, was indicative of the area's affluence. Recent Asian influences in Summer Hill have brought about the introduction of non-Christian places of worship. The Wong Tai Sin (or Kwan Yin Kur) temple {{is located on the}} corners of Kensington Road and Liverpool Road in a building that was a Masonic temple in the 1920s. The same building was converted into the current temple; the lower floor houses the Taoist deity of Wong Tai Sin, and the upper floor houses the Buddhist Bodhisattva of Kwan Yin.|$|E
5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{may also}} be flown at half-mast when the Central People's Government advises the Chief Executive to do so, or when the Chief Executive {{considers}} it appropriate to do so, on occurrences of unfortunate events causing especially serious casualties, or when serious natural calamities have caused heavy casualties. When raising a flag to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised {{to the top of}} the pole and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the pole is one third of the length of the pole. When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of the pole before it is lowered.|$|E

Its construction having been particularly slow, {{it presents a}} complex pattern of French religious types of architecture from the 13th century to the 15th. For example, the tower buttresses are Romanesque, the ornamentation generally is pure Gothic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers are Renaissance (beginning of the 16th century).|$|R
5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
