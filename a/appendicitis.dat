5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} <b>appendicitis.</b> <b>Appendicitis</b> was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|Evers {{was named}} the White Sox acting manager for the 1924 season, {{succeeding}} Chance, who was ordered home due to poor health. However, Evers suffered from <b>appendicitis</b> during the season, missing time during the year, and the White Sox opened up a managerial search when Chance died in September. The White Sox replaced Evers with Collins after the season.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{days before}} the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, while {{training}} in Debre Zeit, Abebe began to feel pain. He {{was brought to the}} hospital and diagnosed with acute <b>appendicitis,</b> and had an appendectomy on September 16. Back on his feet in a few days, Abebe left the hospital within a week.|$|E
5|$|In November 1908, Beilhart {{became ill}} from acute <b>appendicitis.</b> Despite {{attention}} from a surgeon who performed an appendectomy, Beilhart developed peritonitis and died three days later. In {{keeping with the}} society's beliefs in simplicity, Beilhart was buried in a plain coffin in an unmarked grave overlooking Wooster Lake. None of the buildings remain, having been covered by a housing development, although Beilhart's grave remains in a brush-obscured corner of the tract.|$|E
5|$|In November 1908, {{returning}} from a meeting in Chicago, Beilhart fell ill with stomach pains. He was diagnosed with <b>appendicitis,</b> and a surgeon was brought in. There is some discrepancy concerning the diagnosis once surgery was performed. One doctor indicated that his appendix was healthy while another maintained that it had ruptured. Beilhart developed peritonitis and died on November 24, 1908.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, <b>appendicitis,</b> encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Robert Wilson {{was born}} April 26, 1900, in the Pennsylvania steel mill town of Ellwood City, north of Pittsburgh. His mother, Jennie Kaughn, 16, was an {{unemployed}} drifter from Philadelphia; his father, Robert Wilson, 24, was a steel worker. His parents never married; both were heavy drinkers, and in 1907 {{his mother died}} of <b>appendicitis</b> {{at the age of}} 24.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include <b>appendicitis,</b> volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} 15 {{months had}} been personally and professionally calamitous. In June 1921, Churchill's mother had died, followed {{three months later}} by his youngest child, Marigold. In late 1922, he fell ill with <b>appendicitis</b> {{and at the end}} of the year lost his Scottish parliamentary seat at Dundee.|$|E
5|$|<b>Appendicitis</b> {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} Johann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, were {{working at the}} Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of <b>appendicitis</b> after {{spending}} {{less than a year}} in Russia, and when Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.|$|E
5|$|Brett {{departed}} for the Western Front in November 1917 but suffered {{a case of}} <b>appendicitis,</b> resulting {{in the loss of}} his flight status. After making a partial recovery, he served in France as senior materiel officer under Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, attaining the temporary rank of major on 7 June 1918. After briefly returned to the United States to serve in Office of the Director of Military Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. from 1 August to 23 September 1918, Brett went to England to command the United States Army Air Service Camp at Codford.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} in Cuba, Magoon retired from {{public service and}} vacationed for a year in Europe before {{returning}} to the United States. Speculation at the time pointed to him taking a position as ambassador to China, a special commission on stability in Central America, or a Cabinet position. Ultimately Magoon did not take up any of those new responsibilities and formally entered retirement. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1920 after complications from surgery for acute <b>appendicitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{died from}} sepsis on 14 June 1922, at the ancestral {{home of his}} wife at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, England. His obituarists {{ascribed}} this to an obscure form of blood poisoning brought on by gassing in the trenches during his war service. However, his ailments, including fatigue, heartdigestiveneurological disorders, <b>appendicitis,</b> cognitive problems, depression, anxiety — are today recognised as differential symptoms of malaria. Left untreated they sometimes lead to organ failure and death.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, Philipp was {{transferred}} to Defense of the Reich duties as Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG1—1st Fighter Wing), flying high altitude interception operations against the USAAF Eighth Air Force over the North Sea and northern Germany. He claimed his 204th victory on 2 May, and his 205th on 18 May before falling ill with <b>appendicitis.</b> This required hospitalization in Meissen. On 4 October 1943, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring {{is said to have}} issued the following instructions after another attack by the Eighth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Seemingly {{restored}} to full health, Bradman blazed two centuries {{in the last}} two games of the tour. However, when he returned to London to prepare for the trip home, he experienced severe abdominal pain. It took a doctor more than 24hours to diagnose acute <b>appendicitis</b> and a surgeon operated immediately. Bradman lost a lot of blood during the four-hour procedure and peritonitis set in. Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition. On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{candidates}} declared their {{candidacy for}} the Democratic nomination, including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler. Former governor Beckham {{was not a}} candidate; his only son had died in late 1934, devastating his family and leaving his wife strongly opposed to another political campaign. Near {{the end of the}} primary campaign, Laffoon suffered an attack of <b>appendicitis</b> and required an appendectomy, leaving him unable to campaign for Rhea. Two candidates dropped out of the race prior to the election.|$|E
5|$|Techdirt {{reported}} on November 6, 2009, that GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com {{was a dead}} site; by November 10 the domain name was registered to Beck's company, Mercury Radio Arts. In a notice posted {{to one of his}} other websites, Eiland-Hall wished Beck (then suffering from <b>appendicitis)</b> well, and characterized the conclusion of the case as a success. In a post on his blog, Eiland-Hall's lawyer Marc Randazza described the case as a victory for freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple had}} four children. The eldest, William, {{was born in}} 1893, shortly after their marriage. William later became an engineer, aviator, and spy. There were then two daughters; Gwendolyn (also known as Gwyneth), who died of <b>appendicitis</b> before Ewan's birth, and Margaret, who later became a {{decorated}} member of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in the Second World War and a Justice of the Peace, before dying {{in a car accident}} in 1966.|$|E
5|$|After being {{tracked by}} both Manchester United and Manchester City, {{he began his}} {{professional}} career at Birmingham City, where he signed a three-year contract {{at the age of}} 17. Following the departure of manager Steve Bruce, Burge was released by Birmingham in March 2008. He went on trial at League Two club Hereford United and League One side Cheltenham Town. He was verbally offered a short-term contract by Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, but the deal collapsed after Downing was replaced as the Cheltenham manager by Martin Allen. He instead joined up with League Two side Barnet. He made his debut for Barnet in the 4–0 home defeat by Notts County on 15 November 2008. This was the only appearance he made before his time there was disrupted by <b>appendicitis,</b> which ruled him out for four weeks. The club released him in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Bancroft {{served as}} player–manager for the Braves for three seasons, from 1924 through 1927. Upon {{becoming}} manager, {{he became the}} youngest manager in the National League (NL). He missed time during the 1924 season with <b>appendicitis.</b> After finishing in last place in the eight-team NL, Bancroft overhauled the Braves' roster for the 1925 season. However, he lost the services of Rube Marquard and Joe Genewich, and the Braves finished in fifth place. Bancroft suggested that Bob Smith, ineffective as an infielder, become a pitcher; Smith's successes as a pitcher benefited the Braves' starting rotation. The Braves lacked offense going into the 1926 season, but hoped their pitching and defense could lead them into contention. The Braves finished in seventh place in the NL in 1926 and 1927.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for <b>appendicitis,</b> and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later {{attended}} college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart came to believe that it was more important to put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of <b>appendicitis</b> and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years {{making it one of the}} longest surviving communes in America.|$|E
5|$|Charles and Zita {{temporarily}} resided at Castle Tata, {{the home}} of Count Esterházy, until a suitable permanent exile could be found. Malta was mooted as a possibility, but was declined by Lord Curzon, and French territory was ruled out due {{to the possibility of}} Zita's brothers intriguing on Charles's behalf. Eventually, the Portuguese island of Madeira was chosen. On 31 October 1921, the former Imperial couple were taken by rail from Tihany to Baja, where the Royal Navy monitor HMS Glowworm was waiting. They finally arrived at Funchal on 19 November. Their children were being looked after at Wartegg Castle in Switzerland by Charles's step-grandmother Maria Theresa, although Zita managed to see them in Zurich when her son Robert needed an operation for <b>appendicitis.</b> The children joined their parents in Madeira in February 1922.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs played {{just five}} {{first-class}} matches in 1921, when Australia toured England. In his opening first-class game, he played against the touring team, but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia. He missed the opening two Tests, but once recovered, scored a century for Surrey; as England trailed 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose {{him for the}} third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. On {{the first day of}} the match, he had to leave the field, and after a day of rest the pain worsened. He consulted Sir Berkley Moynihan, a prominent surgeon based in Leeds, who diagnosed acute <b>appendicitis</b> and operated the same day. In the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. He missed the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} Göttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of <b>appendicitis</b> on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{at the age}} of 26, O'Brien {{collapsed}} on stage during a performance, and later died due to complications after an <b>appendicitis</b> operation. Storm disbanded the Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades Ice Rink in Liverpool, in Benidorm (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in Jersey and Amsterdam. When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. He developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at Stormsville. The post mortem revealed that Storm had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental. Although it could not be proven, it is thought that his mother had committed suicide after finding Storm's body.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin Coolidge Jr. {{was born}} in Plymouth Notch, Windsor County, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. {{president}} to be born on Independence Day. He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge Sr. (1845–1926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846–85). Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations, and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper and public servant. He held various local offices, including {{justice of the peace}} and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate. Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer. She was chronically ill and died, perhaps from tuberculosis, when Coolidge was twelve years old. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875–1890), {{died at the age of}} fifteen, probably of <b>appendicitis,</b> when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of eighty.|$|E
5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} <b>appendicitis</b> in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
5|$|On 8 August 2016, Jesé joined French Paris Saint-Germain on {{a five-year}} deal for a {{reported}} transfer fee of €25 million. The deal included an 'anti-Barcelona' clause which prevented PSG from selling Jesé to Real Madrid's fierce La Liga rivals Barcelona in the future. He made his debut on 13 August, coming on {{as a substitute}} for Hatem Ben Arfa in a 1–0 away win over Bastia. Jesé was ruled out for a short period soon thereafter as a result of him suffering from <b>appendicitis.</b> Following his return, Jesé scored his first goal for the club on 19 November, netting from the penalty-spot in a 2–0 win over Nantes. He made his Coupe de la Ligue debut on 14 December and scored the third goal in a 3–1 win over Lille.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} before his 22nd birthday, on 15 February 1944, Schnaufer and his crew claimed aerial {{victories}} 45 to 47. Bomber Command had sent 561 Lancasters and 314 Halifax four-engined bombers, supported by de Havilland Mosquito night-fighters and bombers, destined for Berlin. Schnaufer, who had been suffering from stomach pains all day, and his crew returned to Leeuwarden at 00:14. Rumpelhardt {{had been the first}} to congratulate him on his birthday over the intercom. Their fellow airmen had prepared a birthday celebration. The stomach pains had become unbearable and Schnaufer was taken to a hospital with <b>appendicitis.</b> He stayed in the hospital for about two weeks before, together with Rumpelhardt, he went on vacation back home. Carelessly lifting his suitcase, he burst his stitches, resulting in further hospitalisation. He flew his first mission after these events on 19 March 1944.|$|E
5|$|Piron {{was born}} in Couvin in Belgium's Province of Namur on 10April 1896. He entered the Royal Military Academy in Brussels {{at the age of}} 17 in 1913. Following the German {{invasion}} of Belgium in August 1914 at the start of World War I, Piron, who had not finished his studies, was mobilised into the Belgian Army as a junior officer in the 2nd Regiment of the Line. He served with the Belgian army on the Yser Front and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1916. After being hospitalised with <b>appendicitis</b> in October 1917, he was transferred to the Belgian Air Force and served as an air observer with the 6th Reconnaissance Squadron. He was wounded twice. At {{the end of the war}} in 1918, Piron held the rank of acting captain.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with <b>appendicitis</b> during the {{previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, who had been on the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.|$|E
5|$|The 1924–25 season, {{the first}} year of NHL {{expansion}} to the United States, saw major changes in Ottawa's lineup. Jack Darragh retired and had died from <b>appendicitis</b> months after his final game. Making his debut in goal for Ottawa was Alex Connell, replacing Benedict. Replacing Broadbent was Hooley Smith, who had played for Canada in the 1924 Olympics. Lionel Hitchman was sold to the expansion Boston Bruins and replaced by Ed Gorman. It was also the debut season of Frank Finnigan. Off the ice, Gorman and Ahearn squabbled over ownership. In January 1925, during the season, Gorman sold his share of the Senators to Ahearn and left the Senators organization, later joining the expansion New York Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Mawson and Mertz's {{illnesses}} remains {{in part a}} mystery. At the time, McLean—the expedition's chief surgeon {{and one of the}} men who had remained at Cape Denison—attributed their sickness to colitis; Mawson wrote in The Home of the Blizzard, his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and <b>appendicitis.</b> A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and R. V. Southcott of the University of Adelaide concluded that the symptoms Mawson described—hair, skin and weight loss, depression, dysentery and persistent skin infections—indicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of vitamin A. This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts.|$|E
