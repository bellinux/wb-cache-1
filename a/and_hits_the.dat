25|$|This {{law also}} applies if {{part of the}} batsman's {{equipment}} is dislodged <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> stumps: Dwayne Bravo hit Kevin Pietersen {{in the head with}} a bouncer and his helmet hit the stumps during the 2007 England vs West Indies Test match at Old Trafford; a topspinner from Richie Benaud once knocked off Joe Solomon's cap, and the cap landed on Solomon's stumps.|$|E
25|$|If the {{delivered}} ball deflects off the bat, {{and bowls}} the batter, then the informal term {{is known as}} played on, knocked on or dragged on. If the wicket is put down without the batter making any sort of contact with the ball, then it is known as clean bowled with variations being 'bowled through the gate', where the ball travels between the bat and pad, or 'bowled around the legs', where the ball goes behind (to the legside of) the batsman <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> stumps.|$|E
25|$|Mistakes are {{sometimes}} made by even a skilled farrier, {{especially if the}} horse does not stand still. This may sometimes result in a nail coming {{too close to the}} sensitive part of the hoof (putting pressure on it), or a nail that is driven slightly into the sensitive hoof, called quicking or nail pricking. This occurs when a nail penetrates the wall <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> sensitive internal structures of the foot. Quicking results in bleeding and pain and the horse may show signs of lameness or may become lame in following days. Whenever it happens, the farrier must remove the offending nail. Usually a horse that is quicked will react immediately, though some cases where the nail is close to sensitive structures may not cause immediate problems. These mistakes are made occasionally by anyone who shoes horses, and in most cases is not an indication that the farrier is unskilled. It happens most commonly when horses move around while being shod, but also may occur if the hoof wall is particularly thin (common in Thoroughbreds), or if the hoof wall is brittle or damaged. It may also occur with an inexperienced or unskilled horseshoer who misdrives a nail, uses a shoe that is too small, or has not fitted the shoe to the shape of the horse's hoof. Occasionally, manufacturing defects in nails or shoes may also cause a misdriven nail that quicks a horse.|$|E

25|$|In May 1902, Méliès {{made the}} film A Trip to the Moon which was {{loosely based on}} Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon and H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon. In the film, Méliès stars as Professor Barbenfouillis, a {{character}} similar to the astronomer he played in The Astronomer's Dream in 1898. Professor Barbenfouillis is the President of the Astronomer's Club and proposes an expedition to the Moon. A space vehicle {{in the form of}} a large artillery shell is built in his laboratory, and he uses it to launch six men (including himself) on a voyage to the Moon. The vehicle is shot out of a large cannon into space <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> Man in the Moon in the eye. The group explores the Moon's surface before going to sleep. As they dream, they are observed by the Moon goddess Phoebe, played by Bleuette Bernon, who causes it to snow. Later, while underground, they are attacked and captured by a group of Moon aliens, played by acrobats from the Folies Bergère. Taken before the alien king, they manage to escape and are chased back to their spaceship. Then, with the aid of a rope attached to the spaceship, the men, along with an alien, fall from the Moon back to Earth, landing in the ocean (where a superimposed fish tank creates the illusion of the deep ocean). Eventually the spaceship is towed ashore and the returning adventurers are celebrated by the townspeople. At 14 minutes, it was Méliès' longest film up to that date and cost 10,000 francs to produce.|$|E

A blow {{to the front of}} the chest may cause contusion on the back of the lungs because a shock wave travels through the chest <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> curved back of the chest wall; this reflects the energy onto the back of the lungs, concentrating it.

500|$|The Chhinnamasta icon is also {{understood}} as {{a representation of the}} awakening of the kundalini– spiritual energy. The copulating couple represent the awakening in the Muladhara chakra, which corresponds to the last bone in the spinal column. The kundalini flows through the central passage in the body– the Sushumna nadi <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> topmost chakra, the Sahasrara at the top of head– with such force that it blows her head off. The blood spilling from the throat represents the upward-flowing kundalini, breaking all knots (granthis)– those things which make a person sad, ignorant and weak– of the chakras. The severed head is [...] "transcendent consciousness". The three blood streams represent the flow of nectar when the kundalini unites with Shiva, who resides in the Sahasrara. The serpent in her iconography is also a symbol of the kundalini.|$|E

500|$|A {{writer of}} The New York Times {{described}} the singer's {{look in the}} video as [...] "bold". Lauren Cochrane from The Guardian also focused on the singer's look praising the attire she wore as [...] "perfectly acceptable as dinner party" [...] and praising her for wearing the corset with aplomb. An editor of Billboard felt that she [...] "gets sexy" [...] in the song's visual. A writer of the website Fuse praised {{the concept of the}} video, noting that [...] "instead of crying into the steak she just made for her date, she puts on a leather trench coat <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> town. Ultimately, she wins." [...] Dan DeLuca of the Philadelphia Media Network noted that the video gave an opportunity to the singer to showcase her [...] "dark side". Writing on behalf of Vanity Fair, Michelle Collins felt that the set was [...] "bizzaro", similar to a set as in the film Sliding Doors (1998). She further found several of the scenes to accompany the song's lyrics and story. Melissa Locker from Time magazine wrote in her review that the video follows the steps of [...] "Partition" [...] while also being a [...] "natural precursor to 'Irreplaceable,' at least in our imagination". Michael Zelenko from The Fader wrote that it served as a follow-up to [...] "Partition" [...] noting that in [...] "Jealous", [...] "Bey's lingering needs are transformed into a burning suspicion of infidelity".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Mars {{displaying}} sadness as he reminisces about the moments spent {{between him and}} his [...] "brunette vixen" [...] girlfriend in an [...] "sparsely" [...] decorated apartment. Throughout the video, the singer expresses his emptiness and devastation recurring to solo shots in which he stands [...] "around looking sullen" [...] and by using [...] "faded lighting" [...] in order to convey such sentiments. Flashes {{of the two of them}} giggling, kissing, snuggling, pouring out romance and being [...] "playful" [...] are shown, as the singer apparently misses their relationship. After the opening sequence, Mars holds a private screening of [...] "Breaking Dawn" [...] to please her, the couple kiss in front of a cinema projector lights, while romantic scenes from the , including the honeymoon and the one where Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, sweeps Bella, portrayed by Kristen Stewart, [...] "off her feet and into their new home", are projected on the wall. As the video continues, the couple begins to fight, leading to more [...] "heated arguments and lonely nights". At this point, Mars, possibly, writes a song to purse her to stay with him. A critic believed the song written only helped Mars to lead with the break up by telling the story. Nevertheless, MTV's, Jocelyn Vena stated [...] "we see that the song Bruno wrote while his lady was asleep turned out to be romantic enough to win her back." [...] The video ends with Mats revisiting scenes of the relationship and being set back to the present. In the final shot the singer is alone as rain pours down <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> window behind him.|$|E
500|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the events of the first film, Elsa tries to make Anna's 19th {{birthday}} as perfect as possible a way of making up for the years they spent apart. To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, Sven and Olaf to make this a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace courtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna. However, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure hunt to find all the gifts that have been made for her. Without realizing it, each sneeze she makes creates small snowmen called [...] "snowgies", which create trouble for Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting worse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking medicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold cause her to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner, and she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her. Upon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous incident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined everything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as well as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated, she ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn, which inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball {{all the way to the}} Southern Isles <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall into a pile of horse manure. Afterwards, Anna tells a now bed-ridden Elsa that she has given her the best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.|$|E
