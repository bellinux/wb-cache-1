500|$|Barker wrote {{much of the}} show's material, roughly three-quarters, again {{under the}} name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily {{involved}} with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look." [...] After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look {{through all of the}} potential material for the studio recording {{of the rest of the}} show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting [...] "People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> after so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune." [...] They took turns to play the parts which had the [...] "good lines". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: [...] "You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2008 {{during an}} {{interview}} with the Daily Mail, Lister expressed her feelings on the subject of lesbian storylines, stating: [...] "I'd definitely do a lesbian love scene in Hollyoaks. That would be a really good story." [...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when we found out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles. I think the crew were more embarrassed than we were! We were kind of ignored for the day." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} about the Kelvin murder, rather than profusely denying any involvement, Einem simply {{said that he}} wouldn't {{do such a thing}} because it would be [...] "unethical". This came across as <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> for an innocent person to say.|$|E

Some great critics say that our aboriginal music {{is the same as}} played by all primitive people world over. Chinese music itself is built on the same principle and I am planning out the composition called the evolution of music. I hope to show the growth of harmony. First, so many musicians will come out in Indian costume, play some primitive melody. Others will follow playing something more advanced, and so on until the whole band is on stage and we are rendering the best grand opera." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vinnie {{was raised}} Roman Catholic in {{southern}} Philadelphia. Although his family practiced Catholicism, Vinnie felt {{disconnected from the}} religion. In high school, {{a good friend of}} his was Muslim, and whose home he frequented often. His friend's father soon began teaching Paz about the Qur'an, which was his first foray into the new religion. As an adult, he gradually converted to Islam, and remains a Muslim to this day. In an interview with Jason Goss, Paz stated; [...] "Growing up yeah, I'm Italian and from Philly, so obviously my family is Roman Catholic. Religion and spirituality are <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>thing,</b> ya know? Most people just grow up and accept the propaganda that their parents pushed on them. Christian families produce Christian kids, Jewish families produce Jewish kids, and so on. Not many people break that mold. I just never felt any connection with Catholicism, or Christianity in general. I {{spent a lot of time}} in high school at my homeboy Arif's crib, and he came from a Muslim family. I learned a lot there from his family and I got interested in Islam through them." ...|$|E

It was <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>thing,</b> {{but it was}} less his talents and his remarkable intelligence that appealed to me, but the defects in his character. I had {{in front of me}} one of the most extraordinary men of our time; big, strong, vigorous, energetic, {{and at the same time}} clever and devious, with a spirit full of resources. [...] This audacious man wasn't afraid to show who he was.... He told me all of his accomplishments during his administrative career, leaving out nothing; he could have talked for six hours without a break, since it was his favourite subject, himself. I wasn't at all displeased.... It seemed to me that he was exactly the man I needed to fight against the ideas and prejudices of a whole school of economics, against devious people and skeptics coming from the Stock Market, against those who were not very scrupulous about their methods; he was just the man. [...] Whereas a gentleman of the most elevated spirit, cleverness, with the most straight and noble character, would inevitably fail, this vigorous athlete... full of audacity and skill, capable of opposing expedients with better expedients, traps with more clever traps, would certainly succeed. I told him about the Paris works and offered to put him in charge." ...|$|E

60|$|Then <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> happened. I {{know that}} I am {{infringing}} copyright in making that statement, but it so exactly suits the occurrence, that perhaps Mr Rider Haggard will not object. It was <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> that happened.|$|E
