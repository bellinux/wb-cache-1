5|$|At <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> Philip {{chose to}} build lembi. These were the small fast galleys {{used by the}} Illyrians. They had a single bank of oars {{and were able to}} carry 50 {{soldiers}} in addition to the rowers. With these, Philip could hope to avoid or evade the Roman fleet, preoccupied as he hoped it would be with Hannibal, and based, as it was, at Lilybaeum in western Sicily.|$|E

From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard.|$|E

5|$|In order, therefore, to {{establish}} an important point of theory, {{and at the same}} time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors, whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor, whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self-conceit, I submit the following variations which at <b>any</b> <b>rate</b> possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan. They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and probably never got closer than 160km north of Pagan. (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.|$|E

5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the only}} plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when no plan was agreed. At <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> since the Persian army had only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably a sensible strategy. Since the Persians arrived by ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the siege of Lindos earlier in the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{credence}} {{given to}} the reports was such that Pope Alexander III {{sent a letter to}} Prester John via his physician Philip on September 27, 1177. Nothing more is recorded of Philip, but it is most probable that he did not return with word from Prester John. The Letter continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times, textual analysis of the letter's variant Hebrew versions has suggested an origin among the Jews of northern Italy or Languedoc: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts. At <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> the Letters author was most likely a Westerner, though his or her purpose remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} quickly {{descended into}} a debacle. Aristagoras fell out with Megabates {{on the journey}} towards Naxos, and Herodotus says that Megabates then sent messengers to Naxos, warning the Naxians of the force's intention. It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event, {{by way of a}} justification for the subsequent failure of the campaign. At <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege, and the Persians arrived to a well-defended expedition. The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory.|$|E

5|$|Thescelosaurus has {{generally}} been allied to Hypsilophodon and other small ornithopods as a hypsilophodontid, although recognized as being distinct among them for its robust build, unusual hindlimbs, and, more recently, its unusually long skull. Peter Galton in 1974 presented one twist to the classic arrangement, suggesting that because of its hindlimb structure and heavy build (not cursorial, or built for running, by his definition), it {{should be included in}} the Iguanodontidae. This has not been followed, with Morris arguing strongly against Galton's classification scheme. At <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> Galton's Iguanodontidae was polyphyletic and not a natural group, and so would not be recognized under modern cladistic usage.|$|E
5|$|This time, the Burmese king {{received}} the imperial envoys but still refused to submit. The Burmese chronicles {{say that the}} king was so insulted {{that he had the}} envoys executed.

The newly formed Yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation, but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
40|$|Background: Urban {{and rural}} populations have {{different}} rates of psychotic illness. If psychosis exists {{as a continuous}} phenotype in nature, urban-rural population differences {{in the rate of}} psychotic disorder should be accompanied by similar differences in the rate of abnormal mental states characterized by psychotic or psychosislike symptoms. Methods: A random sample of 7076 individuals aged 18 to 64 years were interviewed by trained lay interviewers with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Approximately half of those with evidence of psychosis according to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were additionally interviewed by clinicians. We investigated associations between a 5 -level urbanicity <b>rating</b> and (1) <b>any</b> DSM-III-R diagnosis of psychotic disorder (sample prevalence, 1. 5 %), (2) <b>any</b> <b>rating</b> of hallucinations and/or delusions (sample prevalence, 4. 2 %), and (3) <b>any</b> <b>rating</b> of psychotic or psychosislike symptoms (sample prevalence, 17. 5 %). Results: Level of urbanicity was associated not only with DSM-III-R psychotic disorder (adjusted odds ratio [OR] over 5 levels, 1. 47; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 25 - 1. 72), but also, independently, with <b>any</b> <b>rating</b> of delusion and/or hallucination (adjusted OR, 1. 28; 95 % CI, 1. 17 - 1. 40; clinician-assessed psychotic symptoms only: OR, 1. 30; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 1. 64) and <b>any</b> <b>rating</b> of psychosislike symptom (adjusted OR, 1. 18; 95 % CI, 1. 13 - 1. 24). Psychotic symptoms were strongly and independently associated with psychotic disorder, regardless of the level of urbanization. Conclusions: Community level of psychotic and psychosislike symptoms may be inextricably linked to the prevalence of psychotic disorder. The prevalence of abnormal mental states that facilitate development to overt psychotic illness increases progressively with level of urbanization...|$|R

5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at <b>any</b> <b>rate</b> there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip {{engaged in a}} flurry of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, son of the Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts in exchange for their withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his absence}} from Constantinople {{at the time}} of Phocas's takeover, and because he {{retained}} a large measure of support within the soldiery, Priscus {{was the only one of}} Maurice's senior generals who was retained by the new regime, whereas Comentiolus and Peter were executed and Philippicus was banished to a monastery. A possible explanation for this comes from the later historian Paul the Deacon, who records, possibly based on early 7th-century sources, that Phocas had once served as an equerry under Priscus. At <b>any</b> <b>rate,</b> Priscus was soon counted among the main supporters of the new regime. In the winter of 602/603, he was made comes excubitorum, commander of the imperial bodyguard. In 606 or 607, he also married Phocas's daughter, Domentzia, becoming the effective heir-apparent to the sonless ruler. In the games celebrated at the Hippodrome to honor the event, however, Phocas reacted violently when he saw portraits of Priscus and Domentzia carried alongside his by the citizens. From this moment on, the chroniclers report, Priscus turned against Phocas.|$|E
