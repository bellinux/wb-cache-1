5|$|When the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces {{arrived in}} Japan—all with boots {{polished}} {{to a degree}} not known in the U.S. forces—the G.I.s were more conscious than ever of their feet. The secret was found to rest not only in spit and polish, but in the superior Australian boot polish, a commodity which was soon exchanged with the <b>Americans</b> <b>on</b> a fluctuating basis of so many packets of cigarettes for one can of Kiwi boot polish.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, {{and their}} {{followers}} traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture.

The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to surrender to the <b>Americans.</b> <b>On</b> August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E
5|$|In late July, a {{boy named}} John Billington became lost for {{some time in the}} woods around the colony.

The English organized a party to return Billington to Plymouth. The Pilgrims agreed to reimburse the Nauset for the corn which they had taken in return for the Billington boy. This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the Native Americans in the area.|$|E

5|$|U.S. officials, {{convinced}} that the British Band was hostile, mobilized a frontier militia and opened fire on a delegation from the Native <b>Americans</b> <b>on</b> May 14, 1832. Black Hawk responded by successfully attacking the militia at the Battle of Stillman's Run. He led his band to a secure location {{in what is now}} southern Wisconsin and was pursued by U.S. forces. Meanwhile, other Native Americans conducted raids against forts and settlements largely unprotected with the absence of U.S. troops. Some Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors with grievances against European-Americans took part in these raids, although most tribe members tried to avoid the conflict. The Menominee and Dakota tribes, already at odds with the Sauks and Meskwakis, supported the U.S.|$|E

5|$|While it {{received}} little {{attention from the}} mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among <b>Americans</b> <b>on</b> {{both sides of the}} political spectrum. The Anti-Defamation League, an anti-racist organization that especially covers anti-Semitism, publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games.

5|$|Beginning the 2010–11 {{season with}} the Canucks' minor league affiliate, the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL), he scored his first {{professional}} goal against the Rochester <b>Americans</b> <b>on</b> November 13, 2010. He received his first call-up to Vancouver on January 16, 2011, after injuries to Canucks defencemen Andrew Alberts and Aaron Rome.

He later recorded his first NHL point on January 24, a second assist on a Dan Hamhuis powerplay goal, the final Canucks tally in a 7–1 win against the Dallas Stars. He remained with the NHL team for an extended period as Canucks defencemen continued to suffer injuries.|$|E

In the 1930–31 season, Morenz scored 28 goals and matched his career high with 51 points, winning his second NHL scoring title, and being awarded the Hart Trophy for the second time. He was also named to the newly created NHL All-Star Team, being selected as the first-team centre, as the top player in that position. In the playoffs, the Canadiens reached the Stanley Cup Final for the second consecutive year, playing the Chicago Black Hawks. Playing with an injured shoulder and being held back by the Black Hawks, Morenz only scored one goal throughout ten playoff games, the final goal of the playoffs, as he won his third Stanley Cup with the Canadiens.|$|E

At that time, the case of Korematsu v. United States, challenging the U.S. government’s power to exclude citizens of Japanese ancestry from military zones, came before the United States Supreme Court. While the Department of Justice's Herbert Wechsler (an Assistant Attorney General) was in charge of defending the government's position before the Supreme Court, significant consultation with Fisher was required, as he was again with the legal affairs section of the War Department. During this period, Fisher was involved in critical drafting of the government's brief submitted to the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Browning {{travelled}} to the United States, {{where he}} toured airborne training facilities with his American counterpart, Major General William C. Lee. Browning's tendency to lecture the <b>Americans</b> <b>on</b> airborne warfare made him few friends among the Americans, {{who felt that}} the British were still novices themselves. Browning was envious of the Americans' equipment, particularly the C-47 Dakota transports. On returning to the United Kingdom, he arranged for a joint exercise to be conducted with the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment (2/503). In mid–September, as the 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, would take place in November. When {{he found that the}} 2/503, was to take part, Browning argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised, as the vast distances and comparatively light opposition would provide opportunities for airborne operations.|$|E
5|$|Operating near Taegu {{during the}} Battle of Taegu, {{elements}} of the U.S. Army's 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division were surrounded by North Korean troops crossing the Naktong River at Hill 303. Most of the U.S. troops were able to escape but one platoon of mortar operators misidentified North Korean troops as South Korean army reinforcements and was captured. North Korean troops held the <b>Americans</b> <b>on</b> the hill and initially tried to move them across the river {{and out of the}} battle, but they were unable to do so because of heavy counterattack. American forces eventually broke the North Korean advance, routing the force. As the North Koreans began to retreat one of their officers ordered the prisoners to be shot so they would not slow the North Koreans down.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that <b>Americans,</b> <b>on</b> average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{force of}} about 1000 men set out northward towards Prophetstown. The force {{consisted}} of about 250 army regulars from the 4th US Infantry Regiment, 100 Kentucky volunteers, and near 600 Indiana militia, including two companies of the Indiana Rangers. The army reached {{the site of}} modern Terre Haute, Indiana, on October 3, where they camped and built Fort Harrison while waiting for supplies to be delivered. A scouting party of Yellow Jackets was ambushed by Native <b>Americans</b> <b>on</b> October 10, resulting in several casualties. The Americans stopped foraging, and supplies quickly began to run low. By October 19, officers cut the rations, and the men survived on low rations until October 28, when fresh supplies arrived via the Wabash River from Vincennes. With the army resupplied, Harrison resumed his advance to Prophetstown on October 29.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{exciting}} play, Morenz {{encouraged the}} growth of the NHL, helping bring professional hockey to the United States. Watching Morenz play during the 1924 Stanley Cup Final between Montreal and Calgary, Morenz's first season in the NHL, Charles Adams, the owner of a chain of grocery stores, went back to Boston wanting a hockey team based in the city. That summer, the NHL granted Adams a franchise for the following season, the Boston Bruins. Boxing promoter Tex Rickard, owner of Madison Square Garden, also saw Morenz play early in his career and agreed to add ice to his building for an NHL team known as the New York Americans. As part of the agreement, Morenz and the Canadiens played the first game against the <b>Americans</b> <b>on</b> December 15, 1925.|$|E
