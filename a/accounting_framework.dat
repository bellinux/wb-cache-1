40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how <b>accounting</b> <b>frameworks</b> {{can affect}} three important areas of responsibility of many central banks, namely monetary policy, financial stability and banking supervision. The identified effects of accounting rules and accounting {{information on the}} activities of a central bank are manifold. First, the effectiveness of monetary policy crucially hinges on the financial independence of a central bank, which can be evidenced, inter alia, by its financial strength. Using a new simulation of the financial results of the European Central Bank (ECB), this paper shows that the reported annual profit and financial buffers of a central bank can be significantly affected by accounting, profit distribution and loss coverage rules. Second, in respect of financial stability, the <b>accounting</b> <b>frameworks</b> applied by commercial banks can not only affect their behaviour, but also that of financial markets. Indeed, {{there is evidence that}} <b>accounting</b> <b>frameworks</b> amplified pro-cyclicality during the recent crisis, and thus posed risks to the stability of the financial system. This being so, the <b>accounting</b> <b>frameworks</b> of credit institutions have obvious implications for central banks 2 ̆ 019 analyses with regard to promoting financial stability. Finally, as regards banking supervision, regulatory reporting and key supervisory ratios are based on accounting data. Under the new regulatory framework for banks in the European Union (EU), bank supervisors are highly reliant on accounting data. This means that central banks, in their role as bank supervisors, need to understand the underlying accounting rules and should directly support the development and application of high-quality <b>accounting</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{assessment}} of the International Accounting Standards (AIS) and its relationship with the Accounting Standards of United States (GAAP) and Pakistan. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand the differences between the three <b>accounting</b> <b>frameworks.</b> This will help understand the requirements for a U. S. Company to change its financial statements in accordance with the International Accounting Standards and a Pakistani Company to change its financial statements in accordance with the International or U. S. Accounting Standards. The scope of the paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of some of the major differences between the three <b>accounting</b> <b>frameworks.</b> However, it is important to point out that due to space and time limitations, this paper does not provide a complete list of differences, but addresses some of the major ones. Majority of the information provided is through secondary sources, extracted from various Internet websites of various accounting organizations like, AICPA, Asian Development Bank etc. Also, prior to writing the paper, extensive reading about IAS and U. S. GAAP was done in order to gain an overall understanding of the <b>Accounting</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Upon completion of the project, it was concluded that there is a great possibility that the U. S. Accounting Standards will eventually be eliminated or replaced by International Accounting Standards. However, prior to such a change various other regulating bodies will be required to change their rules and procedures. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
5000|$|The {{comprehensive}} <b>accounting</b> <b>framework</b> {{has several}} advantages. Tracking all the monetary flows {{taking place in}} an economy {{and the way they}} accumulate, allows for a consistent integration of the real and the financial side of the economy (for a detailed discussion see Godley and Lavoie, 2007). Furthermore, as balance sheets are updated in any period, SFC models can be used to identify unsustainable processes, for example a prolonged deficit of a sector will result in an unsustainable stock of debt. These models were used by Wynne Godley in forecasting, showing promising results. Moreover from a modelling perspective, the consistent <b>accounting</b> <b>framework</b> prevents the modellers from leaving [...] "black holes" [...] i.e., unexplained parts of the model.|$|E

40|$|This article takes a cross-disciplinary {{approach}} {{to examine how}} the current legal and <b>accounting</b> regulatory <b>frameworks</b> present problems for an equitable, orderly administration of the insolvent company within a corporate group. It is proposed that the Australian legal and <b>accounting</b> <b>frameworks</b> do not provide specific, systematic solutions for ongoing operation of corporate groups and also their administration in liquidation. Further, that corporate, legal and accounting regulation are closely intertwined but lack consonance. The discrepancies between legal and accounting regulation have an adverse impact on the relevance and usefulness of financial information, particularly when insolvency strikes. Suggested reforms include explicit recognition of corporate groups in the Corporations Law, joint development of common precepts within law and accounting regulation, and statutory provisions facilitating a group solution {{in the event of}} insolvency...|$|R
