5|$|In the two out {{of three}} falls tag team match, Crush and Smash {{represented}} Demolition against the team of Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart.

Well rested, Ax used his power to control the match against Hart. Ax and Smash traded places again, but the Legion of Doom appeared and pulled Ax out from under the ring. With Smash distracted, Hart and Neidhart were able to tackle Crush and pin him to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
