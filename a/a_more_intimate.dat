5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on. Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself {{in order to}} create what he believed was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
5|$|The hoot is a short, soft {{call and}} is {{another form of}} contact call. It is <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> call than the wail and is used {{exclusively}} between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This call is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E
5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E

Stefani's recent partnership with MasterCard allowed her to create a concert experience for her fans in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> setting, as she did not perform in large concert venues.

5|$|Dexter captures Jaworski, {{who admits}} his guilt and {{explains}} {{that he has no}} remorse for his act. After killing Jaworski, Dexter drives to see Rita, but is sidetracked when he sees a refrigerated truck. Dexter follows the truck, and the driver throws a severed head at Dexter's car. When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> level, under the impression that this is what Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's head on his refrigerator door. Inside the freezer, he finds the other parts of the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962. Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, plastering and limewashing of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and heating systems, and minor work on the organ. The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a vestry, toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached boiler house, and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness of the altar from the congregation, a second altar was erected between the parclose screens (extensions forward from {{the ends of the}} rood screen) to enable <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> celebration of the Eucharist. St Nicholas was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.|$|E

5|$|The Musée {{des arts}} décoratifs (Museum of Decorative arts) {{is on the}} ground floor. It was {{established}} in its current form in the years 1920–1924, when the collections of the Kunstgewerbe-Museum Hohenlohe, originally established in 1887, were relocated in the stables wing adjacent to the palace apartments. The collections had previously been in the Renaissance former municipal slaughterhouse Grandes Boucheries or Große Metzig, which now hosts the Musée historique de Strasbourg.) The Musée des arts décoratifs suffered in the World War II bombing raids of 1944 but the building has since been restored and the collections replenished. Besides the furniture and decoration of the cardinals' apartments, the collections focus on the local production of porcelain (Strasbourg faience), silver-gilt, and clockmaking, with original parts of the medieval Strasbourg astronomical clock including the automaton rooster from 1354. The reconstructed living room of a former hôtel particulier, the 1750s Hôtel Oesinger, displays 18th-century furniture in situ on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> scale than the rooms of the palace.|$|E
5|$|When {{the shuffle}} format was introduced, the Hot Seats and {{corresponding}} monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium, and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> feel.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's last sonatas mark a {{distinct}} change of compositional style from his earlier piano sonatas, with several important differences. The typical movement length has increased, {{due to the}} use of long, lyrical, fully rounded-off, ternary-form themes, the insertion of development-like passages within expositions, and the lengthening of the development section proper. Texturally, the orchestral grandeur of the middle-period sonatas gives way to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> writing that resembles a string ensemble. New textures appear in the last sonatas – scale-like melodic elements, free counterpoint, free fantasia, and simple accompanimental patterns such as Alberti bass, repeated chords, and ostinati; the orchestral unison texture, abundant in the preceding sonatas, has disappeared. The harmonic language has also changed: more distant key relationships are explored, longer modulatory excursions, more major/minor shifts of mode, and more chromatic and diverse harmonic progressions and modulations, using elements such as the diminished seventh chord. In general, the last sonatas seem to enact a return to an earlier, more individual and intimate Schubertian style, here combined with the compositional craftsmanship of Schubert's later works.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the new stadium was set to be approximately 50,000 seats made by Ducharme Seating.

This was partially the result of San Francisco's failure to secure a bid for the 2012 Olympics, which would have featured a renovated Stanford Stadium as the main Olympic Venue.|$|E
25|$|Boulez wrote {{a series}} of pieces which used the {{potential}} developed at IRCAM electronically to transform sound in real time.

He also revised earlier works: Notations I-IV (transcriptions for large orchestra of short piano pieces from 1945) were premiered by Daniel Barenboim and the Orchestre de Paris in 1980; and in the 1980s he radically re-worked his cantata on poems by René Char, Le Visage nuptial (1946).|$|E

25|$|In particular, the Crimean War (1853–56) stimulated {{public concern}} over Victoria's defences, and after {{protracted}} discussions, reports and inquiries, Captain (later General Sir) Peter Scratchley of the British Army arrived in Victoria in 1859 to advise {{on the development}} of the Colony's coastal defences. His recommendations included a proposal to construct four large batteries of guns at the entrance to Port Phillip, and suggested Shortland Bluff as the site for one of these batteries.

25|$|Carl Gawboy, {{a modern-day}} Ojibwe artist, speculates that Johnson's time with Bonga and his mixed-race family (Bonga had an Ojibwe wife {{as well as}} mother) changed his {{approach}} to painting.

In his drawings and paintings, Johnson portrayed Ojibwe people in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> and relaxed manner than was usual for paintings of that period. Also unusual was that he often included the subject's names in the titles of the works. He did not focus solely on individual portraits, but also did paintings and sketches of scenes which include Ojibwe dwellings, St. Louis bay, and other groupings of Ojibwe in everyday activities.|$|E
25|$|French artists {{developed}} the rococo {{style in the}} 18th century, as <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>intimate</b> imitation of old baroque style, {{the works of the}} court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, {{the first half of the}} 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first Romanticism with Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, and Realism with Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet, a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism.|$|E
