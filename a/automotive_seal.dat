40|$|AbstractDeep {{drawing is}} a forming {{process in which}} a blank of sheet metal is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch and converted to required shape. Deep drawing involves complex material flow conditions and force distributions. Radial drawing stresses and tangential compressive stresses are induced in flange region due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses result in wrinkling phenomenon in flange region. Normally blank holder is applied for restricting wrinkles. Tensile stresses in radial direction initiate thinning in the wall region of cup. The thinning results into cracking or fracture. The finite element method is widely applied worldwide to simulate the deep drawing process. For real-life simulations of deep drawing process an accurate numerical model, {{as well as an}} accurate description of material behavior and contact conditions, is necessary. The finite element method is a powerful tool to predict material thinning deformations before prototypes are made. The proposed innovative methodology combines two techniques for prediction and optimization of thinning in <b>automotive</b> <b>sealing</b> cover. Taguchi design of experiments and analysis of variance has been applied to analyze the influencing process parameters on Thinning. Mathematical relations have been developed to correlate input process parameters and Thinning. Optimization problem has been formulated for thinning and Genetic Algorithm has been applied for optimization. Experimental validation of results proves the applicability of newly proposed approach. The optimized component when manufactured is observed to be safe, no thinning or fracture is observed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis and the {{associated}} project explore lean automation strategies for high volume, high complexity manufacturing systems. In particular, we study how to reduce the footprint and cost of an <b>automotive</b> <b>sealing</b> line, while maintaining current levels of production, maintainability and safety. The key challenge researched in this thesis concerns how to reduce space requirements and cost of a highly automated facility without sacrificing system maintainability, safety or throughput. For this study, any solution must utilize currently available technology. The thesis will review the basic research, concept development, layout development and solution refinement activities that lead to a final concept and recommendation. The key findings for this study include three strategies {{that led to a}} lower cost footprint that consumed less space. These strategies are: " Intelligent reduction of conveyance systems "Increased system flexibility" Increased automation density Additionally the study highlights how these strategies complement each other when addressing cost and space reduction challenges. In this particular study the three strategies yielded space savings of approximately 33 % and capital cost savings of about 10 %. by Peter Evan Kimball. Thesis: M. B.

Unique performance properties {{in the areas of}} weather resistance, high physical properties and processability are attributed to the seals which are mostly a combination of solid and foamed materials.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} concern with the acoustic environment within automotive vehicles, there is an interest in measuring the acoustical properties of <b>automotive</b> door <b>seals.</b> These systems {{play an important role}} in blocking external noise sources, such as aerodynamic noise and tire noise, from entering the passenger compartment. Thus, it is important to be able to conveniently measure their acoustic performance. Previous methods of measuring the ability of seals to block sound required the use of either a reverberation chamber, or a wind tunnel with a special purpose chamber attached to it. That is, these methods required the use of large and expensive facilities. A simpler and more economical desktop procedure is thus needed to allow easy and fast acoustic measurement of <b>automotive</b> door <b>seals.</b> In the present work, a desktop, four-microphone, square cross-section standing wave tube was modified by the addition of a new sample holder to make it possible to measure the transmission loss of door seals under various states of compression. In this new procedure, the sample is clamped between a sliding piston and one wall of the standing wave tube. Since the clamp partially blocks the channel, thus impacting the measured transmission loss, a correction is necessary to determine the transmission loss of the seal by itself. Therefore, an initial set of measurements was performed to identify the correction factor required to adjust the measured transmission loss of the clamp plus seal to eliminate the contribution of the clamp itself. Once the accuracy of the correction procedure was verified, a number of typical door seals were tested at various degrees of compression. The transmission losses of the seals were generally in excess of 30 dB, and the transmission loss was found to increase significantly as the seals were compressed. The latter point, in particular, indicates that careful design of the seal mounting arrangements in the vehicle is crucial to ensuring their optimal performance...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{its special}} traits, rubber {{has been used}} {{extensively}} for over decades in damping, <b>automotive</b> and <b>sealing</b> applications. In certain applications, rubber is not only subjected to fluctuating loading but also exposure to aggressive liquids. Under cyclic loading conditions, both dry and swollen rubber exhibit strong inelastic responses portrayed by the stress softening owing to Mullins effect. These inelastic responses are believed to affect the durability analysis and hence, it becomes an essential consideration when performing the analysis. In this study, a simple phenomenological approach is developed by extending the concept of pseudo-elastic model. In order to investigate the effect of swelling on the stress softening owing to Mullins effect, the swollen rubbers are obtained by immersing them in biodiesel {{at room temperature for}} two different immersion durations: 1 and 2 weeks. The resulting inelastic response, particularly stress softening, is investigated. The experimental data obtained are then treated to implement the concept of pseudo-elastic in modelling the stress-strain response of both dry and swollen rubber. Results show that the proposed model agrees qualitatively well with the experimental observations...|$|R

The cable is flexible and suited to applications where regular cable movement is required such as in the mining industry.|$|R

The objective function in optimizing process was obtained from results of the mud slurry test, which is one of many tests for evaluating performance of wheel bearing. After the mud slurry test for the four models which have the similar cross-sectional shape, we measured the wear area of the seal lip and the moisture content in grease. The objective function has been chosen by comparing the results of mud slurry test and characteristics of seal lip, such as contact force, contact area, contact pressure, and interference.

40|$|Induction heating is {{a heating}} method for {{electrically}} conductive materials that {{takes advantage of}} the heat generated by the Eddy currents originated by means of a varying magnetic field. Since Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction in 1831, this phenomena has been widely studied in many applications like transformers, motors or generators' design. At the turn of the 20 th century, induction started to be studied as a heating method, leading to the construction of the first industrial induction melting equipment by the Electric Furnace Company in 1927. At first, the varying magnetic fields were obtained with spark-gap generators, vacuum-tube generators and low frequency motor-generator sets. With the emergence of reliable semiconductors in the late 1960 's, motor-generators were replaced by solid-state converters for low frequency applications. With regard to the characterization of the inductor-workpiece system, the first models used to understand the load's behavior were based on analytical methods. These methods were useful to analyze the overall behavior of the load, but they were not accurate enough for a precise analysis and were limited to simple geometries. With the emergence of computers, numerical methods experienced a tremendous growth in the 1990 's and started to be applied in the induction heating field. Nowadays, the development of commercial softwares that allow this type of analysis have started to make the use of numerical methods popular among research centers and enterprises. This type of softwares allow a great variety of complex analysis with high precision, consequently diminishing the trial and error process. The research realized in last decades, the increase in the utilization of numerical modeling and the appearance and improvement of semiconductor devices, with their corresponding cost reduction, have caused the spread of induction heating in many fields. Induction heating equipments can be found in many applications, since domestic cookers to high-power aluminum melting furnaces or <b>automotive</b> <b>sealing</b> equipments, and {{are becoming more and more}} popular thanks to their easy control, quick heating and the energy savings obtained. The present thesis focuses on the application of induction heating to wire heating. The wire heating is a continuous heating method in which the wire is continuously feeding the heating inductor. This heating method allows high production rates with reduced space requirements and is usually found in medium to high power industrial processes working 24 hours per day. The first chapters of this study introduce the induction heating phenomena, its modeling and the converters and tanks used. Afterwards, a multichannel converter for high-power and high-frequency applications is designed and implemented with the aim of providing modularity to the converter and reduce the designing time, the production cost and its maintenance. Moreover, this type of structure provides reliability to the system and enables low repairing times, which is an extremely interesting feature for 24 hours processes. Additionally, a software phase-locked loop for induction heating applications is designed and implemented to prove its flexibility and reliability. This type of control allows the use of the same hardware for different applications, which is attractive for the case of industrial applications. This phase-locked loop is afterwards used to design and implement a load-adaptative control that varies the references to have soft-switching according to load's variation, improving converter's performance. Finally, the modeling of a continuous induction wire hardening system is realized, solving the difficulty of considering the mutual influence between the thermal, electromagnetic and electric parameters. In this thesis, a continuous process is modeled and tested using numerical methods and considering converter's operation and influence in the process. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Lay down of {{viscoelastic}} fluids {{is common}} in several manufacturing processes. In the <b>automotive</b> industry, <b>sealing</b> material is sprayed onto the vehicle body to prevent water leakage into cavities and to reduce noise. To predict the deposition and lower the environmental impact by reducing material consumption, a detailed physical understanding of the process is important. In this work the resulting surface multi-phase flow is modeled and simulated in IBOFlow, the in-house multi-phase flow solver at the Fraunhofer-Chalmers Centre. In the solver the two phase flow is modelled by the volume of fluid method and the viscoelastic fluid by a general Carreu rheology model. In the solver the scanned or CAD geometry is handled by the hybrid immersed boundary method and the material interface is resolved by the adaptive anisotropic octree grid. The resulting hanging octree and triangular nodes along the geometry are automatically handled by the immersed boundary method. To boost the computational performance the simulation domain is in a novel way dynamically divided into an active and an inactive part. The governing equations are only assembled and solved for in the active part, which {{is determined by the}} local position of the injection nozzle. The interface between the active and the inactive cells are handled by symmetry boundary conditions and the pressure is always set for a point inside the active domain. The sealing lay down simulation is successfully validated for a number of real sealing beads on a plate and on a Volvo V 40 vehicle. Finally, the importance of resolving the nozzle in the simulation is investigated for a static case...|$|R
50|$|Unlike later {{portable}} computers from Apple and other manufacturers, the {{battery is charged}} in series with the supply of power to the computer. If the battery can no longer hold a charge, then the computer cannot run on AC power and hence it will not boot. The main {{reason for this is}} that the original power supply had a very low output. This is also why in many instances the special low-power hard drive would not spin up. Several popular unauthorized workarounds were devised, including to use the power supply from the PowerBook 100 Series which provides a higher output. As with <b>automotive</b> batteries, the <b>sealed</b> lead acid cells used in the Portable failed if they were fully discharged. The batteries are no longer manufactured and it is very rare to find an original battery that will hold charge and allow the computer to start. It is possible to repack the battery with new cells, or use alternative 6 V batteries. There were three lead-acid cells inside the battery; each were manufactured by Gates Energy Products (now EnerSys) and they were also used in Quantum 1 battery packs for photographic flash use.|$|R
