40|$|Muscle {{activity}} patterns (motor patterns) of the jaw musculature of all vertebrates {{studied to}} date (primarily fishes and amniotes) vary considerably when they feed on {{different types of}} prey. Previous data on buccal pressure patterns suggested that feeding in the aquatic salamander, <b>Ambystoma</b> <b>mexicanum</b> (Shaw), is highly stereotyped. This hypothesis was tested by quantifying the motor pattern used during feeding on two prey types: earthworms and guppies. Twenty-nine variables were measured from the activity pattern of six cranial muscles in the feeding mechanism of <b>Ambystoma</b> <b>mexicanum.</b> These variables included the area under the electromyogTam of each muscle, relative muscle onset times, and the amplitudes and durations of muscle bursts. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses demonstrate that the feeding motor pattern of <b>Ambystoma</b> <b>mexicanum</b> is stereotyped and does not change with prey type, in contrast to motor patterns of other vertebrates studied to date. Individual salamanders use significantly different motor patterns from one another during feeding, but do not alter their motor pattern during feeding on different prey...|$|R

Population declines have been documented for several species where {{it is evident that}} their habitat is being destroyed or modified. However, other species which inhabit pristine areas are declining as well. It has been suggested that the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (B. d.) {{may be one of the}} causes of the enigmatic declines in Mexico. We surveyed a total of 45 localities, in 12 states across Mexico, examining a total of 360 specimens representing 14 genera and 30 species. We also examined 91 specimens of <b>Ambystoma</b> <b>mexicanum</b> from a captive population in Mexico City as well as one Pachymedusa dacnicolor obtained in a pet shop. We used a two-tiered technique to detect the pathogen. For wild-caught specimens, we utilized light microscopy to identify presence of B. d. sporangia in amphibian skin. Then, to verify the infection, we used a quantitative real-time PCR assay on collected skin sections which is specific for B. d. For captive animals, we used a nonlethal version of the real-time PCR technique. We found evidence of B. d. infection in 111 animals comprising 14 species in 13 localities.

40|$|<b>Ambystoma</b> <b>mexicanum</b> is an {{amphibian}} {{endemic to}} Xochimilco Lake in Mexico City. It {{has been declared}} in danger of extinction and is under special protection. Some chemical contaminants in the water are extremely high and could {{be the cause of}} its high mortality rate in certain areas of Xochimilco. In order to preserve this species it will not only be necessary and fundamental to prohibit fishing axolotls in their natural state, a market study and nutritional chemical analysis will also be necessary in order to establish the organoleptic properties and level of acceptance before a taste panel; that is to say, get {{to know more about the}} specie in order to give the product added value offering its meat as an unconventional delicacy. This way the creation of farms that will help its conservation will be justified. On the other hand it is important to mention that the axolotls are very important in scientific research. Since it serves as an amphibious model for many physiological and morphological processes that explain the regenerative process that this species possess.

During the first weeks of development, when mortality is the highest, <b>Ambystoma</b> <b>mexicanum</b> depends on a diet of zooplankton. The aim {{of this study was to}} check whether contamination levels in lake Xochimilco influence zooplankton consumption by similar size classes of A. mexicanum and Oreochromis niloticus. In this study, we analysed changes in the functional responses and prey preference of A. mexicanum and larval Tilapia in two media, one with filtered lake Xochimilco water and another one with reconstituted water. As prey we used cladocerans (Moina macrocopa, Alona glabra, Macrothrix triserialis and Simocephalus vetulus) and ostracods (Heterocypris incongruens). Zooplankton was offered in 5 different densities, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 ind. /mL. Prey consumption by A. mexicanum varied in relation to the species offered and age of the larvae. From the first week to the eighth week prey consumption by A. mexicanum increased by 57 %. Our functional response tests showed that regardless of the prey type, prey consumption by A. mexicanum was lower in the contaminated water from lake Xochimilco. Among the zooplankton offered in the contaminated environment predators preferred smaller and slower moving microcrustaceans such as Alona glabra and Heterocypris incongruens. Furthermore, O. niloticus preferred prey such as Moina macrocopa and Macrothrix triserialis in the contaminated medium and was more voracious than the axolotl. Our results indicate that both water quality of the lake and the presence of the more resistant exotic fish adversely impact the survival of this endangered amphibian. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of cultured neural crest cells of <b>Ambystoma</b> <b>mexicanum</b> and Xenopus laevis in dc electrical fields was studied. In fields of 1 - 5 V/cm, isolated or confluent cells retract both their anode- and cathode-facing margins. Subsequently, the cells elongate, with protrusive activity confined to their narrow ends. In larger fields (greater {{than or equal}} to 5 V/cm), protrusions form on the cathode-facing sides of the perpendicularly oriented cells. The cells then begin migrating laterally, perpendicular to their long axes, towards the cathode. We suggest that the perpendicular alignment and cathode-directed migrations result from cytoskeletal changes mediated by modified ion fluxes through the anode-facing (hyperpolarized) and cathode-facing (depolarized) cell membranes. The breaking of cellular confluence in response to dc electric fields is also discussed...|$|R

As yet, {{little is known about}} the efficacy of MS 222 (tricaine methanesulfonate), which is the most commonly used anesthetic agent in amphibians. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the anesthetic effects and physiological changes in adult axolotls following a 20 -minute immersion bath, containing progressive MS 222 concentrations starting at 0. 1 %. Depth of anesthesia and physiological changes were evaluated every 15 minutes post-MS 222 exposure with the following parameters: righting behavior, withdrawal reflex, acetic acid test response, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation, as well as cloacal and body surface temperatures. A 20 -minute exposure in a 0. 1 % MS 222 immersion bath (n= 6 animals) had no anesthetic effects on adult axolotls after 20 minutes of exposure. With a 0. 2 % MS 222 solution, all axolotls (n= 9) were deeply anesthetized at 15 minutes, and 80 % were still unresponsive at 30 minutes postexposure. Blood oxygen saturation and heart rate were slightly, but significantly, increased when compared with the baseline value and remained stable up to recovery. There was no significant increase in surface and cloaca temperatures, compared with baseline. With the 0. 4 % MS 222 solution, the duration of anesthesia lasted for 90 minutes to at least 120 minutes (n= 3 animals) and this concentration was deemed too high.

40|$|Abstract The Mexican axolotl, <b>Ambystoma</b> <b>mexicanum,</b> {{carries the}} naturally-occurring {{recessive}} mutant gene 'c' {{that results in}} a failure of homozygous (c/c) embryos to form hearts that beat because of an absence of organized myofibrils. Our previous {{studies have shown that}} a noncoding RNA, Myofibril-Inducing RNA (MIR), is capable of promoting myofibrillogenesis and heart beating in the mutant (c/c) axolotls. The present study demonstrates that the MIR gene is essential for tropomyosin (TM) expression in axolotl hearts during development. Gene expression studies show that mRNA expression of various tropomyosin isoforms in untreated mutant hearts and in normal hearts knocked down with double-stranded MIR (dsMIR) are similar to untreated normal. However, at the protein level, selected tropomyosin isoforms are significantly reduced in mutant and dsMIR treated normal hearts. These results suggest that MIR is involved in controlling the translation or post-translation of various TM isoforms and subsequently of regulating cardiac contractility. </p...|$|R
