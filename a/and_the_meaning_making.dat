Developing effective methodologies for examining real time cognition and action, and the relationship between embodiment, interaction and learning is challenging. This paper draws on multimodality, with its emphasis on examining the use of multiple semiotic resources for meaning making, to examine the differential use of semiotic resources by pairs of students interacting with a tangible learning environment. Specifically the analysis details the role of body position, gaze, manipulation and speech in shaping interaction. The analysis illustrates the interaction between these modes and ‘multimodal action flow’, particularly in terms of pace, rhythm and interaction structure, and the implications of this for interaction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> process...|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of life story narratives in adolescence is facilitated by co-constructed reminiscing, in which caregivers use discussion, comparison, {{and analysis of}} inner motivation to guide reflection about past events and create narratives that explain situations and behavior. This helps adolescents {{develop an understanding of}} the relationship between the [...] "self" [...] of <b>the</b> past <b>and</b> their personal narrative in the present. [...] An interesting finding from adolescent research shows more semantic stories increase and become more meaningful in a child's life. When a child, especially a boy, makes stronger semantic connections in early adolescence, he has a worse sense of well-being, but as he moves to late adolescence his well-being increases. the large jump in cognitive learning during adolescence allows this change to take place. Since this is a very important time for children to expand their social groups and conversational constructs, more semantic narratives can be created <b>and</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> construct to develop.|$|R

It {{is argued that}} nursing practice is a complex, context-specific, activity {{and needs to be}} studied using methods that do not assume an objective, context-free reality. The work of Patricia Benner (1984) guided this study which utilised a qualitative research approach to enter the lived world of nursing practice. Through descriptions of work days and a sharing of clinical exemplars, an understanding of the broader context of nursing practice was gained, areas of skilled performance in nursing emerged, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of <b>making</b> a difference for the nurses in the study examined. The central role of mutual advice and support in facilitating significant incidents in practice was apparent.

Drawing on these developments, this chapter {{will focus on the}} creative potential, within business, for narrative models developed in the field of screenwriting. The latter is an area of creative writing that focuses particularly on story structure. It has produced a range of normative narrative models that recur as the underpinning templates of film and television narratives. The most well known of these is perhaps Christopher Vogler’s reworking of Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey. Taking this text as my starting point, this chapter discusses the particular implications of the use of the Hero’s journey narrative model in a business context, examining the power of narrative retelling <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> possibilities and limitations of different narrative models...|$|E

We report three themes which illustrate the contested and negotiated order of the clinical explanation: anchoring, resistance and normalisation. We show using the theory of social representations how the social order in the physiotherapy consultation is maintained, contested and rearticulated. We highlight the importance of agency in patients’ ability to resist the clinical explanation and in turn shape the clinical discourse within the consultation. Social representations offer insights into how the world is viewed by different individuals, in our case physiotherapists and patients with sciatic pain symptoms. The negotiation about the diagnosis reveals the malleable and socially constructed nature of pain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> process underpinning it.

50|$|Characteristics of a {{narrative}} were defined as early as Aristotle in his Poetics under plot. He called plot as the “first principle” or the “soul of a tragedy.” According to him, plot is the arrangement of incidents that imitate the action with a beginning, middle, and end. Plot includes introduction of characters, rising action and introduction of complication, development of complication, climax (narrative), and final resolution. As described by White (1981) and Martin (1986), plot involves a structure of action. However, not all narratives contain a plot. Fragmentation occurs as the traditional plot disappears, narratives become less linear, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> burden of <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> gets shifted from the narrator to the reader.|$|R
40|$|The idea {{of musical}} signification has been {{implicit}} {{for a long}} time in writings on music, but only during the last decades it has established itself as an explicit discipline. Focussing mainly on sense-making as a major constituent of signification and meaning, it addresses major open questions, which are still pending: What is musical semiotics? What is the relation of musical semiotics to musicology? Should we deal with a tension between an object-centered approach to music and a subjective, cognitive, and hermeneutic approach to musical sense-making? Is there a distinction in contents and methodology or is it possible to bring together <b>the</b> objective <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subjective, <b>the</b> artwork <b>and</b> <b>the</b> receiver, <b>the</b> immanent <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attributed <b>meaning?</b> <b>Making</b> sense of music is an attempt to bring together these diverging claims. Revolving around the central concept of musical sense-making, it includes 31 contributions by scholars from 18 countries, from the USA to Russia, from Brazil to China, which encompass semiotic musical analysis and phenomenological, hermeneutic, and/or cognitive approaches. The contributions investigate classical music, contemporary music, folk and ethno, opera and song, as well as music theory, education, and transmediality. nrpages: 412 status: accepte...|$|R

This article was written {{to reflect on the}} specific role of artefacts as research-related “source material” in the museum. It represents the author’s struggle to narrate a comprehensive interpretation about this theme, as member of the team project “The museum, <b>the</b> exhibition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> visitors: <b>Meaning</b> <b>making</b> in a new arena for learning and communication”, financed by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet). The theme of this present article is therefore <b>the</b> musealized objects <b>and</b> <b>the</b> notion that these artefacts represent resources to cultural analyses and historical knowledge. A leading hypothesis is the concept that postmodern de-constructivism during the late twentieth century has changed our perspective on the artefact from a more or less neutral vessel for historic and cultural knowledge to a multidimensional medium. This has an ongoing impact on archaeological and cultural museum exhibitions. The article discusses what kind of impact the “cultural turn” has on present-day exhibitions.

40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{analyzes the}} characteristics of communication work in a call centre, by examining the communication work at a Swedish call centre which is outsourced to Latvia. The thesis studies {{the ways in which}} communication with the customers is organized, carried out and assigned meaning. Theoretically, the thesis draws on both critical and management-oriented perspectives of work. The empirical investigation combines participant observations at the call centre with individual interviews, mainly conducted with operators and management staff. The communication work is analyzed both as labour and as communicative activity. The concept of labour focuses upon the relation between employer and employee. Therefore, the analysis is placed within the framework of a capitalistic production system, through a survey of the economic and the organisational working conditions. The communicative activity deals with how the telephone conversations with the customers are enacted. In that part of the analyses, the working routines <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> practices are illuminated. As examined in the current research, the communication work is indeed constructed in an alienated manner, through high levels of standardization, immobility, and estrangement from both customers and the customers’ culture. Nonetheless, merely being employed has meant significant economic security for the operators of the Latvian call centre. The operators are incumbents of a society affected by deep economic crises with high unemployment rates. In relation to their broader society, the employees have found meaning within their immediate social situation. This may explain why they endure the monotonous work with few opportunities for development...|$|E
40|$|Preservice teachers' {{perceptions}} of their learning, reading, and teaching in an experientially designed course, Children's Literature in the Classroom, {{is the focus of}} this study. Qualitative methods included data sources such as initial student surveys, written early literacy memories, audiotaped and transcribed discussions of children's and adolescent literature, mid-term and final self-evaluations, audiotaped and transcribed exit interviews, and various written artifacts created throughout the semester. Several levels of data analysis were used to discover answers to the following questions: What do preservice teachers view as the purpose of this course for themselves personally and professionally? What role do they see literature playing in learning, reading, and teaching? What class experiences were most significant to students? What are preservice teachers' {{perceptions of}} themselves and children as learners, readers, and teachers? Each question was extended by also examining the new understandings that were constructed during the many transactions within the semester. The findings of the study emphasized the positive learning experiences within the constructivist framework of this course. Concerning the purpose of the course and children's literature, class members gained a knowledge base in children's literature and an understanding through experience of the purpose and implementation of literature in the classroom. The most significant course aspect was stated as literature discussion groups. Reasons given for this included the personal experiences shared, the various understandings of literature through diverse responses, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> about text and life that transpired. As learners, preservice teachers developed a greater understanding of the complexities of learning as well as professional knowledge about literature and its use. As readers, they discovered new insights into the reading process, and for many a renewed love of reading emerged. As teachers, they constructed new attitudes and beliefs about teaching in addition to resources and professional preparation gained from the course. Three case studies showed how class members who had very different perceptions of how they best learned were all supported in their construction of knowledge within the class...|$|E
40|$|Meaning {{represented}} {{in a text}} may further be {{represented in}} a different text. This study examines how students represent the message in song lyrics into their own texts. This study therefore examines students’ comprehension of song lyrics, the representation of their understanding of song lyrics in their own texts, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> through representational strategies. This study applied a qualitative method. The data {{of this study were}} gathered from the students’ interpretation of song lyrics through writing task. The instrument to be used in analyzing the data is a systemic functional grammar (SFG). The result shows that the students are able to interpret the meaning of the song lyrics. Having analyzed the students’ texts using transitivity, the study shows that there are different types of processes and their ways applied in the texts. The finding shows that the differences occur in the use of processes and their functions. There are three dominant processes that appear in the students’ text in representing their interpretation of both songs, i. e. material, relational, and mental processes. However, there are differences in the order of their occurrences. The dominant process applied in the students’ texts of “Rolling in the deep” interpretation is material process. Then it is followed by relational process and mental process. Meanwhile, the dominant process applied in the students’ texts of “Because of you” interpretation is relational process. Then it is followed by material process and mental process. The dominant use of material processes in “Rolling in the deep” interpretation functions to show that the students’ texts describe the material processes that realized in the explicit physical action. Meanwhile, the dominant use of the relational processes in “Because of you” functions to describe the experience happening to the singer. The use of mental processes in the students’ text of both song interpretation functions to disclose mental state of the singer. Construction of interpretation in this case depends on clues from the text and probability, which is determined both by facts from texts and connotations. In relation to the meaning making through representational strategies, the three processes dominated in the students’ text synergized to build the representation of the song meaning related to the meaning which was meant by the song writer. Key words: Experiential meaning, interpretation, representation, song lyrics...|$|E

40|$|This licentiate thesis, When {{emotions}} {{are allowed to}} rule, a study on reading literature in a multicultural classroom in upper secondary school, attempts from a didactic perspective to understand literature reading in the school subject Swedish {{in the light of}} a multicultural and changing society. From a socio-cultural perspective, the study illustrates the teacher's choice of literature, the teacher's and the students' attitudes to literature, and the ways of reading that are being negotiated in the common reading and what opportunities for understanding and meaning making that are made available. The analyses are based on reception theories and have an underlying intercultural perspective. The study has been conducted in a class represented by students with many different mother tongues in the school subject Swedish during the first year at the natural science programme at an upper secondary school. The main methods are recordings of literature discussions, which have been documented by video and digital voice recorder, qualitative interviews with students and teacher, log books, and the students' novel reading logs. The empirical material is presented in two chapters. The first chapter, The conditions of the reading, focuses on the teacher's and the students' attitudes to literature and literature reading while the second chapter, The actual reading, brings forward the ways of reading that are being negotiated in the common reading of two novels in the class. The results show that there are several factors that are of importance to the understanding <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> that are made possible in the teaching of literature. The students speak about experience oriented attitudes focusing on life experiences and cultural meetings. This differs from the teacher's attitude which is focused on providing the students with language skills and literary history education. The study shows how the reading of the novel Herakles (Kallifatides 2006) results in ethic ways of reading and a rejection of the text while the reading of the optional novel leads to a subjective reading and a common interpretation from ways of reading of enjoyment. The study discusses the importance of safeguarding the students' knowledge, experiences, and emotions and of making explicit their different ways of reading as well as the different readings of the teaching. Discussed further is the need for a teaching that catches and challenges the students' general and literary repertoires from various perspectives in order to provide context and contribute to an active meaning making. The study suggests a caring way of reading, which is characterised by interpretive communities focused on openness to the foreign and different view and a reading that strives towards a cognitive, moral, and emotional understanding...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{potential}} for critical pedagogical innovation to expand student learning activity, meaning making and learning agency of first year undergraduate students. The study {{is located in a}} larger critical project. Rather than looking to support ‘unprepared’ students to better adapt to the current culture of higher education, the larger critical project looks to the generative potential of new students to elaborate the structure of higher education itself over time. The study emanates from a process of reflective self-critique of one higher education institution in South Africa serving a student population with little access to educational advantage. The emerging critique was located at the interface of institutional practice, student learning activity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> processes mediating the two domains. This critique gave birth to the pedagogical innovation at the centre of this study. The pedagogical innovation took the form of an activity system, with three sets of pedagogical tools mediating the system: tools to expand the learning practice of students, symbolic tools to expand the critical meaning making toolkit available, and tools designed to build a new learning community better aligned with interactive learning activity. This study is an intervention case study, theoretically grounded in the work of activity and socio-cultural theorists. The pedagogy was embedded within a semester long credit-bearing core course for entering first year students. The study follows the experience of the 652 students participating in the 2010 pilot experience. Upwards of 70 % of students suggest that their reading (76 %) and writing (71 %) practice had changed {{by the end of the}} course. Over 80 % indicated that the course made them better readers (85 %) and writers (84 %.) Students suggest that they read and write more and enjoy reading and writing more. They suggest that as motive expanded, activity of reading and writing expanded, complimentary activity expanded (e. g. expression and critical engagement), and participation across a number of domains expanded. Students with less historical access to educational advantage made stronger claims about the pedagogical toolkit than students with more access to educational advantage. This study suggests that under the right conditions, critical pedagogy focusing on student learning activity and meaning making can expand learning practice and meaning making of first year undergraduate students, contributing to an expanding claim on learning agency. It tentatively suggests that this type of learning architecture is well aligned for appropriation of students with less access to historical socio-educational learning privilege, but remains sensitive to the situated nature of historic disadvantage (for example, in campus sites.) The study points to the specific potential of three toolkits: toolkits to mediate expanded learning activity, toolkits to expand meaning making, and toolkits designed to directly reconstitute the learning community itself. The study concludes by extracting some lessons for critical pedagogical innovation serving first year studies into the future. It points to the importance of the domain of learning activity and meaning making, and suggests the kind of changes within the culture of higher education required to better unleash innovation in this area. It points to the generative potential of methods that better combine students and lecturers within pedagogical innovation processes. The study concludes by pointing to the relatively unoccupied area of critical research, whereby the work to expand the learning activity of first year students is aligned to the potential of students to elaborate the structure of higher education itself over time. The study points to three specific research areas: research building stronger pedagogical tools for first year students; research to better understand the critical meaning making project of students; and research to better understand the transformation of the pedagogical inheritance within higher education...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ambivalence {{has been}} a key notion that is used in most basic areas of psychology— {{research}} on perception, thinking, personality, and communication. However, its implications for pro-cesses of meaning-making have been largely overlooked. All meanings are created in the present (integrating elements of past experience) {{in relation to a}} future that can never be entirely determined at the present. We outline a developmental model of how <b>meaning</b> emerges through <b>the</b> tensions between <b>the</b> present <b>and</b> <b>the</b> future. Three trajectories can be found in this process. First, lack of ambivalence (the null condition) leads <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> production to reach a status quo and decline. Secondly, low to moderate ambivalence leads to erratic movement of starting <b>and</b> stopping of <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> through <b>the</b> production signs. These signs tentatively control <b>meaning</b> in <b>the</b> present while not constraining <b>the</b> path <b>meaning</b> may take in the future. Thirdly, maximum ambivalence leads to the emergence of "strong " signs that function to constrain the uncertainty of the future as it is becoming present. Empirical data from a microgenetic study of <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> in <b>the</b> development of young adults will be used to illustrate the model...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} street art as {{new form of}} art and {{activism}} of uncomissioned and unsanctioned artifacts including paintings, murals and various kinds of stencils, posters, and stickers applied in any public surface. As Bengtsen (2014) has argued street art is a sociocultural practice, which is performative, ephemeral, and site specific. Street art has much {{to tell us about}} the dialectics in public space, <b>the</b> cultural interaction, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> – <b>making</b> of <b>the</b> urban verbo/visual text production depending on the urban contextualization. Relying on the researcher’s own empirical data gathered during fieldwork conducted in Athens, I discuss if and how Athenian street artists reflect upon contemporary sociopolitical issues, and if and how street art has the potential to actively transform the public space into a communicative and dynamic sociopolitical arena. In particular, the always-imposed question is if and how street artifacts become historical objects with social and artistic expressions of cultural values and heritage (MacDowall 2006, 2008). If so, it is important a research to be pursued towards the cultural significance of street art with the help of digital georeferential applications. Towards this direction, an interdisciplinary study of street art based on GIS models is to be conducted. One of the main objectives of my PhD project in cognitive semiotics is to build up a digital infrastructure for restoring, protecting, analyzing and visualizing street artifacts with the implementation of GIS (Geographical Information System) technique. In fact, {{it seems to me that}} a project like this is an appropriate example of how cultural archival data despite of their ephemeral nature can be explored in new ways applying digital technology in relation with the geographical coordinates...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has produced {{evidence to suggest}} a strong reciprocal link between school context-specific language constructions that reflect a school's vision and schoolwide pedagogy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> way that <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> occurs, and a school's culture is characterized. This research was conducted within three diverse settings: one school in the Sydney Catholic Education system and two Education Queensland State schools, in Australia. Emergent from the school data is the understanding that a contextually created meaning system {{can be a powerful}} force, having a beneficial effect on, and symbiotic relationship with, school culture. Such a meaning system is not dependent on words alone. Metaphors, images, structures and processes unique to each context appear integral to <b>the</b> creation of <b>meaning</b> within each school, and how staff and students make sense of their 'life-world'. Each meaning system works at the level of establishing and reinforcing basic norms, assumptions and ways of working. The creation of such a meaning system does not happen by accident but requires nurturing. This research suggests that over time, shared understandings appear to become intuitive to some extent, and accepted ways of thinking and working become firmly embedded as school culture. ...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{nationwide}} school-feeding programme—the Mid Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) —in India as its anchor, this paper critically evaluates {{the use of}} schools as sites for discharging social policies. Data from semi structured interviews (N = 26) and focus groups (N = 8) conducted in a north Indian village provide evidence that the community distrusts <b>the</b> central <b>and</b> <b>the</b> regional governments <b>and</b> regards state run schools as deficient institutions. In such a social climate, the community perceived the MDMS as an evil governmental design to distract poor people from education. Such representations, the paper argues, further erode {{the faith of the}} community in state run schools. Crucially, data from the study indicate that the MDMS has contributed to a shift in community representations of schools from being a site for imparting education to that of an institution providing free meals. It is argued that such a shift in community representations of schools may hinder the agenda of promoting education in disadvantaged settings. The paper concludes by identifying two critical considerations in using schools as the site of social policy: (a) the symbolic environments of <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> which inform local interpretations of policies; <b>and</b> (b) <b>the</b> local <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> <b>and</b> representations that communities develop of new or existing social policies.

40|$|Research on {{preparation}} programs for student affairs professionals has {{focused primarily on}} identifying competencies. Limited {{attention has been paid}} to the process of how meaning is made of preparation program experiences. Of the scholarship conducted, minimal consideration has been paid to the relationship between development <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. The purpose of this study was to explore the process of self-authorship for graduate students within a student affairs preparation program, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environmental conditions that promoted that process. Utilizing narrative inquiry methodology (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000; Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach, & Zilber, 1998; Marshall & Rossman, 1999; Shank, 2002), data was collected through in-depth interviews of six graduates of a student affairs preparation program meeting the standards set by the Council for the Advancement of Standards (2009), <b>and</b> analyzed using <b>the</b> constant comparative method (Lieblich et al., 1998). The preparation program studied was located at a public research university in the Midwest. The results were considered in relation to constructive-developmental theory (Boes, Baxter Magolda, & Buckley, 2010), self-authorship theory (Baxter Magolda, 2001; Kegan, 1982, 1994), the environment of reference model (Conyne & Clack, 1981), the learning partnerships model (Baxter Magolda, 2004), and transition theory (Schlossberg, Waters, & Goodman, 1995). Results indicated that although movement toward self-authorship was achieved those who graduated had not fully reached self-authorship.

SAP is a theory based on axiomatics of cultural-historicalpsychology of L. S. Vygotsky and transspective analysis as a specially developedmeans to define the tendencies of science developing as a self-organizing system. Transspective analysis has revealed regularities in a constantly growing complexityof professional-psychological thinking along the course of emergence ofscientific cognition. It has proved that the field of modern psychology is shapedby theories constructed with ideation of different grades of complexity. The concept“dynamics of the paradigm of science” is introduced; it allows transitions tobe acknowledged from ordinary-binary logic characteristics of the classical scienceto a binary-ternary logic, adequate to non-classical science and then to aternary-multidimensional logic, which {{is now at the}} stage of emergence. The latteris employed in SAP construction. It involves the following basic methodologicalprinciples: the principle of directed (selective) interaction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> principle ofgenerative effect of selective interaction. The concept of “complimentary interaction”applied in natural as well as humanitarian sciences is reconsidered in thecontext of psychology. The conclusion is made that the principle of selectivity anddirectedness of interaction is relevant to the whole Universe embracing all kindsof systems including the living ones. Different levels of matter organization representingsemantic structures of various complexity use one <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same principleof <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> through which <b>the</b> Universe ensures its sustainability asa self-developing phenomenon.

40|$|This {{exhibition}} {{is a personal}} exploration into why we make objects, how we make them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> derived from <b>making.</b> This underlying foundation of making is focused {{through the lens of}} the applied sciences, specifically theoretical space exploration technologies and current, proven military objects. The {{exhibition is}} divided into two bodies of work, shown in separate, but connected rooms. There are four main methods used to create the work within the exhibition: mold making and slip casting, hand building and shaping, 3 D printing, and 3 D CNC machining. The traditional method of slip casting is used to create the currently deployed militarized objects, while the theoretical space exploration technologies are created through 3 D printing and intuitive hand building and shaping. I have created a series of hand built ceramic sculptures that correlate to scientific theories of space travel and exploration. These objects were first created with a 3 D printer, then increased in scale by hand into a ceramic medium. Also, there are slip cast, large caliber ordinance, specifically 120 mm, 30 mm and 25 mm. These are used by our contemporary military in the M 1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, A 10 Thunderbolt II close air support aircraft, and Infantry Fighting Vehicles, respectively. The goal of this body of work is to explore how people are able to create objects that perform specific tasks extremely well. <b>The</b> research <b>and</b> development of scientific objects and military objects are often very similar and it is a series of decisions, often {{out of the hands of}} the makers, that ultimately allow the object to be created <b>and</b> implemented. Whether <b>the</b> object created is militarized or remains purely scientific, the makers of these products are able to create an object that performs a specific task, within tight tolerances and quality craftsmanship.

40|$|Sporting the Nation: Gender, ”Swedishness” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Body in the Representation of Olympic Games in Swedish Popular Press 1948 – 1972. In this thesis, I study {{representations}} of {{summer and winter}} Olympic Games and Olympic athletes in six Swedish popular magazines 1948 - 1972. The purpose {{is to examine the}} forms of identity produced within the nation as an “imagined community”, in discursive processes where gender, sexuality, ”race”/ ethnicity, class and age/generation intersect and mutually construct each other. The study is inspired by feminist and postcolonial perspectives on how gender and “race”/ethnicity are upheld as socially relevant classifications through the cultural repetition of physical and mental differences. Theoretical points of departure is Foucault’s connecting of power and knowledge and Cultural Studies’ conception of representation <b>and</b> how <b>the</b> textual/visual address of the reader makes available and closes off subject-positions. ”Body” and ”nation” are used as intersectional analytical concepts, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> textual/visual <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> is identified through the techniques that I have termed dichotomisation, compensation, harmonisation, contrasting <b>and</b> connecting. <b>The</b> material is understood in relation to changing historical contexts such as “folkhemmet” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> welfare state, gender relations, global political processes of decolonisation, <b>the</b> Cold war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> radicalised political climate of the 1960 ’s. The analysis highlights how historically specific configurations of Swedish masculinity and Swedish femininity are defined not only through gender dichotomisation, but also by differentiation from – for example – communist bodies/characters or “exotic” and racialised subjects. However, “Swedishness” is not only separated from, but also connected to specific identities. The textual ”us” is located in complex and sometimes contradictory processes, through affinity with Nordic countries, the western side in <b>the</b> Cold war <b>and</b> ”white civilisation” – but also in relation to an abstract and universalistic conception of to ”the world”. The thesis points out the crucial importance of physical work for the merging of masculinity <b>and</b> nation. <b>The</b> sport activities of female athletes are downplayed through compensating markers of conventional femininity and trivialised by being constructed as playful rather than as strained and disciplined physical work. However, the analyses also illustrate the conditions for discursive destabilisations; for example in the case of Olympic medals, where <b>the</b> visual <b>and</b> textual representation of a female Swedish body at work is made possible through intersections of gender, youth or nation. Furthermore, the results show a move towards a higher degree of complexity on the issue of masculinity during the time period, whereas the cultural conception of femininity is characterised by a great degree of stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{central focus}} of this thesis is how {{professionals}} in Singapore negotiate occupational mobility in their career life-course. The research seeks to understand the factors that underpin and guide individual aspiration and motivations when making occupational moves within career trajectories. Occupational mobility is fast becoming the norm among the international skilled labour force, creating a {{need to understand how}} such flexibility can be used advantageously, at the national level, for workforce management. The approach taken in this study conceptualises the career landscape as a field, and analyses mobility at <b>the</b> political, social <b>and</b> individual levels. It examines the power that is enacted by government on its citizens <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reflexive <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> of individuals participating in occupational mobility. The empirical work consists of interviews with ex-teachers and ex-engineers in Singapore. The thesis presents an analysis of their narratives and identifies generic skills acquired in pre-employment training and in employment as a key to understanding how professional individuals are negotiating occupational fields. Amongst the achievements of the research is the understanding of what happens when individuals move from one occupation to the next. The research attempts to humanise <b>the</b> 'human resource' <b>and</b> present, through individual narratives, the individual's perspective on the changing nature of work, the need to participate in boundaryless work contexts and their involvement in occupational mobility. The thesis further illustrates the complexities that surround mobile behaviours of workers within an Asian context, and presents ways of understanding the needs of such professional workers so that they can negotiate the contemporary advanced economy landscape more effectively. The resulting conceptual framework attempts to explain how mobile Asian professional workers negotiate occupational mobility within a context that is influenced by conservative Confucian ideologies that place nation before self, and community before family. The research further emphasises the role that state-initiated lifelong learning structures play in creating <b>the</b> mobile worker <b>and</b> explores how generic skills facilitate occupational movements. It discusses the importance of contextualised skill acquisition and practice for subsequent recontextualisation in a new occupation and also aligns current career discourses to the perceptions that these individuals have of their occupations. Finally, the role that lifelong learning is perceived to play when considering the need for career adaptability competences, the space for recontextualisation of skills <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ideologies that influence individual occupational mobility are presented. By looking at those who have participated in it themselves, this research explores how individuals engage in occupational mobility and explains how control can be maintained over people's personal aspirations in the grand occupational mobility scheme.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{what happens when}} historical feature film is used in history education. The purpose of this thesis is to develop new knowledge of historical film literacy through {{a study of the}} feature film's didactical potential in an educa­tional context. This is carried out through an analysis of <b>the</b> historical <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> among upper secondary students when viewing historical feature films, and special attention is paid to the importance of emotions in <b>the</b> students' <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> through historical feature film. A focus of the study is the didactical dilemma, previously addressed in historical film research, that arises in the use of feature film in history or social studies education, in relation to educational context, film experience, <b>and</b> historical understanding. <b>The</b> present thesis is an independent continuation of my licentiate thesis History as Fiction (2014). The empirical material consists of interviews with students and teachers from two upper secondary schools in Sweden, as well as documentation from students' assessments and selected scenes from feature films experienced by the students as they were used in history class. The theoretical framework for the study takes an interdisciplinary approach. It is based on Jörn Rüsens under­standing of historical meaning and histo­ri­cal culture, as well as on transaction theory described by John Dewey and Louise M. Rosenblatt. Film reception theory is equally important, represented by theories from David Bordwell <b>and</b> Carl Plantinga. <b>The</b> main research question focused on how the concept of historical film literacy could be developed theoretically. Historical film literacy is understood in this thesis as an advanced consciousness of how historical <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> is created through the individual's transaction with film's narration in a specific context, and how <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> ideally links historical disciplinary thinking with practical orientation in life. The core of theoretically developed historical film literacy is an understanding of <b>the</b> individual's emotional <b>and</b> aesthetic experience of historical feature film, and elaborated theoretical knowledge about the close relationship between <b>the</b> affective response <b>and</b> <b>the</b> more distanced cognitive activity during and after watching a film. Also crucial for historical film literacy is an under­standing of the historical film's representation of the past as a conflation of facts <b>and</b> fiction. <b>The</b> knowledge of history that students' gain from historical feature film should be constructed in a synthesis of an aesthetic and an efferent stance in the transaction process. This is because the feature film has the capacity to stimulate both a feeling of empathy and of nearness in the viewer as well as a movement of the viewer away from <b>the</b> narration <b>and</b> towards more distanced cognition. This movement helps the viewer to analyze <b>and</b> interpret <b>the</b> historical <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> from a critical perspective, when the experience of the feature film is transformed to a reflected experience...|$|R
40|$|Teachers who {{practice}} self-reflection, particularly through narrative journals, {{report that they}} experience new ways to make meaning through perceptual transformation in how they view themselves, their work, <b>and</b> their relationships. <b>The</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>making</b> process for this personal and professional transformation is connected to how situations are perceived from a locus of control. A study of the research reported that teacher turnover rates are increasing primarily because of job dissatisfaction. A further investigation revealed this dissatisfaction was {{due to lack of}} administrative support, student behavioral problems, lack of school policy input, and low salaries. Funding for innovative instructional initiatives and professional development showed mixed results. To investigate how teachers access their personal resiliency in order to sustain motivation, quality teaching and professional commitment, this qualitative, exploratory study elicited from teachers how they made meaning of incidents through a structured journal deconstructive process. A sample of seven teachers in the Southwestern United States wrote nine journals on school-related incidents of their choice and an exit interview. Findings revealed, through this grounded theory approach and qualitative triple-coding, respondents framed their incident interpretation through the lens of inner or outer locus of control—they either framed incidents as occurring to them or from a stance of efficacy and congruence. One of the main findings was that most respondents consistently framed situations from an inner locus of control. Another finding was that this perspective transformation was reported despite a majority of stress-related journal topics. In the exit interviews, teachers expressed “gratitude” <b>and</b> “value” in <b>the</b> study process <b>and</b> indicated they would continue the practice. Three theoretical propositions emerging from this research were: The greater the inner locus of control, the stronger the level of congruence; they are mutually occurring. The mindful practice of high levels of congruent thinking has the potential to build teacher resiliency and retention. When self-reflective practice, perspective transformation, and congruent practices are implemented as the foundation for school “climate”, sustainable, systemic education reform is possible.
