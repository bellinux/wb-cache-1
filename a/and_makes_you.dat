The website RPGFan {{also gave}} it a positive review, stating that it is [...] "very well designed and {{is a lot of}} fun to play" [...] and concluding that it [...] "has a great English translation, interesting ideas <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> use your brain to solve puzzles." [...] The game maintains an 83.3% average rating on GameRankings, pooling reviews from 14 separate online sources.|$|E
500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{speaks of}} a love that never dies. According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad {{point in your life}} and {{somebody}} comes in <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the religious themes, the cruel way in which Damien is treated by the other children is a satire on the tendency of schoolchildren to relentlessly pick on new students. Stone said of {{this aspect of the}} episode, [...] "The whole basis of South Park was that kids are little shitheads and civilization and society controls them. Instead of what a lot of hippies and Democrats think, which is we're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us. We believe the first way, that society controls you <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> a better person, ultimately, because when you're little, you're just a little asshole." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Cowboy Style" [...] {{was written}} by Minogue, Steve Anderson and Dave Seaman, {{and was one of}} the first songs {{composed}} for the album. Minogue wrote the song prior to being in a relationship with French photographer Stephane Sednaoui with different lyrical context, but it was completed while she was dating. Of the song, Minogue said [...] "the way you start a new relationship with someone, they can bring out so many emotions within you <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> question yourself a bit more." [...] The title [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] comes from when she first met Sednaoui in person, where she recalled him looking [...] "unusual" [...] and felt like he was [...] "the new cowboy coming into town".|$|E
500|$|After the song's bridge, one of {{the women}} makes plans of reuniting with her former boyfriend, but is stopped by Lipa, who gives her the advice she {{received}} {{at the beginning of the}} visual. After this, the group perform a choreography in front of the pool, in which they pull [...] "each other in closer, in an unbreakable ring of limbs". This is Lipa and Scholfield's favorite scene, with the latter stating, [...] "That wrapped up the whole story for me. The viewer is on the outside, but that choreography pulls you into them, <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> a part of that connection, too." [...] The video ends with the women standing in front of the pool, with the camera turning upside-down and then showing a group of flamingos at the same location.|$|E
500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{was created}} by indie {{developer}} Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family. [...] The game's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights; Rohrer created it partially as an [...] "artistic statement" [...] on defending one's family through violence. He summarized his goals with the game as creating something [...] "that makes you feel violated <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> want to protect stuff that’s yours, and puts you {{in the process of}} securing what’s yours." [...] However, he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocritical—since they are invading others' homes as well—was partially intentional and an [...] "elegant" [...] idea.|$|E

500|$|The bands Clock DVA, Nocturnal Emissions, Whitehouse, Nurse with Wound, and SPK soon followed. Whitehouse {{intended}} to play [...] "the most brutal and extreme music of all time", a style they eventually called power electronics. An early collaborator with Whitehouse, Steve Stapleton, formed Nurse with Wound, who experimented with noise sculpture and sound collage. Clock DVA described their goal as borrowing equally from surrealist automatism and [...] "nervous energy sort of funk stuff, body music that flinches you <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> move." [...] 23 Skidoo, like Clock DVA, merged industrial music with African-American dance music, but also performed {{a response to}} world music. Performing at the first WOMAD Festival in 1982, the group likened themselves to Indonesian gamelan. Swedish act Leather Nun, were signed to Industrial Records in 1978, being the first non-TG/Cazazza act to have an IR-release. Their singles eventually received significant airplay in the United States on college radio.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} both written and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays the part of Toby Flenderson on the show. In the episode, Jim refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms. Jim and Pam ("JandP2") post a review, which can be seen on the actual reviews page. It reads: [...] "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff’s attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Keenan {{surfaced}} {{under the}} name [...] "Puscifer" [...] for the song [...] "REV 22:20" [...] on the Underworld film soundtrack. Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with Danny Lohner, who had formerly performed live with Nine Inch Nails, but has since been formed {{as a manifestation of}} Keenan's [...] "creative subconscious"—meaning that Keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work. Keenan has stated that it is [...] "a premiere improvisational hardcore band", and his [...] "catch-all, stream of consciousness, anything goes, etc." [...] project. When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with Rolling Stone, Keenan described it as his [...] "attempt to make music to inspire people. ... This is definitely not thinking man's music, but groove-oriented music that makes you feel good." [...] In a later interview with Artistdirect, Keenan said {{that he did not want}} the lyrics to be puzzles. He wanted the complexity to be in the music, stating [...] "that's the part that gets under your skin <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> feel good." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is {{about a woman who}} teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, {{throughout}} which she uses sexual references. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has [...] "sassy" [...] lyrics, but its melody is soft enough <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> forget that [...] "the track is actually kind of dirty". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is [...] "not-so-subtly" [...] instructing her lover within the lines [...] "It’s your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I'll stay".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{noted that}} there was a greater focus on Moore's {{keyboards}} than Matheos' guitar riffs. Blogcritics said that [...] "Free focuses a lot on the keyboards and programming of Kevin Moore", although Matheos' [...] "heavy guitar riffs, while not as frequent on this disc, have an even harder edge. They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention." [...] Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free [...] "isn't one of those metal albums that hypes you up <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> want to break stuff. It's one where you have to sit back, throw on the headphones, and appreciate the complexity and musicianship." [...] Olav Björnsen of Prog4you.com stated that [...] "layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension." [...] He said that Matheos used acoustic and electric guitars [...] "to fill out the soundscapes even more, and is at the most effective when playing the acoustic guitar, giving life and warmth to songs {{that would have been a}} bit cold sounding without that input." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "In Marge We Trust" [...] finished 25th in {{ratings for the}} week of April 21–27, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 10.1, equivalent to approximately 9.8 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files and King of the Hill. The episode received critical acclaim; authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "A rare case of both storylines being worthy of full episodes in their own right, this is a cracking episode which highlights the unduly neglected Rev. Lovejoy <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> realize Homer isn't the only one ready to kill Ned Flanders! Great stuff." [...] In a 2000 Entertainment Weekly article, Matt Groening ranked it as his fifth favorite {{in the history of}} the show. Josh Weinstein described it as one of the best of the season, as well as being one of the most underrated episodes of all time. He also described the Mr. Sparkle commercial as his all-time favorite sequence. The fake Fruity Oaty Bar commercial from the film Serenity was partially inspired by the Mr. Sparkle advertisement. Since 2009, the show's new opening sequence includes Mr. Sparkle detergent with Marge's supermarket purchases.|$|E

500|$|Carlo Santos of the Anime News Network {{described}} Dragon Balls setting as [...] "a {{melting pot}} of sci-fi, fantasy, and folklore". Santos praised its quick {{development of new}} characters and storylines, and claimed that the series' crowning achievement is in its dynamic fight scenes. However, he did not enjoy the cliché training and tournament segments, nor its crude humor. His colleague Allen Divers praised the manga's story and humor as being very good at conveying all the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation {{one of the best}} of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese. Animerica felt the series had [...] "worldwide appeal," [...] using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to [...] "maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans". Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux described Toriyama as a [...] "super-cartoonist," [...] a blend of Carl Barks, Jack Kirby, and Peyo. He gave Dragon Ball a perfect rating and called it one of the best manga and comic books he has ever read. Ridwan Khan of Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a [...] "chubby" [...] art style, but as the series continued the characters became more refined, leaner, and more muscular. He cited one slight problem in Viz's release; the translation uses informal language to capture Goku's country accent, but it ends up feeling [...] "forced and odd". Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime adaptations. Ollie Barber writing for Forbes echoed Khan stating with a lot less padding, the manga's [...] "pacing is a lot tighter <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> realize how talented Dragon Ball's creator Akira Toriyama truly is when he chooses to flex his storytelling muscles".|$|E

2500|$|In 1879, when Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich was 20 years old, {{he visited}} the court of his {{maternal}} uncle, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden, {{and fell in love}} with his cousin, Princess Victoria of Baden. [...] "She is charming and pleases one immediately", he wrote, adding, [...] "She kisses you <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> say a thousand things". [...] The Russian Orthodox Church, which prohibited first cousins to marry, would not permit any thought of marriage. [...] Nicholas nevertheless asked his uncle Alexander II to allow the wedding, threatening that if he were not allowed to marry Victoria of Baden, he would never marry.

2500|$|Patton married Cristina Zuccatosta, an Italian artist, in 1994. The couple divided {{their time}} between San Francisco and Bologna, Italy, until their {{separation}} in 2001.
