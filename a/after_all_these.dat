25|$|Nokia also {{acquired}} Mobira, {{a mobile}} telephony company, {{which was the}} foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network {{and the first to}} allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1968, WMATA polling {{suggested}} that citizens of Maryland and Virginia strongly supported Metro. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>these</b> people desperately needed a quick, efficient way of getting to their jobs in the District of Columbia. Eager {{to find some way}} to break ground and begin the construction of the subway system, WMATA asked voters in the two states to approve construction bonds for the subway. They overwhelming did so in November 1968, with 72 percent of voters in favor. Natcher also agreed in the fall of 1968 to release funds for architectural plans, engineering design, and land acquisition (but not construction) of Metro, and Metro broke ground in December 1969. But as Natcher continued to withhold construction funds through 1971, citizens of Maryland and Virginia began to think that the money they had invested in Metro would be wasted. Soon, political pressure was building on members of Congress from these two states to stop Natcher and move ahead with Metro.|$|E

25|$|On February 19, 1977, Wonder was {{nominated}} for seven Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, an award that he had already won twice, in 1974 and 1975, for Innervisions and Fulfillingness’ First Finale. Since 1973, Stevie’s presence at the Grammy ceremonies had been consistent – he attended most of the ceremonies and also used to perform on stage. But in 1976, he did not attend as he was not nominated for any awards (as he had not released any new material during the past year). Paul Simon, who received the Grammy for Album of the Year in that occasion (for Still Crazy <b>After</b> <b>All</b> <b>These</b> Years) jokingly thanked Stevie “for not releasing an album” that year. A year after, Wonder {{was nominated}} for Songs in the Key of Life in that same category, and was widely favored by many critics to take the award. The other nominees were Breezin’ by George Benson, Chicago X by Chicago, Silk Degrees by Boz Scaggs, and the other favorite, Peter Frampton’s Frampton Comes Alive!, which was also a huge critical and commercial success. Wonder was again absent from the ceremony, as he had developed an interest in visiting Africa. In February he traveled to Nigeria for two weeks, primarily to explore his musical heritage, as he put it. A satellite hook-up was arranged so that Stevie could be awarded his Grammys from across the sea. Bette Midler announced the results during the ceremony, and the audience was only able to see Wonder at a phone smiling and giving thanks. The video signal was poor and the audio inaudible. Andy Williams went on to make a public blunder when he asked the blind-since-birth Wonder, “Stevie, can you see us?” In all, Wonder won four out of seven nominations at the Grammys: Album of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Male R Vocal Performance and Producer of the Year.|$|E

The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
500|$|While some {{of these}} {{problems}} were due to mechanical failures, and responsibility for some of the others is still being debated, Kraft did not hesitate to assign blame to Carpenter, and continued to speak out about the mission for decades afterwards. His autobiography, written in 2001, reopened the issue; the chapter that dealt with the flight of Mercury-Atlas 7 was titled [...] "The Man Malfunctioned." [...] In a letter to the New York Times, Carpenter called the book [...] "vindictive and skewed," [...] and offered a different assessment of the reasons for Kraft's frustration: [...] "in space things happen so fast that only the pilot knows what to do, and even ground control can't help. Maybe that's why he is still fuming <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> years." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} Test, Bradman scored another century and England lost the match and series, {{although}} Wyatt played a substantial innings, and Wisden conceded Chapman {{could have made}} little difference except as a fielder.

In comparing circumstances of Chapman's appointment with those of his replacement by Wyatt, Gibson writes: [...] "In 1926, England won: in 1930, England lost. That is why the echoes took so long to die down and why the selectors remained villains." [...] He concludes that, even though Wyatt did relatively well, [...] "It does seem, <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> years, an odd decision to have taken." [...] In the series, Chapman scored 259 runs at 43.16. In all first-class cricket, he passed four figures for the final time, reaching 1,027 runs at an average of 29.34.|$|E

[...] The multiplayer they praised for being more pleasingly simple than recent Call of Duty games and pointed out how it was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of the original, but nonetheless criticized it for feeling limited and shallow. They also noted that the remaster inadvertently felt clichéd and overfamiliar, due to the original having inspired numerous sequels and imitations, but praised the modern-day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again.
