40|$|Trovafloxacin {{pharmacokinetics}} {{were evaluated}} in 12 subjects with AIDS. By using a randomized design, single 200 -mg doses of oral trovafloxacin and intravenous <b>alatrofloxacin</b> were administered. The mean absolute bioavailability was 91 %. The pharmacokinetics of trovafloxacin when administered orally as the active form or intravenously as the prodrug (<b>alatrofloxacin)</b> are not altered {{in subjects with}} AIDS compared to those in healthy adults...|$|E
40|$|A single-dose {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine concentrations of trovafloxacin (CP- 99, 219) achieved in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) relative to those in the serum of healthy subjects after intravenous infusion of <b>alatrofloxacin</b> (CP- 116, 517), the alanyl-alanyl prodrug of trovafloxacin. Twelve healthy subjects were admin-istered single doses of <b>alatrofloxacin</b> at a trovafloxacin equivalent of 300 mg as an intravenous infusion over 1. 0 h. CSF samples were taken by lumbar puncture at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 24 h after the start of the infusion; each subject was sampled at only one time point. Serum samples were taken from each subject at the time of CSF collection. A mean concentration of 5. 8 mg of trovafloxacin per ml was present in serum 1. 0 h after the start of the infusion. CSF/serum ratios ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 33 in the postdistribution phase (5 to 24 h postinfusion), with a mean ratio of 0. 25. The most common adverse events were dizziness, nausea, and rash and were mild or moderate in intensity. The potency of trovafloxacin against susceptible organisms, coupled with its rapid penetration of CSF following the intravenous administration of <b>alatrofloxacin,</b> suggests that it may be useful in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in humans. <b>Alatrofloxacin</b> is an L-Ala–L-Ala prodrug which is rapidly hydrolyzed to trovafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone of the flu-oronaphthyridine class. Currently available quinolones such a...|$|E
40|$|The {{prophylactic}} and therapeutic activities of two fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and <b>alatrofloxacin</b> (the L-Ala-L-Ala prodrug of trovafloxacin), {{were compared to}} those of vancomycin in two different experimental models of foreign-body-associated infections caused by methicillin-resistant but quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates. In a guinea pig model of prophylaxis, subcutaneously implanted tissue cages were infected with 10 (3) CFU of MRSA, which was a 100 % infectious dose in control animals. A single dose of 50 mg of levofloxacin per kg of body weight, administered intraperitoneally 3 h before bacterial challenge, was more efficient than vancomycin {{for the prevention of}} infections in tissue cages with MRSA inocula of 10 (4) and 10 (5) CFU. In a rat model used to evaluate therapy of chronic tissue cage infection caused by MRSA, the efficacies of 7 -day high-dose regimens of levofloxacin (100 mg/kg once a day [q. d. ] or 50 mg/kg twice a day [b. i. d. ]) or <b>alatrofloxacin</b> (50 mg/kg q. d.) were compared to the efficacy of vancomycin (50 mg/kg b. i. d.). Active levels of levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, and vancomycin were continuously present in tissue cage fluid, with the levels exceeding the minimal bactericidal concentrations for MRSA during therapy. The q. d. and b. i. d. regimens of levofloxacin had equivalent activities and were significantly (P < 0. 05) more active than <b>alatrofloxacin</b> or vancomycin in decreasing the viable counts of MRSA in tissue cage fluids. No quinolone-resistant mutants emerged during therapy with either fluoroquinolone. The mechanisms explaining the inferior activity of <b>alatrofloxacin</b> compared to the activity of levofloxacin against chronic foreign-body-associated infections by MRSA are unknown...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of trovafloxacin following {{administration of}} a single intravenous dose of <b>alatrofloxacin,</b> equivalent to 4 mg of trovafloxacin per kg of body weight, were determined in 6 infants (ages 3 to 12 months) and 14 children (ages, 2 to 12 years). There was rapid conversion of <b>alatrofloxacin</b> to trovafloxacin, with an average ± standard deviation (SD) peak trovafloxacin concentration determined {{at the end of}} the infusion of 4. 3 ± 1. 4 μg/ml. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters (average ± SD) analyzed were volume of distribution at steady state (1. 6 ± 0. 6 liters/kg), clearance (151 ± 82 ml/h/kg), and half-life (9. 8 ± 2. 9 h). The drug was well tolerated by all children. There were no age-related differences in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters studied. Less than 5 % of the administered dose was excreted in the urine over 24 h. On the basis of the mean area under the concentration-time curve of 30. 5 ± 10. 1 μg · h/ml and the susceptibility (≤ 0. 5 μg/ml) of common pediatric bacterial pathogens to trovafloxacin, dosing of 4 mg/kg/day once or twice daily should be appropriate...|$|E
