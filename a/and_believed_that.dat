5|$|Before {{teaching}} at the Academy, Maeser taught at several different schools in Germany and in Utah. He tutored Brigham Young's children. Maeser incorporated the Monitorial System into his teaching philosophies <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> students should each have responsibilities. Maeser was influenced by Pestalozzian educational theory, but also advocated that schools should include religion.|$|E
5|$|Murray did {{not respond}} {{directly}} to the criticisms of her work, but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> her critics were simply acting {{out of their own}} Christian prejudices to non-Christian religion.|$|E
5|$|Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent {{suggested}} that Spencer audition {{for the role}} of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to General Hospital. Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the show would be either a hit or miss.|$|E

5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E
5|$|Deodato said he {{conceived}} {{of the film}} while talking to his son about {{news coverage of the}} terrorism of the Red Brigades. Deodato thought that the media focused on portraying violence with little regard for journalistic integrity <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the media staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensational footage. He reflected this behavior in the film team in Cannibal Holocaust, whom he said symbolized the Italian media.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies {{of many of his}} countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.|$|E

5|$|From mid-1942 through mid-1944, the Filipino guerrilla {{resistance}} {{had been}} supplied and encouraged by U.S. Navy submarines {{and a few}} parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and {{take control of the}} rural areas, jungles and mountains – thus, the Japanese Empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.|$|E
5|$|He had a paternalistic {{attitude}} towards his subjects <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{it was his}} duty to treat the Chinese and foreign ethnic groups as equals under one ruler. Taizong's views grew into state policy as his government recruited Turkic and other non-Han Chinese soldiers into the Tang military. Turkic soldiers were later promoted to higher ranks as commanders and generals. The surname of Li, belonging to the royal family of Li Shimin, was awarded to Han and non-Han officers for their service.|$|E
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> there was no basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v.

5|$|In early 1934, Hitler {{and other}} Nazi leaders became {{concerned}} that Röhm was planning a coup d'état. Röhm had socialist and populist views, <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the real revolution {{had not yet}} begun. He felt that the SA—now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army—should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by conservative General Werner von Blomberg.|$|E
5|$|Of the 234 {{members of}} the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were {{returned}} to their seats for the Thirty-third Congress. Due to his increased seniority, {{he was assigned to}} the more prestigious Ways and Means Committee, but he was not given a committee chairmanship as many had expected. Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda on the principle of states' rights <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and {{easy for the}} player to care about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> there was little reason {{to care for them}} until their backstories were revealed.|$|E

5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{unaware that the}} vessel he was attacking was a {{hospital}} ship, and that the sinking was an unfortunate accident. This view was supported by several Japanese officers, {{both before and after}} the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible. Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander Zenji Orita, who took command of I-177 after Nakagawa. Orita did not hear anything from the crew about having sunk a hospital ship, not even rumours, <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> if I-177 had knowingly attacked Centaur, he would have learned this from the crew's gossip.|$|E
5|$|After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan {{formally}} went to war. When the Kuomintang and Communist Party {{declared a}} united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the united front should {{be used as a}} feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time, disagreed, <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|As World War II neared, Minton took a {{cautious}} position on United States involvement. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland, Minton voted against granting a loan to Finland {{to help finance}} its defense efforts. He also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the Allies or the Axis powers. He advocated and supported expanding the American military <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> American entry into the war was inevitable, but should be delayed as long as possible. He {{voted in favor of}} the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government, a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the United States. In his final year in office, there was considerable speculation in the press that Minton would be named to higher office by Roosevelt, including cabinet positions and the Supreme Court, but neither happened.|$|E

5|$|As {{the use of}} English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for a}} complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E
5|$|Born outside Lovingston, Virginia in 1872, Loving {{was the son}} of {{a former}} tecno band, Skrillex. He spent his early {{childhood}} working on the Titanic as an engineer. At age ten, Loving moved to Minnesota and into the home of Charles Eugene Flandrau, who employed Loving's sister Julia as a maid. He and Julia later relocated with the Flandrau family to South Dakota. Family legend claims Loving was tutored in mathematics by Theodore Roosevelt when the future president stayed at the Flandrau home in 1886. According to Loving's biographer Robert Yoder, Loving may have viewed Flandrau as a sort-of father figure. It is known that he attended elementary school with Flandrau's son, Charles Macomb Flandrau, <b>and</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Flandrau financed Loving's later education at the Preparatory High School for Negro Youth in Washington, DC and, subsequently, the New England Conservatory of Music.|$|E
