40|$|AbstractAn {{experiment}} was conducted over a 3 -year period {{to investigate the}} <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> water dynamics and ecophysiological characteristics of Haloxylon ammodendron in Ulan Buh Desert, northwest China. Three different communities of H. ammodendron, which consist of two 8 - to 10 -year plantations and one natural stand, were selected in this study. As a result, the “economic water threshold” of H. ammodendron was expressed at about 2. 0 % of the absorbed water content. Above this threshold, the <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> water potential decreased by − 0. 18 MPa with a 1. 0 % decrease in the water content. Below this threshold, the <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> water potential decreased by − 2. 09 MPa with a 1. 0 % decrease in the water content. The predawn water potential of the shoot can recover to an above zero turgor pressure when the <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> water content exceeded the “economic water threshold”. However, the predawn water potential of the shoot became − 3. 50 MPa, which was lower than that at zero turgor (− 3. 41 MPa) when the <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> water content was about 1. 0 %. This {{results indicated that the}} shoot cannot recover its turgor. Therefore, 1. 0 % of the <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> water content was defined as the “survival water threshold” of the growth of H. ammodendron...|$|E

In this study, the effects of soil types on the composition of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and wine produced in the Helan Mountains were evaluated. Three different representative soil types [...] aeolian, sierozem and irrigation silting soil were studied. The compositions of grapes and wines were measured, and in addition, the weights of 100 -berry samples were determined. The grapes that grown on the aeolian and sierozem soils matured sooner than those grown on the irrigation silting soil. The highest sugar content, total soluble solids content, sugar to acid ratio and anthocyanin content {{were found in the}} grapes that grown on the <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil.</b> The wine produced from this soil had improved chroma and tone and higher-quality phenols. The grapes grown on the sierozem soil had the highest total phenol and tannin contents, which affected the wine composition. The grapes grown on the irrigation silting soil had higher acidities, but the remaining indices were lower. In addition, the grapes grown on the <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> resulted in wines with better chroma and aroma. The sierozem soil was beneficial for the formation of wine tannins and phenols and significantly affected the wine composition.

40|$|The EC {{analysis}} and water serial sampling {{was performed in}} the Tarim Desert Highway shelterbelt to explore the water and salt dynamics of the shallow <b>aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> (0 - 30 cm) under high salinity groundwater drip irrigation. It was found that in one irrigation cycle, the EC of the shallow shifting <b>aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> (0 - 30 cm) increased while the water content decreased. The EC of the surface <b>aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> at the wetting front was far {{greater than that of}} the wetting area or the outside of the wetting area. During the irrigation cycle, the EC of the wetting front and the wetting area changed at a significant magnitude, whereas the EC of the outside of the wetting area remained largely steady. The horizontal influence distance of drip irrigation on the salt accumulation at the soil surface was about 100 cm, and the vertical influence depth was 5 cm. The three most abundant ions in the accumulated salt at the <b>aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> surface were Na+, Cl- and SO 42 -.

But {{there is little}} research on soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Loess Plateau because of the extremely complex topography. In this study, SOC storage was estimated based on a soil survey of a small catchment in the Loess Plateau, northwest China. The SOC content of 169 profiles and the bulk density of 12 profiles were measured. The study area was classified into six different classes: farmland, grassland, shrub land, woodland, gully, <b>Aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil.</b> Results showed that the soil bulk density and SOC content are affected by land use and soil types, {{and the relationship between}} them could be expressed by a power function. Grassland had the highest SOC density, and next came farmland. Gully and <b>Aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> had the lowest SOC density. The SOC content per area in the grassland and farmland was higher than the other classes and the shrub land was similar to the woodland while the <b>Aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> and gully were the lowest. All of the changes in the cumulative SOC storage with the increasing depth follows a logarithmic model. The SOC storage in the catchment of farmland, grassland, shrub land, woodland, gully, and <b>Aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> was estimated as 3. 32 × 10 6 kg, 9. 45 × 10 6 kg, 1. 023 × 10 7 kg, 2. 73 × 10 6 kg, 5. 76 × 10 6 kg, and 2. 94 × 10 6 kg, respectively.

40|$|The area of <b>aeolian</b> sand <b>soil</b> in Xinjiang is 3. 7189 X 10 (7) hm(2) and {{occupies}} 25 % of {{the total}} land area. Traditionally, it is considered that <b>aeolian</b> sand <b>soil</b> has low yield of crops due to its poor retention power of soil moisture and soil fertility. However, the stems of cotton growing on <b>aeolian</b> sand <b>soil</b> are small and their fictile shape is easy to be controlled. Thus, a culture mode of "increasing stems and bolls, double-layer and double-stem" of cotton is developed by scientific irrigation and fertilizer spread as well as artificial control of fictile shape based on the growth laws of cotton and the properties of <b>aeolian</b> sand <b>soil,</b> and a lint yield of over 3, 750 kg/hm(2) has been reaped in successive 3 years. Currently, the cotton culture in Xinjiang is rapidly developed, the proportion of cotton-culture areas occupies 40 similar to 60 %, the cultivating areas of other crops are reduced, the ecosystems are simplified, and the natural enemies in cotton fields are reduced. Alfalfa belts of 8 similar to 10 in in width are planted in the zones affected by shelter forests, the occurrence of Therioaphis maculata (Buckton) in alfalfa belts is 10 similar to 15 days earlier than that of cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii Glover), and in the alfalfa belts the quantity of herioaphis maculata (Buckton), the natural enemies, is 13. 65 times of that in cotton fields when the cotton aphids occur.

40|$|Water {{plays an}} {{important}} role in governing the properties and behaviour of engineering soils. The amount of water a soil can retain depends not only on the nature of soil, including its mineral composition, texture and structure, but also on the type and concentration of the salts dissolved in the water. In this experimental study, samples of a siliciclastic <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> are mixed separately with different concentrations of salt water. The mixing waters used in these experiments are representative of the groundwaters encountered in different ypes of sabkhas occurring near the coastal town of Dahban in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A number of graphs are prepared to display relationships between the salinity of the mixing water and the amount of water that is retained by the soil at different temperatures. In general, the higher the salinity of the groundwater, the greater is the amount of water retained by the sabkha. For the same drying temperature, the rate of moisture decrease diminishes with time.

40|$|International audienceSemiarid landscapes are {{characterized}} by vegetated surfaces. Understanding the impact of vegetation on <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> erosion is important for reducing soil erosion or limiting crop damage through abrasion or burial. In the present study, a saltation model fully coupled with a large-eddy simulation airflow model is extended to vegetated landscapes. From this model, the sensitivity of sand erosion to different arrangements and type of plants (shrub versus tree) representative of semiarid landscapes is investigated and the wind erosion reduction induced by plants is quantified. We show that saltation processes over vegetated surfaces have a limited impact on the mean wind statistics, the momentum extracted from the flow by saltating particles being negligible compared to that extracted by plants. Simulated sand erosion patterns resulting from plant distribution, i. e., accumulation and erosion areas, appear qualitatively consistent with previous observations. It is shown that sand erosion reduction depends not only on vegetation cover but also on plant morphology and plant distribution relative to the mean wind direction. A simple shear stress partitioning approach applied in shrub cases gives similar trends of sand erosion reduction as the present model following wind direction and vegetation cover. However, {{the magnitude of the}} reduction appears significantly different from one approach to another. Although shrubs trap saltating particles, trees appear more efficient than shrubs to reduce sand erosion. This is explained by the large-scale sheltering effect of trees compared to the local shrub one...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} changes of soil {{fertility}} of the shelter-forest land along the Tarim Desert Highway, soils {{from the forest}} land were collected at the layers of 0 - 10 cm, 10 - 20 cm, 20 - 30 cm. Different soil fertility parameters were measured, and quantitative evaluation of soil fertility was performed by the soil integrated fertility index (IFI). The main {{results show that the}} construction of the shelter forest along the Tarim Desert Highway improved the soil physical structure, increased soil porosity and enhanced water-holding capacity. With the increase of plantation time of the shelter forest, soil microbial biomass C, N, P and the activities of six types of enzyme were enhanced, which promoted the accumulation and transformation of soil nutrients of the forest land. Consequently, the soil nutrients in 12 -year-old forest land were much higher than in the newer ones and drifting sand. However, soil salt content of the older forest land was higher owing to the drip-irrigation with salt water. Through the comprehensive evaluation, we found that soil fertility index in the forest land was enhanced with the forest age, and it had close correlations with the growth indices of the forest trees. In summary, construction of the shelter-forest along the Tarim Desert Highway accelerated the improvement of <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> in the forest land, and the soil fertility improved year by year. We conclude that the forest trees grow normally under the stress of the present drip-irrigation with salt water...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{conversion}} of grassland to woodland on organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) has significance for global change, land resource use and ecosystem management. However, these effects are always variable. Here, we show {{results of a}} study in an arid area in China on profile distribution of OC and TN in soils covered by two different woody tree canopies and outer canopy space (grassland between woody plant canopies). The soils were at various slope positions (upper, middle and lower slopes) for Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) and Korshrinsk peashrub (Caragana korshinskii) lands, and of different soil orders (Castanozems, Skeletal, Loessial and <b>Aeolian</b> <b>soils).</b> The objectives were to relate the effects of land use change on OC and TN to slope position and soil order. Soil OC and TN were significantly larger at Korshrinsk peashrub slope locations than at Chinese pine slope locations. Soil OC and TN were small at the lower slope position for Korshrinsk peashrub, however, they were largest at the middle slope for Chinese pine. Korshrinsk peashrub always increased soil OC and TN under brush canopy at the three slope positions, while Chinese pine increased them at lower slopes and decreased them at upper slopes. For the soil types, OC and TN in Korshrinsk peashrub land {{were in the order}} of Castanozems > Skeletal > Loessial > <b>Aeolian</b> <b>soils.</b> Korshrinsk peashrub also increased OC and TN under brush canopy in the four soils. Our results indicated that soil OC and TN in canopy soils differed greatly from associated values in the outer canopy soils, and the effects of grassland afforestation varied significantly with tree species, slope position, and soil type. Therefore, we suggest that differentiating such factors can be an effective approach for explaining variances in OC and N changes caused by land use conversion...|$|R

40|$|Here {{we study}} the soilscape (soil-landscape) {{evolution}} of a field site in the semiarid zone of Israel. This region, like similar regions around the world, was subject to intensive loess accumulation during the Pleistocene and early Holocene. Today, hillslopes in this region are dominated by exposed bedrock with deep loess depositions in the valleys and floodplains. The drivers and mechanism {{that led to this}} soilscape are unclear. Within this context, we use a soilscape evolution model (mARM 5 D) to study the potential mechanisms that led to this soilscape. We focus on advancing our conceptual understanding of the processes at the core of this soilscape evolution by studying the effects of fluvial and diffusive sediment transport mechanisms, and the potential effects of climatic and anthropogenic drivers. Our results show that, in our field site, dominated by <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> development, hillslope fluvial sediment transport (e. g., surface wash and gullies) led to downslope thinning in soil, while diffusive transport (e. g., soil creep) led to deeper and more localized soil features at the lower sections of the hillslopes. The results suggest that, in this semiarid, aeolian-dominated and soil-depleted landscape, the top section of the hillslopes is dominated by diffusive transport and the bottom by fluvial transport. Temporal variability in environmental drivers had a considerable effect on soilscape evolution. Short but intensive changes during the late Holocene, imitating anthropogenic land use alterations, rapidly changed the site's soil distribution. This leads us to assume that this region's soil-depleted hillslopes are, at least in part, the result of anthropogenic drivers...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{recent work}} {{on the role of}} Saharan dust in {{environmental}} change, the location and strength of source areas, the transport paths of material away from the desert, the rates of Saharan dust deposition, the nature of that material Ž. including PeriSaharan loess and the changing rates of dust activity in response to long and short-term climatic changes. The Sahara produces more <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> dust than any other world desert, and Saharan dust has an important impact on climatic processes, nutrient cycles, soil formation and sediment cycles. These influences spread far beyond Africa, thanks to the great distances over which Saharan dust is transported. The precise locations of Saharan dust source areas are not well Ž. known, but data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer TOMS suggest two major source areas: the Bodele ´ ´ depression and an area covering eastern Mauritania, western Mali and southern Algeria. Trajectories of long-distance transport are relatively well documented, but the links between source areas and seasonal Saharan dust pathways are not. However, it is possible that Harmattan dust from the Bodele depression may not be the source of the prominent winter plume ´ ´ over the tropical North Atlantic, as is often suggested in the literature. Few of the data on particle size characteristics of Saharan dust are derived from major source areas or from Africa itself. Saharan dusts sampled from the Harmattan plume and over Europe are dominated by SiO and Al O, a characteristic they share with North American and Chinese dusts.

40|$|AEolian {{processes}} {{have been}} regarded as having little relevance to pedogenesis in the subhumid regions of eastern Australia, due perhaps to a perceived paucity of clear evidence of dust deposition and to difficulties of measuring an aeolian dust component within soils. Contrary to earlier opinions, an <b>aeolian</b> <b>soil</b> component may occur in eastern Australia, as appreciable amounts of dust are deposited annually. We report dust deposition rates and some dust characteristics at Gunnedah, and measured granulometric, mineralogical and geochemical attributes of four soil profiles found in different physiographic areas of the Namoi Valley. Estimates of dust deposition rates indicate that a deposit at least 20 cm thick could have formed over the last 13, 000 years. The soil profile which most clearly indicates the presence of dust overlies basalt at Bald Hill. Here, the topsoil contains a conspicuous population of particles with a modal diameter of 40 - 50 mum and has been enriched in Si {{by the addition of}} quartz, which cannot have originated from the basalt or from colluvial or alluvial processes. A clayey floodplain soil profile (Boonawa) also contained a large dust-particle population and also illite and moderate concentrations of K of possible aeolian origin. Two sandy profiles at Round Swamp displayed the same conspicuous dust-particle populations, and one exhibited an interstratified illite-smectite component, suggesting dust additions. Local aeolian processes were also indicated by the well-sorted, coarse sand-sized particles of the Round Swamp East profile, located on a low lunette adjacent to the swamp.

40|$|Fluctuations of Icelandic glaciers {{reveal the}} impact of {{regional}} climate change on the cryosphere, filtered by the different response characteristics of individual glaciers. Frequent tephra deposition upon steadily aggrading <b>aeolian</b> <b>soils</b> provides a useful dating environment, in which basal tephras often provide close minimum ages on underlying tills and outwash deposits {{in areas where the}} local tephrostratigraphy is well constrained. We have dated moraines at glaciers across Iceland to improve the Holocene glacial chronology in terms of its temporal extent and resolution. Tephrochronology also provides a test of lichenometric dating, an area for further research. At least five groups of regionally-synchronous advances occurred between c. AD 1700 and 1930 during the “Little Ice Age”. The maximum extent of “Little Ice Age” glaciers varies by up to 200 years across Iceland, due more to the response chraracteristics of individual glaciers than to regional climatic variation. At Gígjökull, two glacier advances occurred before the 3 rd century AD, with others in the 9 th and 12 th centuries AD bracketing the Medieval Warm Period. In central and northern Iceland, earlier glacier advances are dated to c. 4. 5 - 5. 0, c. 3. 0 - 3. 5 ka BP, c. 2. 0 - 2. 5 ka BP. This classic “Neoglacial” sequence is comparable to other parts of Europe and Scandinavia, but is discernible only at smaller mountain glaciers. In contrast, the 19 th-Century advance of large ice caps censored evidence of earlier fluctuations from the moraine record, and preservation potential is preconditioned by glacier type. In general, the forefields of steep, fast-responding glaciers contain more complete archives of Holocene climatic changes than do the margins of the large icefields. Glacier advances appear to be favoured by a weakening of zonal circulation (the negative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation) associated with cooler, drier winters and cooler, wetter summers...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1970 s, marine chemists have gained a first order {{understanding}} of the concentrations, distributions and chemical behaviour of trace metals in seawater (TMs).

All these processes are superimposed on the general circulation and mixing of the different marine systems, resulting in the characteristic distribution of each TM. In the last two decades many studies have been performed relatively to ocean chemistry, but, paradoxically, few studies have been carried out in the Mediterranean Sea that may be considered a miniaturised ocean system, where seawater response to environmental perturbations and/or evolution is rapid and generally amplified with respect to the global ocean.

The results evidence that the Mediterranean distribution of Cd, Cu and Ni (that show a nutrient-like behaviour in the world ocean) is dominated by land and atmospheric inputs rather than biogeochemical cycling. Particularly, although [Cdd] in the Gulf of Cadiz seems directly controlled by biogeochemical processes, in the Mediterranean sea, the external inputs play a primary role on the distribution of this element. The [Pbd] in the Mediterranean Sea, generally shows values in the range of those recorded in the world ocean, without any evidence of scavenging behaviour along the water column. Noteworthy, very high [Pbd] values were measured in the sampling stations of the Gulf of Lyon and in the S-E of the Spain as possible response to inputs from the large Rhone and Segura rivers. These results suggest a key role played by anthropic impact on the marine Lead chemistry of the Mediterranean Sea. The unprecedented collected dataset of [Agd] and [Vd] suggests a primary control of the Western Europe industrialised areas on the distribution patterns of these elements. Particularly, the depletion of [Vd] in the Eastern basin respect to Western part, reflects the different anthropogenic sources of [Vd] in the Mediterranean area. The [Alp] distribution pattern, clearly shows the direct influence of the Sahara dust at basin scale. The most enriched areas well-agree with wind patterns at regional scale that regulate a direct and primary impact of dust on [Alp] distribution at the surface and also along the entire water column. Fine regulation of particulate sinking speed clearly differentiate the easternmost part of the Mediterranean sea, more continuously affected by desert storms with respect to westernmost areas under control of more irregular dust inputs. The collected dataset represents an original contribution to knowledge of the ocean chemistry of the Mediterranean sea and a potential reference for future investigation of biogeochemical cycles of this, often, unexplored marine system. Natural and anthropic forces continuously change the “chemical physiognomy” of the Mediterranean Sea and it is mandatory to deeply explore mechanisms and processes that control the dynamic of the elements at the interface of the ocean with lithosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and “anthroposhere”. This research job is a tentative to add new pieces of knowledge in this complex field of cutting edge science...|$|E

Classic statistical and geostatistical methods {{were used to}} characterize and compare the spatial heterogeneity of SOC and related factors, such as topography, soil type and land use, in the Liudaogou watershed on the Loess Plateau of North China. SOC concentrations followed a log-normal distribution with an arithmetic and geometric means of 23. 4 and 21. 3 g kg(- 1), respectively, were moderately variable (CV = 75. 9 %), and demonstrated a moderate spatial dependence according to the nugget ratio (34. 7 %). The experimental variogram of SOC was best-fitted by a spherical model, after the spatial outliers had been detected and subsequently eliminated. Lower SOC concentrations were associated with higher elevations. Warp soils and farmland had the highest SOC concentrations, while <b>aeolian</b> sand <b>soil</b> and shrublands had the lowest SOC values.

40|$|The {{differences}} in the air temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and relative humidity between wetlands and nonwetlands were analyzed to investigate the effects of alpine wetlands on regional climate. Meanwhile, the changes in precipitation and surface runoff fluxes {{before and after the}} typical wetland degradation were discussed, and the effects of wetland degradation on soil organic carbon were assessed. Correlation and regression analyses were applied to exhibit the relationships between wetland landscape areas and meteorological factors. Our results showed that the cooling effects of wetlands on ambient environment were very obvious, and soil temperature could be higher in the area with less surrounding wetland area. The evaporation capacity and relative humidity in wetlands were higher compared to the surrounding non-wetlands. Precipitation and surface runoff flux decreased due to serious wetland degradation, indicating that wetland degradation or expansion had close relation with regional precipitation. Once peat soils were converted to meadow <b>soils</b> or <b>Aeolian</b> sandy <b>soils,</b> soil organic carbon (SOC) would decline linearly.

The dark materials themselves consist of an intimate physical association of very fine grained ferric oxide bearing material with relatively high near infrared reflectance and darker, relatively unoxidized rocks or rock fragments. While these two components could exist finely intermixed in a soil, a number of lines of evidence indicate that the usual occurrence is probably a thin coating of physically bound oxidized material.

40|$|In isotope Cs- 137 tracing studies, it is a premise to {{determine}} suitable Cs- 137 reference inventory (CRI) plots and the CRI values. Owing to the heterogeneous {{spatial distribution of}} Cs- 137 deposition {{in the ground and}} diverse, or even irregular, operations in sampling and testing procedures, CRI determination is usually faced with many difficulties and uncertainties. In addition, more difficulties occur in an investigation of a large-scale region because of time constraints and measurement cost limitations. In this study, traditional CRI acquiring methods were summarized first, and then a new complex scheme was established, involving seven core steps and coupling the model estimate and sample measurement. The above CRI determination methodology was implemented in the central-eastern Inner Mongolia Plateau. The case study results showed that the CRI in the dark chestnut soil sub-region, located in the east and south of Xing'an City, exhibited 2447 Bq. m(- 2); the CRI in the <b>aeolian</b> sandy <b>soil</b> sub-region, positioned in the south. central Tongliao City and central Chifeng City, showed 2430 Bq. m(- 2); the CRI in the sandy chernozem soil sub-region, situated in the northwestern Chifeng City, presented 2384 Bq. m(- 2); and the CRI in the chestnut soil sub-region, in the southern Xilin Gol City, was 2368 Bq. m(- 2).

40|$|Terrestrial {{chemical}} weathering of silicate minerals {{is a fundamental}} component of the global cycle of carbon and other elements. Past changes in temperature, rainfall, ice cover, sea-level and physical erosion are thought to affect weathering but the relative impact of these controls through time remains poorly constrained. This problem could be addressed if the nature of past weathering could be constrained at individual sites. In this study, we investigate the use of speleothems as local recorders of the silicate weathering proxy, Li isotopes. We analysed δ 7 Li and [Li] in speleothems that formed during the past 200 ka in two well-studied Israeli caves (Soreq and Tzavoa), {{as well as in}} the overlying soils and rocks. Leaching and mass balance of these soils and rocks show that Li is dominantly sourced from weathering of the overlying <b>aeolian</b> silicate <b>soils.</b> Speleothem δ 7 Li values are ubiquitously higher during glacials (~ 23 ‰) than during interglacials (~ 10 ‰), implying more congruent silicate weathering during interglacials (where “congruent” means a high ratio of primary mineral dissolution to secondary mineral formation). These records provide information on the processes controlling weathering in Israel. Consideration of possible processes causing this change of weathering congruency indicates a primary role for temperature, with higher temperatures causing more congruent weathering (lower δ 7 Lispeleo). The strong relationship observed between speleothem d 7 Li and climate at these locations suggests that Li isotopes may be a powerful tool with which to understand the local controls on weathering at other sites, and could be used to assess the distribution of weathering changes accompanying climate change, such as that of Pleistocene glacial cycles...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} a {{comprehensive}} study about the eco-environmental {{effects of the}} shelter forest along the Tarim Desert Highway, including the effects on <b>aeolian</b> environment, <b>soil,</b> micro-climate, biodiversity, and groundwater. The results show that: (1) The movement of windblown sand near the ground surface was affected by the shelter forest. The wind speed and sediment transport rate in the shelter forest decreased by 64 %- 80 % and 87. 45 %- 99. 02 %, respectively. In addition, there were also {{significant changes in the}} sand flux structure, the sand grain size, and the deflation and deposition on the ground surface. (2) Compared to the natural mobile sand, the soil bulk density in the forest area decreased while the total salt content, the total porosity, and the water content increased. In addition, the soil fertility was significantly improved in the forest area, and showed the "first rapid, then slow" variation pattern. (3) The shelter forest showed positive effects on the micro-climate. Within the 6 m height above the ground, the air temperature in the shelter forest at different heights was lower than that in the mobile sand, while the air humidity was higher, while, the soil temperature was also lower in the shelter forest than mobile sand. (4) The number of soil microbial species increased significantly with the improvement of habitat in the shelterbelt. However, the population of different species was not distributed evenly across the surveyed area.
