50|$|Mushet steel, {{also known}} as Robert Mushet's Special Steel (RMS), {{self-hardening}} steel and <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steel,</b> is considered the first tool steel and <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> It was invented in 1868 by Robert Forester Mushet. Prior to Mushet steel, steel had to be quenched to harden it. It later led {{to the discovery of}} high speed steel.|$|E
50|$|The first air-hardening grade {{tool steel}} was mushet steel, which {{was known as}} <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steel</b> at the time.|$|E
50|$|In {{a second}} key advance in {{metallurgy}} Mushet invented 'R Mushet's Special Steel' (R.M.S.) in 1868. It was both the first true tool steel {{and the first}} <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> It revolutionised the design of machine tools and the progress of industrial metalworking, and was the forerunner of High speed steel.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steels</b> are {{characterized}} by low distortion during heat treatment because of their high-chromium content. Their machinability is good {{and they have a}} balance of wear resistance and toughness (i.e. between the D- and shock-resistant grades).|$|R
40|$|Argon {{atomized}} powders of two modified boron-containing-tool steels in {{the rapid}} solidification condition {{as well as}} the consolidated materials after hot isostatic pressing at different temperatures were investigated. The microstructure of the powders of both tool steels consists of primary dendrites of solidification and a network of the M 23 (B,C) 6 borocarbide forming a continuous phase. The metastable M 3 B boride is present because of the high solidification rates involved in the atomization process. This microstructure is gradually lost when the temperature of consolidation by hot isostatic pressing is increased. A fine and uniform microstructure is developed after consolidation at 1100 °C. An increase of hardness with an increase of consolidation temperature is observed which is associated to the presence of martensite since both alloys have a composition characteristic of <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steels.</b> After two consecutive tempering treatments at 650 °C for 2 h the martensite is decomposed and a decrease of hardness with increasing consolidation temperature is observed.

50|$|ISO 1.2767, {{also known}} as DIN X 45 NiCrMo 4, AISI 6F7, and BS EN 20 B, is an <b>air-hardening</b> tool <b>steel</b> with a primary {{alloying}} element of nickel. It possesses good toughness, stable grains, and is highly polishable. It is primarily used for dies in plastic injection molding application that involve high stresses. Other applications include blanking dies, forging dies, and industrial blades.|$|R
50|$|In {{a second}} key advance in {{metallurgy}} Mushet invented 'R Mushet's Special Steel' (RMS) in 1868. It was both the first true tool steel {{and the first}} <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> Previously, {{the only way to}} make steel hard enough for machine tools had been to quench it, by rapid cooling in water. Self-hardening (or tungsten) steel machine tools could run much faster and were able to cut harder metals than had been possible previously. RMS revolutionised the design of machine tools and the progress of industrial metalworking, and was the forerunner of high speed steel.|$|E
50|$|In 1818/9 David Mushet built Darkhill Ironworks, {{where he}} experimented with {{iron and steel}} making. In 1845, his {{youngest}} son, Robert Forester Mushet, took over its management. He perfected the Bessemer Process by solving the quality problems which beset the process. In a second key advance in metallurgy he invented Mushet steel (R.M.S.) in 1868. It was the first true tool steel and the first <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> It revolutionised the design of machine tools and the progress of industrial metalworking, and was the forerunner of High speed steel. The remains of Darkhill are preserved as an Industrial Archaeological Site of International Importance and {{are open to the}} public.|$|E
50|$|In 1818/9 another {{ironworks}} {{was also}} built at Darkhill, {{just to the}} west of Parkend, and in 1845 Robert Forester Mushet took over management of the site. One of his greatest achievements was to perfect the Bessemer Process by discovering the solution to early quality problems which beset the process. In a second key advance in metallurgy Mushet invented 'R Mushet's Special Steel' (R.M.S.) in 1868. It was both the first true tool steel and the first <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> It revolutionised the design of machine tools and the progress of industrial metalworking, and was the forerunner of High speed steel. The remains of Darkhill are now preserved as an Industrial Archaeological Site of International Importance and are open to the public.|$|E
40|$|Hot {{sheet metal}} forming is {{becoming}} more and more important in current car body manufacturing. Boron alloyed manganese steels are hot formed and subsequently hardened in a single process. By means of this technology ultra-high-strength parts with a tensile strength of up to 1900 N/mm² can be realized. The present paper gives an overview of the different technological variants of process chains used for hot {{sheet metal forming}} of high strength steels. We have consulted the extensive literature relating to the most widely used technologies in the automotive industry and its suppliers as well as the steel manufacturers and the results of our research are summarised below. Additionally, an analysis of methods, based on solutions described in technical articles or in the course of meetings, has been produced describing single steps in the press hardening or form hardening process. This overview of hot forming technologies concludes with an explanation on special processing routes such as PHS-ultraform (VoestAlpine) or the press hardening of <b>air-hardening</b> <b>steels</b> and a description of the parts which have been produced...|$|R
