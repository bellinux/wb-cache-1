Thus, {{an effective and}} strategic weed control in DSR is often required with available options of post-emergence herbicides. In such situations, tank mixtures of herbicides may provide broad spectrum weed control in DSR. Field experiments were conducted in the wet seasons of 2013 and 2014 to study weed control in response to tank mixtures of herbicides currently applied in DSR in South Asia. Results revealed that the tank mixtures of the currently available herbicides (<b>azimsulfuron</b> plus bispyribac or fenoxaprop, bispyribac plus fenoxaprop, and <b>azimsulfuron</b> plus bispyribac plus fenoxaprop all applied as post-emergence) rarely resulted in antagonistic effects. Highest weed control efficiency (~ 98 %) was recorded with the tank mixture of <b>azimsulfuron</b> plus bispyribac plus fenoxaprop during both the years.

Rice cv Guadiamar was tolerant to preemergence (PRE) application of clomazone at 0. 36 kg ha- 1 and oxadiazon at 0. 5 kg ha– 1. PRE application of pendimethalin at 1. 32 kg ha– 1 combined with clomazone at 0. 36 kg ha- 1 decreased rice yield.

40|$|Dry-seeded rice {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} puddled hand-transplanted rice in the north Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. In dry-seeded rice, weed flora tends to be more diverse and weeds emerge in several flushes during the crop growth cycle and substantial yield reductions due to weed competition are quite common. The efficacy and compatibility of tank mixtures of different herbicides for the control of diverse weed flora in dry-seeded rice was evaluated in field experiments during the summer seasons of 2012 and 2013. The tank mixture of fenoxaprop with ethoxysulfuron improved the control of Echinochloa crus-galli and Echinochloa colona by 43 - 69 % as compared to fenoxaprop alone while the tank-mix of <b>azimsulfuron</b> with fenoxaprop was antagonistic and reduced the control of Leptochloa chinensis by 86 % as compared to fenoxaprop alone. Addition of <b>azimsulfuron</b> or ethoxysulfuron to bispyribac did not improve the control of grass weeds as compared to bispyribac alone. Weed control with the mixture of bispyribac and fenoxaprop varied over the two years. In 2012, bispyribac and fenoxaprop mixture was antagonistic for the control of Dactyloctenum aegyptium, Acrachne racemose, and L. chinensis but in 2013, there was no apparent antagonism and the addition of bispyribac to fenoxaprop reduced grass weed biomass as compared to fenoxaprop alone. In 2013, there was a strong negative correlation (r = - 0. 95, P < 0. 001) between weed dry matter at 45 days after sowing and rice grain yield. According to the linear regression, rice crop is likely to produce no grain yield when weed dry matter exceeds 400 g m. Over the two seasons, fenoxaprop-ethoxysulfuron tank-mix produced similar grain yields (5. 6 - 6. 2 t ha) to the weed-free check (5. 6 - 7. 1 t ha). At the farmer fields, rice grain yield in the plots treated with pendimethalin followed by post-emergence bispyribac or a tank-mix of fenoxaprop + ethoxysulfuron ranged from 6. 2 to 7. 7 t ha as compared to 5. 3 - 5. 6 t ha in the plots treated with pendimethalin alone. The tank mixture of fenoxaprop with bispyribac needs further evaluation as this mixture has the potential to effectively control aerobic and aquatic grasses in dry-seeded rice.

40|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the staple}} food crops of India, and Karnataka {{is one of the}} major rice-producing states. The primary method of rice {{establishment}} in Karnataka is transplanting, but farmers are opting to shift to direct-seeding of rice. Weed management is critical for realizing optimal yield of direct-seeded rice (DSR). The objective of this review was to synthesize the published literature on weeds and weed management in rice in Karnataka, identify improved weed-management technologies for delivery to farmers, and suggest research needs. Some 98 weed species are reported to be associated with rice in Karnataka. Weed control to date in Karnataka has mostly been based on herbicides. Hand-weeding was found to be effective in all methods of rice establishment. However, it is time-consuming, tedious, and costly because labor is becoming scarce and unavailable, and labor wages are higher. Several PRE and POST herbicides that were effective in other Asian countries were also found to be effective in managing weeds in rice established by different methods in Karnataka. Bensulfuron plus pretilachlor and pyrazosulfuron in aerobic rice and pendimethalin, thiobencarb, bispyribac-sodium, cyhalofop, fenoxaprop plus chlorimuron plus metsulfuron, and fenoxaprop plus ethoxysulfuron in dry-DSR were found effective in managing weeds. In wet-DSR, butachlor plus safener and pretilachlor plus safener were effective. Thiobencarb, pendimethalin, pretilachlor, <b>azimsulfuron</b> plus metsulfuron, bispyribac-sodium, butachlor, cinosulfuron, oxadiazon, and quinclorac were found promising for weed management in transplanted rice. Integration of herbicides with hand-weeding or intercultivation was found to be effective in rice established by different methods. Options that were found economical in managing weeds varied across the different rice-establishment methods. The need for developing location-specific, sustainable, integrated weed management and extension of available technologies for the farming community in Karnataka is emphasized...|$|E

For that, two experiments were performed at green house of FAEM/UFPel arranged in a completely randomized design, with four replicates. The experiment I were consisted of resistant (CYPDI 9) and susceptible of C. difformis biotype and rate of the pyrazosulfuron-ethyl herbicide, corresponding to 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32 and 64 times de registered rate (20 g ha- 1). The evaluated variables were visual control and aerial dry mass (MPAS) to the 28 days after the application of the treatments (DAT).
