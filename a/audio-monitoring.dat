40|$|Real life {{applications}} in large scale <b>audio-monitoring</b> scenarios such as smart cities require cost-efficient high-performance audio-hardware {{that can be}} used on existing data infrastructure. Advanced multichannel signal-processing applications, for example beamforming and localization algorithms, require isosynchronous input signals with low channel-interference. In this paper, the influence of hardware-designs of distributed microphone arrays on the signal-performance are examined. The most important characteristics for multichannel signal processing applications are channel crosstalk, signal to noise ratio, correlated noise, word-clock jitter, and signal latency. Sources of electrical interferences, correlated noise and corresponding error-paths in the analogue front-end are identified and analysed using error-models. Hardware optimisations for low noise and low correlation based on these findings are proposed. Distributed microphone-arrays require precise word-clock synchronisation between all hardware capturing-devices. Word-clock jitter has a significant influence on the overall systems performance. A novel distributed microphone-array based on FPGA and UDP/IP-transport and -word-clock distribution has been developed and implemented. The performance of the novel system on multichannel algorithms is compared with commercially available audio capturing devices...|$|E
40|$|Previous optical imaging studies {{used the}} vector-summation (VS) method for calculating {{direction}} and orientation preference maps. However, for direction maps it often resulted in direction vectors which showed a steep angle {{to that of}} orientation vectors violating the ‘aperture rule’. The present report provides a simple procedure for calculating direction preference maps using the ‘electro-physiologist’s ear ’ approach. This approach {{takes into account the}} strongest directional response component (vector-maximum, VM) in each pixel of the optical image, reminiscent of how electro-physiologists determine direction preference by <b>audio-monitoring</b> of the firing rate of neurons. The major advantage of this method is that the orthogonal relationship between orientation and direction preference vectors is preserved and that for most image pixels direction preference can be faithfully described by a single vector parameter. Here we used the VM method for calculating direction and the VS method for calculating orientation preference maps and quantified their spatial relationship. The results showed that, typically, an iso-orientation domain contained a pair of patches that preferred opposite directions orthogonal to the orientation. Rate-of-change maps for direction revealed that virtually all direction discontinuity lines linked orientation centres. Close to orientation centres, direction discontinuity lines ran chiefly parallel with iso-orientation lines, whereas more remotely they had either parallel or perpendicular courses...|$|E
