50|$|In 1926 {{it became}} evident that Long Branch needed high school facilities. Another front section {{was added to}} the {{building}} to accommodate a <b>continuation</b> <b>school.</b> This new front section consisted of six classrooms, a board and staff room, a nurse's office and a principals office. These new facilities were used by the <b>continuation</b> <b>school.</b> Upon the completion of these additions, the school became known as The Long Branch Public and <b>Continuation</b> <b>School.</b> The principal was Mr. James. S. Bell who served the school from 1926 to 1946. In September 1946 Mr. Harvey H. Gibbs was appointed principal of the Public School and Mr. O. Barkley principal of the <b>Continuation</b> <b>School.</b> 1948-1951 were years of expansion for Long Branch Public and <b>Continuation</b> <b>School.</b> 1948 saw the introduction of kindergarten and 1949 the departments of Remedial Reading, Art, Home Economics and Industrial Arts. The Senior Boy's Academic Vocational class began in 1950. In 1951 the <b>Continuation</b> <b>School</b> moved to the new Collegiate in New Toronto and the Public School which had been housing classes in the basement rooms, gymnasium and three churches, filled the vacated space.

40|$|More than 18 % of {{students}} {{drop out of}} high school in California each year, and even more students will never earn a college degree. <b>Continuation</b> high <b>schools</b> operate as last chance alternative schools to help underperforming students earn a high school diploma. This paper examines the perceptions and practices of seven <b>continuation</b> high <b>school</b> principals relating to the preparation of <b>continuation</b> <b>school</b> students for post-secondary education. An inductive qualitative approach was used to gain the perspectives of principals from <b>continuation</b> <b>schools</b> in Los Angeles County. Principals of <b>continuation</b> <b>schools</b> have an extraordinary challenge in readying students for college, as students arrive to <b>continuation</b> <b>schools</b> substantially behind in school and have little time to catch up. <b>Continuation</b> <b>school</b> students are more likely than their traditional high school counterparts to experience instability in the home, foster care, heavy use of alcohol or drugs, and/or engage in violent behaviors or be the victims of violent behaviors. Principals recognize that for many the challenges are insurmountable in the little time they have in the <b>continuation</b> <b>school</b> setting. Still, there are principals who express strong beliefs in the their ability to adequately prepare those students for the transition to college, and the future of their students relies on the ability of school leaders to transform their organizations into college preparatory institutions. School leaders who have experienced such adversity in their own lives express stronger belief in their students to overcome challenges and successfully transition to post-secondary education. <b>Continuation</b> <b>schools</b> that exemplify college-going culture are not typical; however, where principals expressed strong beliefs in student ability to succeed in college, more attributes of college-going culture are evident including college talk with students, clear expectations for students for post-secondary education, information and resources available to students and parents, comprehensive counseling, high levels of faculty involvement, college partnerships with the local community college, articulation with the comprehensive high schools, curriculum required for students to access college, college readiness testing, and high levels of family involvement. This study supports the thesis that principals play a powerful role in shaping the culture and outcomes of their schools and that they can influence student beliefs and outcomes given their preexisting experiences...|$|R

Six <b>continuation</b> high <b>school</b> teachers took part in the study.
