By the beginning of the following academic year, they realized that this was perhaps overly ambitious as a starting point, and instead focused on the idea of a short term broadcast, taking advantage of the Radio Authority's new Restricted Service <b>Licence</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|R

In this paper the research on the short-run impact of the low-cost homeownership programme is examined, by looking at the right to buy, shared ownership, improvement for sale, and homesteading, and at starter homes and <b>licence</b> <b>schemes.</b> The purchasers who have benefited from the programme are identified and the reasons for some of the failures of the policy to reach priority groups and areas of need are examined. An evaluation of the programme is made under three headings: the extent to which new investment is generated, the extent to which benefits are restricted to groups in need, and the long-term consequences of expanding homeownership amongst low-income groups. It is concluded that privatisation cannot be achieved without continued state support and regulation. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{main effect}} of the Directive is to {{stipulate}} that cable retransmission must be {{on the basis of}} contractual, not statutory, licences with copyright holders, although existing statutory <b>licence</b> <b>schemes</b> were permitted to remain in force until the end of 1997 (Art. 8). These licences may only be granted or refused by collecting societies 9(1), which effectively makes such societies compulsory: a collecting society may be deemed to be mandated to manage the cable retransmission rights of a copyright holder {{in the absence of any}} expressive agreement 9(2). Broadcasting organisations are free to exercise their own related rights to licence or prohibit the cable retransmission of their own broadcasts (Art. 10). The Directive also provides for mediation in disputes between cable operators and collecting societies (Art. 11) and for measures to prevent abuse of monopoly powers (Art. 12).|$|R

The Code is voluntary and acknowledges that in the UK there has been some cause for concern with regards to the relocation of UK companies to the Channel Islands to benefit from the LVCR concession, in particular with the CD and DVD market. It looks to address these concerns through the mutual co-operation of the Guernsey Mail Order and Fulfilment Group and lays down similar trade restrictions to those covered by the Jersey <b>Licence</b> <b>Scheme</b> although unlike that scheme, the only sanction available to those breaking the code appears to be exclusion from the Fulfilment Group.

The last Australian in-depth study occurred in 1997 (Haworth, 1997) and a number of significant motorcycle interventions have been implemented since that time (e. g., graduated <b>licence</b> <b>schemes,</b> numerous education and awareness campaigns). To identify risk factors for crashes emerging since then, the Australian road and transport agencies commissioned a new in-depth study of motorcycle crashes. The aims of this study were to: 1. Examine causal relationships between human, vehicle, road and other environmental factors and motorcyclists in serious injury crashes, and 2. examine the influence of the total system on the injuries sustained by seriously injured motorcyclists.

5000|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{conserve}} foreign exchange and to protect local industry, in particular to promote manufacturing to improve employment opportunities and to reduce the economy's reliance on the rural sector. During the war the restrictions were generally recognised to be necessary {{but they were not}} dismantled only eased when conditions improved. In the early 1950s the import licensing system was overhauled and many categories were made exempt. The same period saw the beginning of the safety-valve no-remittance <b>licence</b> <b>scheme.</b> A balance of payments crisis in 1957 brought new controls to restrict imports but by foreign exchange allocation. Another foreign exchange crisis in 1967 brought a reversal of the easing during the previous decade. A new policy in 1979 allowed importers to obtain extra licenses when they could show [...] "significantly deficient" [...] price/quality differentials between local and imported products. By the early 1980s the industry employed around 8,000 workers. However by 1981 official thinking had begun to swing away from import controls considering they did not in the long run remedy underlying conditions though they might be entirely successful at controlling imports. If the intention was to protect local industry tariffs, officials considered, would be a more efficient tool.|$|R
