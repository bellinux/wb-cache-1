25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do {{for such a long}} time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E
2500|$|On that {{occasion}} {{the prospect of}} inviting Baba Hari Dass to the US was raised. [...] "They stayed with me <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go to the United States. I said I could go anywhere. I was ready {{to move to the}} higher mountains".|$|E
60|$|Thus {{wrote my}} friend, adding that Mr. X was an enlightened {{connoisseur}} of bronzes <b>and</b> china, <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> show him my collection.|$|R

6000|$|Then one day I got {{a letter}} from [...] "Kipper" [...] to say he was over for a holiday and was {{stopping}} at Morley's, <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> look him up.|$|R
2500|$|The {{masthead}} {{text was}} designed by Matthew Carter, who would later design the popular webfonts Verdana and Georgia, and the Windows 95 interface font Tahoma. He wrote that, [...] "Nick Luard [...] wanted to change Private Eye into a glossy magazine <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> design it. I realised {{that this was a}} hopeless idea once I had met Christopher Booker, Richard Ingrams and Willie Rushton." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simone was {{appreciative of}} her work, saying Birds of Prey editor Lysa Hawkins [...] "was {{looking for a}} {{slightly}} tougher Birds of Prey <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> submit a proposal. I have a huge fondness for Babs and Dinah both, so it's {{a bit of a}} dream come true. I'm really excited by the art, which is very sleek and sexy, with a nice dark tone, by Supergirl star Ed Benes.|$|E
2500|$|Like [...] "Woman Don't You Cry for Me" [...] and [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues", [...] "I Dig Love" [...] {{originated}} from George Harrison's initial experimentation with slide-guitar playing, in open E tuning. His introduction to this technique occurred in December 1969, {{when he joined}} Eric Clapton as a guest on Delaney & Bonnie's European tour. In his autobiography, I Me Mine, Harrison recalls that Delaney Bramlett [...] "handed me a bottleneck slide <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play a line which Dave Mason had played on the [...] record", since Mason had recently quit the tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is your}} affair; {{but it is very}} ridiculous of you <b>to</b> come <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> protect you. The woman must, indeed, be a fool who cannot protect herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|She shrugged her shoulders. [...] "Oh! mother, {{why do you}} <b>ask</b> <b>me?</b> You {{know well}} that he is always troubling me, {{bringing}} me presents of flowers, <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> opsit with him and what not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{strapping}} our capital {{around me}} in a memory belt like we always carried it, when Andy pulls {{a roll of}} large bills {{out of his pocket}} <b>and</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> put 'em with the rest.|$|R
2500|$|... "The {{following}} {{day after the}} Alexandra Palace gig (where Steve walked off), I was back home and I {{got a call from}} Ronnie Lane who said, 'Me, Kenney and Mac would like to come round and see you.' I thought, Hello, what's all this about? Anyway, they all came round to my horrible little flat in Earls Court <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> join the Small Faces. All I could say was it's a bit late now. Why couldn't you have asked me while we were in Paris? We'd all be in the same band together and Steve wouldn't have left." [...] – Peter Frampton.|$|E
2500|$|Hussain {{was picked}} {{again for a}} Test series against India {{in the summer of}} 1996. The number 3 batting {{position}} had been troublesome for England for some time. England had tried all manner of combinations at No.3, from the left-field Jason Gallian to the veteran Robin Smith, via the temperamentally suspect pairing of Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash. [...] "A lot is made of your batting position," [...] Hussain recalled to Cricinfo, [...] "but I always felt, and I did back then when David Lloyd rang me up <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> bat No.3, that if you're good enough to be playing Test cricket, you should be good enough to move from No.5 to No.3".|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the night}} of the 6th , I got into Camp tired and wet, went to bed and slept very soundly. About midnite a courier brought me a note that each brigade should move with its own ordnance. By a very dim light and just aroused, I read the note incorrectly, that each {{division}} shall move with its own ordnance. When I discovered my mistake I explained the matter to General S. He said that my explanation was perfectly satisfactory <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make it in writing in order that he might forward it to Gen. Lee. I did so and just before Lee rec'd the explanation he ordered S. to arrest me and prefer charges. So here I am in arrest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are other}} men, Agatha, besides Adolphe. Perhaps your next request {{will be a}} very {{different}} one; perhaps, then, you will be singing the praises of some admirer, <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give him a brother's place in my heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Leonard," [...] she begged, [...] "please don't {{do or say}} {{anything}} foolish. Since we do meet again, though, like this, I am {{going to ask you}} one question. What made you come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> marry you that day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I am not packed {{off for a}} trespasser, or if this knight {{does not}} ride a wallop at me," [...] thought I, [...] "Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth at least must {{come out of that}} half-open garden door <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tea." ...|$|R
2500|$|Charles Grean of Dot Records had {{arranged}} with {{the studio to}} do an album of space music based on music from Star Trek, {{and he has a}} teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from Star Trek, then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted me and asked me if I would be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both. ...That was the first album we did, which was called Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached me <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sign a long-term contract.|$|E
2500|$|Wallis was keen to {{join the}} RAF, and applied for their Volunteer Reserve Service, but he was turned down due to a {{defective}} right eye. Consequently, he obtained a private flying licence which required only a certificate signed by his GP. Wallis obtained his A Licence for dual and solo flying in a record 12 hours. In 1938, Wallis tried {{to join the}} RAF again, {{this time with the}} newly formed RAF Short Service Commission Scheme, but again failed the eye test. In 1939, he was called up to RAF Uxbridge, and again was sent for a medical. When it came to the eyesight test he managed to pass, as Wallis later recalled, [...] "I did the first line with my good eye then they covered it up <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> read the bottom line with my bad eye, without them realising I just turned my head slightly so I could again see with my good eye – I passed it with Above Average Eye Sight!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Heck {{remained}} at Harvey, where one co-worker {{in the production}} department was future comics artist [...] Pete Morisi, for two-and-a-half years until a Harvey employee, Allen Hardy, broke off [...] "to start his own line, Media Comics , in 1952," [...] Heck recalled in 1993. [...] "He called me up <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> join." [...] Heck's first known comics work appeared in two Comic Media titles both cover-dated September 1952: the war comic War Fury #1, for which he penciled and inked the cover and the eight-page story [...] "The Unconquered", by an unknown writer; and the cover and the six-page story [...] "Hitler's Head", also by an unknown writer, in the horror comic Weird Terror #1. Heck's work continued to appear in those titles and in the horror anthology Horrific, for which he designed the logo; the adventure-drama anthology Danger; and the Western anthology Death Valley and other titles through the company's demise in late 1954.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,--when the {{election}} was over, and, as far as I can remember, some time after it was over. He wrote <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{saying that he had}} incurred such and such expenses, <b>and</b> <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> repay him. I sent him a cheque for the amount." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --And {{the wife}} with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, Wales {{described}} himself {{simply as the}} founder of Wikipedia; however, according to Brian Bergstein of the Associated Press, [...] "Sanger has long been cited as a co-founder." [...] There is evidence that Sanger was called co-founder, along with Wales, as early as 2001, and he {{is referred to as}} such in early Wikipedia press releases and Wikipedia articles and in a September 2001 New York Times article for which both were interviewed. In 2006, Wales said, [...] "He used to work for me [...] I don't agree with calling him a co-founder, but he likes the title"; nonetheless, before January 2004, Wales did not dispute Sanger's status as co-founder and, indeed, identified himself as [...] "co-founder" [...] as late as August 2002. In Sanger's introductory message to the Nupedia mailing list, he said that [...] "Jimmy Wales contacted me <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> apply as editor-in-chief of Nupedia. Apparently, Bomis, Inc. (which owns Nupedia)... who could manage this sort of long-term project, he thought I would be perfect for the job. This is indeed my dream job". Sanger said [...] "He [...] had had the idea for Nupedia since at least last fall".|$|E
2500|$|While {{living in}} Queens, New York, Jennifer Lee Quick began drawing up ideas for Off Beat. A BFA in animation, she {{approached}} Tokyopop {{when the company}} was doing portfolio reviews for students and graduates at the School of Visual Arts. Originally, she had intended for the manga to be a joint project with her best friend, Becky Cloonan, but Quick was forced to fly solo due to conflicts with Cloonan's schedule."They liked what they saw, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> send them a pitch sometime. At the time, I was working on Once in a Blue Moon so I didn't have time to send a pitch. When I finished that project, my long time best friend, Becky Cloonan was contacted by Tokyopop to send a pitch proposal. I remembered that I {{had been asked to}} send one as well, so we briefly considered sending a joint proposal for Off Beat (at the time she had talked about possibly working on the project with me). Her schedule got booked though, so I wasn't sure about submitting the pitch on my own. She encouraged me to go ahead though, so I went for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early January 2013, Willie Frazer {{said that}} he and a group of loyalists planned to hold a protest outside the Irish {{parliament}} building, Leinster House, in Dublin and [...] "sarcastically" [...] ask for the Irish flag to be taken down. Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if I was living in Ireland and someone came <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence. The UDA's Jimmy Birch told the BBCs Radio Ulster: [...] "Every time they call a tune, we take to the streets. We are wrecking our own areas, we fight with the police, we are burning our own cars and we stop our own people going to work and disrupt our own people's way of life. It is wrong, we need to step back and we need to stop being predictable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Theresa despises {{the others}} {{too much to}} attend to them.
