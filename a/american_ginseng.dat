40|$|Tissue-spray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} is {{developed for the}} in situ chemical analysis of raw herbs under ambient conditions. We demonstrated that analyte molecules could be directly sprayed and ionized from solvent-wetted ginseng tissues upon the application of high electrical voltage to the tissue sample. Abundant phytochemicals/metabolites, including ginsenosides, amino acids and oligosaccharides, could be detected from ginseng tissues when the tissue-spray experiments were conducted in positive ion mode. Thermally labile and easily hydrolyzed malonyl-ginsenosides were also detected in negative ion mode. The tissue-spray ionization method enables the direct detection of analytes from raw herb samples and preserves the sample integrity for subsequent morphological and/or microscopic examination. In addition, this method is simple and fast for chemical profiling of wild-type and cultivatedtype <b>American</b> <b>ginsengs</b> with differentiation.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAmerican ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) and Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) products, such as slices, have {{a similar}} appearance, but they have {{significantly}} different prices, leading to widespread adulteration in the commercial market. Their aroma characteristics are attracting increasing attention and {{are supposed to be}} effective and nondestructive markers to determine adulteration. MethodsThe aroma characteristics of <b>American</b> and Asian <b>ginseng</b> were investigated using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry(GC-MS) and an electronic nose (E-nose). Their volatile organic compounds were separated, classified, compared, and analyzed with different pattern recognition. ResultsThe E-nose showed a good performance in grouping with a principle component analysis explaining 94. 45 % of variance. A total of 69 aroma components were identified by GC-MS, with 35. 6 % common components and 64. 6 % special ingredients between the two ginsengs. It was observed that the components and the number of terpenes and alcohols were markedly different, indicating possible reasons for their difference. The results of pattern recognition confirmed that the E-nose processing result {{is similar to that of}} GC-MS. The interrelation between aroma constituents and sensors indicated that special sensors were highly related to some terpenes and alcohols. Accordingly, the contents of selected constituents were accurately predicted by corresponding sensors with most R 2 reaching 90 %. ConclusionCombined with advanced chemometrics, the E-nose is capable of discriminating between <b>American</b> and Asian <b>ginseng</b> in both qualitative and quantitative angles, presenting an accurate, rapid, and nondestructive reference approach...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adipocyte–macrophage {{communication}} plays {{a critical}} role regulating white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammatory gene expression. Because WAT inflammation contributes {{to the development of}} metabolic diseases, there is significant interest in understanding how exogenous compounds regulate the adipocyte–macrophage crosstalk. An aqueous (AQ) extract of North <b>American</b> (NA) <b>ginseng</b> (Panax quinquefolius) was previously shown to have strong inflammo-regulatory properties in adipocytes. This study examined whether different ginseng extracts influence adipocyte–macrophage crosstalk, as well as WAT inflammatory gene expression. Methods: The effects of AQ and ethanol (EtOH) ginseng extracts (5  μg/mL) on adipocyte and macrophage inflammatory gene expression were studied in 3 T 3 -L 1 and RAW 264. 7 cells, respectively, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Adipose tissue organ culture was also used {{to examine the effects of}} ginseng extracts on epididymal WAT (EWAT) and inguinal subcutaneous WAT (SWAT) inflammatory gene expression. Results: The AQ extract caused significant increases in the expression of common inflammatory genes (e. g., Mcp 1, Ccl 5, Tnf-α, Nos 2) in both cell types. Culturing adipocytes in media from macrophages treated with the AQ extract, and vice versa, also induced inflammatory gene expression. Adipocyte Ppar-γ expression was reduced with the AQ extract. The AQ extract strongly induced inflammatory gene expression in EWAT, but not in SWAT. The EtOH extract had no effect on inflammatory gene expression in either both cell types or WAT. Conclusion: These findings provide important new insights into the inflammo-regulatory role of NA ginseng in WAT...|$|R

25|$|The use of ginseng (人参) is {{well over}} 2,000 {{years old in}} Chinese medicine. Ginseng {{contains}} ginsenosides.

2500|$|There {{had always}} been a general American desire for foreign and {{sometimes}} exotic wares, and, with the British East India Company no longer the dominant force in American trade, the job of satisfying this demand fell to American merchants.

Further motivation came from the knowledge that China, as a whole, had a mercantilist-like attitude towards foreign commerce; they tended to resist the importation of foreign goods because of a mixture of Confucian doctrine, which deprecated trade, and the underlying ethnocentrism felt by the Chinese—they did not need to actively search for trade because the inferior white [...] "barbarian" [...] states would instinctively bring it to them as a form of tribute.

40|$|North <b>American</b> (NA) <b>ginseng</b> is {{a widely}} used {{medicinal}} plant. Polysaccharides (PS), the major medicinal fractions derived from NA ginseng root, have been shown several biological activities including anti-carcinogenic, anti-aging, immunostimulatory and antioxidant activity. This work focused on nanoprocessing of ginseng PS for enhancing their immunostimulation. Herein, we have developed a novel microfluidic approach to synthesize ginseng PS nanoparticles (NPs) from NA ginseng root. The microfluidics was found to provide unimodal PS spheres down to 20 nm with very narrow particle size distributions. In addition, the immunostimulating effect was investigated on Murine macrophage cell lines, with the results revealing an enhanced production of all proinflammatory mediators. This work examines a novel and facile procedure for the fluorescent labeling of ginseng PS using fluorescein- 5 -thiosemicarbazide (FTSC), {{in order to examine}} their cellular distribution using confocal microscopy. The labeled PS exhibited almost no cytotoxicity effect against tumor induced macrophage cell lines while retaining high immunostimulating activity similar to the non-labeled ginseng PS. Furthermore, PS NPs was encapsulated within biodegradable gelatin nanospheres for the sustain release of PS. The release kinetics reveals that the rate of PS release from gelatin nanocarriers depends on the cross-linker and pH. Moreover, we investigated the possible beneficial effects of topical formulations containing ginseng PS NPs to inhibit UVB induced oxidative damages. Induction of photoaging was conducted on SKH- 1 hairless mice through UVB irradiation at 300 mJ/cm 2.

40|$|Abstract Background Immuno-modulatory {{effects of}} ginseng, {{including}} both immuno-stimulatory and immuno-suppressive effects, {{have been widely}} reported. This study aims {{to determine whether the}} paradoxical immuno-modulatory effect is related to unique phytochemical profiles of different North <b>American</b> (NA) <b>ginseng,</b> namely aqueous (AQ) and alcoholic (ALC) extracts. Methods AQ and ALC extracts were prepared and their immuno-bioactivity were studied in vitro in murine macrophages (Raw 264. 7) through measuring the direct stimulatory production of pro-inflammatory mediator and cytokines as well as the suppression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulatory response by the two extracts. Gel permeation chromatography was used to fractionate and isolate phytochemicals for characterization of ginseng extracts. Results AQ extract up-regulated the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) while ALC extract did not. ALC extract but not AQ extract suppressed LPS-induced macrophage NO and TNF-α production. These immuno-stimulatory and suppressive effects were exhibited at similar extract concentrations. Moreover, the macrophage-stimulating activity of the AQ extract was inhibited in the presence of ALC extract. Fractionation of AQ extract revealed the presence of two major peaks at 230 nm with average molecular weights of 73, 000 and 37, 000 Da. The first fraction had similar elution volume as the crude polysaccharide (PS) fraction isolated from the AQ extract, and it was the only bioactive species. Parallel fractionation study of ALC extract yielded similar elution profiles; however, both sub-fractions were devoid of PS. Fraction I of the ALC extract suppressed LPS-induced NO production dose-dependently. Conclusion ALC extract of NA ginseng, which was devoid of PS, was immuno-inhibitory whereas the AQ extract, which contained PS, was immuno-stimulatory. These extract-related anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects may be considered as the Yin and Yang actions of ginseng. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cylindrocarpon destructans/Ilyonectria radicicola {{is thought}} to cause both rusty symptom and root-rot disease of <b>American</b> and Korean <b>ginseng.</b> Root-rot disease poses a more serious threat to ginseng roots than rusty symptoms, which we argue result from the plant defense {{response}} to pathogen attack. Therefore, strains causing rotten root are characterized as more aggressive than strains causing rusty symptoms. In this review, we state 1 - the molecular evidence indicating that the root-rot causing strains are genetically distinct considering them as a separate species of Ilyonectria, namely I.  mors-panacis and 2 - the physiological and biochemical differences between the weakly and highly aggressive species {{as well as those}} between rusty and rotten ginseng plants. Eventually, we postulated that rusty symptom occurs on ginseng roots due to incompatible interactions with the weakly aggressive species of Ilyonectria, by the established iron-phenolic compound complexes while root-rot is developed by I.  mors-panacis infection due to the production of high quantities of hydrolytic and oxidative fungal enzymes which destroy the plant defensive barriers, in parallel with the pathogen growth stimulation by utilizing the available iron. Furthermore, we highlight future areas for study that will help elucidate the complete mechanism of root-rot disease development...|$|R
40|$|Oxidized low-density {{lipoprotein}} (Ox-LDL) {{is believed to}} be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Panax quinquefolium saponins (PQS) are extracted from the stems and leaves of the North <b>American</b> form of <b>ginseng,</b> Panax quinquefolium. Earlier studies have suggested that this extract improves the lipid profile of hyperlipidemic rats and has antioxidant properties in cultured rat cardiac myocytes. The aims of the present study were to investigate the potential of PQS in reducing LDL oxidation as well as limiting the ability of Ox-LDL to impair endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat aortic rings. LDL was isolated from the plasma of healthy human donors by sequential ultracentrifugation. Native LDL (0. 2 or 0. 3 mg/ml) was incubated with PQS (0. 25 - 1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 20 °C. For comparison, vitamin C (50 μM) was added in place of PQS. Oxidative modification was initiated with 5 μM CuSO 4 at 37 °C for 0 - 24 h. In our hands, PQS concentration-dependently reduced lipid peroxide levels as measured by the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances formed. This range of PQS also retarded the alterations in relative electrophoretic mobility of Ox-LDL in a similar manner. Furthermore, measurement of phospholipid fractions content indicated that PQS could reduce the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidylcholine in Ox-LDL. Functional studies demonstrated that PQS- pretreated Ox-LDL was less potent than untreated Ox-LDL at impairing endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat aortic rings. In conclusion, our results suggest that PQS has antioxidant properties and that reduction of LDL oxidation by PQS may provide a protective effect against the detrimental actions of Ox-LDL. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Inasmuch as the {{oxidation}} of {{low-density lipoprotein}} (Ox-LDL) {{may play a}} key role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, it has become increasingly important to identify potential antioxidants. Panax quinquefolium saponins (PQS) are extracted from the stems and leaves of the North <b>American</b> form of <b>ginseng,</b> Panax quinquefolium. Our previous studies have indicated that PQS (0. 25 - 1 mg/ml) can protect against oxidation of LDL in vitro. The purpose of the current work was to investigate the potential interaction of lower concentrations of PQS (1 - 100 μg/ml) with vitamin C on the reduction of LDL oxidation. LDL was isolated from the plasma of healthy human donors by sequential ultracentrifugation. Native LDL (0. 05 or 0. 2 mg/ml) was incubated with PQS and/or vitamin C for 30 min at 20 °C. Oxidative modification was initiated with 2 μM or 5 μM CuSO 4 at 37 °C for 0 - 24 h. Pretreatment with PQS (100 μg/ml) reduced alterations in phospholipids, lipid peroxide levels and relative electrophoretic mobility of Ox-LDL. The presence of vitamin C (1 - 10 μM) significantly enhanced the protective effects of PQS. Pretreatment with PQS (1 - 100 μg/ml) resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of LDL oxidation and prolongation of lag time as determined from measurements of conjugated lipid hydroperoxide content in Ox-LDL samples. Interestingly, the inhibitory actions of lower amounts of PQS (1 and 10 μg/ml) on the formation of conjugated dienes were significantly increased when vitamin C (0. 1 or 1 μM) was present. In conclusion, our results suggest that PQS not only have direct antioxidant property but at low concentrations, their actions can be enhanced by vitamin C. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
2500|$|Trade with China, {{originally}} {{an enterprise}} of seemingly limited prospects involving significant risk instead {{turned out to}} be extremely lucrative. American traders, now with a stable foothold in Guangzhou, were eager to sell their goods to China; the extravagant mandarins in China, in turn, were excited at the idea of buying such goods. [...] The first item that tended to sell in China was Spanish bullion: American traders would devote large sums of money to buying and amassing large quantities of the currency for export to China. [...] Bullion was primarily used to complement the less profitable American goods such as cheese, grain, and rum. Use of bullion eventually became considerable with over $62 million worth of specie traded to China between 1805 and 1825. This practice, however, gradually declined after 1815, when American merchants began to participate in [...] "chain trade" [...] routes —the buying and selling of goods en route to Guangzhou. The second major —and by far the most lucrative— American export to China was ginseng. [...] Hailed by the Chinese among other cultures, as shown by the genus' Latinate scientific name Panax, as a panacea, the most potent and therefore most demanded type of ginseng, aralia quinquefolia, grew in Manchuria and the Appalachian Mountains. Transported from the interiors of Pennsylvania and Virginia to Philadelphia, New York, or Boston, ginseng was then shipped to China and sold for up to 250 times its weight in silver. Furs were the third-most lucrative American export to China. [...] Searching for another type of item that could be sold to the Chinese aside from specie and <b>ginseng,</b> <b>Americans</b> soon found that the mandarins had a taste for sea otter pelts, which could be inexpensively purchased from the Indians of the northwest coast of America and shipped to Guangzhou. The Chinese mandarins’ desire for bullion, ginseng, and furs was the primary impetus for America's initiation of trade with China. The return of the Empress of China, which had carried all three commodities, and her by now rich crew to Boston in 1785 inspired other Americans to make similar voyages. However, different reasons emerged for maintaining trade with China.|$|R
