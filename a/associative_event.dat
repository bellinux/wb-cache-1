40|$|The dodecameric type II dehydroquinases (DHQases) have {{an unusual}} {{quaternary}} structure in which four trimeric units are arranged with cubic 23 symmetry. The unfolding and refolding behaviour of the enzymes from Streptomyces coelicolor and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been studied. Gel-permeation studies show that, at low concentrations (0. 5 M) of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), both enzymes dissociate into trimeric units, {{with little or}} no change in the secondary or tertiary structure and with a 15 % loss (S. coelicolor) or a 55 % increase (M. tuberculosis) in activity. At higher concentrations of GdmCl, both enzymes undergo sharp unfolding transitions over narrow ranges of the denaturant concentration, consistent with co-operative unfolding of the subunits. When the concentration of GdmCl is lowered by dilution from 6 M to 0. 55 M, the enzyme from S. coelicolor refolds in an efficient manner to form trimeric units, with more than 75 % regain of activity. Using a similar approach the M. tuberculosis enzyme regains less than 35 % activity. From the time courses of the changes in CD, fluorescence and activity of the S. coelicolor enzyme, an outline model for the refolding of the enzyme has been proposed. The model involves a rapid refolding event in which approximately half the secondary structure is regained. A slower folding process follows within the monomer, resulting in acquisition of the full secondary structure. The major changes in fluorescence occur in a second-order process which involves the association of two folded monomers. Regain of activity is dependent on a further <b>associative</b> <b>event,</b> showing that the minimum active unit must be at least trimeric. Reassembly of the dodecameric S. coelicolor enzyme and essentially complete regain of activity can be accomplished if the denatured enzyme is dialysed extensively to remove GdmCl. These results are discussed in terms of the recently solved X-ray structures of type II DHQases from these sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether the {{associative}} interactions between synapses {{that lead to}} long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) can occur between spatially segregated synapses of the medial and lateral temporodentate pathway of the rat. Coconditioning of crossed and ipsilateral pathways resulted in LTP of the crossed system only when the current sinks of the two conditioned pathways overlapped sufficiently. Likewise, conditioning of an ipsilateral pathway alone resulted in LTD of the crossed pathway only when those current sinks overlapped sufficiently. These observations {{support the idea that}} <b>associative</b> <b>events</b> that lead to LTP or LTD can be restricted to a local dendritic domain. The postsynaptic cell can therefore serve as more than one unit of integration for synaptic modification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} aimed at {{assessing}} whether peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) show significant levels of aneuploidy and high percentages of cytogenetic events in vitro, indicating a predisposition to aneuploidy spontaneously, or after chemical treatment in vitro. A group of affected individuals {{and a group of}} unaffected, age-, sex- and smokinghabit- matched controls were identified. Lymphocytes were cultured for analysis of the following cytogenetic parameters: premature centromere division (PCD), satellite associations of acrocentric chromosomes (SA) and micronuclei (MN). In a subset of subjects, the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique was combined with the MN assay, by means of a pancentromeric DNA probe for the detection of the presence of centric material. To evaluate the sensitivity to aneuploidogenic agents, in vitro treatment of lymphocytes of affected individuals was performed by adding griseofulvin, a chemical whose supposed target is microtubule-associated protein(s). Both the spontaneous frequency of MN and the frequency of PCD was significantly higher in patient cells than in controls. Furthermore, after application of the FISH technique, we found that the majority of MN were composed of whole chromosomes (because of the phenomenon of chromosome loss). Metaphase analysis for the detection of <b>associative</b> <b>events</b> between satellite regions of acrocentric chromosomes showed no {{differences between the two groups}} under study. Analysis of sensitivity to the aneuploidogen griseofulvin showed that the patient group was characterized by lower levels of MN induction compared with controls. Our data confirm that peripheral blood lymphocytes of AD patients are prone to undergo aneuploidy spontaneously in vitro and support the hypothesis that microtubule impairment might be associated with the disease...|$|R

This phenomenon, referred to as "preparedness, has primarily been demonstrated using arbitrary stimuli, such as lights and simple sounds. Very few studies have investigated the ability of animals to learn preferentially about biologically-meaningful stimuli, such s predators, and to our knowledge, no study has tested for the presence of such adaptive biases in a marsupial. 1 page(s...|$|R
30|$|Sensory {{information}} {{arrives at}} the input level. The evolutionary conservation of all synaptic activity, whether it contributes to the neuronal firing or not, indicates {{the presence of a}} well-maintained functional role residing {{at the level of the}} postsynaptic membrane activation (Vadakkan 2015 b). This leads to the following questions. What third-person observed features can provide information about a process that induces internal sensory meaning to the system as a first-person property? What equivalent internal sensory meaning can an object in the environment impart to the system contributing to the formation of internal sensation of its perception? The best experimental condition that this can be used to isolate the mechanism for induction of internal sensation is associative learning. This calls for the asking of a specific question—Can <b>associative</b> learning <b>events</b> impart certain changes at the location of convergence of associatively learned stimuli such that at a later time when one of the stimuli arrives, the internal sensation of the second stimulus will be induced? Once a basic structure–function mechanism of operational units for internal sensations is derived, then its modifications can be examined for internal sensations of other higher brain functions such as perception.|$|R
40|$|Video event {{detection}} is {{an effective}} way to automatically understand the semantic content of the video. However, due to the mismatch between low-level visual features and high-level semantics, the research of video event detection encounters a number of challenges, such as how to extract the suitable information from video, how to represent the event, how to build up reasoning mechanism to infer the event according to video information. In this paper, we propose a novel event detection method. The method detects the video event based on the semantic trajectory, which is a high-level semantic description of the moving object’s trajectory in the video. The proposed method consists of three phases to transform low-level visual features to middle-level raw trajectory information and then to high-level semantic trajectory information. Event reasoning is then carried out with the assistance of semantic trajectory information and background knowledge. Additionally, to release the users’ burden in manual event definition, a method is further proposed to automatically discover the event-related semantic trajectory pattern from the sample semantic trajectories. Furthermore, in order to effectively use the discovered semantic trajectory patterns, the <b>associative</b> classification-based <b>event</b> detection framework is adopted to discover the possibly occurred event. Empirical studies show our methods can effectively and efficiently detect video events...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cognitive {{experiences}} {{during the}} early stages of life {{play an important role in}} shaping the future behavior in mammals but also in insects, in which precocious learning can directly modify behaviors later in life depending on both the timing and the rearing environment. However, whether olfactory associative learning acquired early in the adult stage of insects affect memorizing of new learning events has not been studied yet. Methodology: Groups of adult honeybee workers that experienced an odor paired with a sucrose solution 5 to 8 days or 9 to 12 days after emergence were previously exposed to (i) a rewarded experience through the offering of scented food, or (ii) a non-rewarded experience with a pure volatile compound in the rearing environment. Principal Findings: Early rewarded experiences (either at 1 – 4 or 5 – 8 days of adult age) enhanced retention performance in 9 – 12 -day-conditioned bees when they were tested at 17 days of age. The highest retention levels at this age, which could not be improved with prior rewarded experiences, were found for memories established at 5 – 8 days of adult age. Associative memories acquired at 9 – 12 days of age showed a weak effect on retention for some pure pre-exposed volatile compounds; whereas the sole exposure of an odor at any younger age did not promote long-term effects on learning performance. Conclusions: The <b>associative</b> learning <b>events</b> that occurred a few days after adult emergence improved memorizing i...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{experiences}} {{during the}} early stages of life {{play an important role in}} shaping future behavior. Behavioral and neural long-term changes after early sensory and associative experiences have been recently reported in the honeybee. This invertebrate is an excellent model for assessing the role of precocious experiences on later behavior due to its extraordinarily tuned division of labor based on age polyethism. These studies are mainly focused on the role and importance of experiences occurred during the first days of the adult lifespan, their impact on foraging decisions and their contribution to coordinate food gathering. Odor-rewarded experiences during the first days of honeybee adulthood alter the responsiveness to sucrose, making young hive bees more sensitive to assess gustatory features about the nectar brought back to the hive and affecting the dynamic of the food transfers and the propagation of food-related information within the colony as well. Early olfactory experiences lead to stable and long-term associative memories that can be successfully recalled after many days, even at foraging ages. Also they improve memorizing of new <b>associative</b> learning <b>events</b> later in life. The establishment of early memories promotes stable reorganization of the olfactory circuits inducing structural and functional changes in the antennal lobe. Early rewarded experiences have relevant consequences at the social level too, biasing dance and trophallaxis partner choice and affecting recruitment. Here, we revised recent results in bees&# 180; physiology, behavior and sociobiology to depict how the early experiences affect their cognition abilities and neural-related circuits...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Develop a {{model for}} {{structured}} and encoded representation of medical information that supports human review, decision support applications, ad hoc queries, statistical analysis, and natural-language processing. DESIGN: A medical information representation model was developed from manual and semiautomated analysis of patient data. The key assumption of the model is that medical information can be represented {{as a series of}} linked events. The event representation has two main components. The first component is a frame or template definition that specifies the attributes of the event. The second component is a structured vocabulary, the terms of which are taken as the values of the slots in the event template structure. Individual event instances are linked by specific named relationships. RESULTS: The proposed model was used to represent a chest-radiograph report. CONCLUSIONS: The event model of medical information representation provides a mechanism for formal definition of the logical structure of medical data and allows explicit time-oriented and <b>associative</b> relationships between <b>event</b> instances...|$|R
40|$|Models {{postulating}} 2 distinctprocessing modes {{have been}} proposed in several topic ar-eas within social and cognitivepsychology. We advance a new conceptual model ofthe 2 processing modes. The structural basis ofthe new model is the idea, supported by psy-chological and neuropsychological evidence, that humans possess 2 memory systems. One system slowly learns general regularities, whereas the other can quicklyform rep-resentations ofunique or novel <b>events.</b> <b>Associative</b> retrieval orpattern completion in the slow-learning system elicited by a salient cue constitutes the effortless processing mode. The secondprocessing mode is more conscious and effortful; it involves the intentional retrieval ofexplicit, symbolically represented rulesfrom eithermemory system and their use to guide processing. After presenting our model, we review existing dual-process models in several areas, emphasizing their similar assumptions of a quick, effortless processing mode that rests on well-learned prior associations and a second, more effortful processing mode that involves rule-based inferences and is employed only when people have both cognitive capacity and motivation. New insights and implica-tions of the modelfor several topic areas are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Learning, {{and hence}} memory, is {{ubiquitous}} not only throughout the animal kingdom, but apparently throughout many {{regions of the}} brain. Is all learning reducible to a single common form? Neuropsychological dissociations suggest that the mammalian brain possesses {{a number of different}} and potentially independent memory systems, with different mechanisms and anatomical dispositions, some of which are neurally widely dispersed and others of which are narrowly organized. Among the types considered are: (i) short-term memory; (ii) knowledge and skills; (iii) stable <b>associative</b> memory; (iv) <b>event</b> memory; and (v) priming. As double or multiple dissociations do not lead to logically inevitable conclusions, {{it has been argued that}} an alternative to multiple memory systems is variable modes of processing. But these, too, would be dissociable on the same lines of evidence. Dissociations, if strong and absolute, have strong pragmatic power when they are combined with evolutionary and neuroscientific evidence. Multiple memory systems may possibly share some common cellular mechanisms, but such mechanisms do not define the separate properties at the systems level...|$|R
40|$|General {{knowledge}} acquisition entails {{the extraction of}} statistical regularities from the environment. At high levels of complexity, this may involve the extraction, and consolidation, of <b>associative</b> regularities across <b>event</b> memories. The underlying neural mechanisms would likely involve a hippocampo-neocortical dialog, as proposed previously for system-level consolidation. To test these hypotheses, we assessed possible differences in consolidation between associative memories containing cross-episodic regularities and unique associative memories. Subjects learned face-location associations, half of which responded to complex regularities regarding the combination of facial features and locations, whereas the other half did not. Importantly, regularities could only be extracted over hippocampus-encoded, associative aspects of the items. Memory was assessed both immediately after encoding and 48 h later, under fMRI acquisition. Our results suggest that processes related to system-level reorganization occur preferentially for regular associations across episodes. Moreover, the build-up of general knowledge regarding regular associations appears to involve the coordinated activity of the hippocampus and mediofrontal regions. The putative cross-talk between these two regions might support a mechanism for regularity extraction. These {{findings suggest that the}} consolidation of cross-episodic regularities may be a key mechanism underlying general {{knowledge acquisition}}...|$|R
40|$|Human {{learning}} and memory {{relies on a}} broad network of neural substrates, and is sensitive {{to a range of}} environmental factors and behaviors. The present studies are designed to investigate the modulation of active exploration behaviors in humans. In the current work, we operationalize exploration in two ways: participants’ spatial navigation (using a computer mouse) in environments containing rewarding and informative stimuli, and participants’ eyegaze activity while viewing images on a computer screen. The study described in Study 1 investigates the relationship between spatial exploration and reward, using participants’ reported anxiety levels to predict between-subject variability in vigor and information-seeking. The study described in Study 2 investigates the relationship between cue-outcome predictive validity and eyegaze behavior during learning; additionally, we test the extent to which differing states of expectation drive differences in eyegaze behavior to novel images. The study described in Study 3 expands on the questions raised in Study 2 : using functional imaging and eyetracking, we investigate the relationship between predictive validity, gaze, and the neural systems supporting active exploration. Taken together, the findings in the present study suggest that emerging certainty in reward outcomes, rather than uncertainty, drives exploration and <b>associative</b> learning for <b>events</b> and their outcomes as well as encoding into long-term memory.

40|$|When someone {{mentions}} {{the name of}} a known person we immediately recall her face and possibly many other traits. This is because we possess the so-called associative memory - the ability to correlate different memories to the same fact or <b>event.</b> <b>Associative</b> memory is such a fundamental and encompassing human ability (and not just human) that the network of neurons in our brain must perform it quite easily. The question is then whether electronic neural networks - electronic schemes that act somewhat similarly to human brains - can be built to perform this type of function. Although the field of neural networks has developed for many years, a key element, namely the synapses between adjacent neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic representation. The {{reason for this is that}} a passive circuit element able to reproduce the synapse behaviour needs to remember its past dynamical history, store a continuous set of states, and be &#x 22;plastic&#x 22; according to the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity. Here we show that all this can be accomplished by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular, by using simple and inexpensive off-the-shelf components we have built a memristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic properties. Most importantly, we have demonstrated experimentally the formation of associative memory in a simple neural network consisting of three electronic neurons connected by two memristor-emulator synapses. This experimental demonstration opens up new possibilities in the understanding of neural processes using memory devices, an important step forward to reproduce complex learning, adaptive and spontaneous behaviour with electronic neural networks...|$|R
40|$|Episodic memory {{refers to}} the storage and {{retrieval}} of information about events in our past. According to dual process models, episodic memory is supported by familiarity which {{refers to the}} rapid and automatic sense of oldness about a previously encoded stimulus, and recollection which refers to the retrieval of contextual information, such as spatial, temporal or other contextual details that bring a specific item to mind. To be clear, familiarity is traditionally assumed to support recognition of item information, whereas recollection supports the recognition of <b>associative</b> information. <b>Event</b> Related Potential (ERP) studies provide support for dual process models, by demonstrating qualitatively distinct patterns of neural activity associated with familiarity (Mid-Frontal old/new effect) and recollection (Left-Parietal old/new effect). In the current thesis, ERPs were used to address two important questions regarding associative recognition – namely, {{the function of the}} neural signal supporting recollection and whether familiarity can contribute to the retrieval of novel associative information. The first series of experiments was aimed at addressing how recollection operates by employing a recently developed continuous source task designed to directly measure the accuracy of retrieval success. To date, the function of recollection has been fiercely debated, with some arguing that recollection reflects the operation of a continuous retrieval process, whereby test cues always elicit some information from memory. Alternatively, recollection may reflect the operation of a thresholded process that allows for retrieval failure, whereby test cues sometimes elicit no information from memory at all. In the current thesis, the Left Parietal effect was found {{to be sensitive to the}} precision of memory responses when recollection succeeded, but was entirely absent when recollection failed. The result clarifies the nature of the neural mechanism underlying successful retrieval whilst also providing novel evidence in support of threshold models of recollection. The second series of experiments addressed whether familiarity could contribute to the retrieval of novel associative information. Recent associative recognition studies have suggested that unitization (whereby multi-component stimuli are encoded as a single item rather than as a set of associated parts) can improve episodic memory by increasing the availability of familiarity during retrieval. To date, however, ERP studies have failed to provide any evidence of unitization for novel associations, whereas behavioural support for unitization is heavily reliant on model specific measures such as ROC analysis. Over three separate associative recognition studies employing unrelated word pairs, the magnitude of the Mid-Frontal old/new effect was found to be modulated by encoding instructions designed to manipulate the level of unitization. Importantly, the results also suggest that different encoding strategies designed to manipulate the level of unitization may be more successful than others. Finally, the results also revealed that differences in behavioural performance and modulation of the Mid-Frontal old/new effect between unitized and non-unitized instructions is greater for unrelated compared to related word pairs. In essence, the results suggest that unitization is better suited to learning completely novel associations as opposed to word pairs sharing a pre-existing conceptual relationship. Overall, the data presented in this thesis supports dual process accounts of episodic memory, suggesting that at a neural level of analysis, recollection is both thresholded and variable, whilst also supporting the assumption that familiarity can contribute to successful retrieval of novel associative information. The results have important implications for our current understanding of cognitive decline and the development of behavioural interventions aimed at alleviating associative deficits...|$|R
