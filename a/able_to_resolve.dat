5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination {{that supported the}} theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1445, Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{was asked}} to assume the Polish throne vacated upon {{the death of his}} brother Władysław. Casimir was a tough {{negotiator}} and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 on his own terms. His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group. He replaced their influence with a power base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> a conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor.|$|E

5|$|Once he {{was back}} in Egypt, Hargest was {{critical}} of Freyberg's conduct of the fighting on Crete in a meeting with General Archibald Wavell, commander of the Allied forces in the Middle East. He expressed similar views in a meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, who was in Egypt at the time on a visit to the New Zealand forces. He also voiced concern over what he considered to be a lack of consultation by Freyberg with his senior commanders. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> his differences with Freyberg and in later correspondence with Fraser expressed his satisfaction with the way Freyberg dealt with his subordinates. Hargest's own performance on Crete escaped official scrutiny and he was awarded a bar to his DSO. He was also awarded the Greek War Cross for his services in the military campaigns in Greece and Crete.|$|E

The early Carnian pistosaur Bobosaurus was found to be one step more advanced than Augustasaurus in relation to the Plesiosauria and therefore it represented by definition the basalmost known plesiosaur. This analysis focused on basal plesiosaurs and therefore only one derived pliosaurid and one cryptoclidian were included, while elasmosaurids weren't included at all. A more detailed analysis published by both Benson and Druckenmiller in 2014 was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> the relationships among the lineages at the base of Plesiosauria.|$|E

25|$|Since their {{independence}} from Portugal and Spain {{in the early}} 19th century, the Empire of Brazil and the Spanish-American countries of South America were troubled by territorial disputes. All nations in the region had lingering boundary conflicts with multiple neighbors. Most had overlapping claims to same territories. These issues were questions inherited from their former metropoles, which, despite several attempts, were never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> them satisfactorily. Signed by Portugal and Spain in 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas was proved ineffective in the following centuries as both colonial powers expanded their frontiers in South America and elsewhere. The outdated boundary lines did not represent actual occupation of lands by Portuguese and Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Competition and interracial {{tensions}} between European Americans and non-white miners erupted on Christmas Eve 1858, with {{the beating of}} Isaac Dixon, a freed American black. He was the town barber and in later years was a popular journalist in the Cariboo. Dixon was beaten by two men from Hill's Bar, the other main town {{in the southern part}} of the goldfields. The complicated series of events that ensued is known as McGowan's War. Its potential to provoke United States annexation ambitions within the goldfields, prompted the governor to send newly appointed Chief Justice Begbie, the colony's chief of police Chartres Brew and a contingent of Royal Engineers and Royal Marines to intervene. They did not need to use force, and were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> the matter peacefully. The team also dealt with the corruption of British appointees in the area, which had contributed to the crisis.|$|E
25|$|Back in the present, an {{encounter}} with Kulan Gath results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. After the Giant-Man Pym spends some time appearing almost emotionally stunted, reciting facts with no sense of emotional depth even when facing the new threat of a supercharged Count Nefaria, the Yellowjacket Pym replaces him, only for his impulsive nature to making a situation worse when Diablo turns an entire village into variations of the Hulk, Yellowjacket's plan to stop the Hulks resulting in them merging into one massive Hulk before he can shrink {{it down to a}} more manageable level. The two versions begin to deteriorate from being apart, but are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other. Pym is eventually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona once again.|$|E

25|$|Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Sonny Crockett, but since it was not lucrative for film stars to venture into television at the time, other candidates {{were considered}}. Mickey Rourke was also {{considered for the}} role, but he turned down the offer. Larry Wilcox, of CHiPs, was also a candidate for the role of Crockett, but the producers felt that going from one police officer role to another would not be a good fit. After dozens of candidates and a twice-delayed pilot shooting, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas were chosen as the vice cops. For Johnson, who was by then 34 years old, NBC had particular doubts about the several earlier unsuccessful pilots in which he had starred. After two seasons, Johnson threatened to walk from the series as part of a highly publicized contract dispute. The network was ready to replace him with Mark Harmon, who had recently departed St. Elsewhere, but the network and Johnson were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> their differences and he continued with the series until its end. Actor Jimmy Smits played Eddie Rivera, Crockett's partner who is killed early in the pilot episode.|$|E
25|$|On 9 March 1975, Kohl and the CDU faced {{re-election}} in Rhineland-Palatinate. What placed Kohl, who intended {{to run for}} chancellor, under increased pressure {{was the fact that}} the sister parties of CDU and CSU were set to decide upon their leading candidate for the upcoming federal elections in mid-1975. CSU chairman Franz Josef Strauß had ambitions to run and publicly put Kohl under pressure over what a result would be acceptable in the state elections. On election day, the CDU achieved a result of 53.9 per cent, the highest ever result in the state, consolidating Kohl's position. Strauß' bid for the chancellorship was further put into jeopardy when in March 1975 the magazine Der Spiegel published a transcript of a speech held in November 1974, in which Strauß claimed that the Red Army Faction, a West German armed struggle group responsible for multiple attacks at the time, had sympathizers in the ranks of the SPD and FDP. The scandal deeply unsettled the public and effectively ruled out Strauß for the candidacy. On 12 May 1975, the federal board of the CDU unanimously nominated Kohl as the candidate for the general elections, without consulting their Bavarian sister party beforehand. In reaction, the CSU nominated Strauß and only a mediation by former chancellor Kiesinger was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> the issue and confirm Kohl as the candidate for both parties. In June 1975, Kohl was also re-elected as party chairman, achieving a result of 98.44 per cent.|$|E
