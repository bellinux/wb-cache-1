5|$|John's {{attempt to}} impose de Gray's {{election}} as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 {{was the beginning}} of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the months}} {{preceding}} the national selection, rumors flooded Eurovision news websites about which artist would be representing Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. There was an internal selection for the artist, being {{chosen by the}} broadcaster, while {{there would be a}} national final for the song, with the public having <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the choice.|$|E
5|$|Administrator Webb {{realized}} {{that in order}} to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.|$|E

5|$|An Assembly of Notables (the members {{consisted}} of magistrates, mayors, nobles and clergy) was convened in February 1787 {{to ratify the}} financial reforms sought by the Controller-General of Finance Charles Alexandre de Calonne. This provided the Count of Provence, who abhorred the radical reforms proposed by Calonne, the opportunity he had long been waiting for to establish himself in politics. The reforms proposed a new property tax, and new elected provincial assemblies that would have <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> local taxation. Calonne's proposition was rejected outright by the notables, and, as a result, Louis XVI dismissed him. The Archbishop of Toulouse, Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, acquired Calonne's ministry. Brienne attempted to salvage Calonne's reforms, but ultimately failed to convince the notables to approve them. A frustrated Louis XVI dissolved the assembly.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{promoted}} and practised the Führerprinzip. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates {{to their}} superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed {{himself in a}} position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he—like other top Nazi officials—had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler. Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer, as he felt to do so would put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> armaments production.|$|E
5|$|Marcos {{initially}} {{needed to}} win votes of the delegates of the Nacionalista Party for the presidential candidacy. Imelda assumed the managerial position in her husband's campaign. The other candidates of the party noted her enthusiasm during the campaign; she met with and befriended every single delegate of the 1,347 who would have <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the Nacionalista Party Convention. She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda {{was the only one}} who went through a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E

5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|After peace returned, Gibraltar {{underwent}} {{major changes}} during the reformist governorship of General Sir George Don, who {{took up his}} position in 1814. The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but Gibraltar was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding St Bernard's Hospital to serve the civilian population and initiating {{the construction of the}} Cathedral of the Holy Trinity to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians. For the first time, civilians began to have <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers. A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a Crown colony. In the same year, the Gibraltar Police Force was established, modelled on London's pioneering Metropolitan Police Service, and a Supreme Court was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.|$|E

5|$|In 1995 {{the team}} regressed further, losing even more players to free agency and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 5–11 record, their worst since Bill Parcells' first season in 1983. Quarterback Dave Brown was particularly disappointing, as he finished with just 2,814yards and 11 touchdowns on the season. Reeves went public with his desire to have more of <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> personnel matters. He controlled the team's free agency decisions, but feuded with General manager (GM) George Young who chose the team's draft picks.* Pervin. pg. 124 Lowlights were a 35–0 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in the Monday Night season opener, and the fans pelting the Charger sideline with snowballs in the season's final game.

5|$|In February 2008, Lazcano Lazcano sent Treviño Morales to kill rival {{drug traffickers}} and {{take control of}} the drug {{trafficking}} routes in Guatemala. Reportedly, he carried out a military-like ambush that resulted in the death of the Guatemalan drug lord Juan José León Ardón (alias Juancho) in March. An unnamed U.S. official said that Treviño Morales may have been the man who fired the bullet that killed the drug kingpin. Having succeeded outside of Mexico, Treviño Morales was appointed by Lazcano Lazcano as the national commander of Los Zetas, a position traditionally reserved to Zetas members with military background. In this position, Treviño Morales had <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> nearly all the decisions Los Zetas made at a national level, creating some resentment among the old-generation commanders of Los Zetas who, unlike him, had been in the Mexican Armed Forces before turning to the drug trade.|$|E
5|$|In early 1148, Foliot {{accompanied}} Theobald of Bec to the Council of Reims, {{even though}} the archbishop had been forbidden to attend by King Stephen; Foliot was presumably with Theobald when the archbishop used a small fishing boat in his escape from England to the continent. Robert de Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, died at the Council of Reims, and Foliot was nominated by Pope Eugene III to fill the Diocese of Hereford, which was held by the Angevin cause. Theobald was behind the appointment, having urged it on the pope. It appears likely that before his consecration Foliot gave assurances {{that he would not}} swear fealty to Stephen. He was consecrated Bishop of Hereford on 5September 1148 at Saint-Omer by Archbishop Theobald. The other English bishops present at Reims—Hilary of Chichester and Josceline de Bohon—refused to help with the consecration, claiming it was contrary to custom for an English bishop to be consecrated outside England. Another of the bishops' concerns was that the pope had infringed Stephen's right to <b>a</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the election. After his consecration Foliot swore fealty to Henry of Anjou, the son of the Empress and the new head of the Angevin party.|$|E
