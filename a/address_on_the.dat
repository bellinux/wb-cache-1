Rhodes, on the verge of becoming Prime Minister of Cape Colony, was a vocal advocate of Southern African political and economic unity. Now, on the occasion of this visit, Smuts chose to give his <b>address</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theme of Pan-Africanism.|$|E
5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street <b>address</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E

25|$|On 22 March 2007, {{three men}} {{were arrested in}} {{connection}} with the bombings. Two were arrested at 1pm at Manchester Airport, attempting to board a flight bound for Pakistan that afternoon. They were apprehended by undercover officers who had been following the men as part of a surveillance operation. They had not intended to arrest the men that day, but believed they could not risk letting the suspects leave the country. A third man was arrested in the Beeston area of Leeds at an <b>address</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street where one of the suicide bombers had lived before the attacks.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 2007, an American Greetings Christmas card {{sent to the}} Chronicle, postmarked 1990 in Eureka had {{recently}} been discovered in their photo files by editorial assistant Daniel King. Inside the envelope, with the card, was a photocopy of two U.S. Postal keys on a magnet keychain. The handwriting on the envelope resembles Zodiac's print, but was declared inauthentic by forensic document examiner Lloyd Cunningham. However, not all Zodiac experts agree with Cunningham's analysis. There is no return <b>address</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> envelope nor is his crossed-circle signature to be found. The card itself is unmarked. The Chronicle turned over all the material to the Vallejo Police Department for further analysis.|$|E
25|$|At a sysop {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised {{that it would be}} nice if there was some way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special <b>address</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E

On September 17, 1859, Abraham Lincoln delivered an <b>address</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building's steps. Eight other presidents have visited the courthouse, either as presidents or during presidential campaigns. They are Andrew Johnson, James Garfield, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton.|$|E
500|$|In 1863, {{during the}} Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln sent Beecher on a {{speaking}} tour of Europe {{to build support}} for the Union cause. Beecher's speeches helped turn European popular sentiment against the rebel Confederate States of America and prevent its recognition by foreign powers. At the close of the war in April 1865, Beecher was invited to speak at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, where the first shots of the war had been fired; Lincoln had again personally selected him, stating, [...] "We had better send Beecher down to deliver the <b>address</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> occasion of raising the flag because {{if it had not been}} for Beecher there would have been no flag to raise." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1883, the American Bar Association began {{exploring}} {{the concept of}} dual federalism. Because of his personal acquaintance with James Madison, whom he characterized as a proponent of dual federalism, Stevenson delivered an <b>address</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject at the Association's annual meeting. Stevenson maintained that Madison believed strongly in {{the rights of the}} sovereign states and regarded a Supreme Court appeal as [...] "a remedy for trespass on the reserved rights of the states by unconstitutional acts of Congress." [...] Stevenson was elected its president that year's and his address published. Association member Richard Vaux characterized Stevenson's presidential report reviewing state and federal legislation in 1885 as [...] "most interesting and valuable to the profession".|$|E
