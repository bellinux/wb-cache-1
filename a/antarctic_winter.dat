25|$|King {{penguins}} and emperor penguins also do {{not build}} nests; instead, they tuck their eggs and chicks between their feet and folds of skin on their lower bellies. They are thus able to move about while incubating, though in practice only the emperor penguin regularly does so. Emperor penguins breed during the harshest months of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>winter,</b> and their mobility allows them to form huge huddled masses which help them to withstand the extremely high winds and low temperatures of the season. Without the ability to share body heat (temperatures in the centre of tight groups can {{be as much as}} 10C above the ambient air temperature), the penguins would expend far more energy trying to stay warm, and breeding attempts would probably fail.|$|E
500|$|Antarctica is {{colder than}} the Arctic for three reasons. First, {{much of the}} {{continent}} is more than [...] above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>winter),</b> and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder <b>Antarctic</b> <b>winter</b> (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.|$|E

In order to study the characteristics of PSC's at higher spatial and temporal resolution than that possible from the satellite observations, aircraft missions were conducted within the Arctic polar night vortex in Jan. 1984 and Jan. 1986 using the NASA Langley Research Center airborne dual polarization ruby lidar system.

40|$|In {{the recent}} WMO {{assessment}} of ozone depletion, the minimum ozone column {{is used to}} assess the evolution of the polar ozone layer simulated in several chemistry-climate models (CCMs). The ozone column may be strongly influenced by changes in transport and is therefore not well-suited to identify changes in chemistry. The quantification of chemical ozone depletion can be achieved with tracer-tracer correlations (TRAC). For forty <b>Antarctic</b> <b>winters</b> (1960 - 1999), we present the seasonal chemical depletion simulated with the ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM model. Analyzing methane - ozone correlations, we find a mean chemical ozone loss of 80 +/- 10 DU during the 1990 s, with a maximum of 94 DU. Compared to ozone loss deduced from HALOE measurements the model underestimates chemical loss by 37 %. The average multidecadal trend in loss from 1960 to 1999 is 17 +/- 3 DU per decade. The largest contribution to this trend comes from the 62 +/- 11 DU ozone loss increase between the 1970 s and 1990 s...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the polar ozone loss processes during 10 recent <b>Antarctic</b> <b>winters</b> is presented with high-resolution MIMOSA–CHIM (Modèle Isentrope du transport Méso-échelle de l'Ozone Stratosphérique par Advection avec CHIMie) model simulations and high-frequency polar vortex observations from the Aura microwave limb sounder (MLS) instrument. The high-frequency measurements and simulations help to characterize the winters and assist the interpretation of interannual variability better than either data or simulations alone. Our model results for the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>winters</b> of 2004 – 2013 show that chemical ozone loss starts in the edge region of the vortex at equivalent latitudes (EqLs) of 65 – 67 ° S in mid-June–July. The loss progresses with time at higher EqLs and intensifies during August–September over the range 400 – 600 K. The loss peaks in late September–early October, when all EqLs (65 – 83 ° S) show a similar loss and the maximum loss (> 2 ppmv – parts per million by volume) is found over a broad vertical range of 475 – 550 K. In the lower stratosphere, most winters show similar ozone loss and production rates. In general, at 500 K, the loss rates are about 2 – 3 ppbv sh − 1 (parts per billion by volume per sunlit hour) in July and 4 – 5 ppbv sh − 1 in August–mid-September, while they drop rapidly to 0 by mid-October. In the middle stratosphere, the loss rates are about 3 – 5 ppbv sh − 1 in July–August and October at 675 K. On average, the MIMOSA–CHIM simulations show that the very cold winters of 2005 and 2006 exhibit a maximum loss of ~ 3. 5 ppmv around 550 K or about 149 – 173 DU over 350 – 850 K, and the warmer winters of 2004, 2010, and 2012 show a loss of ~ 2. 6 ppmv around 475 – 500 K or 131 – 154 DU over 350 – 850 K. The winters of 2007, 2008, and 2011 were moderately cold, and thus both ozone loss and peak loss altitudes are between these two ranges (3 ppmv around 500 K or 150 ± 10 DU). The modeled ozone loss values are in reasonably good agreement with those estimated from Aura MLS measurements, but the model underestimates the observed ClO, largely due to the slower vertical descent in the model during spring...|$|R

In the middle stratosphere, the loss rates are about 3 – 5 ppbv sh− 1 in July–August and October at 675 K. It is found that the Antarctic ozone hole (June–September) is controlled by the halogen cycles at about 90 – 95 % (ClO–ClO, BrO–ClO, and ClO–O) and the loss above 700 K is dominated by the NOx cycle at about 70 – 75 %. On average, the Mimosa-Chim simulations show that the very cold winters of 2005 and 2006 exhibit a maximum loss of ~ 3. 5 ppmv around 550 K or about 149 – 173 DU over 350 – 850 K and the warmer winters of 2004, 2010, and 2012 show a loss of ~ 2. 6 ppmv around 475 – 500 K or 131 – 154 DU over 350 – 850 K.

The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink's ideas.
