50|$|The <b>autodyne</b> circuit was an {{improvement}} to radio signal amplification using the De Forest Audion vacuum tube amplifier. By allowing the tube to oscillate at a frequency slightly {{different from the}} desired signal, the sensitivity over other receivers was greatly improved. The <b>autodyne</b> circuit was invented by Edwin Howard Armstrong of Columbia University, New York, NY. He inserted a tuned circuit in the output circuit of the Audion vacuum tube amplifier. By adjusting the tuning of this tuned circuit, Armstrong was able to dramatically increase the gain of the Audion amplifier. Further increase in tuning resulted in the Audion amplifier reaching self-oscillation.|$|E
50|$|The pentagrid {{proved to}} be a much better mixer. Since the {{oscillator}} circuit was more or less self-contained, good feedback for reliable oscillation across the frequency range was easy to obtain. Some manufacturers that had adopted the <b>autodyne</b> mixer converted some, if not all, of their designs to pentagrid mixers.|$|E
50|$|The typical damped wave {{receiver}} was ineffective {{for receiving}} CW because CW had no audible modulation. Several methods {{were employed to}} generate an audible tone at the receiver: (1) a chopper, (2) a variable condensor with rotating plates (slope demodulation), (3) a tikker, (4) a separate heterodyne, and (5) the <b>autodyne.</b>|$|E
50|$|More recently, <b>autodyne</b> {{converters}} {{are employed}} in radio receivers for the AM and FM broadcast band. A single transistor combines the functions of amplifier, mixer and local oscillator of an otherwise conventional superheterodyne receiver. Such a stage accepts as input the antenna signal, and provides an output to the intermediate frequency amplifier. In this application, the transistor is made to self-oscillate at the local oscillator frequency.|$|E

5000|$|When Marion met Edwin Armstrong {{she was the}} {{secretary}} of David Sarnoff then an executive at RCA.Armstrong was then both an inventor and Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University. He had sold his patents for the <b>autodyne</b> (regenerative circuit) and superheterodyne receiver to Westinghouse, which then owned RCA, making him a millionaire, and owner of a large block of RCA stock.Marion was described as [...] "tall and strikingly handsome".|$|E
50|$|When the <b>autodyne</b> {{oscillator}} was {{advanced to}} self-oscillation, continuous wave Morse code dots and dashes would be clearly heard {{as a series}} of beeps, instead of an all but impossible to decode series of thumps. Spark and chopped CW (ICW) had audio tones which didn't require an oscillating detector to extract from the radio signal.Such a regenerative circuit is capable of receiving weak signals, if carefully coupled to an antenna. Antenna coupling interacts with tuning, making optimum adjustments difficult.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after Armstrong {{invented the}} superheterodyne, a triode mixer stage design was {{developed}} {{that not only}} mixed the incoming signal with the local oscillator, but the same valve doubled as the oscillator. This {{was known as the}} <b>autodyne</b> mixer. Early examples had difficulty oscillating across the frequency range because the oscillator feedback was via the first intermediate frequency transformer primary tuning capacitor, which was too small to give good feedback. Also keeping the oscillator signal out of the antenna circuit was difficult.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of the circuit was that the tube {{could be made to}} oscillate, and thus a single tube could serve as both a beat frequency oscillator and a detector, functioning as a heterodyne receiver to make CW radiotelegraphy transmissions audible. [...] This mode was called an <b>autodyne</b> receiver. To receive radiotelegraphy, the feedback was increased until the tube oscillated, then the oscillation frequency was tuned {{to one side of the}} transmitted signal. The incoming radio carrier signal and local oscillation signal mixed in the tube and produced an audible heterodyne (beat) tone at the difference between the frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The Allied fuze used {{constructive}} {{and destructive}} interference to detect its target. The design had four tubes.

When a target was nearby, it would reflect {{a significant portion of the}} oscillator's signal back to the fuze. The amplitude of the reflected signal indicated the closeness of the target. This reflected signal would affect the oscillator depending on the round trip distance from the fuze to the target. If the reflected signal were in phase, the oscillator amplitude would increase and the oscillator's plate current would also increase. If the reflected signal were out of phase, then the plate current would decrease.|$|E
