40|$|A {{planetary}} gear system includes a sun gear coupled to an annular ring gear through a plurality of twist-planet gears, a speeder gear, and a ground structure having an internal ring gear. Each planet gear includes a solid gear having a first half portion {{in the form of}} a spur gear which includes vertical gear teeth and a second half portion {{in the form of a}} spur gear which includes helical gear teeth that are offset from the vertical gear teeth and which contact helical gear teeth on the speeder gear and helical gear teeth on the outer ring gear. One half of the twist planet gears are preloaded downward, while the other half are preloaded upwards, each one alternating with the other so that each one twists in a motion opposite to its neighbor when rotated until each planet gear seats against the sun gear, the outer ring gear, the speeder gear, and the inner ring gear. The resulting configuration is an improved stiff <b>anti-backlash</b> <b>gear</b> system...|$|E
40|$|A {{closed loop}} PC based {{system has been}} {{developed}} to drive a stepper motor to control the exit area of an isolated Air intake model. The exit area of the intake model is rectangular, which can be varied by turning a rectangular butterfly valve. The valve is connected to a shaft which is driven by a 6 V DC stepper motor. The motor operates at 200 pulses per revolution which corresponds to 1. 8 /pulse. During the run, the butterfly valve is operated from fully open to nearly closed state, a reduction gearbox (reduction ratio = 1 : 15) further reduces the speed of rotation to 0. 12  per pulse. The PC based software for the stepper motor control provides the chosen number of pulses with a resolution of 1 pulse, equivalent to  0. 12 . The motor shaft is also connected {{to a pair of}} <b>anti-backlash</b> <b>gears,</b> used to drive a 10 -turn potentiometer. The output of the potentiometer is calibrated and used to determine the valve position during the run. The software developed can run the motor at any number of chosen steps. After the required steps are achieved, the valve can be driven in reverse direction through any number of chosen steps, which could be the same as forward path or different. The hardware and software are established in such a manner that the whole system could be stopped automatically once the requirement for a particular experiment is over. The complete details of the control set-up i. e. hardware as well as software are included in this report. The whole set-up developed in this work was effectively useful for conducting wind tunnel tests on an isolated supersonic intake in the NAL 0. 3 m Wind tunnel as reported in the Project Document No. TM 0110...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, <b>anti-backlash</b> planetary <b>gear</b> {{system that has}} an input sun gear, a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' gear above the sun gear, a split ring gear that has a fixed lower ring gear coaxial with the sun gear and a rotating upper ring gear also coaxial with the sun gear. A preload bolt is used for securing the split ring gears together. Within the split ring gear is an even number of planet gears between the split ring gear and the sun gear. Each planet gear consists of an upper planet gear, and lower planet gear with {{the upper and lower}} planet gears splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and lower planet gears. The lower planet gear meshes with the input sun gear and the fixed ring gear while the upper planet gear is driven by the lower planet gear and meshes with the rotating ring gear...|$|R
