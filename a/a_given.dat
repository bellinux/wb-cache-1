5|$|Lemoine's {{system of}} constructions, the Géométrographie, {{attempted}} {{to create a}} methodological system by which constructions could be judged. This system enabled a more direct process for simplifying existing constructions. In his description, he listed five main operations: placing a compass's end on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> point, placing it on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> line, drawing a circle with the compass placed upon the aforementioned point or line, placing a straightedge on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> line, and extending the line with the straightedge.|$|E

5|$|As Hilary Putnam writes, Von Neumann {{replaced}} {{classical logic}} with a logic constructed in orthomodular lattices (isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert space of <b>a</b> <b>given</b> physical system).|$|E
5|$|At <b>a</b> <b>given</b> {{temperature}} a {{lipid bilayer}} can exist {{in either a}} liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers <b>a</b> <b>given</b> lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E

5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in <b>a</b> <b>given</b> region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in <b>a</b> <b>given</b> region.|$|E
