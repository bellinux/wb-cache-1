5|$|Savage {{returned}} to San Francisco {{with his wife}} to stay for ten years, raising a daughter and taking part in <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>business.</b> He served at the rank of colonel in the California National Guard, and {{took part in the}} social activity of the city. During a period of anti-Chinese race riots, Savage stood up for law and order, and thereby gained the respect of San Francisco's leaders, property holders and middle class residents. Savage traveled to many exotic lands but in 1890 he was struck with jungle fever in Honduras. While recuperating in New York state he wrote his first book: My Official Wife. This very successful action-and-adventure story was followed by more, at the rate of about three per year, written for the general public rather than for literary critics; the latter were charmed by the first book but scathing of many later ones. Savage lived primarily in New York City, and was involved in lawsuits, especially against his New York publisher regarding unpaid royalties.|$|E

Based on these findings, we believe that SEST has much to offer {{to the study of}} <b>family</b> and nonfamily <b>businesses...</b>|$|R
