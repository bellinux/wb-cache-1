40|$|In mice, {{targeted}} deletion of the {{serine protease}} HtrA 2 (also known as Omi) causes mitochondrial dysfunction {{leading to a}} neurodegenerative disorder with parkinsonian features. In humans, point mutations in HtrA 2 are a susceptibility factor for Parkinson's disease (PARK 13 locus). Mutations in PINK 1, a putative mitochondrial protein kinase, {{are associated with the}} PARK 6 autosomal recessive locus for susceptibility to early-onset Parkinson's disease. Here we determine that HtrA 2 interacts with PINK 1 and that both are components of the same stress-sensing pathway. HtrA 2 is phosphorylated on activation of the p 38 pathway, occurring in a PINK 1 -dependent manner at a residue <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> found mutated in patients with Parkinson's disease. HtrA 2 phosphorylation is decreased in brains of patients with Parkinson's disease carrying mutations in PINK 1. We suggest that PINK 1 -dependent phosphorylation of HtrA 2 might modulate its proteolytic activity, thereby contributing to an increased resistance of cells to mitochondrial stress...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that chronic treatment of chick embryos [from embryonic day 5 (E 5) to E 9] with NMDA rescues spinal cord motoneurons (MNs) from programmed cell death. In this situation, MNs exhibit <b>a</b> reduced vulnerability <b>to</b> acute excitotoxic lesions and downregulate NMDA and AMPA–kainate receptors. Here, {{we report that}} this treatment results in long-lasting sublethal structural changes in MNs. In Nissl-stained sections from the spinal cord of NMDA-treated embryos, MNs display <b>an</b> area <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> eccentrically <b>positioned</b> nucleus in which basophilia is excluded. Ultrastructurally, MNs accumulate tubulovesicular structures surrounded by Golgi stacks. Thiamine pyrophosphatase but not acid phosphatase was detected inside the tubulovesicular structures, which are resistant to disruption by brefeldin A or monensin.

40|$|Crack {{detection}} for bridge {{bottom surfaces}} via remote sensing techniques {{is undergoing a}} revolution in the last few years. For such applications, a large amount of images, acquired with high-resolution industrial cameras close to the bottom surfaces with some mobile platform, are required to be stitched into a wide-view single composite image. The conventional idea of stitching a panorama with the affine model or the homographic model always suffers a series of serious problems due to poor texture and out-of-focus blurring introduced by depth of field. In this paper, we present <b>a</b> novel method <b>to</b> seamlessly stitch these images aided by 3 D structure lines of bridge bottom surfaces, which are extracted from 3 D camera data. First, we propose to initially align each image in geometry based on its rough position and orientation acquired with both a laser range finder (LRF) and a high-precision incremental encoder, and these images are divided into several groups with the rough position and orientation data. Secondly, the 3 D structure lines of bridge bottom surfaces are extracted from the 3 D cloud points acquired with 3 D cameras, which impose additional strong constraints on geometrical alignment of structure lines in <b>adjacent</b> images <b>to</b> perform <b>a</b> <b>position</b> and orientation optimization in each group to increase the local consistency. Thirdly, a homographic refinement between groups is applied to increase the global consistency. Finally, we apply a multi-band blending algorithm <b>to</b> generate <b>a</b> large-view single composite image as seamlessly as possible, which greatly eliminates both the luminance differences and the color deviations between images and further conceals image parallax. Experimental results on a set of representative images acquired from real bridge bottom surfaces illustrate the superiority of our proposed approaches...|$|R
40|$|Telomeres are the {{specialized}} nucleoprotein structures that protect {{the ends of}} eukaryotic chromosomes. Vertebrate telomeres consist of several kb of double-stranded TTAGGG repeats, ending in 100 - 200 bases of single-stranded TTAGGG, named 3 ’-overhang. Protection of chromosome termini is achieved through the establishment of specialized structures, whose precise organization is not known yet. Telomeres are organized in nucleosomal arrays, with an unusually shorter spacing than bulk chromatin. Little is known about {{their role in the}} higher order telomeric chromatin structure. In order to investigate structural features of telomeric chromatin, in this thesis a model system has been developed and studied at single molecule level by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging. Human telomeric nucleosomal arrays, reconstituted on a 1500 bp long telomeric DNA have been analyzed. The same nucleosomal arrays have also been studied by a theoretical method, which derives nucleosomal positioning from the sequence-dependent DNA mechanical properties (curvature and flexibility). A satisfactory correlation between the theoretical and experimental results has been obtained, suggesting a relevant role of DNA sequence in telomeric chromatin basic organization. Both the experimental and theoretical telomeric nucleosome positioning appear characterized by nucleosome dyad axis multiple positioning with the six bp periodicity of human telomeric DNA. Moreover, the barriers between adjacent free energy minima of nucleosome formation are so low {{that it is possible to}} consider the nucleosomal organization on human telomeric DNA as almost continuous and the nucleosomes as free moving along DNA. These features suggest a higher mobility of telomeric nucleosomes with respect to that of bulk nucleosomes. Since the intrinsic mobility of telomeric nucleosomes could be a relevant feature in telomeres dynamics, a model system has been set up to study nucleosome mobility. A construct has been realized, in which nucleosomes, initially located at the end of an 800 bp long DNA fragment, are <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strong nucleosome <b>positioning</b> sequence that should act as a nucleosome trap. By a restriction enzyme assay and AFM imaging it has been found a significant higher mobility of telomeric nucleosomes than average sequence nucleosomes. In fact, the mobility of telomeric nucleosome increases rising the temperature and the ionic strength. Moreover, the telomeric nucleosome mobility is influenced by specific telomeric protein, hTRF 1, since hTRF 1 binding to telomeric nucleosome gives rise to significant nucleosome repositioning...|$|R
