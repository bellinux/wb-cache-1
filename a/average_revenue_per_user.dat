40|$|This essay {{examines}} the mobile wireless services industry Canada. The industry {{is on the}} precipice {{of what could be}} a major change in the dynamics of competition. Industry Canada recently facilitated the market entry of new service providers in order to increase competition for the benefit of consumers. This has the potential to affect the success and future growth prospects of the industry?s leading three companies Rogers Communications Inc., Bell Canada Enterprises and Telus Corporation. The paper provides an overview of the industry?s structure, sources of growth, and key challenges. Performance of the leading companies is compared over the past five years. Conclusions are drawn about which company may be best positioned to gain increased market penetration and higher <b>average</b> <b>revenues</b> <b>per</b> <b>user.</b> The paper also highlights sources of advantage that incumbent firms can leverage to maintain their market share in the face of increasing competition and technological change...|$|R
40|$|The {{marketplace}} for mobile {{digital media}} (MDM) {{is not entirely}} new. Whereas networks, content, services, and even regulatory policies have made progress through convergence, the process of re-engineering business models to reflect {{the characteristics of the}} still-evolving market for mobility-based services that might be offered by MDM is still at its beginning. It is already apparent that advertising will in the long run become an important source of revenue for mobile service operators. This paper focuses on and explores the economic logic that should govern mobile operators strategies for incorporating content delivery and ad placements in mobile service offerings. The MDM Marketplace In the face of declining <b>Average</b> <b>Revenues</b> <b>Per</b> <b>User</b> (ARPU), Mobile Network Operators (MNO) have for some time actively solicited alternate revenue streams by offering value-added services, wireless internet, digital content distribution, and a platform for effective advertising.

50|$|<b>Average</b> <b>revenue</b> <b>per</b> <b>user</b> (sometimes {{known as}} average revenue per unit), usually {{abbreviated}} to ARPU, {{is a measure}} used primarily by consumer communications, digital media, and networking companies, defined as the total revenue divided {{by the number of}} subscribers.|$|E
50|$|Mobile market {{penetration}} in Swaziland {{has been well}} above the African average, but subscriber growth has slowed in recent years.

50|$|Also related is ARPPU (<b>Average</b> <b>Revenue</b> <b>Per</b> Paying <b>User)</b> {{which is}} {{calculated}} by dividing up the revenue amongst the users who paid anything at all. This yields {{a figure that}} is significantly larger than ARPU.

40|$|International audienceParalleling the {{increasing}} traffic {{and the associated}} degradation of services in operators' networks, {{there have been numerous}} research initiatives to explore potential solutions to better optimize network resources and maintain a high quality of experience (QoE) for subscribers. Although several possible solutions do exist, the focus {{of this paper is to}} survey one specific emerging family of solutions, called offload. Offloading's primary goal is to avoid transporting low priority traffic in costly networks in order to avoid degrading the perceived QoE. In particular, mobile operators target traffics that cause network congestion without creating any additional revenue. Offloading is based on traffic redirection from parts of the network where congestion could occur to other low-cost parts of the network where capacity is available and less expensive. In this paper, we present a survey on the offload approaches at different parts of the global network (access, core, and gateway). The aim of these approaches is to help mobile operators to face challenges such as capacity crunch, radio access saturation, <b>average</b> <b>revenues</b> <b>per</b> <b>user</b> decrease, and lack of indoor coverage...|$|R

50|$|In 2009 Rolnik {{initiated}} a campaign advocating {{the introduction of}} competition in the cellular telephony market, which was lacking. Following this campaign, Minister of Communications Moshe Kahlon decided to open the market for competition; Israel's cellular telephone bills soon dropped by 50-90% (for example, while Israeli cellular provider Partner’s monthly <b>Average</b> <b>Revenue</b> <b>Per</b> <b>user</b> (ARPU) in 2006-2008 was 161 shekels, by 2015 it fell to 69 shekels, a 57% drop).|$|E
40|$|Next {{generation}} {{mobile communication}} systems will operate at high system bandwidths {{of up to}} 100 MHz and at carrier frequencies beyond 2 GHz to provide peak data rates of up to 1 Gbit/s with similar <b>average</b> <b>revenues</b> <b>per</b> <b>user</b> as todays cellular networks. High bit rates {{should be available to}} all users in a cell which is challenging due to the unfavorable propagation conditions in these bands. In-band relays are a seen as a promising technology for cellular networks to extend the high bit rate coverage and to enable cost efficient network deployments. The research in this thesis has contributed {{to the development of the}} relaying concept within the European research project WINNER. WINNER has designed a next generation radio system concept based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) with the inclusion of relays as one of the major innovations. In our work we have identified the radio resource management as the most important function to exploit the potential benefits of relay based deployments. We develop a flexible radio resource management framework that adapts to a wide range of deployments, whereas our main focus is on metropolitan area deployments. Here we propose to utilize a dynamic resource assignment based on soft frequency reuse. Further, we propose a practical way to integrate cooperative relaying in a relay network. This concept allows the cooperation of multiple radio access points within a relay enhanced cell with low overhead and small delays. In system simulations we compare the performance of relay deployments to base station only deployments in a metropolitan area network. Our results show that relay deployments are cost efficient and they increase both the network throughput as well as the high bit rate coverage of the network. Further, they show that our proposed soft frequency reuse scheme outperforms competing interference coordination schemes in the studied metropolitan area scenario. Even though the results have been obtained for WINNER system parameters, the conclusions can also be applied to OFDMA based systems such as 3 GPP Long Term Evolution and WiMAX...|$|R
