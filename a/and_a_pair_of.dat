5|$|Macroolithus eggs {{have been}} found {{containing}} oviraptorid dinosaur embryos resembling Heyuannia. Multiple other associations between oviraptorid and elongatoolithids (including other eggs containing embryos, parents brooding on nests, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> shelled Macroolithus-like eggs preserved within an oviraptorid's pelvis) confirm that the parent of Macroolithus was an oviraptorid.|$|E
5|$|Mantises have large, {{triangular}} {{heads with}} a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> antennae.

5|$|Following her ACL injury, McLeod did {{not make}} an {{appearance}} for the Canadian national team until July 2009. She made one appearance for the team in 2009 during an international friendly against the United States on July 22, where she allowed one goal. She was noted for making several impressive saves during the match. McLeod returned to training with the national team in November for the 12-day camp in Florida which featured 22 players <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> exhibition matches against local university teams.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E

5|$|The {{guidelines}} set by Judah Benjamin in 1861 {{soon became}} {{the choice of}} the clothing depots across the South as the war went into its second year. This easier-to-produce jacket, with the loosened hat and trouser regulations, made it easier to clothe Confederate infantrymen. The typical uniform by the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862 was a slouch hat or kepi, a shell-jacket, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> sky-blue or gray cloth trousers, with brogans.|$|E
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, and the island-nesting avocet. Other birds nesting in the wetland include northern lapwing, common redshank and sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers. Eurasian spoonbills, ruffs and black-tailed godwits are present {{for much of the}} year, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> little egrets bred {{for the first time in}} 2010–2012.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb of {{treeshrews}} is {{like the}} lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, but only two of its three pairs of lower incisors {{are included in the}} toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> canines.|$|E

5|$|The track layout is {{such that}} each line has its own pair of tracks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> double {{switches}} between these tracks, and each service has its own island platform serving these tracks. In regular operation, no service needs to cross over the tracks of another service. The tracks are numbered sequentially from east to west, with the N train at tracks 1 and 2; the Q at tracks 3 and 4; the F at tracks 5 and 6; and the D at tracks 7 and 8.|$|E
5|$|After a ten-yard gain by Richardson {{to start}} the quarter, Alabama lost a total of seven yards on {{consecutive}} plays and a McCarron incompletion on third down set up a third long field goal attempt. This time the 49-yard attempt from Jeremy Shelley was blocked by Bennie Logan and recovered by Eric Reid who returned it to the Alabama 48. On this LSU possession, Jordan Jefferson took over as the Tigers' quarterback, and LSU gained a first down on a six-yard Michael Ford run <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> short runs by Ware. However, the drive stalled again and Wing was forced to punt for LSU.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War I Kilkis saw {{service in}} the Allied {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea. While supporting the French and British forces defending Sevastopol in April 1919, Kilkis observed mutinies on several French battleships. Her crew taunted the French mutineers by hanging a dummy from the yardarm. Kilkis then returned to Greece. During the subsequent Greco-Turkish War, Kilkis served in support of landings to seize Ottoman territory. On 15 May 1919, she <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> destroyers escorted a convoy of six transports carrying the troops that undertook the occupation of Smyrna and its environs. Kilkis carried Rear Admiral Kaloulides, who thereafter served as the military governor of the city. The Ottoman Navy had been interned by the Allies {{after the end of}} World War I, and so provided no opposition to the Royal Hellenic Navy's activities.|$|E
