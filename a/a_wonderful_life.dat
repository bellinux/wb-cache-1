5|$|In a subplot, Bart and Lisa {{stay at the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, {{and they}} {{discover}} a metal detector in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen {{it turns out to}} be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it but one of the spectators, The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include this happy ending to the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's <b>A</b> <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Life</b> (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E
5|$|The company {{announced}} in November 1945 that its first production would be James Stewart in It's <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Life,</b> produced {{and directed by}} Capra. In Spring 1946 {{it was announced that}} Liberty would be getting a fifth partner, producer-director Victor Fleming, although that deal never saw fruition. The film was released in November 1946, but was a financial failure. Although it was in the top 7% of that year's films as ranked by box office gross, it was unable to recoup its high production cost of $2.3 million, much less show a profit. After the film's release, Briskin became an outspoken advocate for the policy of longer runs for films, allowing them to recoup the cost of production. Without longer runs, he told The Film Daily, the quality of films would decline, as production costs continued to escalate.|$|E
25|$|It's <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Life</b> won {{just the}} one Academy Award, in the Technical Achievement {{category}} for developing a new method of creating artificial snow.

And it was so loud when stepped on that any snow-filled scenes with dialogue had to be re-dubbed afterwards. RKO studio's head of special effects, Russell Sherman, developed a new compound, utilizing water, soap flakes, foamite and sugar.|$|E

25|$|In the 1940s {{there were}} a spate of film dealing with various aspects of heavenly administration: Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Heaven Can Wait (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and It’s <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Life</b> (1946). Beckett {{may or may not}} have seen any of these; at the very least he would have likely read about them. Significantly the opening camera shot of It’s <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Life</b> dissolves slowly upward into the star-filled, dark night sky where two {{pulsating}} galaxies of light come into view. Two heavenly angels are conversing together in the film's otherworldly opening. In Rough for Theatre II, Bertrand and Morvan take time out to specifically discuss the starry night sky.|$|E

40|$|As consolidation, deregulation, and {{technological}} advances transform {{the financial services}} industry, it is generally believed that community banks provide relationship-based banking services for small businesses, family farmers, and depositors of low to moderate wealth. Using data from actual loan applications to a rural community bank (not too dissimilar to It's <b>A</b> <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Life's</b> 'Bailey Building and Loan Company’ in Bedford Falls), the role of relationship lending {{in the market for}} home mortgages is examined for a financial institution with a long-perceived tradition of character lending. No evidence is found that prior account holders are given any advantage in the approval process for a home loan. Nearly all of the loan decisions are based on objective criteria such as personal wealth, debt obligations, and credit score. This has obvious implications for historically underserved consumers who are often rationed out of a credit market that allocates loan funds based solely on credit scoring techniques. ...|$|R
