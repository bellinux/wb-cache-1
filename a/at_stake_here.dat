[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Fueled with plenty of humor, action, heartfelt drama, and amazing new technical feats, Cars is a high octane delight for moviegoers of all ages." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Existing both in turbo-charged today and the gentler '50s, straddling the realms of Pixar styling and old Disney heart, this new-model Cars is an instant classic." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Despite representing another impressive technical achievement, it's the least visually interesting of the computer-animation boutique's movies, and -- in an ironic twist for a story about auto racing -- drifts slowly through its semi-arid midsection." [...] Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "What ultimately redeems Cars from turning out a total lemon is its soul. Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin, and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame." [...] Ella Taylor of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Cars cheerfully hitches cutting-edge animation to a folksy narrative plugging friendship, community and a Luddite mistrust of high tech." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the Internet technology has caused telemedicine diagnosis systems to be commonly available. The most crucial aspect of the patient’s safety in such systems {{is a problem of}} safe diagnosis. There are two factors <b>at</b> the <b>stake</b> <b>here.</b> The first one is a human factor in the form of user; it is especially severe when the user is not a physician. The second one is the accuracy of the diagnosis process. The best way to handle possible diagnosis errors is to apply measures of sensitivity, specificity and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. We examine these measures on a sample diagnosis system against a real-life data. It turns out that values of these measures are strictly associated with another measure: an indication threshold. Therefore, the accuracy of diagnosis may be to a large extent determined by the chosen threshold. We propose several methods for minimizing the impact of this factor...|$|R

50|$|No Byzantine source defines {{directly}} the Amastrianum as a forum, {{but from}} the context {{it is clear that}} it was a public square. Its name derived from the city of Amastris (modern Amasra) in Paphlagonia (a region on the Black Sea coast of north central Anatolia), either because someone from that city who had come to Constantinople for business was killed here, or because it was a place of execution for delinquents, and the Paphlagonians had a reputation for being criminals. According to the Patrologia Latina, the square hosted two statues, respectively of a Paphlagonian and of a slave of him, both always covered with litter and excrement. Indeed the neighbourhood had a very bad reputation, and witnessed several executions. Here Michael III (r. 842-867) let burn the exhumed body of the iconoclast emperor Constantine V Kopronymos (r. 741-775), and Basil the Macedonian (r. 867-886) burned the slaves responsible of having killed their master. In 932, Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920-944) let burn <b>at</b> the <b>stake</b> <b>here</b> Basil the Copper Hand, who assumed the identity of the usurper Constantine Doukas to lead a rebellion in Bithynia. During the Byzantine age, the Amastrianum was also the centre of the horse trade in the city.|$|R

2500|$|Vital First Amendment speech {{principles}} are <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>here.</b> [...] The first danger to liberty lies in granting the State {{the power to}} examine publications {{to determine whether or}} not they are based on some ultimate idea and, if so, for the State to classify them. [...] The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling effect of individual thought and expression. [...] That danger is especially real in the University setting, where the State acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. [...] In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna, Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous assemblages or concourses for students to speak and to write and to learn. [...] The quality and creative power of student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure of a school's influence and attainment. [...] For the University, by regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the Nation's intellectual life, its college and university campuses.|$|E

5000|$|Meanwhile, {{behavioral}} studies provide {{another layer}} to the argument: recent {{studies suggest that}} the caudate is fundamental to goal direction action, that is, [...] "the selection of behavior based on the changing values of goals and a knowledge of which actions lead to what outcomes." [...] One such study presented rats with levers that triggered the release of a cinnamon flavored solution. After the rats learned to press the lever, the researchers changed the value of the outcome (the rats were taught to dislike the flavor either by being given too much of the flavor, or by making the rats ill after drinking the solution) and the effects were observed. Normal rats pressed the lever less frequently, while rats with lesions in the caudate did not suppress the behavior as effectively. In this way, the study demonstrates the link between the caudate and goal-directed behavior; rats with damaged caudate nuclei had difficulty assessing the changing value of the outcome. In a 2003 human behavioral study, a similar process was repeated, but the decision this time was whether or not to trust another person when money was <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> While <b>here</b> the choice was far more complex--the subjects were not simply asked to press a lever, but had to weigh a host of different factors--at the crux of the study was still behavioral selection based on changing values of outcomes.|$|R

We find evidence of a post-privatisation evolution towards more homogeneous equity structures, where dominant categories of owners aim <b>at</b> achieving controlling <b>stakes.</b> <b>Here,</b> the foreign investors and Hungarian corporations play the major role. In addition, focusing on firm level characteristics we find that the exporting firms attract foreign owners, who acquire controlling equity stakes. Similarly, the firm size measurements are positively associated with the presence of foreign investors. However, they are negatively associated with 100 % foreign ownership, possibly because the marginal costs of acquiring additional equity are growing with the size of the assets. We interpret the results in light of the existing theory. In particular, following Demsetz and Lehn (1985) and Demsetz and Villalonga (2001) we argue that equity should not be treated as an exogenous variable. As for specific determinants of equity levels, we focus on informational asymmetries and (unobserved) ownership specific characteristics of foreign investors and Hungarian investors...|$|R
30|$|The main {{obstacles}} {{in a case}} under scrutiny are related to insufficient funding, difficulties in the technology transfer processes, poor understanding of emerging markets and acquisition of capabilities needed {{in the form of}} competent management teams. Many of these issues are beyond what can be expected from universities only, and quite naturally, the emergence of the human spare parts industry is dependent on many competences of all three institutional spheres of the Triple Helix model. It might be possible to argue, for example, that the local university hospital, owned by the local government, ought to integrate new treatments into its standard repertoire, but, in practice, the mix of potential end-values are poorly identified and not properly debated, and thus, it is difficult for the hospital to take necessary measures or even understand what is <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> And <b>here,</b> the competences of social scientists and/or local politicians might prove invaluable. Moreover, {{it would be easy to}} suggest that the universities ought to strengthen their competences related to entrepreneurship, market formation, technology transfer and commercialization, but as important, it is to ask where complementary competences could be found from and how they could be tapped into and integrated into the local Triple Helix constellation. So far, they have been found in the USA and Belgium. In addition, there is a medical technology-specialised local development agency that played a central role in the early phases of regenerative medicine (see Sotarauta and Mustikkamäki 2015), but as the role of intermediaries has been questioned in the Finnish innovation system, it has been disintegrating from more recent developments. Interestingly, from a national innovation system point of view, this may be a well-argued position but, from a competence set point of view, well established, much needed and valuable local competences have been side-tracked more or less unintentionally.|$|R

40|$|In "Sublime {{historical}} experience" (2005), Frank Ankersmit {{argues that}} the past originates from an experience of rupture. Such an experience of rupture separates the present from the past, and, at the same time, means {{the beginning of an}} effort to overcome the separation. Moreover, the experience is precognitive since it precedes (the possibility of) historical knowledge. As such, it is a condition of possibility for history. Ankersmit resists post-modern thinking about history, considered as too relativizing from the perspective of current philosophy of history. In his view, the focus on text and context, but also the emphasis on categories in transcendental thinking, result in a neglect of experience. Experience should be given its due, also in philosophy of history. Starting from the above challenge, the "original beginnings", which Husserl posits as meaning-origins of a particular history in The Origin of Geometry (cf. appendix 6 to The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, 1970) are questioned from a transcendental perspective. More in particular, it will be investigated if these meaning-origins are to be grasped as structural and nachtraglich, in a Derridean style, or {{if they are to be}} considered as founding moments of experience, probably in a more Merleau-Pontian style. <b>At</b> <b>stake</b> is <b>here</b> the transcendental status of the first acquisition. Is the point from which a historical demarcation is being made, and thus also the meaning-origin itself, a matter of interpretation after the facts or is it the witness of a supposedly genuine experience? The differences between these two options are both subtle and crucial for transcendental thinking today. In the conclusions, we point to the importance of thinking the possibility of history in structural terms, and to different possible appreciations of the spiritual products of culture and more specifically, of works of art...|$|R
