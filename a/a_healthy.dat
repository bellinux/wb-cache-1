5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E
