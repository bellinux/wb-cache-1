He supported the United Nations in its early years, an unpopular position in Dallas for that time. In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for <b>any</b> <b>black</b> entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E
5|$|The later 19th {{century was}} a high point {{in the history of}} civil rights for African Americans. Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas. Leaders, such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, worked to {{establish}} educational and employment opportunities for blacks and organize black voters to support the Republican Party, then the main party supporting black rights in the South. Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages for blacks in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by <b>any</b> <b>black</b> American in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{conventional}} color descriptions {{are traditional}} in astronomy, and represent colors {{relative to the}} mean color of an A-class star, which {{is considered to be}} white. The apparent color descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. However, most stars in the sky, except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work. Red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type, and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than <b>any</b> <b>black</b> body.|$|E
25|$|Planters held slaves {{for use as}} field hands, laborers, artisans, and {{domestic}} servants. In the city, slaves worked primarily as domestic servants and artisans, although they also worked with merchants, shippers, and {{in a wide variety}} of trades. Plantations raised commodity crops of tobacco and hemp, and thoroughbred horse breeding and racing became established in this part of the state. In 1850, one-fifth of the state's population were slaves, and Lexington had the highest concentration of slaves in the entire state. It also had a significant population of free blacks, who were usually of mixed race. By 1850, First African Baptist Church, led by London Ferrill, a free black from Virginia, had a congregation of 1,820 persons, the largest of <b>any,</b> <b>black</b> or white, in the entire state.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the racial}} {{restrictions}} that lasted from Brigham Young's presidency until 1978, persons with <b>any</b> <b>black</b> African ancestry could not receive church priesthood or any temple ordinances including the endowment and eternal marriage or {{participate in any}} proxy ordinances for the dead. An important exception to this temple ban was that (except for a complete temple ban period from the mid-1960s until the early 70s under McKay) black members had been allowed a limited use recommend to act as proxies in baptisms for the dead. The priesthood restriction was particularly limiting, because the LDS Church has a lay priesthood and most male members {{over the age of}} 12 have received the priesthood. Holders of the priesthood officiate at church meetings, perform blessings of healing, and manage church affairs. Excluding black people from the priesthood meant that men could not hold any significant church leadership roles or participate in many important events such as performing a baptism, blessing the sick, or giving a baby blessing. Between 1844 and 1977, most black people were not permitted to participate in ordinances performed in the LDS Church temples, such as the endowment ritual, celestial marriages, and family sealings. These ordinances are considered essential to enter the highest degree of heaven, so this meant that they could not enjoy the full privileges enjoyed by other Latter-day Saints during the restriction.|$|E

500|$|White Dog is a 1982 American drama film, which Samuel Fuller {{directed}} from {{a screenplay}} he and Curtis Hanson had dramatized, which, in turn, they based loosely on Romain Gary's 1970 {{novel of the}} same title.
