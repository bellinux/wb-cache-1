5|$|In this 6-minute short film, he entire kingdom is {{preparing}} for Rapunzel's marriage to Eugene. Several guests are in attendance, including Rapunzel's birth parents, the King and Queen, the pub thugs and the Stabbington Brothers, while their animal friends Pascal, a chameleon, and Maximus, a horse, serve as the Flower boy and ring bearer respectively. Just as a brown-haired Rapunzel, accompanied by her father, completes her journey down the <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> unite with Eugene, Maximus, who is carrying the wedding rings on a pillow in his mouth, has a reaction to one of Pascal's flower petals and sneezes, expelling the rings {{down the aisle and}} out onto the city streets.|$|E
25|$|The Black Abbey in Kilkenny, founded 1225, is a Dominican abbey with two-bay double-height lean-to lower <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> south. It was extended, c. 1325, with four-bay double-height {{transept}} {{to south}} having four-bay double-height lean-to lower <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> west.|$|E
25|$|Seats in old buses {{face the}} <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> {{optimize}} passengers' movement during rush hours. New Buses have their seats facing front, {{which is to}} reduce sexual harassment that usually happen in public transportation in rush hours.|$|E
25|$|Sport stadiums {{and outdoor}} arenas {{frequently}} have {{several types of}} <b>aisles,</b> including <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> purchase tickets for events, <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> enter the main event area and <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> go to seating. Stadium seating routinely is separated into sections by aisles. Seating rows are accessed by stairsteps. <b>To</b> promote safety, <b>aisles</b> commonly are divided by a handrail {{in the middle of}} the aisle.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} routing and layout {{issues for}} parallel aisle warehouses. In such ware-houses order pickers walk or drive along the <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> pick products from storage. They can change aisles {{at a number}} of cross aisles. These cross aisles are usually located at the front and back of the warehouse, but there can also be one or more cross aisles at positions in between. We describe a number of heuristics to determine order picking routes in a warehouse with two or more cross <b>aisles.</b> <b>To</b> analyse the performance of the heuristics, a branch-and-bound algorithm is used that generates shortest order picking routes. Performance comparisons between heuristics and the branch-and-bound algorithm are given for various warehouse layouts and order sizes. For the majority of the instances with more than two cross aisles, a newly developed heuristic appears to perform better than the existing heuristics. Furthermore, some consequences for layout are discussed. From the results it appears that the addition of cross <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> the warehouse layout can decrease handling time of the orders by lowering average travel times. However, adding a large number of cross aisles may increase average travel times because the space occupied by the cross <b>aisles</b> has <b>to</b> be traversed as well. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{architectural}} style is early English. Built in stone {{with a high}} pitched roof, it consists of a nave with clerestory, <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> north and south, a chancel, vestry, organ-chamber, and a west end pinnacled tower.|$|R
25|$|The {{arms of the}} Barclays, impaled {{with those}} of Crawfurd are carved on a panel located on the tower of the kirk. The Crawfurds added the Crawfurd <b>Aisle</b> <b>to</b> the Auld Kirk with its fine Renaissance-style carvings of 1642. A private {{apartment}} is located behind with the family burial vaults lying beneath. The numerous heraldic shields were carved for John, first Viscount Garnock, and represent the armorial bearings of his ancestors.|$|E
25|$|The font {{dates from}} about 1493. It is boldly carved and {{includes}} heraldry {{relating to the}} lordship of Bromfield. In the <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> {{the south of the}} chancel is a Decorated piscina which has been moved from elsewhere. A memorial plate in the north chancel aisle is dated 1666. The two-manual organ is a 1910 Norman and Beard organ moved from a redundant church in the North of England which was rebuilt and installed in 1976. There is a ring of six bells which were all cast in the 18thcentury by Rudhall of Gloucester.|$|E
25|$|Church restorations {{were also}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Oxford Movement, which advocated moving the centre of importance in the church from preaching to the sacrament of the Eucharist: from the pulpit to the altar. Consequences of this included moving the pulpit from a more central position {{to the side of}} the church, replacing box pews with open pews, creating a central <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> give a better view of the altar, and the removal of galleries. Another consequence was that a larger chancel was required for the associated ritual.|$|E
5000|$|The church, {{which had}} been damaged by fire started by invaders, had to be rebuilt in the early 14th century. Around 1420 the present chancel and tower {{crossing}} with chapels and <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> {{the north and south}} were completed ...|$|R
50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} Saint Mary Magdalene is {{predominantly}} Decorated Gothic. English Heritage dates the earliest building {{work to the}} 14th century but local opinion holds the nave and <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> be 13th century. It is a Grade II* listed building.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{expansion}} of the side <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> the height of the nave transformed the building into a hall church, which was rededicated to St. Hippolytus. The church again took on a typical basilican cross-section with the construction of a higher nave between about 1425 and 1440.|$|R
25|$|Speaker Bolger {{has stated}} {{that he plans to}} work with legislators {{on both sides of the}} <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> assist Detroit in its revitalization. In October 2013, the Speaker visited Detroit with state Representative Harvey Santana, a Democrat from Michigan's 9th house district, and pledged to explore ways to fight crime, lower auto {{insurance}} rates and clean up the city. After the visit Speaker Bolger met with the Michigan State Police to discuss alternatives to fighting crime, as well as discussing plans about alternative sentencing options with other legislators.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{moved back}} to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds. Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her. At an {{adjacent}} coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> try to shut the door of the coach he was on. He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.|$|E
25|$|Two further {{stained glass}} windows to that {{dedicated}} to the Duke of Clarence, and that supplied by Albert De Burton, are one in the south <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> {{the memory of a}} Dr Blasson, and one in the chancel to Lieutenant C. R. Winkley, son of a former vicar who was killed in action during the First World War. In the east window are the arms of Eleanor, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, those of John de Beaumont, 2nd Baron Beaumont (died 1342), her husband, and of the Marmion family. In the south aisle east east window are fragments of medieval stained glass, including a haloed and yellow-robed figure.|$|E

50|$|The {{church has}} a single nave with <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> the sides. The entire {{interior}} is painted. Above the main altar is a painting of the Assumption of Mary by the Spanish artist Antonio Palomino, painted in the seventeenth century.

25|$|The sieges {{ended when}} the Constitutional Court banned the People's Power Party {{and two of}} its {{coalition}} allies. During the critical period that followed the rulings, it is alleged that Army commander and co-leader of the 2006 coup, General Anupong Paochinda, coerced former PPP MPs, mainly those of the Friends of Newin Group, to endorse a Democrat Party-led coalition, which secured enough parliamentary votes to allow Abhisit to be elected Prime Minister. These MPs, along with MPs of 4 other former PPP-coalition parties, crossed the <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> endorse a Democrat-led coalition government. In a December 2008 parliamentary session, the Democrat-led coalition government was voted upon, with 235 to 198 votes in favor of Democrat Party leader and candidate for PM Abhisit Vejjajiva.|$|E
25|$|Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, {{wrote about}} Duke:He once {{presented}} a {{bill on the}} floor, {{one of the few}} which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times. Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a saying}} {{attributed}} to Muhammad in the hadith Sahih Bukhari, women {{are allowed to}} go to mosques. However, as Islam spread, Muslim authorities stressed the fears of unchastity from interaction between sexes outside their home, including the mosque. By pre-modern period it was unusual for women to pray at a mosque. By the late 1960s, women in urban areas of the Middle East increasingly began praying in the mosque, but men and women generally worship separately. (Muslims explain this by citing the need to avoid distraction during prayer prostrations that raise the buttocks while the forehead touches the ground.) Separation between sexes ranges from men and women on opposite sides of an <b>aisle,</b> <b>to</b> men in front of women (as {{was the case in the}} time of Muhammad), to women in second-floor balconies or separate rooms accessible by a door for women only. Women in the state of ritual impurity, such as menstruation, are forbidden from entering the prayer hall of the mosque.|$|E

25|$|Regulations {{applicable}} to public carriers transporting passengers often require <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> be completely clear in vehicles, such as airlines, buses and trains.

25|$|The {{improvements}} to Memorial Stadium's west grandstand {{were made in}} 2001. About $362,774 was spent to add wheelchair lifts and wheelchair-accessible seating in the west bleachers. These costs included replacement of the wood and fiberglass seating with aluminum chairs, {{and the addition of}} an <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> the front of the lower bleachers. Although the contractor saved money because work proceeded ahead of schedule (due to mild weather), an additional $13,558 was appropriated for the improvements after workers discovered that the west concourse beneath the stands had been built directly on clay rather than on a foundation. This area was slightly excavated, gravel was used to fill in the space, and a firmer foundation created for the concourse. Workers also discovered that instead of a concrete foundation, the north and south walls of the west grandstand were built on a wood foundation—which had rotted away. The rotten wood was removed, concrete footings were poured, and a new rot-resistant wood foundation for the walls set in place. Contractors also installed new grandstand gates (to control access to the track from the bleachers), and said the entire project would be completed {{after the end of the}} track and field season in May 2001. A few weeks later, the school board approved the semi-exclusive soda and juice distribution contracts with Coke and Pepsi. Each contract gave the school district $50,000 a year for five years (for a total of $500,000). District officials approved the expenditure of $360,000 from the contract revenues to pay for west bleacher improvements.|$|E

500|$|For the I Am... disc, Beyoncé was {{influenced}} by folk and alternative rock genres, while incorporating other instruments she had not normally used previously, such as the acoustic guitar. Tedder specifically assisted Beyoncé with crafting the album's balladry. The ballads were crafted {{in a way to}} combine [...] "the best elements" [...] of pop and soul music, while simultaneously [...] "expanding the possibilities of both genres". Beyoncé attempted something different as people had strong expectations from her; she experimented with stronger lyrics. Beyoncé worked with Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] after having co-written [...] "Disappear" [...] in London, England. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that they were both inspired by their then-recent marriages and had walked down the <b>aisle</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Ave Maria".|$|E
50|$|The first plan of January 1905 envisaged a nave, side <b>aisles</b> <b>to</b> {{the north}} and south, quire, {{square-ended}} chancel, short transepts and porches to the north, south and east sides. The design provided for a capacity of 590. Priestman wanted 700. Prior re-worked the design adding a morning chapel and moving the south porch to the west. This arrangement provided for 688.|$|R
