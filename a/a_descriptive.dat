40|$|This paper {{concerns}} two composite Lewis-Skyrms signaling games. Each {{consists in}} a base game that evolves <b>a</b> language <b>descriptive</b> {{of nature and}} a metagame that coevolves <b>a</b> language <b>descriptive</b> of the base game and its evolving language. The first composite game shows how a pragmatic notion of truth might coevolve with <b>a</b> simple <b>descriptive</b> language. The second shows how a pragmatic notion of probability might similarly coevolve. Each of these pragmatic notions {{is characterized by the}} particular game and role that it comes to play in the game...|$|R

5|$|Several reviews {{have found}} that the use of AAC does not impede the {{development}} of speech in individuals with autism or developmental disabilities, and in fact, may result in modest gains being observed. A 2006 research review of 23 AAC intervention studies found gains in speech production in 89% of the cases studied, with the remainder showing no change. <b>A</b> <b>descriptive</b> review looking specifically at Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) intervention studies found that several studies reported an increase in speech, often during later phases, while one noted little or no effect.|$|E

5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements {{that at one time}} or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not to be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as <b>a</b> <b>descriptive</b> enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than <b>a</b> <b>descriptive</b> adjunct to medicine.|$|E

The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the church and castle, which are rendered in <b>a</b> <b>descriptive</b> perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than their actual dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm. Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and <b>a</b> <b>descriptive</b> grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
