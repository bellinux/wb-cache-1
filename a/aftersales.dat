30|$|An {{electronics}} {{company that}} outsources its <b>aftersales</b> services wants {{to measure the}} performance of the <b>aftersales</b> provider companies. The company has five different <b>aftersales</b> providers. These <b>aftersales</b> providers’ performance can be measured by the attributes Customer Satisfaction (CS), Service Quality (SQ), Financial Success (FS), Perceived Service Value (PSV), Customer Retention (CR), Repurchase (RP), Brand Loyalty (BL), Recommendation (RC), and Brand Image (BI). A group of three managers evaluated five different <b>aftersales</b> providers. The managers discuss their evaluations and achieve final compromise evaluations collectively. The performances of the <b>aftersales</b> service providing companies are evaluated at four periods. Table 1 shows the compromised intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix collected at these four periods.|$|E
30|$|The {{performances}} of <b>aftersales</b> companies are changing {{depending on the}} weights of the attributes. The performances are highly responsive to {{the change in the}} attributes. Currently, P 1 shows the highest performance among <b>aftersales</b> provider companies mainly due to its performance on Customer Satisfaction, Perceived Service Value, and Customer Retention criteria. However, P 5 becomes the leading <b>aftersales</b> provider when the importance of Financial Success is higher than 0.4, or the importance of Recommendation is greater than 0.2 or the importance of Brand Loyalty is greater than 0.3. P 4 becomes the highest performing <b>aftersales</b> provider when Service Quality is almost only performance criteria or when the importance of repurchase is higher than 0.4. P 2 becomes the leading <b>aftersales</b> provider when the brand image is more important than 0.5.|$|E
30|$|Measurement of {{performance}} in <b>aftersales</b> services is quite {{important to understand}} current problems and develop strategies. Gaiardelli et al. [15] claim that literature has limited well-prepared performance measurement systems for <b>aftersales</b> services and develop performance measurement system for <b>aftersales</b> services. According to this study, there should be various levels of analysis depending on the purposes. Moreover, {{there should be a}} combination of financial and non-financial dimensions, long-term and short-term decisions, tangible and intangible features, and measures of the efficiency and effectiveness.|$|E
30|$|<b>Aftersales</b> {{services}} are crucial for gaining a competitive advantage, since they enhance long-term profitability and sustainability. <b>Aftersales</b> service performance evaluation {{is necessary to}} understand current problems and develop new strategies. Multi-period evaluations are required for revealing these performances. Moreover, performance appraisal results usually involve uncertainty and fuzziness. In this study, a dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute <b>aftersales</b> performance evaluation method is {{used to measure the}} performance of an electronics company. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the robustness of the results.|$|E
30|$|<b>Aftersales</b> {{services}} include {{various activities}} that start after the purchasing {{of the product}} or service and continue during the usage of the product or service [3, 9, 36]. <b>Aftersales</b> services provide a competitive advantage by enabling companies to differentiate the product or service and increase the revenue by sale of spare parts. Therefore, <b>aftersales</b> services are considered as the linkage between customers and the company [9]. Customer preferences and an initial selection of customers differ based on the provided products or services and the additional services after purchasing the product or service [25, 44]. Maintaining customer satisfaction, improving the quality, providing well-maintained relationships with customers, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, and enhancing competitive advantage are the main objectives of <b>aftersales</b> services [3, 14, 36].|$|E
30|$|The fifth paper Dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute <b>aftersales</b> {{performance}} evaluation whose authors are Cevik Onar et al. presents a dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute <b>aftersales</b> {{performance evaluation}} method {{to measure the}} performance of an electronics company. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the robustness of the given decisions.|$|E
