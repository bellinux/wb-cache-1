5000|$|Curare {{is known}} by many tribes across the Amazon forest, {{where it has}} served as a poison. Over a low fire the {{purified}} extract in time became a thickened liquid; it was then brushed onto <b>arrow</b> <b>heads</b> and dart <b>points</b> for use in hunting. Curare acts quickly as a paralysing poison when it directly enters the bloodstream. It is apparently safe to be taken orally, so that [...] "one can drink the poison without being harmed". Hence wild birds and animals caught by using curare are safe to eat. Years earlier Córdova had learned how to make it.|$|R

Trachtenberg called this the 2 Finger Method. The {{calculations}} for finding the fourth digit from the example above are illustrated at right. The arrow from the nine will always point to the digit of the multiplicand directly above the digit of the answer you wish to find, with the other arrows each pointing one digit to the right. Each <b>arrow</b> <b>head</b> <b>points</b> to a UT Pair, or Product Pair. The vertical arrow points to the product where we will get the Units digit, and the sloping arrow points to the product where we will get the Tens digits of the Product Pair. If an arrow points to a space with no digit there is no calculation for that arrow. As you solve for each digit you will move each of the arrows over the multiplicand one digit to the left until all of the arrows point to prefixed zeros.|$|R
5000|$|In 1633 or 1634, Seeley {{joined a}} ten-man {{expedition}} led by John Oldham to the Connecticut River. The group soon established Wethersfield, the first English settlement on the Connecticut River.

40|$|This {{project is}} about the {{development}} and analysis of arrow for archery. 3 types of <b>arrow</b> <b>head</b> been designed: bullet shaped head, 3 D shaped head and cone shaped <b>head.</b> The <b>arrow</b> performance measurement parameters were studied such as the FOC values, static stiffness values and the drag forces. SolidWorks 2012 was used to designs {{the three types of}} <b>arrow</b> <b>head</b> and the drag force is simulated by using SolidWork Flow Simulation. The material used for the <b>arrow</b> <b>head</b> fabrication is stainless steel 304. The arrow shafts used are carbon shaft of 5. 46 mm outer diameter and 7 mm fiberglass and carbon fiber shaft. 3 different shaft properties are used to determine the effect of static stiffness, <b>arrow</b> <b>heads</b> weight and shaft diameter on the drag force generated at the arrow. The experimented result for Beman 570 - 14 arrows are slightly higher compared to simulation results obtained from SolidWorks. The possible cause is the characteristic of the arrow during flight where arrows starts to bend in C manner then straight again then bend again in reverse C manner and so on when it been shot. These deformation causes energy losses to the surrounding due to air friction, natural damping effect and shear friction. From the result obtained, it is shown that fiberglass shaft arrow has the highest drag force regardless of the <b>arrow</b> <b>head</b> types used compared to the other two types of shaft. Although Beman 570 - 14 shaft has smaller frontal area compared to a 7 mm outer diameter carbon fiber shaft, the drag force obtained from the experiment shows that both bullet shaped head and 3 D shaped head for carbon fiber shaft has lower drag force compared with the same <b>arrow</b> <b>head</b> shape...|$|R
