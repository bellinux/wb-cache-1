5|$|Thermoremanent {{magnetization}} is {{the main}} source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust {{on both sides of the}} ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes <b>and</b> <b>infer</b> the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.|$|E

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} is a mother's {{ability to}} perceive <b>and</b> <b>infer</b> the meaning behind her infant's behavioural signals, {{and to respond}} to them promptly and appropriately. Maternal sensitivity affects child development at all stages through life, from infancy, {{all the way to}} adulthood. In general, more sensitive mothers have healthier, more socially and cognitively developed children than those who are not as sensitive. Also, maternal sensitivity has been found to affect the person psychologically even as an adult. Adults who experienced high maternal sensitivity during their childhood were found to be more secure than those who experienced less sensitive mothers. Once the adult becomes a parent themselves, their own understanding of maternal sensitivity will affect their own children's development. Some research suggests that adult mothers display more maternal sensitivity than adolescent mothers who may in turn have children with a lower IQ and reading level than children of adult mothers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Several tools {{have been}} {{designed}} for measuring end-to-end available bandwidth (AB) of a path by injecting probe traffic <b>and</b> <b>inferring</b> AB based on the delays observed {{at the end of}} the path. While the algorithmic aspects of designing probe streams <b>and</b> <b>inferring</b> AB has received considerable attention, most tool designs have ignored an important aspect of measuring AB—that of the sampling timescales and strategies used. In this paper, we address this issue by studying the impact of the measurement time-scale, tool run-time, sampling strategy, and sampling intensity, on the accuracy, variability, and predictability of the estimated AB. We passively analyze link-level packet traces collected from 15 Internet links (8 different locations). Our analysis intentionally ignores the tool-specific algorithmic aspects of designing probe streams <b>and</b> <b>inferring</b> AB—our conclusions, therefore, are applicable to a wide variety of AB estimation tools. We use our analysis to derive several guidelines for tool design. ...|$|R

2500|$|Empirical Bayes {{methods for}} ancestral {{reconstruction}} require the investigator {{to assume that}} the evolutionary model parameters and tree are known without error. [...] When the size or complexity of the data makes this an unrealistic assumption, it may be more prudent to adopt the fully hierarchical Bayesian approach <b>and</b> <b>infer</b> the joint posterior distribution over the ancestral character states, model, and tree. Huelsenbeck and Bollback first proposed a hierarchical Bayes method to ancestral reconstruction by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample ancestral sequences from this joint posterior distribution. A similar approach was also used to reconstruct the evolution of symbiosis with algae in fungal species (lichenization). For example, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for MCMC explores the joint posterior distribution by accepting or rejecting parameter assignments {{on the basis of the}} ratio of posterior probabilities.|$|E
2500|$|The {{integration}} of Frames, rules, and object-oriented programming was significantly driven by commercial ventures such as KEE and Symbolics spun off from various research projects. At {{the same time}} as this was occurring, there was another strain of research which was less commercially focused and was driven by mathematical logic and automated theorem proving. [...] One of the most influential languages in this research was the KL-ONE language of the mid 80's. KL-ONE was a frame language that had a rigorous semantics, formal definitions for concepts such as an Is-A relation. KL-ONE and languages that were influenced by it such as Loom had an automated reasoning engine that was based on formal logic rather than on IF-THEN rules. This reasoner is called the classifier. A classifier can analyze a set of declarations <b>and</b> <b>infer</b> new assertions, for example, redefine a class to be a subclass or superclass of some other class that wasn't formally specified. In this way the classifier can function as an inference engine, deducing new facts from an existing knowledge base. The classifier can also provide consistency checking on a knowledge base (which in the case of KL-ONE languages is also referred to as an Ontology).|$|E
