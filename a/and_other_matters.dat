5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>matters</b> of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert {{wrote the}} Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, {{which was a}} legal code for the clergy, setting forth the proper {{procedures}} for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>matters.</b> It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England {{after the death of}} Nothhelm in 739, {{it is possible that the}} Dialogus was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The Dialogus details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was to behave in society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on the mention of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.|$|E
