40|$|More {{than two}} hundred subcircular to {{crescent-shaped}} depressions, often with radiating markings, were discovered on a 120 m 2 bedding plane interpreted as base-of-slope carbonate deposits and belonging to the Lutetian–Bartonian Peschici Formation at San Lorenzo (Vieste, Gargano Promontory, Italy). The area was mapped using a high-resolution aerial camera (mounted on a kite) and a terrestrial laser scanner. The survey allowed detailed morphologic analysis and topographic mapping of the traces, in order to analyze the very regular distribution pattern. The ichnological study, combined with sedimentologic and stratigraphic analyses, identifies the depressions as fish feeding traces.

The sedimentary deposits {{are associated with}} ferromanganese hardgrounds, more or less colonised by endo-lithic and epilithozoan organisms. The presence of foraminifera typical of tropical and subtropical waters (such as Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides trilobus, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata and Sphaeroidinella dehiscens) indicates that the micritic deposition occurred during warm climatic periods, whilst micrite cementation and hardground formation <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>attributed</b> to colder climates.

The molar teeth of 1 P 25 C are distinguished from similarly-aged Macaca libyca (Wadi Natrun, Egypt), cf. Macaca sp. (Menacer, Algeria), and cf. Macaca sp.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the natural variability of Atlantic and Coastal water, a late-Holocene multi-proxy analysis is performed on a marine sediment core {{from the northern}} Norwegian margin. This includes planktic foraminiferal fauna and their preservation indicators, stable isotopes (δ 18 Oc, δ 13 C), sub-surface temperature (SSTMg/Ca) and salinity (SSS) records based on paired Mg/Ca and δ 18 Oc measurements of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and transfer function–derived sub-surface temperatures (SSTTransfer). The record shows a general cooling with subtle fluctuating palaeoceanographic conditions, here attributed to shifting North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) modes. Period I (ca. 3500 – 2900 [*]cal. yr BP) is strongly influenced by Coastal water and stratified water masses, possibly correlating to negative NAO conditions. During period II (ca. 2900 – 1600 [*]cal. yr BP), dominating warm Atlantic water might be linked to a positive NAO mode and the Roman Warm Period. A renewed influence of Coastal water is observed throughout period III (ca. 1600 – 900 cal. yr BP). Stable and colder SST values potentially correlate to the Dark Ages and <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>attributed</b> to negative NAO conditions. Within period IV (ca. 900 – 550 cal. yr BP), the core site experienced a stronger influence of Atlantic water which might be because of the positive NAO conditions correlating to the ‘Medieval Warm Period’. Additionally, an inverse correlation in Atlantic water influence between the eastern and western Atlantic Ocean is observed throughout periods II, III and IV. This Atlantic oceanographic see-saw pattern is attributed to an opposite climatic response to changing NAO conditions arguing for a coupling between ocean and atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|A {{cyclical}} pattern can {{be observed}} in the central sector of the Guadix Basin (southern Spain) in the Late Pliocene-Quaternary alluvial fan deposits prograding into its axial valley. A climatic significance has been attributed to this cyclicity on the basis of sedimentological and preliminary isotopic studies. The progradation phases of the alluvial fans <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>attributed</b> to more arid time intervals in which the vegetation cover would be less developed, erosion and sediment supply would be higher, and base level would be lower. In contrast, the time intervals during which the fluvial system sediments dominated the area are inferred to be wetter and base level higher, with vegetation cover retaining the soils and preventing erosion. Permanent water supply to the river would therefore facilitate the aggradation of the floodplain and prevent progradation of the fans. Starting from a litho-, bio- and magnetostratigraphical frame provided for the area, an age is assigned to the alternation of the reddish sediments of the transverse alluvial fans and the greyish to white fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the axial drainage system. A cyclicity of ca. 100 ky has been identified in most of the alluvial fan progradation phases, falling within Milankovitch high-frequency eccentricity periodicities. Correlation of the phases with insolation curves is accordingly discussed as a possible origin for the cyclicity. Finally, the results offer new insights into early hominin occupation patterns in the region, through the identification of predictable resources of permanent fresh water that would have remained available throughout the recorded time span (that includes the Early–Middle Pleistocene transition) even during times of aridification.

Usually if the bias was switched at time t = 0, real and imaginary permittivity jumped to new values then decreased as logt. This well-known 'glassy' effect is attributed to switchable microdomains that are present accidentally in single crystals but are systematically more numerous in powders. A very different after-effect was observed in a narrow T range around 7 - 8 K. Real permittivity jumped to a lower value then increased with t as a stretched exponential with a T-dependent time constant. This lay near the Arrhenius law of a known, but unassigned dispersion.

While such compounds usually exhibit a rich polymorphism including amorphous and partially ordered crystals, the phases here explored correspond to crystals showing complete orientational order. The {{results show that the}} temperature dependence of к(T) above its maximum deviates from the expected decrease following a 1 /T law with increasing temperature arising from anharmonic interactions involving acoustic excitations. Such a deviation <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>attributed</b> to the presence of a component кII(T) corresponding to the shortest-lifetime phonons (Cahill–Pohl model) additional to that кI(T) related to propagating phonons and thus: к(T) = кI(T) + кII(T). Above T = 40 K кI(T) does follow the law 1 /T and кII(T) is basically temperature independent. The component кI(T) is well described by the Debye–Peierls model taking into account the phonon–phonon Umklapp processes and phonon scattering by dislocations. In turn, the contribution кII(T) is attributed to the effects of higher lying excitations which get thermally populated above some 40 K. Finally, a systematic trend is found concerning the strength of phonon–phonon scattering which is seen to diminish as the number of carbon atoms in the alcohol molecule increases...|$|R

Furthermore, {{it is argued that}} the contribution to intensity as a function of x-ray energy seen in the experiment on the low energy side of the electric dipole (E 1) resonance is due to an electric quadrupole (E 2) resonance. The absence of the E 1 resonance for h odd, and appearance of the E 2 resonance at h odd and h even is accounted for in the calculated structure factor. For h odd the structure factor is proportional to the octupole moment of the vanadium ion, which is estimated to have a magnitude {{similar to that of the}} orbital angular momentum. In the case of E 2 resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction from hematite the calculated structure factor contains three orbital moments, two of odd rank and one of even rank. The calculated polarization dependence and azimuthal-angle scans are in complete accord with experimental findings. The contribution of even and odd rank moments is shown to make scattering depend on circular polarization.

Using laser-induced fluorescence, digital image processing and laser-Doppler anemometry, the flow properties of the jet have been studied in detail. It is found that, with sufficient heating, the jet no longer grows linearly with height, and the decay of both centreline velocity and turbulence intensity is arrested, and may even be reversed just beyond the zone of heat addition; nevertheless the entrainment decreases, which is at variance with the hypotheses often made for modelling it.

The basal reflections at 10. 00, 7. 22, 5. 00, 3. 35, 2. 50, 2. 29 and 2. 10 Å, sharp infrared spectral lines at 469 and 519 cm − 1 and typical dehydration of interlayer water < 200 °C, together with results from the EDX analysis, indicate the presence of calcium buserite — a manganese oxide mineral. SEM images of buserite crystals show degraded platy pseudo-hexagonal forms suggesting a non-biological origin. Pedogenic processes taking place at the soil material overlying red mudstones, likely induced the reducing or acidic conditions under which Mn 2 + was released by the dissolution of Mn-bearing minerals during the wet periods. Organic compounds were also most likely leached during these periods and subsequently, during the dry climatic intervals, manganese oxide minerals precipitated from the infiltrating soil solutions under oxidizing conditions. The nanometer-scale layering in manganese oxide coatings <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>attributed</b> to repeated changes in redox conditions. Some trace elements in the coatings, such as Ba, Ni, Co, and Ce have either been absorbed by the Mn oxide minerals or organo-mineral complexes...|$|R
