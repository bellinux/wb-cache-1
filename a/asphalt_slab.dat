40|$|The breakwaters of IJmuiden are of {{a unique}} design; a riprap core {{is covered with a}} thick {{impermeable}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab.</b> During construction and after completion, slope instability caused extensive damage. Placement of a concrete cube armour layer prevented further damage to the asphalt, but proved to be unstable and required a significant amount of maintenance. Rijkswaterstaat (RWS), which is responsible for the maintenance, contracted a number of companies to investigate the strength and loading of the breakwaters. Lifting of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> as a result of overpressure in the breakwater core was found to be the decisive failure mechanism. To determine the amount of overpressure, measurements were performed in both breakwater heads. A bigger favourable damping of wind waves was measured in the southern breakwater. Based on these measurements and other research outcomes RWS decided to change the maintenance strategy; armour units above the NPA – 2 m line will not be maintained in the future. The new strategy is based on the reasoning that the damping of wind waves reduces lifting forces and makes the weight of the armour layer redundant to prevent lifting. The mechanism(s) causing the larger damping in the southern breakwater are however unknown, this makes it hard to predict the amount of damping and therefore the magnitude of the loading of the asphalt during storm conditions. Aim of this thesis is to get insight in the stability of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> during design storm conditions, and the necessity of an armour layer. Therefore the damping mechanism and the amount of damping during storm conditions need to be determined. Numerical modelling is performed to describe wave transmission through the breakwater and to evaluate the influence of different damping mechanisms. Most important mechanism causing additional damping is siltation of the toe structure of the southern breakwater. Along the Dutch coast the net longshore sediment transport is directed northwards. Therefore sediment passes the southern breakwater, part of the sand might settle in the toe and core of the breakwater. A sand layer with a height of 3. 3 m reduces the flow of water enough to cause the measured damping. The stability of the sand during storm conditions is checked using open filter sediment transport formula. Erosion of the sand layer is expected, however the erosion is expected to be in the order of centimetres which is insignificant. The damping mechanism causing the measured damping in the southern breakwater is determined; hence loading of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> during design storm conditions can be determined. The thickness and quality of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> is uncertain and might vary significantly over the length of the breakwaters. In order to get insight in the quality of the asphalt two cores were drilled in 2004. One showed high quality cohesive asphalt, the other showed low quality with low cohesion. Lifting of the asphalt cannot be ruled out. The dead weight of the designed <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> in combination with a partial armour layer is not sufficient to resist the upward pressures during a design storm. The additional resistance needed against lifting can be provided by the weight of a complete armour layer or bending strength of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab.</b> The bending strength of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> depends on {{the quantity and quality of}} the asphalt present. In order for the <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> to have sufficient bending strength a top layer of high quality cohesive asphalt is required. Concluding, without additional information concerning the asphalt quality and thickness lifting of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> and thereby failure of the breakwaters cannot be ruled out in case the armour layer erodes above a level of NAP - 2 m.

40|$|Cracks {{are one of}} {{the main}} {{distress}} mechanisms that affects the structural performance, comfort and durability of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) layers in road pavements. These cracks are generally of small size and can occur superficially, from top to bottom, from bottom to top, or they can run across the entire HMA layer thickness. Pavement rehabilitation is planned according to the bearing capacity of the pavement that is related to the number of cracks but also to its width (opening) and depth. Visible surface cracks can be manifested as superficial cracks or as cracks that already crossed the entire layer, and, both situations need different rehabilitation strategies. Therefore, there is an urgent need of accurate assessment of cracks characteristics to plan rehabilitation accordingly. Due to its characteristics useful for road inspection and high resolution, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was used to assess its capability on detecting cracks of different widths. A laboratory experiment was setup to analyze the detectability of a crack in an <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> (across the entire thickness) before and after a new slab was placed over the cracked one. The results showed that the possibility of the crack detection depends essentially on the contrast of the layers surrounding that crack.

Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the maximum heat area using ethylene glycol. The study was involved the field monitoring of the six samples of <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> with stainless steel pipe with ethylene glycol and empty pipe act as the controlled sample. The pipe was arranged in three different depths of 50 mm, 100 mm and 150 mm and keeping controlled the pipe diameter and the size of slab of 20 mm and 300 mm x 300 mm respectively. These results show that the maximum heat extraction by the ethylene glycol was at a depth 150 mm which was 51. 2 °C. The average percentage increments of the pipe with ethylene glycol for three days for pipe depth 50 mm was 71 %, while for pipe at depth 100 mm and 150 mm were 78 % and 62 % respectively. The ethylene glycol effect was more noticeable compare to the pipe without ethylene glycol and can store more heat. For the strength of pipe, the highest maximum load bearing capacity that can be supported by the stainless steel pipe was at depth 50 mm and the second highest was at a depth 100 mm while the third highest was at depth 150 mm.

40|$|Longitudinal joints {{are one of}} the {{critical}} factors that cause premature pavement failure. Poor-quality joints are characterized by a low density and high permeability; which generates surface distresses such as ravelling or longitudinal cracking. Density has been traditionally considered as the primary performance indicator of joint construction. Density measurements consist of taking cores in the field and determining their density in the laboratory. Although this technique provides the most accurate measure of joint density, it is destructive and time consuming. Nuclear and non-nuclear gauges have been used to evaluate the condition of longitudinal joint non-destructively, but did not show good correlation with core density tests. Consequently, agencies are searching for other non-destructive testing (NDT) options for longitudinal joints evaluation. NDT methods have significantly advanced for the evaluation of pavement structural capacity during the past decade. These methods are based either on deflection or wave velocity measurements. The light weight deflectometer (LWD) is increasingly being used in quality control/quality assurance to provide a rapid determination of the surface modulus. Corresponding backcalculation programs are able to determine the moduli of the different pavement layers; these moduli are input parameters for mechanistic-empirical pavement design. In addition, ultrasonic wave-based methods have been studied for pavement condition evaluation but not developed to the point of practical implementation. The multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) consists of using ultrasonic transducers to measure surface wave velocities in pavements and invert for the moduli of the different layers. In this study, both LWD and MASW were used in the laboratory and in the field to assess the condition of longitudinal joints. LWD tests were performed in the field at different distances from the centreline in order to identify variations of the surface modulus. MASW measurements were conducted across the joint to evaluate its effect on wave velocities, frequency content and attenuation parameters. Improved signal processing techniques were used to analyze the data, such as Fourier Transform, windowing, or discrete wavelet transform. Dispersion curves were computed to determine surface wave velocities and identify the nature of the wave modes propagating through the asphalt pavement. Parameters such as peak-to-peak amplitude or the area of the frequency spectrum were used to compute attenuation curves. A self calibrating technique, called Fourier transmission coefficient (FTC), was used to assess the condition of longitudinal joints while eliminating the variability introduced by the source, receivers and coupling system. A critical component of this project consisted of preparing an <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> with a joint in the middle that would be used for testing in the laboratory. The compaction method was calibrated by preparing fourteen asphalt samples. An exponential correlation was determined between the air void content and the compaction effort applied to the mixture. Using this relationship, an <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> was prepared in two stages to create a joint of medium quality. Nuclear density measurements were performed at different locations on the slab and showed a good agreement with the predicted density gradient across the joint. MASW tests were performed on the asphalt slabs using different coupling systems and receivers. The FTC coefficients showed good consistency from one configuration to another. This result indicates that the undesired variability due to the receivers and the coupling system was reduced by the FTC technique. Therefore, the coefficients were representative of the hot mix asphalt (HMA) condition. A comparison of theoretical and experimental dispersion curves indicated that mainly Lamb waves were generated in the asphalt layer. This new result is in contradiction with the common assumption that the response is governed by surface waves. This result is of critical importance for the analysis of the data since MASW tests have been focusing on the analysis of Rayleigh waves. Deflection measurements in the field with the LWD showed that the surface modulus was mostly affected by the base and subgrade moduli, and could not be used to evaluate the condition of the surface course that contains the longitudinal joints. The LWDmod software should be used to differentiate the pavement layers and backcalculate the modulus of the asphalt layer. Testing should be performed using different plate sizes and dropping heights in order to generate different stress levels at the pavement surface and optimize the accuracy of the backcalculation. Finally, master curves were computed using a predictive equation based on mix design specifications. Moduli measured at different frequencies of excitation with the two NDT techniques were shifted to a design frequency of 25 Hz. Design moduli measured in the field and in the laboratory with the seismic method were in good agreement (less than 0. 2 % difference). Moreover, a relatively good agreement was found between the moduli measured with the LWD and the MASW method after shifting to the design frequency. In conclusion, LWD and MASW measurements were representative of HMA condition. However, the condition assessment of medium to good quality joints requires better control of {{the critical}} parameters, such as the measurement depth for the LWD, or the frequency content generated by the ultrasonic source and the coupling between the receivers and the asphalt surface for the MASW method...|$|E
40|$|Voids {{and cracks}} in asphalt or {{concrete}} can indicate {{the condition of}} a road or pavement. A decaying road may contain many very small cracks, and such small artifacts {{can be difficult to}} identify using conventional ground penetrating radar (GPR) techniques. A new approach is examined here to detect the scattering from the multitude of small defects in the ground. Consideration is given to the layout of suitable antennas to sensitise a GPR system to the laterally propagating cross-polarised signals that voids in a road will produce. A self-shielded antenna with a circularly symmetrical beam pattern is used to transmit vertically downwards. This is surrounded by a number of wide band dielectric wedge directional antennas, oriented to pick up the cross-polarisation of the scattered signal.

Presently available laboratory compaction methods {{do not seem to}} be able to produce specimens that can truly represent the mixtures as it exists in the field, especially for Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) mixtures. SMA is highly dependent on the method of compaction. As the application of the SMA is rapidly gaining acceptance worldwide, a suitable laboratory compaction method is evidently needed. Turamesin, a laboratory slab roller compactor was developed to enable laboratory compaction of asphalt mixtures in field simulation conditions. This study was carried out in order to establish criteria for slab compaction and identify the potential of the newly developed Turamesin.

Civil infrastructures are considered high priority assets in Ontario and Canada because of their value, high consequence of failure, and the continual influence of aging effects. Unexpected failure of infrastructure not only costs more than planned replacements but also results in increased safety risks. The in-situ condition assessment of civil infrastructure is critical for the successful implementation of maintenance and safety programs. Therefore, reliable nondestructive methods of inspection are required {{for the implementation of}} economical and efficient maintenance and asset management programs. Continuing technological developments in data collection, acquisition equipment, and data processing techniques have provided useful applications of nondestructive methods in many engineering fields. Among the many applications, this research study examines three applications of nondestructive testing in civil engineering: (1) condition assessment of construction joints in asphalt pavements, (2) average thickness evaluation of steel pipes, and (3) void and debonding detection in grouted steel tanks. The study on asphalt focuses on the improvement of the coupling system between the transducers and the asphalt surface, {{and the development of a}} new data processing technique to reduce user input and increase the reliability of the condition assessment of longitudinal joints. The current wavelet transmission coefficient (WTC) method requires user input, making the automatic data processing difficult. In the WTC method, the coupling between the transducers and the asphalt surface requires the use of epoxy and aluminum plates. This procedure is not practical for testing in-service roads. A new coupling mechanism using polyurethane foam to provide a spring action on the transducers and calibrated weights to generate a compression force was developed and showed good results, reducing the testing time by up to 50 %. A new and robust data analysis methodology, called instantaneous transmission coefficient (ITC), is proposed based on measured instantaneous frequencies and damping ratios. The main advantage of the ITC procedure is that it can be performed automatically, reducing user input. A laboratory scale <b>asphalt</b> <b>slab</b> is used to evaluate the new methodology. Results show good agreement between the WTC and ITC measurements for both jointed and joint-free areas. The second study investigates the feasibility of the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) technique for the evaluation of the average wall thickness of steel pipes. Electromagnetic NDT methods, such as the eddy current and the remote field testing, are common tools for thickness measurement of conductive materials. However, these methods give only localized results where measurements are made, making the process time consuming and inaccurate for assessing the full cross-sectional area of the pipe. Lamb waves have been used previously in the evaluation of steel pipes; however, the existing techniques require prior calibration to a theoretical wave mode, and their accuracy decreases with the length of the pipe evaluated due to wave attenuation effects. Preliminary results show the capability of the MASW test for providing reliable thickness information. The measured dispersion curves include information of fundamental modes and the higher modes, providing an improved characterization of the medium. Thicknesses between 3. 2 mm and 12. 7 mm are tested with an error of less than 2 %. The third study explores the detection of voids in a steel tank filled with lightweight grout. A joint analysis of surface waves and Lamb waves is used for void detection and the identification of debonding conditions in a laboratory scale model of a steel tank filled with grout. Different configurations of the MASW method are conducted using an instrumented hammer (large wavelengths, 10 cm < λ < 25 cm) and a 50 kHz piezoelectric transmitter (small wavelengths, 5 cm < λ < 9 cm) as sources. The attenuation coefficient computed from the Fourier spectra of the measured signals indicates that the presence of a void has an effect on the propagation of the wave. The comparison between experimental and theoretical dispersion curves show that mainly Lamb waves are generated during the testing of the steel tank; thus, detecting the debonding conditions between the steel plate and the grout. Lamb modes are used successfully for detecting the presence of a void beneath the steel wall. The laboratory measurements are effective in the detection of the void, showing amplitudes up to 50 % higher, likely because the deformation of the wall is attenuated by the grout...|$|E

Air voids, segregation and binder content were found to {{have a significant effect on}} TDC for all the temperatures tested. Modeling the TDC involved laboratory testing to establish the viscoelastic and tensile strength properties of the asphalt mixtures tested. It was found that the rutted surface contributes significantly to TDC initiation Effect of Construction Quality, Temperature, and Rutting on Initiation of Top-Down Cracking.

40|$|Infiltration {{capacity}} reduction {{due to the}} progressive clogging of land surfaces {{is the most important}} feature controlling pervious pavement life use. It is influenced by material and local characteristics. The rainfall regime can be influenced by water volume and rainfall intensity. A laboratory study was conducted to analyze the influence of the rainfall intensity on the sediments dynamics on pervious pavements. Three different rainfall intensities were settled using a rainfall simulator: 50 mm/h, 100 mm/h and 150 mm/h. Pervious concrete (PC) and porous <b>asphalt</b> (PA) <b>slabs</b> of 50 × 26 × 5 cm, with void contents of 15 %, 20 % and 25 % were tested. They were clogged using sediments containing mostly sand and an assembled PSD (particle size distribution) that fall within the range of real case scenarios. The sediments were applied over the slabs on aerial loadings of 0. 5 kg/m 2, 1. 0 kg/m 2 and 2. 0 kg/m 2. Using a falling head permeameter discharge measurements were made over the samples in newly built conditions, after clogging and after rainfall simulation. The obtained results showed that in most cases the rainfall intensity does not produce significant differences in discharge time. The information obtained through this study provides better understanding of sediments transport mechanisms on pervious pavements and could lead to customized maintenance routines...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a Louisiana pavement surface friction guideline that considers polished stone value (PSV) and mixture type alike in terms of both micro- and macro- surface textures. The polishing and texture properties of aggregates were characterized using the British Pendulum, Micro-Deval and Aggregate Imaging System (AIMS). <b>Asphalt</b> mixture <b>slabs</b> were fabricated with different combinations of two aggregate sources (sandstone and limestone) and four mixture types and polished by a three-wheel accelerated polishing device developed by the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT). The surface frictional characteristics of each slab were measured by Dynamic Fiction tester (DFT) and Circular Texture Meter (CTM) at various pre-determined polishing cycles. In addition, an inventory dataset of field friction number (FN) measurements was obtained from the LADOTD’s Materials Laboratory and analyzed in this study to determine the effects of traffic loading, aggregate and mixture types on the measured FN values. The laboratory results indicated that the accelerated polishing device used in this study performed just as the expectation; i. e., as the polishing cycle increases, the measured frictional property of testing slab surface decreases. It was found that the DFT measurements were fairly sensitive to the coarse aggregate types (related to micro-texture) used in mix design, but were not very sensitive to different mix types or aggregate gradations (related to macrotexture) ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, energy {{harvesting}} from road {{has become a}} research hotspot. The power generation system within asphalt pavement based on thermoelectric technology was studied in this paper. The characteristics of temperature difference between the pavement and ambient air, {{as well as the}} temperature gradient within road surface were investigated by collecting data on-site in different seasons. Based on this, a novel set of road thermoelectric generator system (RTEGS) was developed, which can generate electricity when there is a temperature difference between road surface and ambient air. In addition, a RTEGS prototype was fabricated to verify the energy generation capacity based on indoor and outdoor tests. Results showed that the output voltage of RTEGS was about 0. 4 V by <b>asphalt</b> mixture <b>slab</b> (300 mm × 300 mm by size), when the temperature difference between road surface and ambient air was 15 oC in winter. While in summer, the output voltage was about 0. 6 V to 0. 7 V, with a temperature difference of 25 oC to 30 oC. This means that some 160 kWh of energy can be obtained in 8 hours from a road of 1 km in length and 10 m in width. For asphalt pavement in tropical and subtropical regions, the large temperature difference would be more suitable for RTEGS. The findings and research experiments from this study will provide a good starting point and reference for the development and application of pavement thermoelectric technology...|$|R
40|$|Distresses on asphalt {{pavements}} {{are associated}} to the traffic and moisture both in asphalt and granular layers. The traffic on road pavements is responsible by {{the occurrence of}} cracks that promote the pavement failure. The quality of the asphalt mixes, measured by its density, {{is an important factor}} to ensure the integrity of the pavements. The water in pavement surface decreases the driving comfort and reduces the asphalt-aggregate bond leading to the degradation of the asphalt materials. Thus, this paper uses Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) tests to assess density and moisture content on <b>asphalt</b> mix <b>slabs.</b> Six <b>asphalt</b> mixes were produced in laboratory with the same aggregate gradation and asphalt type, varying the binder content (4. 0, 5. 0 and 6. 0 %) and the air-void content (from 3. 7 % up to 16. 9 %). For the assessment of the moisture content, each mix was tested with 5, 10, 20 and 40 % of the air-void volume filled with water. The effect of the water on GPR results was performed after the sprinkling of the water and 24 h after the water application. Results show that the density of the asphalt mixes can be well predicted by the Complex Refractive Index Model while the presence of water is not easy to identify due to the connectivity of the air-voids inside the asphalt mixesCOST (European COoperation on Science and Technology) Action TU 1208 “Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar. ”info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For the {{assessment}} of the condition of concrete bridge decks {{it is important to know}} the moisture and the salinity of the concrete. Usually, the salinity is determined by potential measurements and is verified by analyzing samples in the laboratory. However, this method requires the removal of the pavement. We developed a novel technique for nondestructive determination of the complex dielectric permittivity of the concrete which operates nondestructively from a wagon running on the pavement. Using a 1 GHz Ground Penetrating Radar, the transient time of the electromagnetic wave to the upper layer reinforcement bars (rebars) is measured. The depth of the rebars is determined by a magnetic measurement of two components of the static magnetic field of the premagnetized rebars using feedbacklinearized GMR magnetometers. This magnetic depth determination technique is independent of the dielectric properties of the materials covering the rebars. Comparison of the Radar delay and the magnetically extracted depth yields the averaged real part of the dielectric permittivity of the intermediate material. The imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity is estimated from the reflected Radar amplitude. The moisture and salt content of the concrete is derived from the measured complex dielectric permittivity using interpolated calibration curves. The method was evaluated using a test block of reinforced concrete with water and chloride contaminated nests and an <b>asphalt</b> cover <b>slab,</b> resembling a typical bridge deck. The system was tested on two highway bridge decks. The dielectric constant of the concrete close to the surface was mapped. The advantages and the limitations of the new technique are discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Investigations on asphalt {{produced}} and compacted {{in the laboratory}} are indispensable for a forecast assessment of the presumed performance behaviour of asphalt. For this, predominantly cylindrical samples or sample slabs are required for technical testing responses of the deformation resistance of the asphalts in heat and prismatic samples for the response to crack resistance in cold conditions and the fatigue resistance under repeated load conditions. Since {{the end of the}} 1970 's it is a well known fact that the mechanical characteristics of asphalt to a large degree can be influenced by the type of compaction in the laboratory. This was confirmed {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 's as part of a research project sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Transport at the Institut fuer Strassenwesen der Technischen Universitaet Braunschweig (Institute for Road Building of the Technical University of Braunschweig). The aim of the current research project was therefore to design a laboratory asphalt compaction machine and to optimise the technical boundary conditions process to such an extent that <b>asphalt</b> sample <b>slabs</b> or samples could be produced, the mechanical characteristics of which correspond to those of field compacted asphalts in heat, cold and repeat loading conditions. This aim could be achieved with a laboratory asphalt compacting machine in which the asphalt coated materials are compacted in a heat chamber at a pre-defined temperature by means of a roller to a targeted density level. By means of path-controlled pre-compacting and powercontrolled main compacting the sample slabs can be produced with equal density and thickness distribution which have adequate mechanical characteristics of practical application.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new test method simulating the effect of ageing on skid resistance. This test is applied to bituminous mixes in this study, but can also be applied to concrete. This test relies on two machines, the Wehner–Schulze machine, to measure the friction, and the Weatherometer sunset machine, to simulate weather effects (rain, wind, sunlight, etc.). The relevance of this test is evaluated from comparisons between changes in friction and a chemical function linked to bitumen ageing: the carbonyl index. Validation is performed on bituminous mixture samples exposed to natural and accelerated ageing modes. Three very thin <b>asphalt</b> concrete (VTAC) <b>slabs</b> are manufactured in the laboratory with three different types of bitumens. Two specimens are extracted from each slab: one for natural ageing and the other for accelerated ageing. The evolutions of friction and carbonyl index measured on these samples submitted to the two ageing modes exhibit similar tendencies for all three bitumen types, thus confirming the relevance of the test. A conversion factor describing the correspondence between the durations of accelerated ageing and those of natural ageing is proposed for each type of bitume...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern about the {{scarcity}} of water resources due to population growth and increased demand for potable water. Thus, the rational use of water has become necessary for the conservation of such resources. The objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the potential for potable water savings in buildings of different sectors—residential, public and commercial—in the city of Florianópolis, southern Brazil, by using stormwater harvested from porous pavements. Models were constructed to assess infiltration and rainwater quality; samples of stormwater from a local road were collected to evaluate its quality; and computer simulation was performed to assess the potential for potable water savings and rainwater tank sizing. Draining <b>asphalt</b> concrete <b>slabs</b> with two types of modifiers were used, i. e., tire rubber and SBS polymer—styrene-butadiene-styrene. The Netuno computer programme was used to simulate the potential for potable water savings considering the use of rainwater for non-potable uses such as flushing toilets and urinals, cleaning external areas, and garden watering. Average stormwater infiltration was 85. 4 %. It was observed that stormwater is not completely pure. From the models, the pH was 5. 4 and the concentrations of ammonia, phosphorus, nitrite, and dissolved oxygen were 0. 41, 0. 14, 0. 002, and 9. 0 mg/L, respectively. The results for the stormwater runoff of a paved road were 0. 23, 0. 11, 0. 12, 0. 08, 1. 41, 2. 11, 0. 02, and 9. 0 mg/L for the parameters aluminium, ammonia, copper, chromium, iron, phosphorus, nitrite, and dissolved oxygen, respectively; and the pH was 6. 7. In the city of Florianópolis, which has a surface area of paved roads of approximately 11, 044, 216 m², the potential for potable water savings ranged from 1. 2 % to 19. 4 % in the residential sector, 2. 1 % to 75. 7 % in the public sector and 6. 5 % to 70. 0 % in the commercial sector...|$|R
40|$|A seismic {{approach}} {{is used to}} estimate the thickness and elastic stiffness constants of <b>asphalt</b> or concrete <b>slabs.</b> The overall concept of the approach utilizes the robustness of the multichannel seismic method. A multichannel-equivalent data set is compiled from multiple time series recorded from multiple hammer impacts at progressively different offsets from a fixed receiver. This multichannel simulation with one receiver (MSOR) replaces the true multichannel recording in a cost-effective and convenient manner. A recorded data set is first processed to evaluate the shear wave velocity through a wave field transformation, normally used in the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method, followed by a Lambwave inversion. Then, the same data set is used to evaluate compression wave velocity from a combined processing of the first-arrival picking and a linear regression. Finally, the amplitude spectra of the time series are {{used to evaluate the}} thickness by following the concepts utilized in the Impact Echo (IE) method. Due to the powerful signal extraction capabilities ensured by the multichannel processing schemes used, the entire procedure for all three evaluations can be fully automated and results can be obtained directly in the field.
