2500|$|Normally, the (non-placement) new {{functions}} throw an exception, of type std::bad_alloc, if {{they encounter}} an error, such as exhaustion of all available memory. This was not how the functions were defined by Stroustrup's Annotated C++ Reference Manual, {{but was a}} change made by the standardization committee when the C++ language was standardized. The original behaviour of the functions, which was to return a [...] pointer when <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred,</b> is accessible via placement syntax.|$|E
6000|$|No notice (or almost none) of misprints in Wordsworth's own text is taken, in {{the notes}} to this edition. Sometimes <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred,</b> and was carried on {{through more than}} one edition, and {{corrected}} in the next: e.g., in 'The Childless Father', the editions of 1827, 1832, and 1836 have the line: ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{function}} returns [...] if <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred.</b> Otherwise, it returns {{an integer}} representing the newly assigned descriptor.|$|E
5000|$|On {{several of}} the band's {{compilation}} albums, <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> with [...] "The Sign", cutting one second from the beginning.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> typeI <b>error</b> <b>occurs</b> when convicting <b>an</b> {{innocent}} person (a miscarriage of justice). <b>A</b> typeII <b>error</b> <b>occurs</b> when letting <b>a</b> guilty person go free (<b>an</b> <b>error</b> of impunity).|$|R

5000|$|Similar to an [...] "out" [...] argument, {{a global}} {{variable}} can store what error occurred (or simply whether <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred).</b>|$|E

5000|$|If <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs,</b> it is logged and {{a ticket}} is issued to the user. That allows error tracking.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{connection}} is accepted, it is dequeued. On success, 0 is returned. If <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs,</b> -1 is returned.|$|R
50|$|Programs that {{automatically}} loaded the patch for the ONERR GOTO bug would crash if <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred,</b> as this bug was already fixed.|$|E
50|$|If an {{instruction}} pointer error occurs during the execution {{and a program}} points to a memory segment filled with NOP instructions, inevitably <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> and is recognized.|$|E
50|$|A {{maintenance}} cell {{indicates that}} <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> with a data block {{at the far}} end of the link. This cell then sends a message back to the near end.|$|E

50|$|If <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs</b> at any {{instance}} {{in the above}} events, the browser will trigger <b>an</b> <b>error</b> event and stop the process. Given below are <b>a</b> few <b>errors</b> that can <b>occur</b> when re-downloading resources.|$|R
5000|$|Levels of REPLs. In many Lisp systems if <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs</b> {{during the}} reading, {{evaluation}} or printing of an expression, {{the system is}} not thrown back to the top-level with <b>an</b> <b>error</b> message. Instead <b>a</b> new REPL, one level deeper, is started in the error context. The user can then inspect the problem, fix it and continue - if possible. If <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs</b> in such <b>a</b> debug REPL, another REPL, again a level deeper, is started. Often the REPL offers special debug commands.|$|R
50|$|Unlike diff, {{the return}} code from comm has no logical {{significance}} concerning {{the relationship of}} the two files. A return code of 0 indicates success, a return code >0 indicates <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> during processing.|$|E
5000|$|... is used {{to check}} on the state of a socket in a set of sockets. The set can be tested to see if any socket can be written to, read from or if <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred.</b>|$|E
50|$|Once the {{received}} vector {{has been}} determined to be error-free or corrected if <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> (assuming only zero or one bit errors are possible) then the received data needs to be decoded back into the original four bits.|$|E
5000|$|Error handling. The REPL {{provides}} restarts. These restarts can be used, when <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs,</b> {{to go back}} to {{a certain}} REPL level.|$|R
50|$|Communication will {{continue}} until either the master transmits a 0 (NoMAK) during the acknowledge sequence, or <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs.</b> Assuming no <b>errors</b> <b>occur,</b> {{this means that}} commands can continue indefinitely if the master chooses.|$|R
50|$|During execution, when <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs,</b> {{the script}} host issues a message stating {{the type of}} error {{and the number of}} the {{offending}} line.|$|R
50|$|<b>An</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> {{during the}} second {{rendezvous}} docking operation which {{was carried out in}} August 1998. The troubleshooting to identify this error was done in early March 1999. All previously planned robot experiments were completed by the end of March. Additional experiments were planned and carried out later.|$|E
5000|$|<b>An</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> in the {{previous}} reading of this inscription. Thus, the word “navvab” (noble) {{was thought to be}} the name of the painter when the painting was first registered in them museum. As a result, the portrait of a young man had been identified as a portrait painted by Mir Mohsun Navvab in his youth.|$|E
50|$|When {{the target}} returns a Check Condition in {{response}} to a command it is indicating that it has entered a contingent allegiance condition. This means that <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> when it attempted to execute a SCSI command. The initiator usually then issues a SCSI Request Sense command in order to obtain a Key Code Qualifier (KCQ) from the target.|$|E
5000|$|If U {{is equal}} to I, then no <b>error</b> <b>occurs.</b> If , <b>a</b> bit flip <b>error</b> <b>occurs.</b> If , <b>a</b> sign flip <b>error</b> <b>occurs.</b> If [...] then both <b>a</b> bit flip <b>error</b> and <b>a</b> sign flip <b>error</b> <b>occur.</b> Due to linearity, {{it follows that the}} Shor code can correct {{arbitrary}} 1-qubit errors.|$|R
2500|$|If an exec {{function}} does {{return to}} the calling program, <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>occurs,</b> the return value is −1, and errno is set {{to one of the}} following values: ...|$|R
