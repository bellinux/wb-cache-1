5|$|As {{the story}} begins, {{a woman named}} Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's {{assistant}} at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in {{putting an end to}} them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> out from the window in their room, they hear the sound of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} at the Asian Branch headquarters, Allen's Innocence takes its true form: the , a cape-like Innocence which is armor and has a small claw (allowing Allen to perform new techniques). He rejoins his comrades in Edo, where the group is trapped in Noah's Ark. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> for a way off the Ark, Allen and his friends fight the Noah. In his rematch with Tyki, Allen {{transforms}} his left arm into a sword which exorcises evil (allowing him to win). When Cross appears and saves Allen from Tyki's new Noah appearance, he directs him to restore the falling Ark by playing a piano. Returning to headquarters, Allen learns {{that he is the}} host of the late 14th Noah (Nea), who betrayed the Earl, was killed and was related to Mana. Before his death, Nea implanted his memories in Allen so he would be reborn. All Exorcists are ordered to kill Allen before he begins transforming into a Noah. While Allen controls his body, he begins turning into Nea; Crown Clown's sword hurts him, despite its only affecting Noah and Akuma.|$|E

25|$|Changes to the plumage are variable; {{many have}} been {{selected}} to lose dark brown tones of the wild bird. The result is an animal marked, or completely covered in white feathers. Others retain plumage close to the natural; some, such as the modern Toulouse goose look almost identical to the greylag in plumage, differing only in structure. White geese are often preferred <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> better plucked and dressed, with any small down feathers remaining being less conspicuous.

25|$|Palenque is a {{city and}} {{municipality}} located {{in the north of}} the state of Chiapas, Mexico. The city was named almost 200 years before the famous nearby Mayan ruins were discovered in the 18th century. The area has a significant indigenous population, mostly of the Ch'ol people, a Mayan descendent. The city is the only urban area in a municipality of over 600 communities and it is surrounded by rainforest. However, deforestation has had dramatic effects on the local environment, with howler monkeys occasionally seen in the city itself <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> for food. While most of the municipality’s population is highly marginalized economically, working in agriculture, the Palenque archeological site {{is one of the most}} important tourist attractions for both the area and the state of Chiapas.

25|$|Ron Harper and James Naughton played Alan Virdon and Peter Burke, two 20th-century American astronauts {{who pass}} through a time warp to a future where apes subjugate humans (unlike the {{original}} film, the humans can speak). Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts. Booth Coleman played orangutan Councillor Zaius and Mark Lenard played gorilla General Urko. The episodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> for answers, aid downtrodden humans and apes, and avoid the authorities. The show premiered on September 13, 1974, filling CBS' 8–9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned low ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the series famous. Given the considerable production costs, CBS cancelled the show after 14 episodes, the last airing on December 20, 1974.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at {{the burning}} night sky over the Underworld Storybrooke, Hades and Zelena {{are on a}} date, as he {{explained}} why he created the world for her, then tells Zelena {{that he wants to}} follow her back to the real Storybrooke, if he is able to restore his heart and become human again. However, he also tells Zelena that {{in order to do that}} he wants to leave the outsiders in the Underworld forever, then he asks her to be his partner in chaos (a modified version of a wedding proposal), leaving Zelena feeling awkward. Hades also tells her that he took the precaution of adding the remaining outsiders' names to more tombstones, after Mary Margaret had her name replaced by David's. Unfortunately for Zelena, Regina saw this through a magic mirror, and then confronts Zelena afterwards, as the latter thinks that Hades, like Robin Hood (or Regina), might not be a villain forever. Regina explain this to the rest of the outsiders, saying that Zelena was thinking irrationally and in danger, and telling them that the only way to solve this problem was to go to Cora, to break them up. Cora is working in the Underworld Mill, situated above the Lethe, the yellow-colored River of Forgetfulness, and supervised by two guards. She finds a hook hidden under the stalks on grain, cuts off the black anti-magic handcuff, and uses her magic to knock out the guards. Escaping, she bumps into Hook who retrieves his hook and brings her to Regina.|$|E

500|$|To {{represent}} the prologue to the war, the obverse {{of the monument}} (the side facing North Terrace) features a relief of the Spirit of Duty appearing as a vision before the youth of South Australia, represented in the work by a sculptural group consisting of a girl, a student and a farmer abandoning the [...] "symbols of their craft". The three are depicted in normal dress, as they are not yet soldiers and are currently unprepared for the war that is to come, and they are facing away from the world <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> to the vision before them. In Bagot's original plan, submitted for the 1924 competition, {{there was to be}} but a single nude figure kneeling before the vision (for which Bagot posed while in Europe), but Laybourne-Smith's 1926 submission became grander in its scope. In addition, Bagot's original designs were naturalistic, with the Spirit of Duty depicted as a female figure, but under Hoff's direction the figure was changed to male, and the style of the reliefs was changed to Art Deco—a [...] "radically new" [...] art style for Australia at the time. Hoff, however, presented the sculptural group in the original naturalistic style, thus providing a [...] "bridge between the Renaissance-style architecture and the Art Deco of the reliefs".|$|E

The man then warns Peter that the world will end because of the Y2K problem, so Peter locks himself and the family in their basement in hazmat suits. Just after midnight, the Y2K bug hits, causing a worldwide nuclear attack The Griffins remain unharmed, and <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> for survivors, they discover that Joe has been melted into his driveway, his son Kevin has been vaporized, and Quagmire and Cleveland have been stitched together and are now called [...] "Clevemire" [...] (or [...] "Quagland"), and Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons have eaten Tricia Takanawa. Starving, Peter immediately eats all the dehydrated meals, without adding water. Peter recalls that the snack food Twinkies are the only food that can survive a nuclear holocaust, so the family travels to Natick, Massachusetts, in hopes that the Twinkie factory has survived.|$|E
