The acoustic radiator assembly is characterized in that a control unit (3) is present, which is designed {{in such a way that}} the sheet materials, which are supported in such as way that the sheet materials can vibrate, can be excited so as to cause vibrations having a phase difference among each other, in particular having a phase difference in the range of approximately 90 degrees to approximately 180 degrees...|$|R

Below is their description of the cliff: [...] …a board laid across a large sheet of heavy glass which is supported a foot or more above the floor.

5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included <b>side</b> <b>sheets</b> extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it would seem that the <b>side</b> <b>sheets</b> made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|R
5000|$|The 14 car train, {{en route}} from Waycross, Georgia, to Montgomery, Alabama, was {{traveling}} westbound on a single track line through Stockton at a speed of 65 mph, when a broken rail beneath the 9th car derailed the 10th-14th cars into <b>a</b> <b>siding</b> where they collided with a freight train which had been standing there to let the passenger train pass. All the fatalities occurred in the 10th car which was [...] "sheared practically its entire length diagonally from the floor on the right hand side to the juncture of the roof and <b>side</b> <b>sheets</b> on the left hand side".

40|$|During {{the first}} and second Mercury flyby the MESSENGER {{spacecraft}} detected <b>a</b> dawn <b>side</b> double-current <b>sheet</b> inside the Hermean magnetosphere that was labeled the “double magnetopause” (Slavin, J. A. et al. [2008]. Science 321, 85). This double current sheet confines a region of decreased magnetic field that is referred to as Mercury’s “dayside boundary layer” (Anderson, M., Slavin, J., Horth, H. [2011]. Planet. Space Sci.). Up to the present day the double current sheet, the boundary layer and the key processes leading to their formation are not well understood. In order to advance the understanding of this region we have carried out self-consistent plasma simulations of the Hermean magnetosphere by means of the hybrid simulation code A. I. K. E. F. (Müller, J., Simon, S., Motschmann, U., Schüle, J., Glassmeier, K., Pringle, G. J. [2011]. Comput. Phys. Commun. 182, 946 – 966). Magnetic field and plasma results are in excellent agreement with the MESSENGER observations. In contrast to former speculations our results prove this double current sheet may exist in a pure solar wind hydrogen plasma, i. e. {{in the absence of any}} exospheric ions like sodium. Both currents are similar in orientation but the outer is stronger in intensity. While the outer current sheet can be considered the “classical” magnetopause, the inner current sheet between the magnetopause and Mercury’s surface reveals to be sustained by a diamagnetic current that originates from proton pressure gradients at Mercury’s inner magnetosphere. The pressure gradients in turn exist due to protons that are trapped on closed magnetic field lines and mirrored between north and south pole. Both, the dayside and nightside diamagnetic decreases that have been observed during the MESSENGER mission show to be direct consequences of this diamagnetic current that we label Mercury’s “boundary-layer-current“...|$|R
