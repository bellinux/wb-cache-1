5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio {{early on in the}} film's development, but by that time the studio <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E

At 15:50, the British fleet had been placed on two hours readiness and at 19:05 were ordered to sail south from Scapa Flow. Around midnight, the Harwich Force (Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt) of three light cruisers and 18destroyers was ordered to move north.|$|E
25|$|I {{returned}} to a Salonika destroyed. I was hoping to find my adopted brother, but rumor told that he had died of malaria in Lublin. I <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{opportunities}} in 1944 of international and nationwide gathering of Bahá'ís, the first Bahá'í World Congress {{was attended by}} Bahá'ís from South Carolina where again {{the scope of the}} community was more plain and invigorating to those that attended. “Seeing all these people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, the beauty of these diverse people coming together for one purpose, I knew it could happen all over the world. It wasn’t just in Greenville, South Carolina; this was a world community.…I <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> but at the World Congress I saw it.” This event saw the election of the Universal House of Justice, the new head of the religion since the death of Shoghi Effendi, for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Paneth and Peters in the 1920s <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{palladium}} {{can absorb}} up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen gas, storing it at several {{thousands of times}} the atmospheric pressure. This led them {{to believe that they}} could increase the nuclear fusion rate by simply loading palladium rods with hydrogen gas. Tandberg then tried the same experiment but used electrolysis to make palladium absorb more deuterium and force the deuterium further together inside the rods, thus anticipating the main elements of Fleischmann and Pons' experiment. They all hoped that pairs of hydrogen nuclei would fuse together to form helium, which at the time was needed in Germany to fill zeppelins, but no evidence of helium or of increased fusion rate was ever found.|$|E
25|$|Egypt and Syria {{launched}} the Yom Kippur War against Israel in the Sinai {{and in the}} Golan Heights on 6October 1973 without Hussein's knowledge. Between 10September and 6October, Hussein secretly met with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir in Tel Aviv on 25September. Israeli leaks of the meeting led to rumors in the Arab World that Hussein had tipped off Meir about Arab intentions. Hussein only discussed with Meir what both <b>already</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>that</b> the Syrian army was on alert. On 13October Jordan joined the war and sent the 40thbrigade to assist the Syrians in the Golan Heights. Some see it as ironic {{that it was the}} same brigade that had been sent to deter the Syrian invasion during Black September in 1970. Subsequent peace talks with Israel collapsed; while Jordan wanted a complete Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Israel preferred to retain control but with Jordanian administration.|$|E
25|$|Foster and Ross decided {{together}} that further effort would be futile, so the flotilla began {{to withdraw the}} next day. They had not gone far when they encountered a group of Union transports bringing in reinforcements {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Isaac F. Quinby, whose appointment predated that of Ross and who therefore ranked him. Quinby ordered Ross to go back down the river to renew the attack, and he persuaded Foster (whom he could not order) to accompany him. A few desultory probes were launched in the next several days, but Quinby found what Ross <b>already</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>that</b> the land was unsuitable for an infantry assault. Quinby received orders from Grant to return to the Mississippi, where he and Ross were needed for the next assault on Vicksburg. The flotilla withdrew from Fort Pemberton for the last time, and by April 14 all had returned.|$|E

25|$|After their {{missions}} for the Navy, Knorr {{arrived on}} site on August 22, 1985, and deployed Argo. When they {{searched for the}} two submarines, Ballard and his team discovered that they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth. It littered thousands of pieces of debris all over the ocean floor. Following the large trail of debris led them directly to both and made it significantly {{easier for them to}} locate them than if they were to search for the hulls directly. He <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the Titanic imploded from pressure as well, much the same way the two submarines did, and concluded that it too must have also left a scattered debris trail. Using that lesson, they had Argo sweep {{back and forth across the}} ocean floor looking for the Titanic's debris trail. They took shifts monitoring the video feed from Argo as it searched the ocean floor two miles below.|$|E

After taunting Mulder and Scully, he reveals to Scully what Mulder <b>already</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>that</b> the alien re-colonization of Earth is set for December 22, 2012.

500|$|As {{the end of}} term approaches, Rook begins getting strange emails about Isabella's death, {{and begins}} seeing shinigami figures. Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother asks {{to speak to him}} {{concerning}} misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations. When he meets her, he finds that Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students made it look like she was dead via Amie as a prank that got out of control. Furthermore, they <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he could see their messages; Akira's mother explains that the students have no idea of online privacy, having always had technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put online—even [...] "private" [...] messages—might be read by anyone. The game ends with Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during the game by the player.|$|E
500|$|The staff {{struggled}} {{throughout the}} writing process to decide which Winchester would be kidnapped and possessed, and were forced to revise the script multiple times to reflect the latest choice. Because of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's recurring role on Grey's Anatomy, however, the writers realized {{that he would not}} be available long enough to be a main focus of the episode. They thus decided late into production for John to be the one who is captured. With this finalized, Kripke found it rather easy to write the episode; he <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the key elements of the episode would be the exorcism of the demon possessing Meg, the death of the real Meg, and the apparent rescue of John Winchester. Kripke felt that it had to be John who was possessed by Azazel, as it united and completed the two main storylines of the seasonfinding their father and tracking down the demonand it did so by finding both characters in one body. He found it a [...] "happy accident" [...] to be able to present the brothers with the opportunity to finally kill the demon, but at the cost of their father's life.|$|E
500|$|Alexander O. Smith, {{who worked}} as a writer on the {{localization}} of the first Ace Attorney game, also worked on the localization of Apollo Justice. Localization of the game was already in progress by August 2007. The name [...] "Apollo Justice" [...] was decided in collaboration between the Japanese and American divisions of Capcom; it took them twenty-two meetings to decide on it. The name refers to how Apollo fights for justice. During the localization, there was some debate about {{the use of the word}} [...] "panties" [...] to describe Trucy's magical bloomers, a prop she uses in her magic shows; some on the localization team felt that it was inappropriate to joke about an underage girl's panties, and wanted them to be localized as [...] "magic pants", while some felt that the joke would be lost if the player <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> they were massive bloomers. Janet Hsu, one of the staff members working on the localization, made an argument for [...] "emotional accuracy", saying that the Japanese version of the game was trying to make the player feel at unease over looking for what they might imagine to be [...] "sexy lingerie", and then let the player feel relief at finding out that it is a prop for a magic show. In the end, they were referred to as [...] "panties".|$|E

500|$|On February 22, 2000, {{his first}} music CD Two Lips was published. It was {{followed}} on April 23, 2002 {{by his first}} comedy CD, I Am Not Homer, in which {{he and his wife}} perform several comedy skits. The majority of the sketches had been written and performed before the CD was recorded, and Castellaneta thought {{that it would be a}} good idea to preserve them [...] "since [...] don't perform them much anymore." [...] Some came from their sketch series on a local radio station in Chicago and had to be lengthened from the [...] "two-minute bits" [...] that they were originally, while several others were stage sketches performed in a comedy club in Santa Monica. Additionally, [...] "Citizen Kane", a sketch in which two people discuss the film Citizen Kane with different meanings, was something the pair had performed at an art gallery. Castellaneta noted that [...] "we <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> these skits were funny, [...] some of them we polished and tightened." [...] The skits were principally written by improvising from a basic point, transcribing the results and then editing them to the finished scene. Castellaneta chose the title I Am Not Homer as a parody of Leonard Nimoy's famous first autobiography I Am Not Spock, as well as to show that most of the comedy featured [...] "is not the typical Homer comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} devised {{following}} a lecture given by writer Mike Bullen {{and executive producer}} Andy Harries at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference in November 2000. Bullen and Harries <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> actress Fay Ripley {{did not want to}} renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted [...] "for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go". The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1. As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, [...] "One of them , whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters." [...] Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country. The direction of the fourth series, and thus the finale, changed significantly when Helen Baxendale announced that she was pregnant.|$|E

In one case, Beria picked up Tatiana Okunevskaya, a well-known Soviet actress, under the pretence of bringing her to perform for the Politburo. Instead he took her to his dacha where he offered to free her father and grandmother from NKVD prison if she submitted. He then raped her telling her [...] "scream or not, it doesn't matter."
