5|$|A {{large portion}} of the field surveys and {{research}} conducted with regards to threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> species in Michigan is undertaken by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) program. The MNFI program was originally developed in 1980 as part of the state natural heritage programs conceptualized by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), through which it received its first funding. The MNFI program severed relations with TNC in 2000, and became a program of the Michigan State University Extension Services.|$|E

5|$|B.brownii occurs {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is rare <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> {{in its natural}} habitat, with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.|$|E
5|$|Fiji {{has another}} Erythrura species, the rare <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> pink-billed parrotfinch. This {{is a larger}} bird with a green head, blue crown and black face, and a very large pink bill. The Fiji parrotfinch resembles the closely related royal and {{red-headed}} parrotfinches, and the rare blue-headed variant is very like the blue-faced parrotfinch, but these three species do not occur in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|The Southern California DPS, {{which was}} listed as {{endangered}} in 2011, has been affected by habitat loss due to dams, confinement of streams in concrete channels, water pollution, groundwater pumping, urban heat island effects, and other byproducts of urbanization.

5|$|The pardalotes are a {{small family}} of very small, brightly {{coloured}} birds native to Australia, with short tails, strong legs and stubby blunt beaks. They feed on insects, generally in the canopy of eucalypts and nest in burrows. Three species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic <b>and</b> <b>endangered.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} listed as {{vulnerable}} in 1996 <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> as recently as 1988. Most monitored stocks have rebounded {{since the end of}} commercial whaling.

5|$|The valley {{also has}} {{a wide variety of}} small mammals with larger species {{including}} Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and deer (Cervidae). The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). A rare <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E

5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile <b>and</b> <b>endangered,</b> building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the network}} of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), the Tualatin River refuge {{is one of only}} ten urban refuges in the United States. Habitats in the refuge include forested areas, wetlands, oak and pine grassland, and meadows, with mixed {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests common to Western Oregon. The refuge was established as an urban refuge to provide wetland, riparian, and upland habitats for a variety of migratory birds, threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> species, fish and other resident wildlife. The refuge is home to nearly 200 bird species and more than 70 other animal species.|$|E

5|$|Plant life is {{extremely}} diverse and ranges from sun-loving species {{to those that}} grow in dense shade. Tree cover dominates the publicly owned acreage, and is a significant component on privately owned lands. Oak-hickory is the predominant timber type, however, many other commercially important timber species also occupy significant acreages. More than 500 wildlife species {{can be found in}} the Forest, including 48 mammals, 237 birds, 52 reptiles, 57 amphibians, and 109 species of fish. There are seven federally listed threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> species that inhabit the Forest, as well as 33 species which are considered regionally sensitive, and 114 Forest-listed species.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the Creek Turnpike, from US-75 in Jenks to US-64/US-169 in Tulsa, was first {{authorized}} in 1987, with construction beginning in 1989. The turnpike's construction was controversial; homeowners along {{the route of the}} highway formed a group called Tulsans Against Turnpikes to fight the highway in both the courtroom and the media. The highway was also challenged on environmental grounds, with impacts upon wetlands <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> species being the chief concerns. Nevertheless, the highway opened to traffic in three sections, starting from the easternmost, {{over the course of the}} first half of 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{region is}} {{home to one of}} the largest populations of {{endangered}} Indian elephant and Bengal Tiger in India. Elephant populations are found in eight fragmented sites in South India; in northern Karnataka, along the Western Ghats, in Bhadra–Malnad, in Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats, in Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore, in Anamalai–Parambikulam, in Periyar–Srivilliputhur and Agasthyamalai The region {{is home to}} one-third of the tiger population {{and more than half of}} the elephant population of India. There are 14 Project Tiger reserves and 11 Project Elephant reserves in the region. Other threatened <b>and</b> <b>endangered</b> species found in the region include grizzled giant squirrel, grey slender loris, sloth bear, nilgiri tahr, nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, and Indian leopard.|$|E
