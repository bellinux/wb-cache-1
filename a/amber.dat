5|$|A {{young boy}} named Cooper and his girlfriend, <b>Amber,</b> are seen searching frantically for {{civilisation}} after {{they take a}} wrong turn. They are caught in a storm and head to a nearby mansion to seek shelter. Once outside, Cooper checks his map, but is unaware that someone is watching. Baron von Ghoul, the game's main antagonist, looks down from his window and orders two gargoyles to retrieve Cooper and <b>Amber.</b> <b>Amber</b> is kidnapped by the gargoyles and is taken into the Ghouly Mansion, with Cooper in pursuit. Once inside the mansion, Cooper realises that <b>Amber</b> {{is nowhere to be}} seen in the Grand Hallway. Crivens, the mansion's butler, tells him to go to the archives where <b>Amber</b> is held. On the way, a huge group of boxing skeletons challenge Cooper to a boxing match, with Cooper emerging victorious. Upon reaching the archives, Cooper finds <b>Amber</b> being held hostage by a mad scientist named Dr. Krackpot. Krackpot then shoots <b>Amber</b> with his laser rifle and she transforms into a horrible creature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amber</b> {{workshops}} {{appeared in}} Palanga during the 17th century; guilds {{devoted to the}} material functioned in Brügge, Lübeck, Danzig, and Königsberg. By {{the end of the}} 18th century Palanga {{was the center of the}} Russian Empire's <b>amber</b> industry. In the years preceding World War I about 2,000 kilograms of raw <b>amber</b> were processed in Palanga annually.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{runs for}} help and goes into the kitchen. Ma Soupswill, the cook, is delighted to help, but Cooper must {{retrieve}} three ingredients: Glowworms, a giant egg, and a sprig of dungweed. After retrieving the ingredients, Ma Soupswill creates a potion to reverse the effects on <b>Amber.</b> However, she unwittingly transforms <b>Amber</b> into an even more hideous monster, having added the wrong spice, and <b>Amber</b> attacks Cooper in anger. Cooper defeats the mutated <b>Amber</b> and Ma Soupswill arrives with the correct spice, finally transforming <b>Amber</b> back to herself. Afterward, Cooper and <b>Amber</b> attempt to escape the mansion but are stopped by Mr. Ribs (Ma Soupswill's assistant). He tells them to help free the other children who are imprisoned all over the mansion. Cooper seeks Crivens {{for help and}} tells him that only the Baron has the key to free them. To get to his room, Cooper must collect three pieces of a rhyme which {{opens the door to}} the Baron's room. Once there, a battle ensues, and Cooper emerges victorious.|$|E
30|$|We {{believe that}} this work {{demonstrates}} that gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and derivatisation in situ with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) are particularly suited for the characterization of <b>ambers.</b> This approach enabled us to identify the geographical origin of the archaeological <b>ambers.</b> The archaeological samples from the Italian sites were found to consist of Succinite, thus ruling out any possible Italian origin of the <b>ambers</b> (such as Simetite from Sicily or <b>ambers</b> from the Dolomites or Apennines) which {{have been shown to}} contain small or non-detectable quantities of succinic acid [30].|$|R
50|$|Canzoneri kept {{fighting}} and winning and on May 10, 1935, {{he found himself}} in a ring for a world title again, this time against Lou <b>Ambers,</b> who had earned the World Lightweight title that once had belonged to Canzoneri. Canzoneri once again won the World Lightweight title by outpointing <b>Ambers</b> over 15 rounds. After successfully defending his Lightweight title once, he lost it again in a rematch with <b>Ambers</b> by a 15-round decision. There was a rubber match between the two and <b>Ambers</b> once again won a decision in 15 rounds.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>Ambers</b> {{wanted to}} {{continue}} with his career, his manager, Al Weill, convinced {{him that he was}} through, and to retire. <b>Ambers</b> never fought again. After his retirement from boxing, <b>Ambers</b> operated a restaurant, and also worked in public relations. He died on April 24, 1995 in Phoenix, Arizonahttp://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/ambers-l.htm. He is interred at the Saint Francis Cemetery in Phoenix http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=23764328.|$|R
5|$|In 1998, two {{separate}} teams, one German and one Lithuanian, announced they had located the <b>Amber</b> Room. The German team {{pointed to a}} silver mine while the Lithuanian team believed the <b>amber</b> treasure was buried in a lagoon; neither of the two suggestions turned out to hold the <b>Amber</b> Room.|$|E
5|$|In Kleinmachnow, near Berlin, {{there is}} a {{miniature}} <b>Amber</b> Room, fabricated after the original. The Berlin miniature collector Ulla Klingbeil had this copy made of original East Prussian <b>amber.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operations of {{the ancient}} <b>Amber</b> Road - a trans-European, north-south <b>amber</b> trade route, {{continued}} and intensified during the Roman Empire times. From the 1st century BC the <b>Amber</b> Road connected the Baltic Sea shores and Aquileia, an important <b>amber</b> processing center. This route was controlled first by the Celts, and later by the Romans south of the Danube, by Germanic tribes north of that river, and was used for transporting a variety of traded merchandise (and slaves) besides <b>amber.</b> As told in Naturalis Historia by Pliny the Elder, {{during the reign of}} Nero an equestrian of unknown name led an expedition to the Baltic shorelines, from where he brought a huge quantity of <b>amber,</b> which was subsequently used for propaganda purposes during public games - gladiator fights. The infrastructure of the <b>Amber</b> Road was destroyed by Germanic and Sarmatian attacks {{in the second half of}} the 3rd century AD; to a lesser degree it was still used intermittently until the mid-6th century. The Przeworsk culture sites provide a rich assortment of <b>Amber</b> Road traded objects.|$|E
50|$|The rematch was as {{controversial}} {{as their}} first bout. Armstrong was penalized for low blows, which enabled <b>Ambers</b> {{to capture the}} 15-round decision on August 22, 1939. This was <b>Ambers</b> last great performance.|$|R

5|$|The 3rd century saw the Danube river {{become the}} {{principal}} artery of trade, eclipsing the <b>Amber</b> Road and other commercial routes. The redirection of investment to the Danubian forts saw the towns along the <b>Amber</b> Road growing slowly, though yet retaining their prosperity. The prolonged {{struggle between the}} Romans and the barbarians further left its mark on the towns along the <b>Amber</b> Road.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Amber</b> Road was a European trade route {{associated}} with the trade and transport of <b>amber.</b> <b>Amber</b> satisfied the criteria for long distance trade as it was light in weight and was in high demand for ornamental purposes around the Mediterranean. Before the establishment of Roman control over areas such as Pannonia, the <b>Amber</b> Road was virtually the only route available for long distance trade.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Amber</b> Room was looted during World War II by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany, {{and brought}} to Königsberg for {{reconstruction}} and display. Its current whereabouts remain a mystery. In 1979, efforts were undertaken to rebuild the <b>Amber</b> Room at Tsarskoye Selo. In 2003, after decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany, the reconstructed <b>Amber</b> Room was inaugurated at the Catherine Palace near Saint Petersburg.|$|E
50|$|Another {{involves}} Tracy skipping school, stealing shoes {{from the}} Etta Gown Shop, and {{breaking into the}} Von Tussles' home, using <b>Amber's</b> hair bleach to bleach her hair in <b>Amber's</b> sink, thus explaining Tracy's change of hair color later in the film.|$|R
5000|$|Within days of <b>Amber's</b> death, Donna Whitson was [...] "calling for tougher laws {{governing}} kidnappers and sex offenders". <b>Amber's</b> parents soon established People Against Sex Offenders (P.A.S.O.). They collected signatures hoping {{to force the}} Texas Legislature into passing more stringent laws to protect children.|$|R

5|$|The Baltic Sea coast {{has been}} a source of Eurasian <b>amber</b> trade since prehistoric times (see <b>Amber</b> Road). Neolithic {{artifacts}} made of <b>amber</b> were discovered in nearby Juodkrantė in the 19th century - these artifacts unfortunately disappeared during the 20th century. Lithuanian mythology, folklore, and art have long associations with amber; the legend of Jūratė and Kastytis imagines an undersea palace of <b>amber</b> under the Baltic, which was shattered by Perkūnas, the god of thunder. Its fragments were said to be the source of the <b>amber</b> that still washes up on the beaches nearby.|$|E

5|$|While <b>Amber</b> is {{lounging}} in a kiddie pool, she overhears Homer and Marge arguing, with Homer ultimately {{announcing that he}} is leaving Marge and the kids. Homer then invites <b>Amber</b> to Moe's for a night of drinking. The next day, a hungover <b>Amber</b> discovers that she is now married to Grampa Simpson, with the Simpsons have video evidence of the event about her vowing to forsake all other husbands when married to Grampa. <b>Amber</b> and Ginger, who escapes because she is fed up with Ned Flanders, drive away and vow never to return.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the <b>Amber</b> Room {{was never}} seen in public again, though reports have {{occasionally}} surfaced stating that pieces of the <b>Amber</b> Room survived the war. Several eyewitnesses claimed to have spotted the famous room being loaded on board the Wilhelm Gustloff, which left Gdynia on 30 January 1945, and was then promptly torpedoed and sunk by a Soviet submarine.|$|E
5|$|Cooper allies with Mr. Ribs to {{free the}} imprisoned {{children}} before finally reaching the exit of the mansion. Once outside, imps knock Cooper and Mr. Ribs out, but Ma Soupswill arrives and defeats them. Cooper regains consciousness and he and <b>Amber</b> leave the mansion, but the household staff prefer to stay. As Cooper and <b>Amber</b> walk towards a small town, the Baron can be seen flying his plane towards it.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} club's history, Hull {{have worn}} black and <b>amber</b> shirts with black shorts. These black and <b>amber</b> colours are where Hull's nickname, The Tigers, {{originated}} from. However, in the club's first match against Notts County in 1904, white shirts were worn, with black shorts and black socks. During their first season in the League, Hull wore black and <b>amber</b> striped shirts and black shorts, which they continued to wear until the Second World War {{with the exception of}} the 1935–36 season, in which they wore sky blue shirts. Following the end of the Second World War, Hull spent another season wearing sky blue, but changed to plain <b>amber</b> shirts, which they wore until the early 1960s, when they swapped back to stripes.|$|E
