[...] and then for all of the other guests to join in and say [...] "... hooray!" [...] This is normally repeated three times. In Canada, especially at young children's birthdays, {{immediately after}} [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] has been sung, the singers segue into [...] "How old are you now? How old are you now? How old are you now-ow, how old are you now?" [...] and then count up: [...] "Are you one? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two?</b> Are you..." [...] until they reach the right age, at which the celebrant says [...] "yes", and everybody else, who presumably know the right number, all cheer.|$|E
60|$|MRS MARCH. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> quarrelling about? Will {{you bring}} home cigarettes, Johnny--not Bogdogunov's Mamelukes--something more Anglo-American.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> old dears {{worrying}} about?" [...] {{she exclaimed}} lightly. [...] "You have {{the air of}} conspirators. No secrets from me, please. What is it all about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She knows, she {{longs to}} help you. Don't {{you know how}} fond of <b>you</b> she always <b>was?</b> <b>You</b> <b>two</b> {{appreciated}} each other from the first.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pious mentors!" [...] thought I. [...] "Pure {{guides for}} youth! If `Human Justice' were what {{she ought to}} <b>be,</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> would scarce hold your present post, or enjoy your present credit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, there <b>you</b> <b>be,</b> <b>you</b> <b>two!</b> Now sit ye right down, dears; DO. <b>You</b> must <b>be</b> tired out; and you, Phemie, love, draw up by {{your poor}} father. There--that's right. You'll be better soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> men mumblin' and confidin' to each other? You {{look for}} all the world like two old women gossips," [...] she said, with languid impertinence.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> also smarting under a {{sense of}} the inconsiderateness and {{selfishness}} {{of the rest of the}} world--both misunderstood--everything expected from you, and no allowances made for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As Joseph Wate, a lad of fifteen, Mr. Atkin's Malanta godson and pupil, wrote afterwards, 'Joe {{said to me}} and Sapi, [...] "We {{are going}} to look for the Bishop, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> afraid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He hates me," [...] said Mrs. Travers, {{and frowned}} at d'Alcacer's {{incipient}} smile. [...] "It isn't a delusion on my part. The worst {{is that he}} hates me not for myself. I believe he is completely indifferent to my existence. Jorgenson hates me because as it <b>were</b> I represent <b>you</b> <b>two</b> who <b>are</b> in danger, because it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> that <b>are</b> the trouble and I [...] . Well!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What?' said Mrs. Vansuythen, with a hysterical little laugh. 'Kurrell! Oh, it can't <b>be!</b> <b>You</b> <b>two</b> {{must have}} made some horrible mistake. Perhaps you you lost your temper, or misunderstood, or something. Things can't be as wrong as you say.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Milly," [...] said Mrs Moss, severely, {{when they}} met {{a few minutes later}} in the drawing-room, [...] "what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> and Mr Jackman {{laughing}} at so loudly? Surely you did not tell them what we had been speaking about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The parlour {{door opened}} {{suddenly}} {{before the other}} could reply, and revealed the face of Mrs. Kybird. [...] "Wot <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> a-quarrelling about?" [...] she demanded. [...] "Why don't you come inside and {{sit down for a}} bit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm blessed if it isn't Boy Jim! And what's this? Why, it's young Master Rodney Stone, as I'm {{a living}} sinner! What {{in the world}} <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> doing up at Cliffe Royal {{at this time of}} night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> talking about?" [...] said Lord Henry, strolling {{over to the}} table, {{and putting}} his cup down. [...] "I hope Dorian has told you about my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a {{delightful}} idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{certainly}} won't {{know him}} for a seaman now,' remarked the landlord, laughing, and again surveying Bob up and down. 'But if I <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>two,</b> I should drive home-along straight and quiet; and be very busy in the mill all to-morrow, Mr. Loveday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘O, {{here you}} are!’ he cried, {{as soon as}} they were near enough for easy speech. ‘You are a man at least, and must reply. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> after?

6000|$|... "I see you," [...] exclaimed Don Juan, [...] "and {{must believe}} my eyes. Without their evidence, however, I could scarce believe it can <b>be</b> <b>you</b> <b>two,</b> {{one of whom}} I thought on board the brig, and the other {{suffering}} a most miserable death on a naked rock." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hartley's eyes {{expressed}} incredulity; {{but he did}} not put {{his feelings}} into words, for he perceived in Lize a type with which he was entirely familiar--one to be handled with care. [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> women doing here? Are you related to one of these rangers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] said he, [...] "I {{will have}} been {{thinking}} of a very different matter, whateffer. Here are my pipes, and here <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers. It's an auld dispute which one of ye's the best. Here will be a braw chance to settle it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{excellent}} {{master of}} Monksmoor looked unaffectedly surprised. [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> young ladies making a fuss about?" [...] he said. [...] "Mr. Morris is a gentleman by profession; and--may I venture to say it, Miss Emily?--a valued {{friend of yours}} as well. Who has a better claim {{to be one of}} my guests?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{here you}} are!" [...] he cried, {{as soon as}} they were near enough for easy speech. [...] "You are a man at least, and must reply. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> after?

6000|$|... "Let us see, then. He is {{at present}} {{entitled}} to the half of five thousand dollars, {{the other half of}} which belongs to <b>you.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> who preserved the safe {{from the bottom of the}} Pacific, and if you only had waited a little longer, Mr. Tate and myself would have increased the reward." ...|$|R

6000|$|Suspicion {{crept into}} the {{protruding}} eyes of the rent collector. He waxed wroth. [...] "Say!" [...] he demanded. [...] "Who <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> guys, anyway, {{and what do you}} think you're doing here? That's what I'd like to know. What do you want with the name of the owner of this place? What business is it of yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> quarrelling about?" [...] cried a gay {{voice behind}} {{us, and we}} looked round into the {{laughing}} eyes of Miss Dale. She was the one cottager we knew in Saratoga, but when we were with her we felt that we knew everybody, so hospitable was the sense of world which her kindness exhaled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{have promised}} quite enough for you. You {{are not in}} a position, Captain Batsby, to ask me as to money;--nor is she. You shall marry her without a shilling,--or you shall not marry her at all. Which is it to be? I must have an end put to all this. I won't have you hanging about my house unless I know the reason why. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> engaged to each other?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Excuse me, it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> who <b>are</b> on {{the wrong}} tack," [...] said Mrs. Cadwallader. [...] "You should have proved {{to him that he}} loses money by bad management, and then we should all have pulled together. If you put him a-horseback on politics, I warn you of the consequences. It was all very well to ride on sticks at home and call them ideas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, what's this?" [...] {{cried the}} captain, {{when at last}} he broke the silence. [...] "You <b>two</b> <b>are</b> alike. <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> much alike. What's this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> {{lawfully}} seized and {{possessed of}} all Old England,' began Puck, in a sing-song voice. 'By right of Oak, Ash, and Thorn are you free {{to come and}} go and look and know where I shall show or best you please. You shall see What you shall see and you shall hear What you shall hear, though It shall have happened three thousand year; and you shall know neither Doubt nor Fear. Fast!

6000|$|... "Hello, hello!" [...] a gay voice called, as if {{calling to}} them both. [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> conspiring?" [...] Bushwick, as {{suddenly}} {{as if he had}} fallen from the sky or started up from the earth, stood before them, and gave a hand to each--his right to Verrian, his left to Miss Shirley. [...] "How are you, Verrian? How are you, Miss Shirley?" [...] He mocked her in the formality of his address. [...] "I've been shadowing you ever since you came into the park, but I thought I wouldn't interrupt till you seemed to have got through your conversation. May I ask what it was all about? It seemed very absorbing, from a respectful distance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] she said, in lowered tones. A sudden {{distrust}} of him seized her the next moment. [...] "Who told me I was excited?" [...] she burst out. [...] "It's {{you who are}} excited. Deny it if you dare; I begin to suspect you, Mr. Morris; I don't like your conduct. What has become of your pipe? I saw you put your pipe in your coat pocket. You did it when you set me down among the trees where she could see me! You are in league with her--she is coming to meet you here--you know she does not like tobacco-smoke. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> going {{to put me in}} the madhouse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, old man," [...] said Berry compassionately, [...] "do {{you think}} I've {{come down here}} to fool away my time talking about Miss Carver? We'll take some Saturday {{afternoon}} for that, when we haven't got anything else to do; but it's Miss Swan that has the floor at present. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>two</b> talking about over there, so long? I can't get along with Miss Carver worth a cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll see in two shakes," [...] said McTurk. [...] "Don't swear like that. What {{we want to}} know <b>is,</b> why <b>you</b> <b>two</b> hulkin' swine {{have been}} bullyin' Clewer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{handsome}} {{rather than}} pretty. I wonder why it <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> should <b>be</b> married, and so grandly married, and that I shall never, never have any one to love." ...|$|R
