In the beginning, it directed the brigades itself, with its own resources, techniques and funding. Some of their members served as instructors until 1922, when the name of the program was changed to Navy League Sea Cadets. Unlike the adult leadership of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets, the instructors of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets were volunteers. They wore a uniform similar to officers of the Royal Canadian Navy, but with an <b>anchor</b> <b>device</b> above the rank stripes rather than the wavy stripes of the Naval Reserve or the permanent force's executive curl. They did not receive any military training and did not hold a commission from the King. In 1941 the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets were established, and became associated with the Royal Canadian Navy. The Sea Cadets operated under the authority of the Department of National Defence from then, in co-operation with the Navy League of Canada. Sea Cadet officers were warranted while they served, rather than commissioned, as were the officers of the Cadet Services of Canada that led the Army Cadet program. Promotion was based on age and length of service. Sea Cadet officers were not members of the Canadian Forces until the Canadian Forces were integrated and they were taken into the Cadet Instructors List, with the exception that time as a warranted Sea Cadet officer was credited towards the Canadian Forces Decoration.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility, reproducibility {{and efficacy of}} a new tissue <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> in a porcine survival model. METHODS: Gastrotomies were performed using a needle-knife and balloon dilator in 10 female Yorkshire pigs weighing 30 - 35 kg. Gastric closure was attempted using a new tissue <b>anchoring</b> <b>device.</b> The tightness of the closure was confirmed by means of air insufflation {{and the ability to}} maintain gastric distension with stability in peritoneal pressure measured with a Veress needle. All animals were monitored daily for signs of peritonitis and sepsis over 14 d. During necropsy, the peritoneal cavity and the gastric access site were examined. RESULTS: Transgastric access, closure and 14 d survival was achieved in all pigs. The mean closure time was 18. 1 ± 19. 2 min and a mean of 2. 1 ± 1 devices were used. Supplementary clips were necessary in 2 cases. The closure time was progressively reduced (24. 8 ± 13. 9 min in the first 5 pigs vs 11. 4 ± 5. 9 min in the last 5, P = NS). At necropsy, the gastric access site was correctly closed in all cases with all brace-bars present. One device was misplaced in the mesocolon. Minimal adhesions were observed in 3 pigs and signs of mild peritonitis and adhesions in one.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials for external strengthening of existing masonry elements is strictly conditioned by debonding phenomena. To avoid or delay the debonding and, hence, attain higher failure loads or larger ductility at failure, end <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices</b> {{may be a}} very suitable solution. Several types of end <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices</b> have been proposed, especially for concrete elements, but for none of them design indications for predicting the increase in failure load have been suggested so far.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} three-dimensional (3 D) -constitutive models for concrete formulated {{in the framework of}} plasticity theory to structural analyses of anchor devices. For this purpose, two commonly employed concrete material models are considered. The first model, the extended Leon model, is based on one yield surface for the description of compressive and tensile failure of concrete. The second material model is a multisurface plasticity model consisting of three Rankine yield surfaces and a Drucker-Prager yield surface. The predictive capability of the models is demonstrated by means of anchor devices, commonly employed in structural engineering for the connection of steel and concrete members. Such devices induce strongly nonuniform triaxial stress states in the surrounding concrete, ranging from tensile, overcompressive, to confined compressive stress states. In the vicinity of the anchor head, even nearly hydrostatic stress states may occur. The numerical simulations {{on the basis of the}} employed 3 D material models for concrete give insight into the load-carrying behavior of the investigated anchor devices. Two headed studs characterized by different shapes of the anchor head and an undercut anchor are considered. Comparison of the peak loads and failure modes of the respective <b>anchor</b> <b>device</b> predicted by the numerical models with experimental data highlight the strength and weakness of the employed material models. It is shown that some load cases may lead to rather large differences in peak load depending on the choice of material model. These differences are based on the individual properties of the constitutive models for concrete and, hence, detailed knowledge of the model under consideration is essential for giving accurate estimates of the peak load of the <b>anchor</b> <b>device</b> and the failure mode of concrete...|$|E

30|$|Calibration-based {{solutions}} use fingerprints {{of average}} RSS values over a specific duration at specific locations {{in order to}} diminish the impact of variation in the RSS values [28 – 30]. Even though calibration-based techniques provide more localization accuracy than calibration-free, they require extensive efforts to collect the calibration data. This problem rises dramatically in dynamic environments since {{any change in the}} environment or the configuration, requires new calibration data to be collected. To address this issue, a number of methodologies were proposed to reduce the time required to collect the calibration data. For example, in [31], an effortless indoor Wi-Fi solution that leverages the floor plan and walls within the environments to generate RSS maps of access points and the target node location is estimated using a map overlapping technique. This work eliminates the necessary time to survey the environment. However, it does not address the changes of RSS due to changes in the environment over time, to provide accurate results. In [32], a novel algorithm that solves the problem of regenerating calibration dataset was proposed. In this approach, access points with custom-made firmware were allowed to scan the channel and record RSS levels of each other, as well as the RSS level of a special <b>anchor</b> <b>device.</b> It also requires the mobile device to be in an access point mode in order to send beacon frames and allow other nodes in the system to connect to it. Although, in [31, 32], good attempts were made to solve the limitations of fingerprinting methods, these are client-server-based techniques and cannot be adapted for distributed Wi-Fi location identification systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{anchorage}} zone of {{post-tensioned concrete}} structures is a discontinuity region, where a redistribution of stress occurs behind the <b>anchor</b> <b>device,</b> as the concentrated prestressing force spreads {{out over the}} full concrete section. This disturbed zone is subjected to a very complex three-dimensional state of stress, with transverse tensile forces that cause longitudinal cracks which can extend throughout the beam span, thus causing failure. To prevent excessive cracking, therefore, concrete must be adequately reinforced with supplementary or ‘’bursting" reinforcement. The problem of the stress distribution in the anchorage zone has been well studied in the past decades using various methods such as linear elastic theory [1 - 5], experimental investigations [6 - 7], strut and tie models [7] and finite element analyses [8 - 10]. Most efforts in the previous analyses have focused on evaluating the ultimate strength of post-tensioned beams tested to anchorage failure and only few works have considered the effects of support reaction. Although ultimate limite states {{are the most important}} considerations in the design of prestressed structures, more in depth study is required at serviceability limit states in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} bursting reinforcement to control maximum crack width. Prediction of this behavior requires advanced analytical techniques with the ability to simulate the highly nonlinear behaviour of the concrete. To date, most of the nonlinear finite element analyses have consisted of two-dimensional models of the anchorage zones, although it is a three-dimensional one even in a rectangular beam. The main reason for this choice is generally attributed to a lack of a proper description of material properties of concrete. In this study, three-dimensional non-linear finite element analyses have been carried out using the program Atena to simulate the behaviour of end zones of rectangular section post-tensioned girders, with the presence of the support reaction. This program includes an advanced three-dimensional material model which allows employing it as an effective tool for the investigation of reinforced and prestressed concrete elements. The validity of the finite element model has been verified through comparisons with tests reported in literature and it was found good agreement between the experimental and numerical results. The validated model has been used to investigate the influence of the arrangement of bursting reinforcement on stirrups strains and crack development at serviceability and ultimate limit state...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to changes}} in the Swedish design code in 1994, timber {{construction}} is no longer limited to two-storey buildings. This change has created an attractive market for multi-storey timber structures. A Scandinavian glulam manufacturer, Moelven Töreboda, started in 2007 to develop a new beam and post building system in timber for multi-storey buildings with the Swedish commercial name, “trä 8 ”. For “trä 8 ”, the stabilising system is based on prefabricated wall panels placed at a few locations in the building. The stabilising elements consist of double sheathing of LVL Kerto-Q boards glued and screwed to a glulam frame. The panels are typically of 2. 4 m width and continuous up to four storey height. The elements are fixed to the foundation by using special <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices,</b> which include threaded rods glued-in lengthwise in the timber member. In this paper, an introductory experimental study of the efficiency of this prefabricated wall panel used as a stabilising element is reported. Experimental results from full-scale testing of the racking performance of the stabilising element including the <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> are presented. The study, which focuses on the stiffness and the serviceability state, demonstrates that the presented wall panel elements, as part of a beam and post system for multi-storey buildings, have the potential to provide the necessary horizontal stability for the building.

40|$|Purpose: Magnetic <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices</b> {{may reduce}} the number of port sites needed in laparoscopic surgery. In this study, we prospectively {{assessed}} the feasibility of using a magnetic anchoring and guidance system (MAGS) in laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery performed by novices. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 LESS simple nephrectomies were performed with or without MAGS in a nonsurvival porcine model by 6 operators with no previous LESS surgery experience. After installation of the homemade single port, an intra-abdominal magnet was fixed to the renal parenchyma with suturing and stabilized by an external magnet placed on the flank so that the position of the kidney could be easily changed by moving the external handheld magnet. The length of the procedure and any intraoperative complications were evaluated. Results: Operative time (mean±standard deviation) was shorter in the group using the magnetic <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> (M-LESS-N) than in the group with conventional LESS nephrectomy (C-LESS-N) (63 ± 20. 8 minutes vs. 82 ± 40. 7 minutes, respectively). Although all nephrectomies were completed uneventfully in the M-LESS-N group, renal vein injury occurred during dissection of the renal hilum in two cases of C-LESS-N and was resolved by simultaneous transection of the renal artery and vein with an Endo-GIA stapler. Conclusions: LESS-N using MAGS is a feasible technique for surgeons with no LESS surgery experience. Taking into account the 2 cases of renal vein injury in the C-LESS-N group, the application of MAGS may be beneficial for overcoming the learning curve of LESS surgery...|$|R
