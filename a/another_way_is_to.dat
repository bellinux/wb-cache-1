25|$|The {{easiest way}} to locate the {{constellation}} is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar “V” shaped asterism of Taurus and the three stars of Orion’s belt. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> mentally draw {{a line from the}} Pleiades star cluster located in Taurus and the brightest star in Leo, Regulus. In doing so, you are drawing an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.|$|E
25|$|Limits are not {{the only}} {{rigorous}} approach to the foundation of calculus. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use Abraham Robinson's non-standard analysis. Robinson's approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery from mathematical logic to augment the real number system with infinitesimal and infinite numbers, as in the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers are called hyperreal numbers, and they can be used to give a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. There is also smooth infinitesimal analysis, which differs from non-standard analysis in that it mandates neglecting higher power infinitesimals during derivations.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, campfires {{should be}} made in a fire ring. If a fire ring is not available, a {{temporary}} fire site may be constructed. Bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site. Alternatively, turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> cover the ground with sand, or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material, {{to a depth of}} a few inches. A ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire. Fire rings, however, do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire. Flying embers are still a threat, and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it, or the rocks could crack.|$|E

25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E
2500|$|The {{geography}} of Mesoamerica describes the geographic features of Mesoamerica, a culture {{area in the}} Americas inhabited by complex indigenous pre-Columbian cultures exhibiting a suite of shared and common cultural characteristics. [...] Several well-known Mesoamerican cultures include the Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Maya, the Aztec and the Purépecha. [...] Mesoamerica is often subdivided {{in a number of}} ways. [...] One common method, albeit a broad and general classification, is to distinguish between the highlands and lowlands.

2500|$|Stage magicians note several {{methods of}} {{creating}} {{the illusion of a}} spoon spontaneously bending. Most common is the practice of misdirection, an underlying principle of many stage magic tricks. There are many ways in which a bent spoon can be presented to an audience as to give the appearance it was manipulated using supernatural powers. One way is through brief moments of distraction in which a magician can physically bend a spoon unseen by the audience, before gradually revealing the bend to create the illusion that the spoon is bending before the viewers' eyes. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pre-bend the spoon, perhaps by heating it, reducing the amount of force that [...] needed to be applied to bend it manually.|$|E

2500|$|One way to {{increase}} growth factor concentrations in wounds is to apply the growth factors directly. This generally takes many repetitions and requires large amounts of the factors, although biomaterials are being developed that control the delivery of growth factors over time. [...] <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> spread onto the wound a gel of the patient’s own blood platelets, which then secrete growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1–2 (IGF), PDGF, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). [...] Other treatments include implanting cultured keratinocytes into the wound to reepithelialize it and culturing and implanting fibroblasts into wounds. [...] Some patients are treated with artificial skin substitutes that have fibroblasts and keratinocytes in a matrix of collagen to replicate skin and release growth factors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the males being sexually aggressive, [...] females of P. dominula demonstrate ways to weed out the low-quality males. Females are typically larger and more dominant than males, so females exert strong choice by rejecting males. One way they reject males is to express aggressive behaviors such as biting, darting, or stinging to stop the male from copulating with her. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> remain still while the male mounts, but move her abdomen to prevent the male's genitalia entering her body. Females are also known to mate with multiple males, especially with non-nest mates. They fly over to different males' nests to assess the best-quality males and generally copulate with the resident males. That males are resident males often implies that they are large, sexually active and aggressive – providing better protection for her and the brood.|$|E

60|$|Those are {{the three}} first facts of heredity. That it exists; that it is subtle and made of a million elements; that it is simple, and cannot be unmade into those elements. To summarise: you know there is wine in the soup. You {{do not know how}} many wines there are in the soup, because you do not know how many wines there are in the world. And you never will know, because all chemists, all cooks, and all {{common-sense}} people tell you that the soup is of such a sort that it can never be chemically analysed. That is a perfectly fair parallel to the hereditary element in the human soul. There are many ways in which one can feel that there is wine in the soup, as in suddenly tasting a wine specially favoured; that corresponds to seeing suddenly flash on a young face the image of some ancestor you have known. But even then the taster cannot be certain he is not tasting one familiar wine among many unfamiliar ones--or seeing one known ancestor among a million unknown ancestors. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get drunk on the soup, which corresponds to the case of those who say they are driven to sin and death by hereditary doom.
