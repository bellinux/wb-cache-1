ESSA-1 had approximately 10,000 1-cm by 2-cm solar cells, which charged 21 nickel-cadmium batteries.

50|$|Long {{established}} parts maker Valeo {{has developed}} a properly engineered 4-piece clutch kit to replace the DMF. The UK introduction {{was at the end}} of 2005. It is claimed to provide increased reliability for the expensive replacement operation (labour time cost and the part cost), of the dual-mass flywheel. The 4-piece kit is composed of a traditional rigid flywheel and long travel damper consisting of <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> <b>assembly,</b> a high performance drive plate and a release bearing. Rigorous R&D testing showed the 4-piece kit performs just as well in terms of overall clutch operation, transmission protection, comfort and improves heat dissipation and durability. The transmission protection provides full engine and gearbox safety; the 4-piece kit matches the DMF for mechanical vibration reduction and therefore limits premature wear within the gearbox. The long travel damper closely matches the damping performance of a DMF. Fitting times are also comparable.|$|E

40|$|The {{hardware}} and software of NASA's proposed Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE) are described. The OARE is to provide aerodynamic acceleration measurements along the Orbiter's principal axis in the free-molecular flow-flight regime at orbital attitude and in the transition regime during reentry. Models considering the effects of electromagnetic effects, solar radiation pressure, orbiter mass attraction, gravity gradient, orbital centripetal acceleration, out-of-orbital-plane effects, orbiter angular velocity, structural noise, mass expulsion signal sources, crew motion, and bias on acceleration are examined. The experiment contains an electrostatically balanced cylindrical proofmass accelerometer sensor with three orthogonal sensing axis outputs. The components and functions of the experimental calibration system and signal processor and control subsystem are analyzed. The development of the OARE software is discussed. The experimental equipment will be enclosed in <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> <b>assembly</b> that will be mounted in the Orbiter close {{to the center of}} gravity...|$|E
