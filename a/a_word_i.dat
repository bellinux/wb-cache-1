He is {{extremely}} literate musically. I'm not sure if the general public knows that." [...] Pierre Boulez told Musician magazine's posthumous Zappa tribute article that Zappa [...] "was an exceptional figure because {{he was part of the}} worlds of rock and classical music and that both types of his work would survive." ...|$|E

I didn't dare say <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> <b>I</b> just checked that the environment was in order. Then I went to bed and Janne stayed up. All night long I could hear his footsteps, alternating with music played quietly.|$|E

500|$|... {{was named}} Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster. Linguist and OED {{consultant}} Benjamin Zimmer {{pointed out that}} the word truthiness already had a history in literature and appears in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), as a derivation of , and The Century Dictionary, both of which indicate it as rare or dialectal, and to be defined more straightforwardly as [...] "truthfulness, faithfulness". Responding to claims by Michael Adams that the word already existed with a different meaning, Colbert explained the origin of his word as: [...] "Truthiness is <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>I</b> pulled right out of my [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{securing}} a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in {{artists such as}} Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: [...] "From <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>I</b> can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis." [...] She considered her music {{as a form of}} poetry, citing the album track [...] "Hazy Shades" [...] {{as an example of a}} poem turned into a song.|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> <b>I</b> thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E

500|$|After {{the war he}} went up to St John's College, Cambridge, {{to study}} {{theology}} and was subsequently ordained as an Anglican priest in 1953. He realised that he had lost his faith and made an error in his career; he later admitted that during one sermon, [...] "I didn't believe <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>I</b> was saying". He was released from the church in 1958 and took up a position as a drama critic with the Stratford-upon-Avon Herald. It was whilst at the Herald—aged 33—that Gardner realised he was an alcoholic, drinking two bottles of gin a day. He overcame his addiction and produced his first book as part of his therapy: the autobiographical Spin the Bottle, published in 1964. Critic and scholar John Sutherland says that of all the books Gardner published, [...] "it's the one that most deserves to survive." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>I</b> said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
2500|$|Hawke {{declared}} {{publicly that}} [...] "socialist is not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>I</b> {{would use to}} describe myself", and his approach to government was pragmatic. He concerned himself with making improvements to workers' lives from within the traditional institutions of government, rather than by using any ideological theory. He opposed the Vietnam War, but was {{a strong supporter of}} the US-Australian alliance, and also an emotional supporter of Israel. It was his commitment to the cause of Jewish Refuseniks which purportedly led to a planned assassination attempt on Hawke by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and its Australian operative Munif Mohammed Abou Rish.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, on {{the other}} hand, thought it was [...] "the best of the recent {{roadshow}} musicals... Since The Sound of Music, musicals have been... long, expensive, weighed down with unnecessary production values and filled with pretension... Finian's Rainbow is an exception... it knows exactly where it's going, and is getting there as quickly and with {{as much fun as}} possible... it is the best-directed musical since West Side Story. It is also enchanting, and that's <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>I</b> don't get to use much... it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands... he... created this warm old man... and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him look younger with common tricks of lighting, makeup and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly want to make this point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the New York Times review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken." ...|$|E
