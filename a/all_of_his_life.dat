5|$|His decade-long reign {{over the}} Kievan Rus' {{was marked by}} rapid {{expansion}} into the Volga River valley, the Pontic steppe, and the Balkans. By {{the end of his}} short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital in 969 from Kiev (modern-day Ukraine) to Pereyaslavets (identified as the modern village of Nufăru, Romania) on the Danube. In contrast with his mother's conversion to Christianity, Sviatoslav remained a staunch pagan <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> Due to his abrupt death in ambush, his conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a fratricidal feud among his three sons, resulting in two of them being killed.|$|E

Young Stephen was sent to school near Mobile, Alabama, but his {{education}} was interrupted by his father's death. His elder brother John also died about this time. To support herself and her surviving son, Ellen opened a boarding house for seamen. Then she sent her son away for further schooling at a Moravian academy in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Although he was for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> a practicing Catholic, he had only praise for the education he received at the academy. After about three years, his mother {{could no longer afford}} to pay his tuition, so in 1829 his schooling ended and he returned home.|$|E
5|$|In the story, Tyrion {{uses his}} status as a Lannister to {{mitigate}} the prejudice he has received <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> even from his family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is sent by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing, as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without the Lannister resources.|$|E
