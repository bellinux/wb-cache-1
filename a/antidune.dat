50|$|An <b>antidune</b> is a bedform {{found in}} fluvial and other channeled environments. Antidunes occur in {{supercritical}} flow, {{meaning that the}} Froude number is greater than 1.0 or the flow velocity exceeds the wave velocity; this {{is also known as}} upper flow regime. In antidunes, sediment is deposited on the upstream (stoss) side and eroded from the downstream (lee) side, opposite lower flow regime bedforms. As a result, antidunes migrate in an upstream direction, counter to the current flow. Antidunes are called in-phase bedforms, meaning that the water surface elevation mimics the bed elevation; {{this is due to the}} supercritical flow regime. <b>Antidune</b> bedforms evolve rapidly, growing in amplitude as they migrate upstream. The resultant wave at the water's surface also increases in amplitude. When that wave becomes unstable, breaks and washes downstream, much of the <b>antidune</b> bedform may be destroyed.|$|E

Climates that have extreme rainy seasons resulting in runoff create a higher flow velocity within their streams and rivers, thus increasing the ability of upper flow regime structures to form.

For dunes, the water surface is low over the dune and high over the interdune. For antidunes, flow depth is roughly the same everywhere, which means the water surface is high over the <b>antidune</b> and low over the interdune.|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and laboratory investigation {{was made of}} <b>antidunes</b> and associated stationary waves. The objectives were to determine the factors involved {{in the formation of}} <b>antidunes,</b> the characteristics of the stationary waves, and the effects of <b>antidunes</b> and waves on the friction factor and sediment transport capacity of streams. In the potential flow solution for flow over a wavy bed it was hypothesized that the flow shapes the erodible sand bed by scour and deposition to conform to a streamline of the flow configuration for which the energy is a minimum. Under this hypothesis, flow over <b>antidunes</b> {{is the same as the}} segment of flow above an intermediate streamline of the fluid motion associated with stationary gravity waves (waves with celerity equal and opposite to the flow velocity) in a fluid of infinite depth. For a velocity V the wave length, L, is given by L = (2 *pi*V^ 2) /g and waves break when their height reaches 0. 142 L. Laboratory and field data for two-dimensional stationary waves and <b>antidunes</b> confirmed these relations. For the same velocity, short-crested, three-dimensional waves (rooster tails) have shorter wave lengths than two-dimensional waves. Forty-three experimental runs in laboratory flumes were made for different depths and velocities and bed sands of two different sizes (0. 549 mm and 0. 233 mm). No general criterion for the formation of <b>antidunes</b> or the occurrence of breaking waves could be formulated because of inadequate knowledge of the complex sediment transport phenomenon. Qualitatively, it was found that for a given sand, the critical Froude number for the occurrence of breaking waves decreased as the depth was increased. Over a certain range of depth and velocity it was found that the flow formed waves and <b>antidunes</b> or was uniform depending on whether or not the flow was disturbed to form an initial wave. Waves that did not break had no measurable effect on the transport capacity or friction factor, but breaking waves increased both of these quantities...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of flow structures: {{bidirectional}} (multiple directions, back-and-forth) and unidirectional. Flow regimes in single-direction (typically fluvial) flow, which at varying speeds and velocities produce different structures, are called bedforms. In the lower flow regime, the natural progression is from a flat bed, to some sediment movement (saltation etc.), to ripples, to slightly larger dunes. Dunes have a vortex in the lee side of the dune. As the upper flow regime forms, the dunes become flattened out, and then produce <b>antidunes.</b> At higher still velocity, the <b>antidunes</b> are flattened and most sedimentation stops, as erosion takes over as the dominant process.|$|R
50|$|Cross beds {{can tell}} geologists {{much about what}} an area was like in ancient times. The {{direction}} the beds are dipping indicates paleocurrent, the rough direction of sediment transport. The type and condition of sediments can tell geologists the type of environment (rounding, sorting, composition…). Studying modern analogs allows geologists to draw conclusions about ancient environments. Paleocurrent can be determined by seeing a cross-section {{of a set of}} cross-beds. However, to get a true reading, the axis of the beds must be visible. It is also difficult to distinguish between the cross beds of a dune and the cross beds of an <b>antidune.</b> This could lead to misinterpretation since dunes dip downstream while antidunes dip upstream.|$|E
50|$|In 1899 {{the first}} {{description}} of antidunes was presented by Vaughan Cornish to the Royal Geographical Society. He observed that while water was flowing down stream waves occurred that traveled up stream depositing sand and other material. This observation was later validated by John S. Owens in 1908.The term <b>antidune</b> was coined by G.K. Gilbert in a 1914 US Geological Survey Professional Paper entitled “Transportation of debris by running water”. He wrote this report {{in conjunction with}} E. C. Murphy, their description of antidunes and stationary waves that expanded on Cornish and Owens' previous report. Their information was gathered during a laboratory investigation sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey. The first person to attempt an analytical description of antidunes was Walter B. Langbein in 1942. He applied dimensional analysis to Gilberts' results {{and came up with}} transition points using Froude numbers versus velocity and hydraulic radius.|$|E
50|$|In East Java {{the base}} of the Semilir Formation can be {{identified}} by the abrupt termination of bioturbated reworked deposits characteristic of the Kebobutak Formation. The volcanic rocks of the Semilir Formation are characterised by features typical of terrestrial air-fall, pyroclastic surge and flow deposits including dune and <b>antidune</b> structures, crystal layering, well-sorted granular laminations, diffuse bedding, breccias (with metre-scale pumice blocks), thick mantling ashes, and abundant fragments of charcoal. Locally there are water-laid deposits, with scoured irregular bases, flame, traction and suspension structures, and large slump folds indicating an unstable marine slope. Smyth et al. (2011) interpret these observations to indicate the Semilir Formation was erupted in a subaerial setting in which pyroclastic flows travelled across vegetated slopes picking up and baking plant fragments, with some of these flows entering the sea. Some of the primary material would have been redeposited as lahars in distal settings.|$|E
40|$|Supercritical-flow {{phenomena}} {{are fairly}} common in modern sedimentary environments, yet their recognition and analysis remain {{difficult in the}} stratigraphic record. This fact is commonly ascribed to the poor preservation potential of deposits from high-energy supercritical flows. However, the number of flume data sets on supercritical-flow dynamics and sedimentary structures is very limited in comparison with available data for subcritical flows, which hampers the recognition and interpretation of such deposits. The results of systematic flume experiments spanning {{a broad range of}} supercritical- flow bedforms (<b>antidunes,</b> chutes-and-pools and cyclic steps) developed in mobile sand beds of variable grain sizes are presented. Flow character and related bedform patterns are constrained through time-series measurements of bed configurations, flow depths, flow velocities and Froude numbers. The results allow the refinement and extension of some widely used bedform stability diagrams in the supercritical-flow domain, clarifying in particular the morphodynamic relations between <b>antidunes</b> and cyclic steps. The onset of <b>antidunes</b> is controlled by flows exceeding a threshold Froude number. The transition from <b>antidunes</b> to cyclic steps in fine to medium-grained sand occurs at a threshold mobility parameter. Sedimentary structures associated with supercritical bedforms developed under variable aggradation rates are revealed by means of combining flume results and synthetic stratigraphy. The sedimentary structures are compared with examples from field and other flume studies. Aggradation rate is seen to exert an important control on the geometry of supercritical-flow structures and should be considered when identifying supercritical bedforms in the sedimentary record...|$|R
50|$|Sediment motion {{can create}} self-organized {{structures}} such as ripples, dunes, <b>antidunes</b> on the river or stream bed. These bedforms are often preserved in sedimentary rocks {{and can be used}} to estimate the direction and magnitude of the flow that deposited the sediment.|$|R
40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{in the ocean}} are driven by suspended sediment. Yet results from surveys of the modern sea floor and turbidite outcrops indicate that {{they are capable of}} transporting as bedload and depositing particles as coarse as cobble sizes. While bedload cannot drive turbidity currents, it can strongly influence the nature of the deposits they emplace. This paper reports on the first set of experiments which focus on bedload transport of granular material by density underflows. These underflows include saline density flows, hybrid saline/turbidity currents and a pure turbidity current. The use of dissolved salt is a surrogate for suspended mud which is so fine that it does not settle out readily. Thus, all the currents can be considered to be model turbidity currents. The data cover four bed conditions: plane bed, dunes, upstream-migrating <b>antidunes</b> and downstream-migrating <b>antidunes.</b> The bedload transport relation obtained from the data is very similar to those obtained for open-channel flows and, in fact, is fitted well by an existing relation determined for open-channel flows. In the case of dunes and downstream-migrating <b>antidunes,</b> for which flow separation on the lee sides was observed, form drag falls in a range that is similar to that due to dunes in sand-bed rivers. This form drag can be removed from the total bed shear stress using an existing relation developed for rivers. Once this form drag is subtracted, the bedload data for these cases collapse to follow the same relation as for plane beds and upstream-migrating <b>antidunes,</b> for which no flow separation was observed. A relation for flow resistance developed for open-channel flows agrees well with the data when adapted to density underflows. Comparison of the data with a regime diagram for field-scale sand-bed rivers at bankfull flow and field-scale measurements of turbidity currents at Monterey Submarine Canyon, together with Shields number and densimetric Froude number similarity analyses, provide strong evidence that the experimental relations apply at field scale as well...|$|R
5000|$|Antidunes are {{typically}} found in fluvial environments in shallow areas {{with a high}} flow rate. Unlike ripples and dunes in lower flow regime, antidunes are generally symmetric and migrate counter to the flow direction. Antidunes evolve rapidly, growing in amplitude as they migrate against the current. When the surface wave above them becomes unstable and breaks (when the surface wave amplitude reaches 1/7 its wavelength) most of the <b>antidune</b> bedform is destroyed and its sediment carried down stream. [...] Antidunes are commonly observed in small streams that flow across beaches into the ocean. Flume {{studies have shown that}} they can also occur in submarine environments beneath density flows like turbidity currents. Antidunes produce sedimentary structures characteristic of their flow regime, which allow sedimentary geologists to understand past flow conditions. Unlike low flow regime bedforms like dunes and ripples which generally produce downstream dipping cross stratification, antidunes produce a mixture of low-angle downstream and upstream dipping strata. While antidunes migrate upstream, upstream dipping cross-stratification is not indicative of antidunes or upper flow regime conditions.|$|E
50|$|The Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry {{of western}} Colorado yields {{one of the}} most diverse Upper Jurassic {{vertebrate}} assemblages in the world. This fossil assemblage was deposited within a poorly sorted sandstone bed that is stratigraphically situated in the lower portion of the upper Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation. The bone accumulation, consisting of thousands of bones, was the consequence of two cataclysmic events, a drought, and flash flood. In the Dry Mesa area, a severe drought resulted in the mass mortality of dinosaurs and other vertebrates. These animals were attracted to a remnant water hole of the dry Lake T'oo'dichi' lake bed where they died of starvation and dehydration. This mass mortality produced a considerable accumulation of disarticulated vertebrate remains. Subsequently, a short-lived flash flood traversed the dry lake beds. The quarry sandstone bed is a 2 meter thick, 121 meter wide, very poorly sorted pebble-rich sublitharenite. The channel sandstone shows abundant trough cross-stratification and a possible <b>antidune</b> bedform composed of gravel and sand which indicates flow velocities as high as 200 cm/s (5 miles/hour). Measured bone volumes can be equated to flow velocities. These calculated bone volume velocities are in agreement with flow velocities determined from grain size and bedforms. The river flow direction, based upon bedform orientations and bone elongation statistics, was to the east-northeast. Geologic and taphonomic characteristics indicate a short transport distance for the bone accumulation (Richmond and Morris, 1999).|$|E
40|$|This thesis firstly {{reviews the}} current {{literature}} available on <b>antidune</b> bedforms and their hydrodynamic environment, alongside {{recent studies of}} the turbulence environments associated with bedforms in unidirectional flow. Based on this understanding, three suites of experiments were designed and conducted to elucidate turbulent flow structure within the standing waves above antidunes and to record the sedimentary response of a loose mobile bed that constituted the antidunes. The first suite of experiments used Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) to quantify and characterise the flow structure above fixed bedforms and this {{was supported by a}} second suite of experiments that used high-speed video to visualise flow structure. Finally, in the third suite of experiments a loose bed of sediment was allowed to deform into antidunes beneath standing waves and the resultant sedimentary structures were recorded and related to the growth and decay of both standing waves and <b>antidune</b> form. Taken together these data have been interpreted in order to identify and elucidate the bulk-flow, turbulent environment of the flow field above antidunes and the sedimentary structures that characterise the preserved <b>antidune</b> bedding. The ADV experiments have shown that a coherent and organised spatial pattern of turbulence exists above <b>antidune</b> bedforms. Initially, when <b>antidune</b> amplitude is small, turbulent stresses are relatively equally distributed along the entire bed boundary layer, however as <b>antidune</b> amplitude increases there is a progressive concentration of turbulent stresses. Turbulence becomes increasingly concentrated in the near-bed region within the trough between upstream and downstream contiguous antidunes and on the upstream flank of the <b>antidune</b> immediately downstream. Velocities in the trough region drop significantly below the mean velocity elsewhere over <b>antidune</b> bedforms. A clear distinction can be drawn between sand and gravel antidunes, with gravel antidunes having comparatively much lower velocities in the trough region, and turbulence stresses (ejections, sweeps, turbulence Intensity, TKE and Reynolds Stress) an order of magnitude higher than for sand bedforms. Further, experiments over a porous gravel bed indicate levels of near bed turbulence higher than over a gravel-surfaced concrete bedform without interstitial flow. High-speed photography and interpretation of streak images further supports this ADV data. It is proposed that antidunes break when turbulence reaches an ‘intensity’ that constitutes a threshold above which rapid erosion occurs in the trough causing a pronounced increase in turbulent ejections laden with sediment and consequent rapid deposition on the downstream <b>antidune</b> flank. Flow then stalls over the downstream antidune; the standing wave collapses and erodes much of the bed. In terms of distinctive sedimentary structure, three types of bedding were observed in sediment sections taken after mobile bed runs where antidunes had been active. Type I bedding is formed by the erosion of the bed and marks the lowest surface formed by <b>antidune</b> downcutting during active migration or collapse. Type II bedding is formed by turbulent sweeps during <b>antidune</b> growth and migration. However the contrasts in sediment size and type that mark bedding are dependent on the heterogeneity of bed sediment. A third type of downstream dipping, bipartite planar bedding was observed to form under an upstream migrating standing wave. The preservation of a suite of sedimentologic features produced by a period of <b>antidune</b> activity is however dependent on the degree of downcutting and erosion during standing wave collapse.

5000|$|Some of {{the largest}} <b>antidunes</b> on Earth are formed by {{turbidity}} currents.

Generally, on lower gradients beyond minor breaks of slope, flow thickness increases and flow velocity decreases, leading to an increase in wavelength and a decrease in height.|$|R
40|$|Boundary waves often form at the {{interface}} between ice and fluid flowing adjacent to it, such as ripples under river ice covers, and steps on the bed of supraglacial meltwater channels. They may also be formed by wind, such as the megadunes on the Antarctic ice sheet. Spiral troughs on the polar ice caps of Mars have been interpreted to be cyclic steps formed by katabatic wind blowing over ice. Cyclic steps are relatives of upstream-migrating <b>antidunes.</b> Cyclic step formation on ice {{is not only a}} mechanical but also a thermodynamic process. There have been very few studies on the formation of either cyclic steps or upstream-migrating <b>antidunes</b> on ice. In this study, we performed flume experiments to reproduce cyclic steps on ice by flowing water, and found that trains of steps form when the Froude number is larger than unity. The features of those steps allow them to be identified as ice-bed analogs of cyclic steps in alluvial and bedrock rivers. We performed a linear stability analysis and obtained a physical explanation of the formation of upstream-migrating <b>antidunes,</b> i. e., precursors of cyclic steps. We compared the results of experiments with the predictions of the analysis and found the observed steps fall in the range where the analysis predicts interfacial instability. We also found that short antidune-like undulations formed as a precursor to the appearance of well-defined steps.

40|$|AEISTMCT: <b>Antidune</b> {{deposits}} on a washover fan on Seabrook Island, South Carolina {{display a}} variety of bedding types. The predominant stratification form comprises nested, very thin lenses which are internally cross-laminated and which become thinner and more closely spaced downflow. In addition, cross laminae within the lenses tend toward backset forms in the bermward portions of the flow, and become more foreset-oriented in a downfan direction. These characteristics, together with the <b>antidune</b> field's relationship to other bed features on the fan, suggest that <b>antidune</b> formation {{is related to the}} occurrence of an undular hydraulic jump just downfan from the berm crest. Ancient deposits interpreted as washover sequences, including Ordovician and Pleistocene sandstones in South Africa and a Carboniferous sandstone in Kentucky, display sedimentary structures similar to those observed in the Seabrook <b>antidune</b> field. Because washed-out antidunes and their associated cross laminae are very subtle features, antidunes are possibly responsible for many of the gentle m q u h t i e s in otherwise flat beds and are therefore possibly far more common in the geologic record than previously recognized. Their sedimentary structures are distinct from degraded forms of ripple cross-lamination, and in many cases are identical to features usually described in the literature as low-angle truncation surfaces...|$|E
40|$|A {{supercritical}} free-surface turbulent stream flowing over an erodible bottom {{can generate}} a characteristic pattern of upstream migrating bedforms known as antidunes.

The results of the linear stability analysis match the experimental data very well, both for the instability region and the dominant wavelength. The analytical tractability of the 1 D modeling allows us (1) to elucidate the key physical processes which drive <b>antidune</b> instability, (2) to show the secondary role played by sediment inertia, (3) to obtain the dispersion relation in explicit form, and (4) to demonstrate the absolute nature of <b>antidune</b> instabilit...|$|E
40|$|The linear and weakly {{nonlinear}} {{stability of}} a uniform flow in an infinitely wide open channel with erodible bottom is studied.

At a linear level, the corresponding regions of existence are presented and compared with experimental data. A weakly nonlinear analysis is then performed in a neighbourhood of the critical conditions for dune and <b>antidune</b> formation. The analysis shows that, for values of the ratio of the shear velocity to the depth-averaged velocity of practical interest, dune bifurcation is supercritical, whereas <b>antidune</b> bifurcation is subcritical. The latter result suggests a possible interpretation of the plane–antidune transition, where plane bed and <b>antidune</b> configurations are observed to coexist for the same values of the flow and the sediment parameters. The supercritical behaviour of the dune bifurcation allows for the prediction of an equilibrium amplitude that successfully compares with the amplitudes measured in laboratory experiments...|$|E
40|$|The linear {{stability}} of a uniform flow in an infinitely wide erodible channel is investigated {{with respect to}} disturbances of the bed that are periodic in both the transverse and the longitudinal directions.

Regions of instabilities in the space of the parameters are found, which can be associated with bed forms of different kinds, spanning from dunes and <b>antidunes</b> to alternate bars.

Cross laminae within the waves are {{parallel to the}} upstream wave fronts (maximum steepness about 22 °), indicating that the anti-dunes were migrating in tile upstream direction. Current direction is known independently from cobble im-brication in adjacent beds, regional grain size trends, oriented structures, and known source areas. Hydrodynamic calculations indicate that the preserved <b>antidunes</b> formed in water about 1. 6 cm deep, flow-ing at I 00 cm/sec down a paleoslope of at least 2. 7 °.

50|$|<b>Antidunes</b> migrate {{upstream}} {{because the}} stream flow is shallow and {{fast in the}} trough and slows and deepens over the crest. As a result, the shear stress on the bed decreases from trough to crest, allowing sedimentation, and increases from crest to tough, causing erosion. The inertia of the flow moves the shear stress maximum and minimum slightly downstream of the trough and crest. This allows the bedform to amplify with time as erosion occurs in the trough and deposition occurs at the crest.|$|R

This study is the first to compare observations of formative flow conditions and resulting sedimentary structures in a natural setting, testing the Alexander et al.

With new experiments, this study aimed to improve the prediction of <b>antidune</b> geometry on steep slopes. An equation for <b>antidune</b> wavelength was deduced from dimensional analysis and fitted to new experimental data. The equation was successfully evaluated using a data set extended to 167 values with data from the literature, obtained on both steep and gentle slopes.

40|$|The bed {{instability}} {{leading to}} the formation of alternate and multiple bars in river has been deeply investigated in the past, starting from the linear analyses of Callander (1969) and Blondeaux and Seminara (1985), through the weakly nonlinear analyses of Colombini et al. (1987) and Schielen et al. (1993), up to the fully nonlinear solution of Colombini and Tubino (1991). All these works were based on a 2 D depth-averaged steady flow model coupled with a suitable implementation of the Exner equation. The rationale behind this choice is that the shallow-water assumption holds whenever the relevant processes occur over streamwise and spanwise distances many times greater than the flow depth. As a consequence, the formation of ‘longer’ bed forms, such as bars, can be studied by means of depth-averaged models, whereas ‘shorter’ bed forms, such as dunes and <b>antidunes,</b> require the implementation of more refined flow models, whereby the vertical structure of the flow is accounted for in the calculations. Quite recently, Colombini and Stocchino (2012) have presented a 3 D flow model aiming at the investigation of the effects associated with three-dimensionality in the formation of dunes and <b>antidunes.</b> In the present contribution we focus on alternate bar linear stability and perform a comparison between the results obtained with the latter three-dimensional flow model and with a conventional two-dimensional depth-averaged formulation...|$|R

40|$|A linear {{stability}} {{theory for}} dune and <b>antidune</b> formation is presented that implements a rotational two-dimensional flow model. As in previous linear theories, the phase-lag between sediment transport and bed elevation remains the main mechanism driving instability. However, it is shown that this phase-lag varies significantly in a neighbourhood of the bed. Moreover, since the layer in which sediments are moving has a finite (though small) thickness, {{it is assumed}} that the perturbations of the fluid stress driving bedload transport should be evaluated {{at the top of the}} layer itself. It is shown that such an apparently minor modification of the classical approach alters remarkably the balance between stabilizing and destabilizing effects that drives the instability process. This also allows a clarification of the debated role of bedslope on the formation of dunes and antidunes. Following the above ideas, antidunes are shown to form in the absence of suspended sediment load and without any effect associated with sediment inertia. The present analysis ultimately allows a successful unification of the theories of dune and <b>antidune</b> formation. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis deals with river {{alternate}} bars. Fluvial bars are regular widespread bed forms that are characterized by vertical and transversal scales which are comparable with the stream depth and width, respectively. Although well-established linear and weakly nonlinear stability analysis have already been performed, no non modal analysis has been proposed yet. We here demonstrate the remarkable non normality of the operator that governs bar dynamics in large regions of the parameter space in fair agreement with our tests in flume experiments. This entails the occurrence of dramatic transient growths in the evolution of bed perturbations. Such algebraic growths suggest a novel explanation, through a purely linear process, of the progressive increase in the dominant bar wavelength that is observed in flume experiments and real rivers during bar inception. The second part of this thesis deals with river antidunes. A supercritical free-surface turbulent stream flowing over an erodible bottom can generate a characteristic pattern of upstream migrating bedforms known as antidunes. This morphological instability, which is quite common in fluvial environments, has attracted speculative and applicative interests, and has always been modelled in 2 D or 3 D mathematical frameworks. However, in this work we demonstrate that <b>antidune</b> instability can be described by means of a suitable one-dimensional model that couples the Dressler equations to a mechanistic model of the sediment particle deposition/entrainment. The results of the linear stability analysis match the experimental data very well, both for the instability region and the dominant wavelength. The analytical tractability of the 1 D modeling allows us (1) to elucidate the key physical processes which drive <b>antidune</b> instability, (2) to show the secondary role played by sediment inertia, (3) to obtain the dispersion relation in explicit form, and (4) to demonstrate the absolute nature of <b>antidune</b> instabilit...|$|E
40|$|Imaging methods {{developed}} to characterise the oscillatory free surface of rapid flows are presented {{and applied to}} torrential currents over sediment <b>antidunes.</b> The aim is to obtain high-resolution relief maps of the free surface topography. Two measurement principles are tested, both based on the imaging of floating tracers dispersed on the rapidly flowing surface. The first technique involves direct stereoscopic measurements. The second technique is indirect, and exploits a Bernoulli relation to derive surface elevations from the horizontal velocity field acquired using a single camera. Special {{attention is paid to}} error estimation and control. Relief maps obtained for various bedform patterns are presented, allowing comparison between the two techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|River bedforms arise as {{a result}} of {{morphological}} instabilities of the stream-sediment interface. Dunes and <b>antidunes</b> constitute the most typical patterns, and their occurrence and dynamics are relevant for a number of engineering and environmental applications. Although flow variability is a typical feature of all rivers, the bedform-triggering morphological instabilities have generally been studied under the assumption of a constant flow rate. In order to partially address this shortcoming, we here discuss the influence of (periodic) flow unsteadiness on bedform inception. To this end, our recent one-dimensional validated model coupling Dressler's equations with a refined mechanistic sediment transport formulation is adopted, and both the asymptotic and transient dynamics are investigated by modal and nonmodal analyses...|$|R
40|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} problems in hydraulic engineers to solve the mechanismof sand waves. Because sand waves occur at almost time when the bed materials move by runn-ing water and they give various difficult problems. We know the existence of various bedconfigurations, ripples, dunes, stationary waves, <b>antidunes</b> and etc [...] But we cannot fullyexplain these complex phenomena at present. Authors started a series of studies from the standpoint of thinking these phenomena asone of the stochastic process. As the first step of these studies, authors have manufactured a equipment measuringwater level and bed elevation suing ultra-sonic device with sufficient accuracy. And theyhave discussed the significance of the mean values of the period, wave-length, wave-height andetc. as the characteristic values of the sand waves...|$|R
