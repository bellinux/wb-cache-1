40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{number of}} desaturations {{determined}} in recordings of pulse oximeter saturation (SpO 2) primarily {{depends on the}} time over which values are averaged. As the <b>averaging</b> <b>time</b> in pulse oximeters is not standardized, it varies considerably between centers. To make SpO 2 data comparable, it is thus desirable to have a formula that allows conversion between desaturation rates obtained using different <b>averaging</b> <b>times</b> for various desaturation levels and minimal durations. METHODS: Oxygen saturation was measured for 170 hours in 12 preterm infants with a mean number of 65 desaturations < 90 % per hour of arbitrary duration by using a pulse oximeter in a 2 - 4 s averaging mode. Using 7 different <b>averaging</b> <b>times</b> between 3 and 16 seconds, the raw red-to-infrared data were reprocessed {{to determine the number}} of desaturations (D). The whole procedure was carried out for 7 different minimal desaturation durations (≥ 1, ≥ 5, ≥ 10, ≥ 15, ≥ 20, ≥ 25, ≥ 30 s) below SpO 2 threshold values of 80 %, 85 % or 90 % to finally reach a conversion formula. The formula was validated by splitting the infants into two groups of six children each and using one group each as a training set and the other one as a test set. RESULTS: Based on the linear relationship found between the logarithm of the desaturation rate and the logarithm of the <b>averaging</b> <b>time,</b> the conversion formula is: D 2 = D 1 (T 2 /T 1) (c), where D 2 is the desaturation rate for the desired <b>averaging</b> <b>time</b> T 2, and D 1 is the desaturation rate for the original <b>averaging</b> <b>time</b> T 1, with the exponent c depending on the desaturation threshold and the minimal desaturation duration.

The first approach of modelling the hourly average concentration can underestimate total odour concentration peaks, resulting in annoyance and complaints.

Therefore, the current regulatory method of dispersion modelling, using hourly <b>averaging</b> <b>times,</b> is less successful at capturing peak concentrations, and does not capture the pattern of odour emission as indicated by the community monitoring database. The use of short <b>averaging</b> <b>times</b> is therefore of greater value in predicting the likely nuisance impact of an odour source and in framing appropriate regulatory controls...|$|R
