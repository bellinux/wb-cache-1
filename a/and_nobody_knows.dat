5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword from the trunk shall receive it as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E

25|$|He {{made a big}} leap in {{his movie}} career with Tokyo Tower in 2005. In the movie he portrayed a young college student torn between his love for a lady twenty years his senior and the views society has on these kinds of relationship. After that came , known as Hana to Western movie audiences, {{directed}} by the renowned director Hirokazu Koreeda (Distance, After Life <b>and</b> <b>Nobody</b> <b>Knows).</b> In the movie, Okada portrayed Sōza, a samurai uninterested in killing his enemy and focused on {{what he could do}} today to be a better person instead. The movie earned him a nomination for the Blue Ribbon Awards, but he declined this nomination. Nevertheless, he still got awarded the Ishihara Yujiro New Actor Award at Nikkan Sports Film Award for his role in Hana. Recently, he has been involved in movies such as , portraying a young man in debt because of pachinko, and , an unconventional love story between two neighbors who have never met each other and only follow the other person's life through the sounds they hear {{from the other side of}} the wall.|$|E
500|$|On 1 February Missouri {{was finally}} freed with the {{assistance}} of 23 vessels. Five tug boats pulled alongside, six pulled astern, and three swung to the bow to facilitate movement. Additionally, two Gypsy-class salvage vessels, [...] and , and seven yard tugs helped keep the other vessels in place. Kedge anchors were also used to expedite the process. About the time that Missouri began to move again, she suffered one last incident: while being towed off the shoal, she bumped into Windlass, wiping out a portion of Windlasss side railing. However, the damage was insignificant, and as the battleship slowly returned to the harbor, the band played Missouri Waltz, Anchors Aweigh, <b>and</b> <b>Nobody</b> <b>Knows</b> the Trouble I've Seen. Crewmen also hoisted battle flags and hoisted signal flags which read [...] "Reporting for Duty". A Norfolk harbor pilot was responsible for issuing the engine and rudder orders to the battleship, while Missouris own navigator issued course orders for the battleship during the tow.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{process of}} the album eventually lasted from January to August 2003, with an additional mixing and mastering period lasting until October. Previous Blink-182 sessions were recorded in three months. The band stated that being in a studio longer than three months gave them the luxury of experimenting with different methods of writing, playing, and recording. The band built each song with a minute attention to detail. Hoppus described the studio as a [...] "musical laboratory": over 70 guitars, 30 amps, [...] "30 or 40" [...] different snare drums, up to six drum kits, various keyboards, turntables, and pianos {{were used in the}} album's production, a lot of which came from Finn's personal collection. Barker was responsible for the turntables and a copy of Pink Floyd's The Wall. The group also enlisted the help of James Guthrie, an engineer behind The Wall. The trio also sent The Cure frontman Robert Smith the bed track of [...] "All of This" [...] in hopes he would contribute; Smith makes a guest appearance and recorded his parts in England. The three initially believed their legitimacy would be in question due to the humor-oriented nature of their earlier recordings, to which Smith responded, [...] "Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> the full potential of any band. I really like the music you sent me." [...] The band also collaborated with DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator, and Barker desired to work with The Neptunes. Jerry Finn, who had produced the previous two Blink-182 albums and the Box Car Racer album, returned to produce Blink-182, which would be his final contribution with the band.|$|E

60|$|Something {{had to be}} done. Jerry Muskrat said so. Grandfather Frog said so. Billy Mink said so. Little Joe Otter said so. Even Spotty the Turtle said so. The Laughing Brook couldn't laugh, and the Smiling Pool couldn't smile. You see, there wasn't water {{enough in}} either of them to laugh or smile, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> if there ever would be again. <b>Nobody</b> had ever <b>known</b> {{anything}} like it before, <b>and</b> so <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> what to think or do.

2500|$|The Holby City 2007 Christmas episode, [...] "Elliot's Wonderful Life", was a reimagining of the 1964 film It's a Wonderful Life {{featuring}} Elliot, and guest-starring Richard Briers as his guardian angel. It {{was filmed}} in North London over three weeks. Series producer Diana Kyle described the episode as Elliot [...] "go {{on a major}} emotional journey and tak time to reassess his life". Bradley explained: [...] "Elliot goes into this complete breakdown and decides to kill himself", and discussed Elliot's motivation in considering suicide: [...] "Something in his brain snaps. He's overworked and emotionally overwrought." [...] He explained that, while the episode is based on It's a Wonderful Life: [...] "the screen doesn't go wobbly so you know you're in fantasy world. It's played very straight. There are some really interesting things going on - angels in the corridors <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> who this old man is. But it's not all doom and gloom, there's humour in there and it's {{a bit of an}} adventure." [...] Bradley was pleased to work with Briers, commenting: [...] "Richard has always been a hero of mine. He's an actor I've always wanted to be like. We got on so well; we were exhausted from laughing!" [...] Briers added of the storyline: [...] "It's extraordinary to pinch a marvellous idea from a great film." ...|$|E
