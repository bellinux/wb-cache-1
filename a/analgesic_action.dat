25|$|While {{working in}} London {{in the early}} 1970s with John R. Vane (Nobel prize in Medicine, 1983), he participated in the {{discovery}} of the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by aspirin-like drugs. At that time, he proposed that the mechanism of the <b>analgesic</b> <b>action</b> of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was due to the prevention of pain receptor sensitization which results from an inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. This hypothesis was supported by further work from his laboratory and from many other investigators. His studies on the basic mechanisms involved in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia led to the discovery that a select class of analgesics like metamizole, in contrast to the classical NSAIDs, are able to counteract the ongoing sensitization of the primary sensory neuron via the stimulation of the arginine/nitric oxide pathway. He recently (December 2008) characterized a phenomenon described as retrograde sensitization of the primary sensory neuron, which emphasizes the importance of the peripheral component of the inflammatory pain. His group made a relevant contribution to the role of bradykinin and of cytokines in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. He found that among the cytokines, interleukin 1b mediates the endogenous release of prostaglandins and IL-8 is responsible {{for the development of the}} sympathetic hyperalgesia. In this area he described an antagonist of IL-1 that is now being developed as a model for a new class of analgesics.|$|E

40|$|Peripheral painful {{neuropathy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common complications in diabetes and necessitates improved treatment. Secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG), a predominant lignan in flaxseed, has been shown in our previous studies to exert antidepressant-like effect. As antidepressant drugs are clinically used to treat chronic neuropathic pain, this work aimed to investigate the potential analgesic efficacy of SDG against diabetic neuropathic pain in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. We subjected mice to diabetes by a single intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 200 mg/kg), and Hargreaves test or von Frey test was used to assess thermal hyperalgesia or mechanical allodynia, respectively. Chronic instead of acute SDG treatment (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, p. o., twice per day for three weeks) ameliorated thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in diabetic mice, and these <b>analgesic</b> <b>actions</b> persisted about three days when SDG treatment was terminated. Although chronic treatment of SDG to diabetic mice did not impact on the symptom of hyperglycemia, it greatly attenuated excessive oxidative stress in sciatic nerve and spinal cord tissues, and partially counteracted the condition of weight decrease. Furthermore, the <b>analgesic</b> <b>actions</b> of SDG were abolished by co-treatment with the reactive oxygen species donor tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), but potentiated by the reactive oxygen species scavenger phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN). These findings indicate that chronic SDG treatment can correct neuropathic hyperalgesia and allodynia in mice with type 1 diabetes. Mechanistically, the <b>analgesic</b> <b>actions</b> of SDG in diabetic mice may be associated with its antioxidant activity. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that heroin and morphine- 6 β-glucuronide (M 6 G) both act through a novel mu opioid receptor subtype distinct from those mediating morphine's actions. This very high affinity 3 H-M 6 G site is selectively competed by 3 -methoxynaltrexone. In vivo, 3 -methoxynaltrexone (2. 5 ng, i. c. v.) selectively antagonizes the <b>analgesic</b> <b>actions</b> of heroin and M 6 G without interfering with mu (morphine and [d-Ala 2,MePhe 4,Gly(ol) 5]enkephalin), delta ([d-Pen 2,d-Pen 5]enkephalin), kappa 1 (U 50, 488 H) or kappa 3 (naloxone benzoylhydrazone) analgesia. In dose–response studies, 3 -methoxynaltrexone (2. 5 ng, i. c. v.) significantly shifted the ED 50 values for heroin and its active metabolite, 6 -acetylmorphine, without affecting the morphine curve. These results indicate that 3 -methoxynaltrexone selectively blocks a novel 3 H-M 6 G binding site {{which is responsible for}} the <b>analgesic</b> <b>actions</b> of heroin and M 6 G. This ability to selectively antagonize heroin actions opens new possibilities in the development of therapeutics for the treatment of opioid abuse...|$|R
40|$|Many {{analgesic}} drugs, including μ-opioids, cannabinoids, and {{the novel}} nonopioid analgesic improgan, produce antinociception by {{actions in the}} rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). There they activate pain-inhibiting neurons, termed “off-cells,” defined by a nociceptive reflex-related pause in activity. Based on recent functional evidence that neuronal P 450 epoxygenases are important for the central antinociceptive actions of morphine and improgan, we explored the convergence of opioid and nonopioid <b>analgesic</b> drug <b>actions</b> in RVM by studying {{the effects of the}} P 450 epoxygenase inhibitor CC 12 on the analgesic drug-induced activation of these off-cells and on behavioral antinociception. In rats lightly anesthetized with isoflurane, we recorded the effects of intraventricular morphine and improgan, with and without CC 12 pretreatment, on tail flick latency and activity of identified RVM neurons: off-cells, on-cells (pronociceptive neurons), and neutral cells (unresponsive to analgesic drugs). CC 12 pretreatment preserved reflex-related changes in off-cell firing and blocked the <b>analgesic</b> <b>actions</b> of both drugs, without interfering with the increase in spontaneous firing induced by improgan or morphine. CC 12 blocked suppression of evoked on-cell firing by improgan, but not morphine. CC 12 pretreatment had no effect by itself on RVM neurons or behavior. These data show that the epoxygenase inhibitor CC 12 works downstream from receptors for both μ-opioid and improgan, at the inhibitory input mediating the off-cell pause. This circuit-level analysis thus provides a cellular basis for the convergence of opioid and nonopioid <b>analgesic</b> <b>actions</b> in the RVM. A presynaptic P 450 epoxygenase may therefore be an important target for development of clinically useful nonopioid analgesic drugs...|$|R

Ethanolic extract of Moringa M. oleifera (EMO was administered at 50, 100, 200, 400 mg/kg doses orally to the respective four groups. Control was normal saline (orally at 2 ml/kg body weight). Antipyretic activity was done in albino rats using the Brewer’s yeast induced pyrexia model, standard used was paracetamol (100 mg/kg).

These behavioral parameters were monitored in the OF: the percentage of center ambulation time and distance; whereas in the EPM: the time spent in open arms and the entries into open arms compared to the total time (%OAT) and entries (%OAE). In the OF, obestatin significantly decreased the percentage of time spent in the center in mice undergoing naloxone-precipitated mild morphine withdrawal.
