25|$|The {{weight of}} the hull could {{generally}} be reduced by using higher grades of steel that were lighter and thinner for the same strength, reducing dimensions, particularly length, or using <b>advanced</b> <b>construction</b> techniques like welding that saved weight over the conventional riveting. The Japanese used the same high tensile steel for the Hatsuharu class as they did for the older destroyers and chose not to increase {{the power of the}} turbines and boilers to achieve the desired high speed, but lengthened the hull to offset the reduced power of the light-weight machinery. The beam was increased to counter some of the extra top-weight, but the draft was reduced to reduce hull resistance, which also reduced stability by lessening the area of the hull beneath the waterline in comparison to the area above it, which was subject to pressure from the wind. Electric welding was extensively used to reduce weight although it was at an early stage of development in Japan and was still problematic.|$|E
25|$|The main Axis use {{the airport}} was {{to serve as}} a forward {{mechanical}} center for Norway. The decision was largely based on existence of the aircraft factory. A new hall was built, which along with upgrades to the existing gave four halls. In addition a paint shop and large warehouse were built. New workshops had to be built for instruments, radio and electrical equipment. From the summer of 1940 the factory became a division of Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke. It relied largely on the existing Norwegian workforce, but was forced to extensive retraining because of the <b>advanced</b> <b>construction</b> of the German aircraft. Junkers eventually withdrew and was replaced by Brinker Eisenwerk. The operation kept going until 1944. There was also established two separate motor repair shops, one operated by Daimler-Benz and one operated by Bayerische Motorenwerke (BMW). Both received new concrete halls. The work at the various companies was often met with passive resistance, such as through slow work, demands for work to be redone and occasionally sabotage.|$|E
25|$|John Henry Antes settled {{along the}} West Branch Susquehanna River circa 1772. His {{property}} {{was on the}} very edge of the Pennsylvania frontier. Antes’ neighbors on the north side of the West Branch Susquehanna and west of Lycoming Creek were outside the jurisdiction of the colonial government of Pennsylvania. They banded together to form the Fair Play Men. Antes, as a Justice of the Peace for what was then Northumberland County, worked closely with the Fair Play Men. He conducted their weddings and his stockade provided some protection against raids conducted by local Native Americans, who began fighting back against the encroachment of the Europeans. Antes built a gristmill along Antes Creek in 1773. It was the most <b>advanced</b> <b>construction</b> of any kind in frontier north-central Pennsylvania. John Henry Antes served as a Justice of the Peace from July 29, 1775 until January 24, 1776 when he was appointed captain of 58 militiamen under Colonel James Potter. After participating in a raid conducted by Colonel William Plunket against settlers from Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley near Wilkes-Barre, Antes returned to his gristmill, home and future fort in mid-1777. He also was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel that same year.|$|E

2500|$|Although steamships {{had already}} begun to {{dominate}} the shipping trade, Skomvær still did good business in the first few decades of the 20th century due to her high storage capacity and <b>advanced</b> <b>construction.</b> [...] To stay profitable the ship took whatever jobs were available, carrying a variety of cargo over long distances. [...] On 6 June 1908, the ship began one of many such voyages, departing from Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia with coal for delivery to Valparaíso in Chile. [...] However, disaster struck on 3 July, when a strong gust of wind caused the ship to heel and the cargo to shift, resulting in her sailing with an unsafe angle of list. [...] The crewmen were forced to cut down parts of the rig to keep the ship upright. [...] The situation worsened as the winds picked up and more of the rig broke down, making maneuvering difficult. [...] Though the ship sustained heavy damages, the crew trimmed some of the cargo and continued the journey. [...] On 17 July the ship was offered assistance by the crew of the British steamship Frankby, but refused. [...] Skomvær arrived in Valparaíso as a wreck on 25 August, where she was unloaded and underwent heavy repairs. [...] The repairs were finally completed on 25 January 1909.|$|E
