Fuel specific oxides of nitrogen emissions at the Port have decreased 12 % since 2010 while infrared opacity (a measure of particulate matter) remained low, showing no diesel particulate filter deterioration. The weigh station truck’s fuel specific oxides of nitrogen emission reductions since 2010 (18. 5 %) almost double the previous three year’s reductions and are the result of new trucks using selective catalytic reduction systems. Trucks at the weigh station equipped with these systems have a skewed oxides of nitrogen emissions distribution (half of the emissions were from 6 % of the measurements) and had significantly lower emissions than similarly equipped Port trucks. Infrared thermographs of truck exhaust pipes revealed that the mean temperature observed at the weigh station (225 ± 4. 5 °C) was 70 °C higher than for Port trucks, suggesting that the catalytic <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> on trucks at our Port site were often below minimum operating temperatures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based control and calibration design method for online cost-based optimization of engine-aftertreatment operation under all operating conditions. The so-called Integrated Emission Management (IEM) strategy online minimizes the fuel and AbBlue consumption. Based {{on the actual}} state of engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems,</b> optimal air management settings are determined for EGR-SCR balancing. Following a model-based approach, the strategy allows for a systematic control design and calibration procedure for engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems.</b> The potential of this time efficient method is demonstrated by experiments for a heavy-duty Euro-VI engine. The Integrated Emission Management strategy is developed and calibrated offline over a cold and hot World Harmonized Transient Cycle (WHTC) for the set emission targets. The total IEM development and calibration process takes approximately 20 weeks from model identification to the acceptance tests. Moreover, by only changing the software settings, the existing hardware performance increases: the WHTC results show a 1. 1 % operational cost reduction and corresponding 1. 4 % fuel consumption reduction (and by that CO 2) compared to the baseline Euro-VI strategy. Further potential benefits include reduced heat rejection in the EGR system and reduced DPF regeneration frequency.

The small nano-particulates present in automotive exhaust gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> are typically described as spherical and inert, closely following the gas phase streamlines apart from a superimposed Brownian motion. We will review when this picture provides a sound basis for the development of mathematical models of particle behavior, and when the underlying assumptions break down.

We will show that the deposition of such particles in an automotive catalyst substrate cannot in general be well described by the aforementioned modelling approach, as particle transformations become active inside the substrate channels, altering the apparent deposition efficiency. A conceptual model is proposed that is able to explain the initially observed discrepancies between measurements and simulations, by describing the particulate matter as a mixture of three different types of particles: truly inter particles, semivolatile particles and completely volatile particles. The conceptual model is corroborated by experimental and numerical investigations into the behavior of truly inert particles in automotive catalyst substrates. Finally, the role of particle inertia on the particle dispersion and deposition is also evaluated by experimental and numerical investigations of more complex substrate channel designs.

For varying {{operating}} environments, the engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system</b> must comply with the real-world emission legislation limits. Simultaneously, minimal fuel consumption and good drivability are crucial for economic competitiveness and usability. Meeting these requirements takes substantial development and calibration effort, and complying with regulations results in a trade-off between emissions and fuel consumption. TNO's Integrated Emission Management (IEM) strategy finds online, the cost-optimal point in this trade-off and is able to deal with variations in operating conditions, while complying with legislation limits. Based on the actual state of the engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system,</b> an optimal engine operating point is computed using a model-based optimal-control algorithm. A novel feature introduced in this work is the addition of a feedback scheme to control the tailpipe NOx emissions through modification of the Lagrange multiplier in the optimal control algorithm. The Lagrange multiplier represents the penalty on tailpipe NOx emissions in the optimal control problem. This feature provides In-Service Conformity (ISC) in real-life operation and adds robustness, in terms of emissions, to system disturbances, such as production tolerances, system ageing and sensor or actuator errors. The IEM strategy is a generic toolkit and can incorporate additional optimization variables, provided their effects are accurately represented by the online models of the engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> This can be used to include additional degrees of freedom such as fuel injection timing, pressure, pre- and post-injections and power-splits for hybrid drivelines.

The oxidation of NO to NO 2 is an important intermediate step involved in all current <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> that are designed for NOx and PM catalytic removal. The performance of both NOx control systems and catalysed particulate filters depend highly on the NO 2 concentration. In this work we have examined the influence of using hydrogen (H 2) and simulated reformate (H 2, CO and EGR gases) {{as a supplement to}} diesel fuel on NO 2 production. In actual engine applications a reformer will be integrated within the engine EGR system. This will not only provide the engine with recirculated exhaust gas (i. e.

The effects of adding H 2 or reformate results in a significant decrease in total engine-out NOx emissions, as well as an increase in both NO 2 concentration and NO 2 /NOx ratio. The influence of the simulated reformate combustion on the NO 2 production is dependent on the engine load and in-cylinder conditions. It was observed that both reformate composition and concentration significantly influence the NO 2 /NOx ratio of the exhaust gas. Air/fuel ratio, combustion efficiency and in-cylinder temperatures were the most influential parameters in this study. The NO 2 production was dependent on the EGR addition and air/fuel ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{dedicated}} auxiliary power unit is essential to utilize the potential that hybrid vehicles offer for efficient and ultra-clean transportation. An example of a hybrid project at the TNO Road-Vehicles Research Institute shows the development {{and the results of}} {{a dedicated}} auxiliary power unit for a series hybrid powertrain. This auxiliary power unit consists of a direct injected turbodiesel engine and a permanent magnet generator. This APU achieves not only extremely high efficiency, but thanks to a special <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system</b> (particulate trap and Denox catalyst) also very low emissions. During the design and development of the APU, attention is given to the following aspects: the choice of the operating points, the interaction between duty cycles and conversion rate of the <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system,</b> the genset controller and the hybrid controller. Based on a reference power input signal, the genset controller has to ensure a stable power delivery during varying external circumstances. The hybrid controller and its incorporated power control strategy, affects driveability aspects (like performance, range, safety reserve), efficiency, emissions, life, the temperature range for aftertreatment conversion, noise and various other aspects, thus being of prime importance for the succesful use of a series hybrid powertrain...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{aftertreatment}} {{systems and}} Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in particular, {{is becoming increasingly}} more popular as a cost effective way of reducing emissions from heavy duty vehicles. In order to make efficient use of these systems, {{it is important to}} have a complete system approach when it comes to calibration of the engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> One novel approach to reach the best compromise between low emissions and fuel/urea consumption is to use model based optimization. To perform model based optimization, extremely computationally efficient, yet accurate models of the engine and <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system</b> are needed. This is the focus of this thesis; to develop efficient models of primarily NOx formation in the diesel engine and NOx reduction using SCR. The first step involved developing quasi steady emission prediction methods. A physically based correction method termed the Delay Model is presented. Using this compensation method, transient correction factors can be calculated to predict carbon monoxide and particulate emissions from Euro III class diesel engines with reasonable accuracy. On the engines studied, no correction factor is applied for NOx emissions. The models lack in accuracy to be used for simulation / optimization purposes however...|$|E

SCR systems benefit from closed-loop control if an appropriate exhaust gas sensor were available. An ammonia sensor has recently been developed {{for use as a}} feedback element in closed-loop control of urea dosing in a diesel SCR <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>system.</b> Closed-loop control of SCR dosing enables the SCR system to be robust against disturbances and to meet conformity of production (COP) and in-use compliance norms...|$|E
40|$|Tightening {{environmental}} constraints on {{exhaust gas emissions}} of gasoline and Diesel engines led to a growing interest in new and highly sophisticated gas sensors. Such sensors will be required in future exhaust gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> for the selective real time detection of pollutants such as nitric oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Restrictions on cost and device dimensions imposed by the automobile industry make semiconductor gas sensors promising candidates for the realization of cheap and small-size sensor devices. This work deals with semiconductor field effect devices with catalytically active platinum (Pt) electrodes and potential applications of such devices in automotive exhaust gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems.</b> To allow for continuous operation at high temperatures, silicon carbide (SiC) and group III-nitrides such as GaN and AlGaN were used as semiconductor materials. Different devices have been realized with such materials: SiC based MOS capacitors (MOSiC), GaN Schottky diodes and GaN/AlGaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMT). The principle feasibility of SiC and GaN based field effect gas sensors for automotive applications was tested under laboratory conditions using synthetic gas mixtures. Exhaust gas components such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxides (NO and NO 2), various saturated and unsaturated hydro-carbons as well as water vapor, oxygen (O 2) and hydrogen (H 2) were used as test gases in appropriate concentrations with the sensor devices being operated {{in a range of}} temperatures extending from room temperature up to 600 degree C.

40|$|Exhaust gas <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} present in motor {{vehicles}} for decades and have contributed to reducing {{their impact on the}} environment and people. Most of them for oxidation or reduction of harmful emissions of particulates and fumes require a certain temperature to be reached that changes with the exhaust temperature, i. e. the points of engine operation. The article describes the effect of oxidation reactor and particulate filter temperatures on specific emissions of gaseous compounds and particulate matter during the modified NRSC engine test. Before the first measurement cycle, the engine was idling, before the second measurement cycle, the exhaust system was heated with exhaust gases at full engine load until passive regeneration of the particle filter occurred (noticeable decrease in instantaneous particle concentration) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Automotive {{powertrain}} system {{consists of}} several interactive and coupled nonlinear systems. This {{research focuses on}} the coordination of Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine, transmission and emission <b>aftertreatment</b> <b>systems.</b> The goal is to design an optimal control strategy on driving performance, emissions (HC, CO, NOX), fuel economy {{as well as the}} transition smoothness of engine mode switching and gear shifting, under both discrete and continuous constraints. A multivariable control strategy is utilized to compromise among all powertrain subsystems to achieve optimal overall performance. The nonlinear discrete dynamic programming approach is proposed for hybrid system optimization. The multivariable automotive control problem is then converted into a simplified optimization problem. The feasibility of automotive hybrid control by discrete dynamic programming approach is demonstrated by results of numerical simulations on different operating conditions...|$|R
