5|$|The World Series {{started on}} a Tuesday for the second {{straight}} year, instead of a Wednesday as in the past. The practice was to avoid games on Thursday <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> nights, generally big days of television viewing, where Fox's telecast would face stiff competition from Thursday Night Football, ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime, various popular primetime entertainment shows, <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> Night Football.|$|E
5|$|Other {{political}} stations {{include the}} likes of Galaxy FM, founded in the early 1980s and gaining a strong audience by the late 80's after becoming consistent reliable station broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> mornings. Galaxy FM did attempt to broadcast 24 hours on the FM briefly and did advertise for a short time, before returning to broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> mornings after 1992 with no profit making adverts. It was not until June 2012 Galaxy FM attempted to broadcast 24 hours {{a day on the}} FM again and deliberately continued to not use profit making advertisements to maintain the station. However, in late September/early October 2012 due to constant attacks from the authorities the station {{decided to go back to}} its original schedule, this time with an additional day and a half of broadcasting per week; broadcasting on the FM from Thursday afternoons until Monday afternoons. Galaxy FM encourages the black population to liberate themselves through empowerment and self-reliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} {{attracted}} 2.2million viewers its initial airing on April 17 in the U.S., and totaled 5.4million viewers across multiple Sunday <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> night airings. It averaged 743,000 and reached a peak 823,000 in UK and Ireland on its April 18 premiere. HBO {{announced that they}} would be commissioning a second season on the strength of the reception of the premiere episode. By the final episode of the season, which aired June 20, the ratings had climbed to over 3 million.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{were held}} {{during the second}} wave of strikes, when Brendan Barber {{announced}} {{on the afternoon of}} Friday 30 October that proposals had been put to both Royal Mail and the CWU for them to consider over the weekend. Talks resumed on the Monday, however this news was overshadowed by the announcement that a further two days of strikes would be held on Friday 6 November <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> 9 November. It was also announced that these would be all out strikes with everybody walking out at the same time rather than the rolling strike action that had been adopted previously, thus leading to a complete stoppage throughout the course of the action. These were later called off in order for further talks to take place.|$|E
5|$|In her car, {{she packed}} clothing, toiletries, college textbooks, and birth-control pills. When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games {{had to be}} played on {{different}} days. Normally they both would be held on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, {{so they had to}} be played on Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to be played on different days.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} broadcast in an extended 90-minute commercial timeslot on 10 December 2001 on the ITV {{network in the}} United Kingdom (ITV1, STV and UTV) and on TV3 in Ireland. Unofficial overnight ratings recorded an average of 8.5million viewers and a 37% audience share for the episode in the UK. Final ratings, accounting for PVR viewings, rose to 8.95million (38% share), making it the twenty-first most-watched show of the week. The fourth series had been broadcast on ITV on consecutive Sunday <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> nights, and the Monday ratings had been considerably lower. Episode 8 marked {{the peak of the}} Monday night ratings.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October, it was {{announced}} that postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions. It was later announced that a national strike would be held on Thursday 22 October and Friday 23 October. After further talks failed, more strikes were announced to take place on Thursday 29 October, Friday 30 October and Saturday 31 October. Discussions continued throughout the second wave of strikes with proposals being put to both sides, but these were overshadowed by the announcement of a third walkout on Friday 6 November <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> 9 November. However, on 5 November it {{was announced}} that strikes had been called off until the New Year to allow time for fresh talks to take place. A resolution to the dispute was finally reached following lengthy discussions on 8 March 2010, and on 27 April it was reported that postal workers voted to accept the deal.|$|E
5|$|Some Romans, {{following}} a belief possibly originating in Mesopotamia but developed in Hellenistic Egypt, {{believed that the}} seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth. The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest to the closest planet). Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. Because each day was named by the god that started it, {{this is also the}} order of the days of the week in the Roman calendar after the Nundinal cycle was rejected – and still preserved in many modern languages. In English, Saturday, Sunday, <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> are straightforward translations of these Roman names. The other days were renamed after Tiw (Tuesday), Wóden (Wednesday), Thunor (Thursday), and Fríge (Friday), the Anglo-Saxon gods considered similar or equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday <b>and</b> <b>Monday,</b> it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway <b>and</b> <b>Monday,</b> to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
5|$|With her task finished, Elspeth {{tries to}} resume her {{beautiful}} guise with the mirror. But instead, the magic mirror returns {{her to her}} true form, even more loathsome than before, as punishment from the Green-Eyed One for killing her stepdaughter. Meanwhile, the dwarfs, unable to save Snow White, place her in a coffin of ice and leave her near Monday's statue. When she receives a kiss of true love from Prince Alfred, in his bear form, she is revived. The spells on Alfred, Sunday, <b>and</b> <b>Monday</b> break, and Elspeth's mirrors shatter, freeing John. Elspeth gets cornered, tackled, and killed by the gnomes, who have been freed from their enchantments. Freed from Elspeth, the Green-Eyed One is able to go his way. Snow White and Alfred {{live happily ever after}} while the dwarfs decide to move on to find Sleeping Beauty.|$|E
