25|$|God, if I hadn't {{loved him}} I would have hated him <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> ridiculous stories, persuading people I was {{offering}} him money {{to have his}} name taken off...that he would be carrying on like this, denouncing me as a coauthor, screaming around.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} of the Portuguese deserters trying to cross the frontier by their own risk, several days after the Battle of Toro, is not comparable to the bloodbath suffered by the Castilian fugitives {{at the hands of}} the population in the 24 hours after the Battle of Aljubarrota. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>those</b> Portuguese deserters had some capability to make war and antagonize the Castilians who might try to capture them (as Cardinal Mendoza himself admitted), whereas near the Aljubarrota battlefield the Castilian soldiers’ thought was to survive the carnage. Their bargaining power and silver were useless.|$|E

25|$|Consider {{this matter}} in the context that natural gas {{producers}} generally buy mineral rights from the Crown but must negotiate surface access and other land rights with their neighbours. In this environment, the chances are high that some projects will face delays {{as a result of}} public hearings - for example, as Shell and the other contenders did at the Caroline hearing. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>those</b> with an interest in a single land use decision could include petroleum producers, Aboriginal communities, landowners, farmers, ranchers, loggers, trappers, campers, sports and environmental groups, and others. Many conflicting interests need to be resolved.|$|E
500|$|Along the way, the {{production}} team went through drafts {{where the first}} act included far more detail than what {{ended up in the}} final version, such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent who would have explained the backstory behind Elsa's magical powers, and a regent for whom Lee was hoping to cast comedian Louis C.K. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> details were thoroughly [...] "over-analyzed", they were excised because they amounted to a [...] "much more complex story than really we felt like we could fit in this 90-minute film." [...] As Del Vecho put it, [...] "the more we tried to explain things at the beginning, the more complicated it got." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{troops from}} Ireland, thus {{obtained}} {{at the cost}} of an enormous political blunder, proved to be untrustworthy <b>after</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Those</b> serving in Hopton's army were [...] "mutinous and shrewdly infected with the rebellious humour of England". When Waller's Londoners surprised and routed a Royalist detachment at Alton on 13 December 1643, half the prisoners took the Covenant.|$|E
50|$|This payment {{continued}} to be exacted after the stone theater was built. Pericles, to relieve the poorer classes, passed a law that enabled them to receive {{the price of admission}} from the state; <b>after</b> which <b>all</b> <b>those</b> citizens who were too poor to pay for their places applied for the money in the public assembly, which was then frequently held in the theater.|$|R

Afterward Candice gouges out Ryan's eyes, and sets him on fire. She finds her husband's body and cuts his leg off, revealing that he had $100,000 hidden in a prosthetic leg. Candice walks off into the distance with the leg, <b>after</b> betraying <b>all</b> <b>those</b> around her.|$|R
2500|$|Daughter Katherine McIntosh told CNN {{that the}} photo's fame {{had made the}} family feel both ashamed and {{determined}} never to be as poor again. Son Troy Owens said that more than 2,000 letters received along with donations for his mother's medical fund led to a re-appraisal of the photo: [...] "For Mama and us, the photo {{had always been a}} bit of [...] curse. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> letters came in, I think it gave us a sense of pride." ...|$|E
2500|$|Copland {{would not}} {{consider}} the specific instrumentation for a piece until it was complete and notated. Nor, according to Pollack, did he generally work in linear fashion, {{from beginning to end}} of a composition. Instead, he tended to compose whole sections in no particular order and surmise their eventual sequence <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> parts were complete, much like assembling a collage. Copland himself admitted, [...] "I don't compose. I assemble materials." [...] Many times, he included material he had written years earlier. If the situation dictated, as it did with his film scores, Copland could work quickly. Otherwise, he tended to write slowly whenever possible. Even with this deliberation, Copland considered composition, in his words, [...] "the product of the emotions," [...] which included [...] "self-expression" [...] and [...] "self-discovery." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 July 2011, {{he moved}} to Turkish Süper Lig side Samsunspor after seven-year spell in Feyenoord. Following his move to Samsunspor, Andre told Feyenoord's {{official}} website that [...] "he admits he is sorry to be leaving and says sorely miss this club and this city" [...] He also told Feyenoord's official website that [...] "It {{will take time to}} get used to being Samsunspor <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> years at Feyenoord". Two months after signing for the club due to pre match friendly, Andre made his debut in the Samsunspor shirt in a 3–2 win over Gençlerbirliği on 10 September 2011. At the start of the 2012–13 season, Andre left Samsunspor by mutual consent after one season. His release was explained as Andre sued the club over allegedly owing him four months of unpaid wages.|$|E

Yet you are not one of those to turn your face to the wall because the {{greatest}} gift of life is withheld from you. That is why I have lifted the curtain of my own days. I know you, and I know that you will triumph. It is a world of compensations <b>after</b> <b>all</b> for <b>those</b> who have the wit to understand." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} her wonderingly. It seemed to me so strange that, under our very eyes, the child whom I had led by the hand through Covent Garden on that bright Spring morning should have {{developed}} in thought and mind under our own roof, and with so little conscious instruction, into a woman of perceptions and character. Somewhere the seed of these things must have lain hidden. One knows so little, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> of <b>those</b> whom one knows best.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll hope, nevertheless," [...] said Mr Clare. [...] "And I {{continue}} {{to pray for}} him, though {{on this side of}} the grave we shall probably never meet again.

2500|$|The band {{signed to}} Interscope Records, and in June 1994 {{used the money}} {{acquired}} from their recording contract to relocate from Brookfield to Fort Collins, Colorado, where Alvarez had lived {{as a child and}} where drummer Bill Stevenson's girlfriend lived. [...] "We moved to Fort Collins {{with the advent of the}} major label because we finally had enough money to live like normal people <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> years", Alvarez later said. [...] "That was the first time we had ever lived in separate residences. At the time I was actually married, which was a new one for the band to deal with, and everyone’s moving in their different circles, but we kept touring and making records." [...] "Los Angeles was too big. Brookfield was too small. This is just right", he said in 1995. [...] "When we lived in Brookfield and wanted to do a local gig, we'd have to drive two hours to Columbia or six hours to St. Louis. It's a lot easier here, and the kids are real cool. So I think we'll stay." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even <b>after</b> adding <b>all</b> <b>those</b> {{solenoids}} and switches, {{getting a}} Selectric {{to talk to}} a computer was a complicated project. [...] The Selectric mechanism had many peculiar requirements. If commanded to shift to upper case when it was already in upper-case, the mechanism locked up and never signaled [...] "done." [...] The same applied to shifting the ribbon direction or initiating a carriage-return. [...] These commands could only be issued at particular times, with the Selectric in a particular state, and then not again until the terminal signaled the operation was complete.|$|R
50|$|On August 2, 2012, Harvey {{performed}} {{his final}} stand-up act at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, ending a 27-year {{career as a}} stand-up comedian. The two-hour performance was broadcast live on Pay-Per-View. “The road to this final show has been an amazing journey, doing stand-up for the past 27 years, and I can’t thank fans enough <b>after</b> reflecting on <b>all</b> <b>those</b> years on stage,” he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye-es," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I {{often think}} the {{religious}} johnnies are saving their money {{to put on a}} horse that'll never run <b>after</b> <b>all.</b> I remember <b>those</b> Yogi chaps in India.

500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and <b>after</b> watching <b>all</b> <b>those</b> games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Out-of-town {{reviews for}} Big Fish were positive. Variety called it [...] "A wholly {{satisfying}} show: meaningful, emotional, tasteful, theatrically imaginative and engaging," [...] and concluded: [...] By taking Edward’s tales as the jumping-off {{point for the}} theatricality of production numbers, the show makes a case for the musical form itself {{as a means of}} privileging imagination over ordinariness. The show does have a target audience <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> and it’s <b>those</b> who love musicals.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She looks quite a {{different}} girl to what she did during the season,' one of her acquaintances said to Mrs. Dean, who had arrived at Lucerne {{the day before the}} Hawtreys. 'I suppose she never really cared for Halliburn <b>after</b> <b>all.</b> No doubt <b>those</b> curious stories that there were about {{had something to do with}} the affair being broken off. For my part I think it would have been better taste for her----' ...|$|R
60|$|Lisbeth paused, in a {{listening}} attitude, without removing {{her apron}} from her face. The voice was strange to her. Could it be her sister's spirit {{come back to}} her from the dead <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> years? She trembled and dared not look.|$|E
6000|$|They {{died away}} {{when one of}} the men, with {{emphatic}} gestures, demanded attention. Moving out from the rest, he turned to Grant.

60|$|Here {{was another}} trouble. Yes; {{all the people}} in Carmarthen would know the old Squire's carriage, and <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> {{passages}} in the newspapers,--believing, as he knew they did, that he had stolen the property,--would clamber up on the very wheels to look at him! The clerk had been right in that.|$|E
50|$|For {{most of the}} {{remainder}} of the voyage, the ship weathered heavy gales that lasted from two to three days at a stretch. But for the explosion, the ship performed well on her maiden voyage and carried a good spread of canvas for {{the remainder}} of the trip to England. Making port at Plymouth, England, on 4 April, Worcester eventually discharged her cargo at London. The plan to sell the cargo to raise money to purchase relief supplies for the French fell through. It seemed that the French really did not need help <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> and <b>those</b> who did could not afford to pay the cost of transporting the supplies from the French coast to their districts.|$|R
5000|$|Before the Creation, Eru Ilúvatar {{made the}} Ainur or [...] "holy ones". This Quenya {{name comes from}} the Elvish root ayan- [...] "revere, treat with awe". [...] "Ainur only appears in plural Elvish texts since <b>after</b> the Creation <b>all</b> <b>those</b> were Maiar {{includes}} Valar and their lesser kin, but not {{those who did not}} take part in the Great Theme, or else did not enter Eä." [...] This means that only apocryphal texts written by Men or by Hobbits used the singular Ainu.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the death}} {{certificate}} the causa mortis was acute pneumonia in the left lung. Pedro II died without abdicating, and Isabel inherited the claim to the throne of the Brazilian Empire. She solemnly kissed her father's hands, and <b>after</b> that, <b>all</b> <b>those</b> present, including dozens of Brazilians already there kissed her hand, recognizing her as the Empress de jure of Brazil. The Baron of Rio Branco, who was also present, later wrote: [...] "The Brazilians, thirty and something, went in line and, one by one, sprinkled holy water on the corpse and kissed his hand. I did the same. They were saying farewell to the great dead." [...] Senator Gaspar da Silveira Martins arrived soon after the Emperor's death and, {{when he saw the}} body of his old friend, wept convulsively.|$|R
