5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny would prove to be for naught <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E
5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, and <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E

25|$|After the Carthaginian defeat by the Roman Republic, the {{north-east}} of Iberia {{became the}} first to come under Roman rule and became part of Hispania, the westernmost part of the Roman Empire. Tarraco (modern Tarragona) {{was one of the}} most important Roman cities in Hispania and the capital of the province of Tarraconensis. Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuriæ (former Emporion) and Barcino (Barcelona). <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Hispania, Latin law was granted to all cities under the reign of Vespasian (69-79 AD), while Roman citizenship was granted to all free men of the empire by the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of Roman law since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, vine, wheat), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the Via Augusta, parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like aqueducts.|$|E
25|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} {{of the country and}} the massive internal migration in China, the standard Putonghua Proficiency Test has quickly become popular. Many university graduates in mainland China and Hong Kong take this exam before looking for a job. Employers often require varying proficiency in Standard Chinese from applicants depending {{on the nature of the}} positions. Applicants of some positions, e.g. telephone operators, may be required to obtain a certificate. People raised in Beijing are sometimes considered inherently 1-A (A score of at least 97%) and exempted from this requirement. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> the score of 1-A is rare. According to the official definition of proficiency levels, people who get 1-B (A score of at least 92%) are considered qualified to work as television correspondents or in broadcasting stations. 2-A (A score of at least 87%) can work as Chinese Literature Course teachers in public schools. Other levels include: 2-B (A score of at least 80%), 3-A (A score of at least 70%) and 3-B (A score of at least 60%). In China, a proficiency of level 3-B usually cannot be achieved unless special training is received. Even though many Chinese do not speak with standard pronunciation, spoken Standard Chinese is widely understood to some degree.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{difference}} between the general plot outline of Tom Thumb and The Tragedy of Tragedies, but Fielding does make significant changes. He completely removed {{a scene in which}} two doctors discuss Tom Thumb's death, and in doing so unified the type of satire that he was working on. He narrowed his critique to abuses of language produced only by individuals subconsciously, and not by frauds like the doctors. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the play, Fielding expanded scenes, added characters, and turned the work into a three-act play. Merlin is added to the plot to prophesize Tom's end. In addition, Grizzle becomes Tom's rival for Huncamunca's heart, and a giantess named Glumdalca is added as a second love interest for both King Arthur and Tom. As the play progresses, Tom is not killed by Grizzle, but instead defeats him. However, Tom is killed by a giant, murderous cow offstage, the news of which prompts a killing spree, leaving seven dead bodies littered on stage and the King alone, left to boast that he is the last to fall, right before stabbing himself. The ghost of Tom in Tom Thumb is replaced by the ghost of Gaffar Thumb, Tom's father.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{into account}} the new role of the castle, the emperor Ferdinand I. of Habsburg had it rebuilt into a Renaissance castle by Italian {{builders}} and artists, such as Giulio Licino da Pordanone and Maciotanus Ulisses from Rome, between 1552 and 1562 (but some work continued even afterwards). The main designer and supervisor of the construction was the Italian architect Pietro Ferrabosco, who had been serving the emperor in Vienna and knew Count Eck Salm, the captain of Pressburg from 1552– 1571. The building’s form did not change (except that the entrance was shifted), but it was completely changed inside and outside. Above all, floors and rooms were rearranged, and most rooms received precious (golden etc.) equipment. In the late 16th century, a ball house (for various ball games) at the eastern wall and a second, better water well were added. Unfortunately, basically {{only one part of}} the castle chapel has been completely preserved from this time, paradoxically because it was walled up as “unnecessary” in the 17th century. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the site, there were wooden dwellings for the guards (up to the 18th century) in the north-west, a (today unknown) “old tower” somewhere {{to the left of the}} castle building was improved, and the western entrance gate of the site was replaced by a big armoury.|$|E

Taylor's over the edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. This was especially true given the eventual career paths of talented players like Hollywood Henderson and Dexter Manley whose drug problems derailed their careers. However, after his return Taylor played at his normal All-Pro level, recording 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny would prove to be for naught, <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his career Taylor passed his drug tests and avoided suspension.|$|E
500|$|The {{response}} for [...] "Dial D for Diddly" [...] {{was that it}} started well, but then gradually declined. In Marnell's opinion, [...] "he best segment of the entire episode comes when Ned makes his normal routine look sinister and yet when he finally closes his hands to pray, he's actually holding a pair of severed hands", but <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the segment, he is disappointed: [...] "hen {{it seems like the}} short is heading for some darkly hilarious territory, the voice of God turns out to be Homer urging Ned to murder his enemies." [...] Other reviewers agreed with his assessment. Surette concluded that the episode [...] "tarted off good, but got boring very quick."

500|$|Brener noted when Mars' audio {{infrastructure}} evolved substantially, when Berry {{took over}} the only model he would use was Sennheiser wireless.

Nevertheless, Berry and Brener tried several capsule and transmitter combinations before [...] "settling" [...] with a SKM 5200 handheld transmitter and a MD 5235 capsule. Berry stated that Mars is not only involved with him and Brener [...] "on the way things sound", but also [...] "has very clear ideas on what he wants and what he expects". Regardless of the place where Mars is going to perform he will only use Sennheiser; [...] "there is no debating [...] he wants Sennheiser, and that's what he's going to get", says Berry. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the vocals and horns, the wireless system has ten channels of Sennheiser EM 3732-II receivers, seven SKM 5200-II transmitters with MD 5235 capsules and three SK 5212-II bodypack transmitters.|$|E

500|$|The {{architectural}} historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner {{compared the}} college unfavourably to {{the designs of}} the Danish architect Arne Jacobsen [...] for St Catherine's College, Oxford, construction of which began in 1960 (the year that Nuffield College was completed): St Catherine's, in his view, was [...] "the most perfect piece of architecture of 20th-century Oxford" [...] and made Nuffield [...] "look even more absurd". Nevertheless, he [...] "proposed forgiveness" [...] for the [...] "mighty tower", which [...] "positively helps the famous skyline of Oxford", adding that it has [...] "enough identity {{to be sure that}} one day it will find affection". He said that the tower had something of the architect Edwin Lutyens' [...] "felicitous manipulation of period details into a non-period whole and will, I prophesy, one day be loved", although he was less sure that this fate awaited the rest of the buildings. Simon Jenkins said of Pevsner's prophecy about the tower, [...] "I doubt it"; he described it as [...] "at best ungainly", with a [...] "weak spire", and said that [...] "vegetation was its best hope, <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Nuffield". The college, in his view [...] "required a sense of humour".|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy Wales has {{described}} Wikipedia as [...] "an {{effort to create}} and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language". Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others). For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.|$|E

He was reputed to be superficial, blundering, untrue, ambitious, vain, crafty and an intriguer." [...] François-Poncet, who knew Papen well thanks to their shared membership in the prestigious Deutscher Herrenklub (German Gentleman's Club) of Berlin, noted that Papen's [...] "face bears the mark of frivolity of which he has never been able to rid himself. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> he is not regarded as a personality of the first rank...One quality he clearly does possess: cheek, audacity, an amiable audacity of which he seems unaware.

2500|$|Ignoring the {{prevailing}} attitude, Civitans adopted {{service to the}} developmentally disabled as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for disabled children, {{all at a time}} when such training and programs were almost nonexistent. In the United States, the segregation of people with developmental disabilities wasn't widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of Wolf Wolfensberger's seminal work [...] "The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models", drawing on some of the ideas proposed by SG Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as deviant, sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that [...] "deviant" [...] role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of [...] "retardates" [...] and provided the same basic human rights <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the population.|$|E
