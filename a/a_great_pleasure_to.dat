[...] In an interview with Radar in 2007, Hitchens {{said that if the}} Christian right's agenda were implemented in the United States [...] "It wouldn't last very long and would, I hope, lead to civil war, which they will lose, but for which it would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> take part." ...|$|E

I am not gifted with the art of oratory, and am forced to say my thanks in plain and homely words. Yet they are none the less heartfelt. I make no pretense that the {{building}} of the Virginian Railway was intended wholly as a public service, and it is a business enterprise. I have faith that the resources of this Old Dominion State, when properly developed, mean a great deal, not for you who live here alone, but for the whole country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, at the post-fight press conference, Érik further {{explained}} his reasoning for brawling with the Filipino slugger; [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> fight this way. I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I {{need to put}} a little flavor into the ring. My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|It will be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> all to {{hear that}} the HRH the Prince of Wales has {{expressed}} a wish to be given the fine old English title of Visitor of this school.

Finding that the title existed, he has thus honored us by becoming [...] "Visitor of Upper Canada College".... The gracious offer of the Prince, places the position on a still higher plane, and it makes us all feel a lot prouder of the grand old College to which we belong.|$|E

After the dance performances, the captains of the nine teams took the [...] "MCC Spirit of Cricket" [...] pledge. Captain of the defending champions, M.S.

30|$|Analogous to {{scattered}} islands that form a single archipelago, {{the network of}} distributed hedonic hotspots forms a functional integrated circuit, which obeys control rules that are largely hierarchical and organized into brain levels (Aldridge et al. 1993; Berridge and Fentress 1986; Grill and Norgren 1978; Peciña et al. 2006). At the highest levels, the hotspot network may function as a more democratic heterarchy, in which unanimity of positive votes across hotspots is required in order <b>to</b> generate <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>pleasure.</b> For example, any successful enhancement that starts in one hotspot involves recruiting neuronal activation across other hotspots simultaneously, to create a network of several that all vote 'yes' together for more pleasure (Smith et al. 2011). Conversely, a pleasure enhancement initiated by opioid activation of one hotspot can be vetoed by an opposite vote of 'no' from another hotspot where opioid signals are suppressed. Such findings reveal the need for unanimity across hotspots in order for <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> be produced, and the potential fragility of hedonic enhancement if any hotspot defects (Smith and Berridge 2007; Smith et al. 2010).|$|R

60|$|Most persons {{visit the}} sea-side in warm weather, when fogs are frequent, and the {{atmosphere}} is wont to be thick, and the charm of the sea is to some extent lost. But I suspect that the fall is the best season, for then the atmosphere is more transparent, and it is <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> {{look out over the}} sea. The clear and bracing air, and the storms of autumn and winter even, are necessary in order that we may get the impression which the sea is calculated to make. In October, when the weather is not intolerably cold, and the landscape wears its autumnal tints, such as, methinks, only a Cape Cod landscape ever wears, especially if you have a storm during your stay,--that I am convinced {{is the best time to}} visit this shore. In autumn, even in August, the thoughtful days begin, and we can walk anywhere with profit. Beside, an outward cold and dreariness, which make it necessary to seek shelter at night, lend a spirit of adventure to a walk.|$|R

2500|$|In May 1909 Chelmsford {{accepted}} the appointment as Governor of New South Wales and {{was sworn in}} at Government House on 28 May 1909. Unlike in Queensland, his term was comparably stable and was distinguished by {{good relations with the}} state government. At the start of his term, Charles Wade, of the Commonwealth Liberal Party, was the Premier. However, following the 1910 election, Wade's Liberals were defeated and the Labor Party under James McGowen was sworn in as the state's first Labor Government. Despite his conservative background, Chelmsford was able to get along well with the Labor Government. Chelmsford became friends with the Attorney General, William Holman, with whom they shared a love of music and as a competent Viola player, Chelmsford encouraged chamber concerts at Government House. He said of the government: [...] "I have never had a body of Ministers with whom it has been <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> work. They are quiet, unassuming and industrious, and have won the goodwill and loyalty of their departments." [...] From 21 December 1909 to 27 January 1910 Chelmsford acted as Administrator of the Commonwealth when the Governor-General of Australia, The Earl of Dudley was on leave.|$|R
