This retrospective study identified 56 postmeningitically deafened children (diagnosed between 4 - 140 months of age) with no diagnosed cognitive impairment. It compared the age of diagnosis (categorised as prelingual, 12 months) with the medical/surgical outcomes (i. e., whether drilling was required for implant insertion and the type of insertion/ electrode array used). Additionally, whether educational support was provided throughout the years of preschool to high school was considered as a very broad measure of functional performance. Fortyeight participants (86 %) <b>acquired</b> postmeningitic <b>deafness</b> prelingually and 34 (61 %) participants were implanted early. This suggests that delays in implantation from the time of diagnosis do not influence whether surgical drilling is required or the likelihood of full insertion of the implant.

The responses in the 70 – 210 ms time window, encompassing the N 1 b/P 2 and Ta/Tb components of the AEPs, were modeled by a vertically and a laterally oriented dipole source in each hemisphere. Peak latencies and amplitudes of the major components of the dipole waveforms were measured in the hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulated ear. The normal-hearing subjects showed significant ipsilateral–contralateral latency and amplitude differences, with contralateral source activities that were typically larger and peaked earlier than the ipsilateral activities. In addition, the ipsilateral–contralateral amplitude differences from monaural presentation were similar for left and for right ear stimulation. For unilaterally deaf subjects, the previously reported reduction in ipsilateral–contralateral amplitude differences based on scalp waveforms was also observed in the dipole source waveforms.

It is assumed that people with dark eyes also have more melanin in the inner ear than those with light eyes, and melanin causes the retention of ototoxic derivatives within the cochlea. 1 A higher melanin content in the cochlea also protects against the effects of noise; those with dark eyes are less likely to develop hearing loss associated with noise. <br/...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{determine}} the diagnostic approach to severe or profound bilateral postmeningitic deafness and to propose management guidelines. Material and methodsA retrospective review of five patients (two adolescents and three infants) with rapidly progressive severe bilateral deafness following {{an episode of}} meningitis managed between 2004 and 2010. ResultsThe two adolescents presented Neisseria meningitidis meningitis and the three infants presented Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. <b>Acquired</b> bilateral <b>deafness</b> was diagnosed by audiometry an average of 68. 8  days (range: 9 – 210) after the episode of meningitis. Behavioural audiological testing, adapted to age and state of health, was performed in all patients. Deafness was confirmed by Auditory Brainstem Response tests. All five patients were assessed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within ten days. T 2 -weighted MRI sequences showed endolymph changes in four patients. CT scan demonstrated ossification in only one patient. Bilateral cochlear implant was performed in all patients, with complete electrode array insertion for eight implants and partial insertion for two implants (20 and 21 out of 22  electrodes inserted). Good results were obtained with cochlear implants in four cases. ConclusionsBilateral deafness can occur immediately or several months after bacterial meningitis, regardless of the micro-organism responsible, justifying screening by behavioural audiological testing adapted to age for two years following bacterial meningitis. Auditory Brainstem Response testing can confirm audiometric findings. When severe or profound bilateral deafness is observed, MRI must be performed urgently to detect endolymph inflammation or ossification.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to expand the {{knowledge}} of mental health problems with deaf and severely hard of hearing children and adolescents in the following domains: 1. The prevalence of mental health problems; 2. Specific intra- and interpersonal aspects of pathogenesis; 3. characteristics of the hearing impaired population with severe mental health problems. The rate of mental health problems, especially of emotional problems, was increased in deaf adolescents of normal intelligence compared with the general population. However, findings from the studies described in this thesis {{support the view that}} it is not deafness in itself which contributes to mental health problems but rather deafness in conjunction with physical health problems, communication problems, and adverse living conditions. For example, stress-inducing deafness-related characteristics such as an <b>acquired</b> cause of <b>deafness</b> moderated the associati on between low self-esteem and emotional disorder in deaf adolescents. Comparing hearing and hearing impaired children referred to a mental health service over a period of 15 years, more disabling physical health conditions, more intellectual impairment and more environmental distress were found with hearing impaired children. The findings argue for the importance of early detection of problems and a multi-informant approach to the assessment of disorder. Promotor: Ph. D. A. Treffers, Co-promotor: A. W.

40|$|Background Individuals with a {{unilateral}} severe-to-profound hearing loss, or single-sided deafness, report difficulty with listening in many everyday situations despite {{having access to}} well-preserved acoustic hearing in one ear. The standard of care for single-sided deafness available on the UK National Health Service is a contra-lateral routing of signals hearing aid which transfers sounds from the impaired ear to the non-impaired ear. This hearing aid {{has been found to}} improve speech understanding in noise when the signal-to-noise ratio is more favourable at the impaired ear than the non-impaired ear. However, the indiscriminate routing of signals to a single ear can have detrimental effects when interfering sounds are located {{on the side of the}} impaired ear. Recent published evidence has suggested that cochlear implantation in individuals with a single-sided deafness can restore access to the binaural cues which underpin the ability to localise sounds and segregate speech from other interfering sounds. Methods/Design The current trial was designed to assess the efficacy of cochlear implantation compared to a contra-lateral routing of signals hearing aid in restoring binaural hearing in adults with <b>acquired</b> single-sided <b>deafness.</b> Patients are assessed at baseline and after receiving a contra-lateral routing of signals hearing aid. A cochlear implant is then provided to those patients who do not receive sufficient benefit from the hearing aid. This within-subject longitudinal design reflects the expected care pathway should cochlear implantation be provided for single-sided deafness on the UK National Health Service. The primary endpoints are measures of binaural hearing at baseline, after provision of a contra-lateral routing of signals hearing aid, and after cochlear implantation. Binaural hearing is assessed in terms of the accuracy with which sounds are localised and speech is perceived in background noise. The trial is also designed to measure the impact of the interventions on hearing- and health-related quality of life. Discussion This multi-centre trial was designed to provide evidence for the efficacy of cochlear implantation compared to the contra-lateral routing of signals. A purpose-built sound presentation system and established measurement techniques will provide reliable and precise measures of binaural hearing.

40|$|Background:-Most {{students}} with deafness have some difficulty with academic achievement, especially with reading and mathematics. However, {{the range of}} intelligence levels of {{students with}} deafness does not differ from the range in their hearing counterparts. Academic performance must not be equated with intelligence. Most children who are deaf have normal intellectual capacity {{and it has been}} repeatedly demonstrated that their scores on non-verbal intelligence tests are approximately the same as those of the general population. Deafness imposes no limitations on the cognitive capabilities of individuals. The problems that deaf students often experience in academics and adjustment may be largely attributed to a bad fit between their perceptual abilities and the demands of spoken and written English.

40|$|Noise {{exposure}} {{leads to}} pathophysiological changes within the cochlear {{and the central}} components of hearing. <b>Deafness</b> <b>acquired</b> via acoustic overstimulation is often treated with hearing aids that amplify up to 115 dB SPL. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to answer the following question: what effects do high sound pressure levels have on a central auditory pathway that had been exposed to a single noise trauma before? Our group discovered recently that a single noise trauma leads to a significant cell loss in the entire central auditory pathway. Apoptosis may play an important role as one of the underlying mechanisms. Little is known about how a second noise trauma influences apoptosis in the key structures of hearing. Mice were sound exposed (5 - 20 kHz, 115 dB SPL for 3 h) under anesthesia and investigated two weeks after the first trauma. One group was exposed to the same trauma a second time (7 days after the first trauma) and was compared to the single noise trauma group. Auditory Brainstem Recordings (ABR) were performed to measure the hearing loss. A significant threshold shift was found at 8 kHz, 12 kHz and 20 kHz, while the differences at 4 kHz and 16 kHz were not significant. Apoptosis was detected by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL staining). The staining was captured with a digital camera under a light microscope. TUNEL positive cells were counted manually in standardized grids in the ventral and dorsal cochlear nucleus (VCN and DCN), in {{the central part of the}} Inferior Colliculus (ICC), in the dorsal, ventral and medial subdivisions of the medial geniculate body (dMGB, vMGB and mMGB), as well as in the 6 histological layers of the primary auditory Cortex (AI). There was no significant difference of TUNEL positive cells between the single-trauma and double-trauma group in the basal structures (VCN, DCN and ICC). Significantly more TUNEL-positive cells were counted in all subdivisions of the MGB (dMGB, vMGB and mMGB), as well as in layers I and III of the AI. No significant differences were found in the other layers of the AI. These results show for the first time the influence of noise exposure on apoptosis in the central auditory pathway of animals that had suffered from noise-induced hearing loss before. On the basis of these findings the treatment with hearing aids in patients with noise-induced hearing loss should be reevaluated...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Otosclerosis {{is one of}} the commonest non infective {{causes of}} <b>acquired</b> <b>deafness</b> in adults’. ‘Otosclerosis’ {{literally}} means hardening of the ear. It is a primary and exclusive disease of otic capsule of human temporal bone. Otosclerosis is characterised by alternate phases of bone resorption and formation. If the location of bony changes produces evident clinical manifestations term “C linical Otosclerosis” is used. If bony changes are not translated into clinical manifestations, the term used is “histologica l Otosclerosis”. Antonio Valsalva in 1735 gave first description of ankylosis of stapes to margins of oval window. Von Troltsch in 1881 coined the term ‘Otosclerosis’. Politzer in 1893 first described Otosclerosis as a primary disease of otic capsule. Alth ough the clinical course of the disease is well documented, its aetiology remains unclear; thus, multiple theories are available. But none of them has established a definite cause. Otosclerosis usually manifests as a progressive conductive or mixed hearing loss occurring clinically to varying degrees in 0. 5...|$|E

Diagnostic delay occurs even though half the children who have impaired hearing are known to be at increased risk. A plea is made for the setting up of a register of infants known to be at risk for impaired hearing. First-contact physicians should be alert to the possibility of hearing problems, particularly in children at high risk. Screening methods for use by nonspecialist practitioners are outlined...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the speech perception performance {{of children with}} a cochlear implant (CI) after 3 and 4 years of follow-up and to study the influence of age at implantation, duration of deafness and communication mode on the variability in speech perception performance. STUDY DESIGN: A broad battery of speech perception tests was administered to 67 children with a CI. The results were reduced into one measure: the 'equivalent hearing loss (EHL) '. This outcome measure refers {{to the performance of}} a reference group of severely and profoundly hearing impaired children with conventional hearing aids. PARTICIPANTS: The population comprised 35 congenitally, 17 pre-lingually and 15 post-lingually deaf children implanted between 1989 and 1999. The population was homogeneous with respect to cognition, residual hearing and support at home as a result of conservative inclusion criteria. RESULTS: During the first 2 years after implantation, post-lingually deaf children showed the fastest rate of improvement in speech perception. After 3 years of implant use, the early implanted pre-lingually deaf children and congenitally deaf children implanted under the age of 6 years caught up with the post-lingually deaf children. Pre-lingually deaf children implanted after a relatively long-duration of deafness tended to show poorer performance than those with a shorter duration. Performance of congenitally deaf children implanted after the age of 6 years was poorer and progress was slower. In the congenitally deaf children, 36 % of the variability in performance was explained by duration of deafness, whereas in the children with pre- and post-lingually <b>acquired</b> <b>deafness,</b> communication mode explained 69 % of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: All children derived benefit from their CI for speech perception tasks, but performance varied greatly. Several children reached EHL levels around 70 dB; their speech perception was equal to that of a child with conventional hearing aids who has 70 dB HL. After early implantation, the levels of performance that were eventually achieved differed no more than 10 dB, irrespective of whether the onset of deafness was pre-lingual or postlingual. In congenitally deaf children, duration of deafness {{played a major role in}} speech perception performance, whereas in the children with pre-lingually and post-lingually <b>acquired</b> <b>deafness</b> together, mode of communication was a major factor...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{conducted}} in mammals and humans have shown that multisensory processing may be impaired following congenital sensory loss and in particular if no experience is achieved within specific early developmental time windows known as sensitive periods.

To this aim, we tested congenitally and late deaf cochlear implant (CI) recipients, age-matched with two groups of hearing controls, on an audio-tactile redundancy paradigm, in which reaction times to unimodal and crossmodal redundant signals were measured. Our results showed that both congenitally and late deaf CI recipients were able to integrate audio-tactile stimuli, suggesting that congenital and <b>acquired</b> <b>deafness</b> does not prevent the development and recovery of basic multisensory processing. However, we found that congenitally deaf CI recipients had a lower multisensory gain compared to their matched controls, which may be explained by their faster responses to tactile stimuli.

40|$|DSM-IV), and hyperkinetic {{syndrome}} (ICD- 10) are com-mon and disabling. However, {{a number}} of factors in deaf chil-dren's development make the assessment of these disorders in deaf children problematic The prevalence of ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder {{does not appear to be}} higher than ex-pected in children with inherited deafness alone but does ap-pear to be higher in children with <b>acquired</b> <b>deafness</b> and/or additional impairments. Data from a re-analysis of an earlier epidemiological study of psychiatric disorder in deaf children and adolescents suggests that these disorders are commoner than expected in deaf children and share the features of ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder seen in hearing children. Disorders of overactivity and inattention in children are common and can be disabling (Sandberg, 1996). Their etiology is likely to be multifactorial (Sandberg, 1996); biological, psychological, and social factors all playing important parts in their genesis. Other disor-ders, such as mood and anxiety disorders, can present with similar symptoms (e. g., restlessness and inatten-tion), which require very different management. Differentiating between these different disorders de-pends, in large part, on obtaining an accurate ac-count of the child's personal experience of troubling symptoms. Deaf children experience the same range of psychi-atric and psychological disorders as hearing childre...|$|E
40|$|Hearing {{impairment}} is the commonest sensory disorder worldwide 1. Deafness in a {{child may}} be congenital or acquired. Congenital deafness is mostly sensorineural and has an incidence of 1 - 1. 5 per 1000 children 2. <b>Acquired</b> <b>deafness</b> is mostly conductive and is commonly due to glue ear or otitis media with effusion (OME). Up to 30 % of preschool children can have OME especially in cold climates 2. Causes of hearing impairment in childhood Relative contribution of genetic and environmental causes to hearing impairment is determined by factors such as consanguinity, infection control, immunization and provision of antenatal/perinatal care in a given society 1. In the developed world approximately 50 % of childhood deafness is caused by genetic factors. About 30 % of genetic deafness {{is said to be}} syndromic i. e. deafness is part of a known syndrome. 75 - 80 % with non-syndromic genetic hearing loss have an autosomal recessive cause. 10 - 15 % have an autosomal dominant aetiology and the rest are caused by X-linked, mitochondrial or chromosomal causes 1. Non-genetic causes of early-onset deafness are listed in table 1. Post-meningitic deafness is mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and antibiotic treatment delayed for even 24 hours is a well recognized risk factor for developing hearing loss 3...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{superior}} temporal sulcus (STS) {{is specifically}} involved in processing the human voice. Profound <b>acquired</b> <b>deafness</b> by post-meningitis ossified cochlea and by bilateral vestibular schwannoma in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients are two indications for auditory brainstem implantation (ABI). In order to objectively measure the cortical voice processing {{of a group}} of ABI patients, we studied the activation of the human temporal voice areas (TVA) by PET H(2) (15) O, performed in a group of implanted deaf adults (n= 7) with more than two years of auditory brainstem implant experience, with an intelligibility score average of 17 %+/- 17 [mean+/-SD]. Relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in the three following conditions: during silence, while passive listening to human voice, and to non-voice stimuli. Compared to silence, the activations induced by voice and non-voice stimuli were bilaterally located in the superior temporal regions. However, compared to non-voice stimuli, the voice stimuli did not induce specific supplementary activation of the TVA along the STS. The comparison of ABI group with a normal-hearing controls group (n= 7) showed that TVA activations were significantly enhanced among controls group. ABI allowed the transmission of sound stimuli to temporal brain regions but lacked transmitting the specific cues of the human voice to the TVA. Moreover, among groups, during silent condition, brain visual regions showed higher rCBF in ABI group, although temporal brain regions had higher rCBF in the controls group. ABI patients had consequently developed enhanced visual strategies to keep interacting with their environment...|$|E
