Consequently, calcifuges grown on alkaline soils often develop the symptoms of iron deficiency, i.e. interveinal chlorosis of new growth. There are many horticultural plants which are calcifuges, most of which require an 'ericaceous' compost with a low pH, composed principally of Sphagnum moss peat.|$|E
5000|$|Silicate filming, etching, and {{accelerated}} crack corrosion: This film starts as an iridescence or [...] "oil-film" [...] effect on glassware, and progresses into a [...] "milky" [...] or [...] "cloudy" [...] appearance (which {{is not a}} deposit) that cannot be polished off or removed like limescale. It is formed because the detergent is strongly <b>alkaline</b> (<b>basic)</b> and glass dissolves slowly in alkaline aqueous solution. It becomes less soluble {{in the presence of}} silicates in the water (added as anti-metal-corrosion agents in the dishwasher detergent). Since the cloudy appearance is due to nonuniform glass dissolution, it is (somewhat paradoxically) less marked if dissolution is higher, i.e. if a silicate-free detergent is used; also, in certain cases, the etching will primarily be seen in areas that have microscopic surface cracks {{as a result of the}} items' manufacturing. Limitation of this undesirable reaction is possible by controlling water hardness, detergent load and temperature. The type of glass is an important factor in determining if this effect is a problem. Some dishwashers can reduce this etching effect by automatically dispensing the correct amount of detergent throughout the wash cycle based on the level of water hardness programmed.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The glassy residua from an alkali olivine-basalt and a nepheline-basanite are {{respectively}} alkali trachytic and phonolitic {{in composition}} and contrast strongly with the compositions ofthe host rocks. The {{analysis of the}} glass from the alkali olivine-basalt reveals appreciable normative corundum, which is considered {{a consequence of the}} crystallization f excessive diopsidic linopyroxene. This results in a deficiency in lime relative to alumina during the crystallization f much of the plagioclase. A consideration ofthe compositions ofthe glasses and the salic differen-tiates from <b>alkaline</b> <b>basic</b> intrusions indicates that the development of either trachyte or phonolite depends on differing degrees of undersaturation of the parental basic magmas. T HE chemistries of the intersertal glasses in igneous rocks are of particular importance in petrogenesis for they provide the best indi-cations of the compositions of liquid residua. Vincent (1950), Walker, Vincent, and Mitchell (1952), and Elliot (1956) have presented chemical data on glasses from tholeiites. However, hypocrystalline <b>alkaline</b> <b>basic</b> rocks have usually been discussed from a petrographic standpoint only. This study deals principally with the chemistry of the glasses in two alkali basic lavas (an alkali olivine-basalt and a nepheline-basanite) from the Central Volcanic Province of north-eastern New South Wales. This Province is developed mainly on the New England Tableland, where it extends as a belt from south of Armidale north to Glen Innes and west to the Inverell area. The available data indicate that the most common lava is alkali olivine-basalt. The associated volcanic rocks include nepheline-basanites and olivine-nephelinites, analcime-basanites and olivine-analcinfites, and ankaramitic types (Wilkinson, 1966). Tholeiitic lavas also occur in the Invere]l area. The Central Province is a major alkali olivine-basalt province in a continental setting, the volcanic rocks out-cropping over an area greater than 2000 square miles. The analcime-basalt (olivine-analcimite) from Spring Mount, west of Glen Innes (Wilkinson, 1962), is lower Oligocene. This age determination is based o...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{trachyte}} plug near Jos {{contains a}} suite of inclusions, commonly rounded and of large size, including olivine nodules, pyroxenites, {{and a variety of}} basic to intermediate plutonic rocks, as well as albite megacrysts. The olivine nodules are typical of those found elsewhere in <b>alkaline</b> <b>basic</b> lavas and widely in-terpreted as upper mantle fragments. Most of the other inclusions contain evidence of crystallization at high pressures, even the syenites, which are interpreted as plutonic equivalents of the trachyte; for the feldspar in them is sanidine-microperthite. Discovery of this inclusion assemblage in a trachyte provides further support for the thesis that alkaline salic lavas can be generated at sub-crustal depths, by partial melting beneath domically uplifted continental shield areas (Bailey, I 964). The Nigerian Cenozoic volcanic province lies in an area of regional uplift, and is characterized by scattered small volcanic entres rather than by major eruptive foci. High pressure inclusions are being found at an increasing proportion of these centres, suggesting that the magmas rose directly and rapidly to the surface from the upper mantle levels at which they were all (including the trachyte) generated...|$|E

The intrusion includes foid gabbros at the margins and foid monzodiorites towards the center. The foid monzodiorites are considered as the evolved melts after the fractional crystallization mostly of olivine and clinopyroxene from a foid gabbro parental magma. Based on mass balance calculation {{the evolution of the}} Kamarbon alkaline gabbro could be explained by 19. 2 % fractionation of clinopyroxene, 13. 8 % of olivine, 3 % of plagioclase and 1. 0 % Ti-Magnetite, with 63 % of residual liquid. REE inversion modeling indicates that the Kamarbon intrusion magma was generated by low degrees (< 3 %) of partial melting from a garnet-bearing mantle source. In primitive mantle-normalized incompatible element diagrams, the Kamarbon rocks show enrichment in LILE elements (Ba, Rb, Sr and Th), HFSE elements (Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr and Hf) and P and depletion in K, Y and HREE (Yb, Lu) which are similar to patterns of HIMU-OIBs or intraplate alkaline magmas. According to the existence of extensional phases and occurrence of different rifting during late Triassic to middle Jurassic in Central Alborz, the formation of Kamarbon intrusion could be related to an intracontinental rifting...|$|E
40|$|The Shiant Isles Main Sill, of Tertiary age, is {{a classic}} example of a composite, {{differentiated}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>basic</b> sill. The first unit to be intruded was a 2 m thick olivine teschenite which was emplaced with phenocrysts of olivine (rag> 83) [rag = Mg#] and, perhaps, plagioclase. This was intruded by a 24 m thick picrite sill consisting of a mush of melt and suspended olivine phenocrysts (rag> 83) with a D-shaped modal profile. The 140 m thick picrodolerite-crinanite unit was formed by a magma carrying ~ 10 % olivine (rag> 83) as the main phenocryst phase, together with some calcic plagioclase phenocrysts, being emplaced into the top of the picrite unit before the host rock was completely solidified. The olivine phenocrysts settled towards the bottom to form the picrodolerites. In-situ differentiation processes occurred under conditions of almost perfect fractional crystallization, during which very strongly zoned ophitic crystals of olivine (fayalitic rims) and clinopyroxene (hedenbergitic rims), and zoned laths of plagioclase (anorthoclase rims), formed. The last unit consists of ~ 2 m of granular olivine picrodolerite which was intruded into the upper crinanites, again before the host rock was fully solid. The mineral zoning patterns are interpreted using published cation diffusion coefficient data, and used to show that the picrite unit might have cooled to the blocking temperatures for Mg and Fe diffusion in < 5 years...|$|E

40|$|Mantle-derived xenoliths {{from the}} Marsabit shield volcano (eastern {{flank of the}} Kenya rift) include porphyroclastic spinel peridotites {{characterized}} by variable styles of metasomatism. The petrography of the xenoliths indicates a transition from primary clinopyroxene-bearing cryptically metasomatized harzburgite (light rare earth element, U, and Th enrichment in clinopyroxene) to modally metasomatized clinopyroxene-free harzburgite and dunite. The metasomatic phases include amphibole (low-Ti Mg-katophorite), Na-rich phlogopite, apatite, graphite and metasomatic low-Al orthopyroxene. Transitional samples show that metasomatism led to replacement of clinopyroxene by amphibole. In all modally metasomatized xenoliths melt pockets (silicate glass containing silicate and oxide micro-phenocrysts, carbonates and empty vugs) occur in close textural relationship with the earlier metasomatic phases. The petrography, major and trace element data, together with constraints from thermobarometry and fO 2 calculations, indicate that the cryptic and modal metasomatism {{are the result of}} a single event of interaction between peridotite and an orthopyroxene-saturated volatile-rich silicate melt. The unusual style of metasomatism (composition of amphibole, presence of graphite, formation of orthopyroxene) reflects low P â€“T conditions (~ 850 â€“ 1000 Â°C at 2. The inferred melt was possibly derived from <b>alkaline</b> <b>basic</b> melts by meltâ€“rock reaction during the development of the Tertiaryâ€“Quaternary Kenya rift.

They range in bulk rock composition from fertile spinel-lherzolites to residual spinel-harzburgites. The Sr-Nd isotope and trace element composition of clinopyroxene mineral separates varies between LREE-depleted samples with Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 as low as 0. 70262 and Nd- 143 /Nd- 144 up to 0. 51323 and LREE-enriched samples with Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 up to 0. 70461 and Nd- 143 /Nd- 144 down to 0. 51252. The available data suggest that all the studied peridotite samples suffered variable degrees of partial melting during Pre-Mesozoic times (based on Nd model ages relative to CHUR and DMM). The overprinted enrichment is related to a subsequent metasomatism, induced by fluids rising through the lithosphere that preferentially percolated the originally most depleted domains. Despite the occurrence of orogenic volcanism in the area, preferential enrichment in elements typically associated with slab derived fluids/melts (K, Rb, Sr, Th) relative to LREE has not been detected, and metasomatism {{seems to be more}} likely related to the infiltration of highly <b>alkaline</b> <b>basic</b> melts characterised by an EM-like Sr-Nd isotopic composition.
