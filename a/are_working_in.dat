Of course they do." [...] Myles believes that in series four, Gwen and Jack have a [...] "love-hate-love relationship" [...] resembling in different ways a sibling relationship, a marital relationship and also [...] "the strongest friendship". Episode seven of Miracle Day features a scene where Jack threatens Gwen with violence after she states she would have him killed to save her daughter. Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters have different needs and that this means they inevitably [...] "clash like steel blades".

500|$|Nookie in New York, the TV {{show that}} Marge watches with her sisters, spoofs the TV series Sex and the City.

In the video that Homer recorded for Marge, Homer holds two toys. The one {{in his left hand}} is a [...] "Funzo", a fictional toy which first appeared in the season 11 episode [...] "Grift of the Magi". The fictional area of [...] "West Springfield" [...] is modeled after the American state Texas (purposely once again a red-herring to where Springfield is based - it seems to be right next to Texas, until Lisa states that West Springfield is [...] "Three times the size of Texas"). The scene in which Homer and Lenny are travelling to West Springfield is a reference to the last scene in the 1969 drama film Midnight Cowboy. The music heard during the scene is also made to resemble the theme from said film. The scene in which Homer and Lenny <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> an oil rig is a reference to the 1970 film Five Easy Pieces. The song produced by Artie's invention {{at the end of the}} episode is Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), originally by The Eurythmics.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{political}} pressures, it is suggested by Susan Himmelweit {{is the issue of}} whom to empower. When there are considerations of policies, politicians usually only consider work as paid labor, and do {{not take into account the}} interdependence between unpaid work and paid work. It is also often common to think that women make economic decisions similarly to men. This is typically not the case, because for men, payment is simply a compensation for lost leisure time. However, for women, when they <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> the paid sector, they are still losing money because they have to make provisions for the domestic labor they are unable to do, such as caring for children or making dinner from scratch due to lack of resources such as child care. Her net financial gain is less than the financial gain of a man because she has to spend her earnings on providing for these provisions. In addition, increasing paid work hours in order to have more money may have negative effects on the woman due to the increased total work hours and decreased leisure time. [...] Therefore, policies that give greater power to people who do paid labor, such as cutting back on public expenditure in order to lessen income taxes have an adverse effect on female employment and the effect that the double burden has on females. Such policies give greater power and consideration towards people who work in the paid sector, and less towards people who work in the unpaid sector.|$|E
