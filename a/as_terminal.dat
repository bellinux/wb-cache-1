5|$|Construction {{started in}} February 1962 and cost NOK3.2 million. The runway was {{completed}} {{by the fall of}} that year, but other parts of the construction were delayed. By late April 1963, the airport was lacking fire fighting equipment and ground crew had still not received sufficient training. However, the issues were resolved, allowing the airport to open on schedule on 4 May 1963. Lakselv and Kirkenes Airport also opened the same day, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Several important facilities were missing from Alta Airport when it opened; the control tower and the passenger terminal were not completed until 1964, so at first a shed was used <b>as</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be <b>as</b> <b>terminal</b> sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{defeated}} bowel {{cancer in}} 1992, a malignant melanoma in 1995, and a tumour {{in his right}} lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially paralysed due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and also with a partially prosthetic upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed <b>as</b> <b>terminal</b> in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts of chemotherapy. After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining {{years of his life}} to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. By November 2008, the Foundation had raised £1million. The money raised by the Foundation funded equipment for the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre, in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, and would go on to fund other cancer projects in the North East of England.|$|E

5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known <b>as</b> <b>terminal</b> sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E

50|$|Ironically, NCs {{ended up}} being used as the very 'dumb terminals' they were {{intended}} to replace, as the proprietary backend infrastructure is not readily available. 1990s era NCs are often network-booted into a minimal Unix with X, to serve <b>as</b> X <b>terminal.</b> While NC purists may consider {{this to be a}} suboptimal use of NC hardware, the NCs work well <b>as</b> <b>terminals,</b> and are considerably cheaper than purpose-built terminal hardware.|$|R

25|$|In many {{healthcare}} systems, prolonged ventilation as part {{of intensive}} care is a limited resource (in {{that there are only}} so many patients that can receive care at any given moment). It is used to support a single failing organ system (the lungs) and cannot reverse any underlying disease process (such <b>as</b> <b>terminal</b> cancer). For this reason, there can be (occasionally difficult) decisions to be made about whether it is suitable to commence someone on mechanical ventilation. Equally many ethical issues surround the decision to discontinue mechanical ventilation.|$|E
25|$|The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP) was a UK {{care pathway}} (excluding Wales) {{covering}} palliative care options for {{patients in the}} final days or hours of life. It was developed to help doctors and nurses provide quality end-of-life care. Now discredited, the LCP was widely abused as a 'tick box exercise', with patients being casually assessed <b>as</b> <b>terminal,</b> heavily sedated, and denied water so the diagnosis became self-fulfilling. Hospitals were also provided cash incentives to achieve targets for the number of patients killed on the LCP.|$|E

40|$|Optimal cell {{yield of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown under denitrifying {{conditions}} was obtained with 100 mM nitrate <b>as</b> the <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor, {{irrespective of the}} medium used. Nitrite <b>as</b> the <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor supported poor denitrifying growth when concentrations of less than 15 mM, but not higher, were used, apparently owing to toxicity exerted by nitrite. Nitrite accumulated in the medium during early exponential phase when nitrate was the terminal electron acceptor and then decreased to extinction before midexponential phase. The maximal rate of glucose and gluconate transport was supported by 1 mM nitrate or nitrite <b>as</b> the <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions. The transport rate was greater with nitrate than with nitrite <b>as</b> the <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor, but the greatest transport rate was observed under aerobic conditions with oxygen <b>as</b> the <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor. When P. aeruginosa was inoculated into a denitrifying environment, nitrate reductase was detected after 3 h of incubation, nitrite reductase was detected after another 4 h of incubation, and maximal nitrate and nitrite reductase activities peaked together during midexponential phase. The latter coincided with maximal glucose transport activity...|$|R

25|$|The {{advent of}} {{wide-body}} aircraft posed {{opportunities and challenges}} for aviation. In 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of two new Boeing 747 aircraft; the first one arrived in March and, shortly afterwards, performed a flyover above O'Connell Street in Dublin on Saint Patrick's Day; a third Boeing 747 was delivered later that decade. To cope with this, a new £10 million passenger terminal capable of handling six million passengers per year, which became known <b>as</b> <b>Terminal</b> 1, was opened in June 1972. The growth which was anticipated at Dublin's airport (and provided for through heavy investment by the airport and Aer Lingus) during the 1970s did not materialise immediately.|$|E
25|$|Remote Desktop Services (RDS), known <b>as</b> <b>Terminal</b> Services in Windows Server 2008 and earlier, {{is one of}} the {{components}} of Microsoft Windows that allows a user to take control of a remote computer or virtual machine over a network connection. RDS is Microsoft's implementation of thin client, where Windows software, and the entire desktop of the computer running RDS, are made accessible to a remote client machine that supports Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With RDS, only software user interfaces are transferred to the client system. All input from the client system is transmitted to the server, where software execution takes place. This is in contrast to application streaming systems, like Microsoft App-V, in which computer programs are streamed to the client on-demand and executed on the client machine.|$|E
