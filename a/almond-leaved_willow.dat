It is found from southeastern England east to Lake Baikal, and south to Spain and the Mediterranean east to the Caucasus, and the Alborz Mountains. It usually grows in {{riparian}} habitats, on river and stream banks, and in wetlands.|$|E

It has been shown, that two existing conceptions of species (E. Mayer and Erlich - Raven) reflect the extreme cases of the real spectre of situations. The values of the interpopulation streams of genes of the four species of plants in Podmoscowie, including those three to be protected. The conclusions about the degree of insulation {{and the influence of}} populations on each other have been made. The method of determination of the plants populations insulation degree is being introduced in practiceAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the natural {{populations of the}} <b>almond-leaved</b> and gray-leaved <b>willows</b> on the {{territory}} of the Desninsky Polesje. The purpose of the work: to establish the main laws of the intrapopulation variation of the <b>almond-leaved</b> and gray-leaved <b>willows.</b> The new type of the meiosis of the plants has been described, the high level of the aneuploidy in the populations has been established; the correlative-combination quazicontinuous character of the variation of the vegetative organs and the length of the pollen grains has been revealed. The method of revealation of the aneuploidy has been developed with the aid of the palinometric analysis; the dependence of the pollen grains dimensions on the conditions of inhabitation has been established.
