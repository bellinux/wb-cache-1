50|$|When an {{aircraft}} slows to below its stall speed, it {{is unable to}} generate enough lift in order to cancel out the forces that act on the aircraft (such as weight and centripetal force). This will cause the aircraft to drop in altitude. The drop in altitude may cause the pilot to increase the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack (the pilot pulls on the stick), because normally increasing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack (<b>pulling</b> up) puts the aircraft in a climb. When the wing however exceeds its critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, an increase in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack (<b>pulling</b> up) {{will lead to a}} loss of lift and a further loss of airspeed (the wing stalls). The reason why the wing stalls when it exceeds its critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack is that the airflow {{over the top of the}} wing separates.|$|R

5000|$|Lowering a concentrated, {{heavy weight}} down the anchor line - rope or chain - {{directly}} in front of the bow to the seabed behaves like a heavy chain rode and lowers the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> on the anchor. If the weight is suspended off the seabed it acts as a spring or shock absorber to dampen the sudden actions that are normally transmitted to the anchor and can cause it to dislodge and drag.

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} effect of the {{insertion}} angle and the angle of applied load on the pullout strength of screw-in suture anchors. Methods Screw-in metallic suture anchors were inserted into a 10 –lb/cu ft synthetic cancellous bone block at 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 90 ° to the surface. The suture pull angle was then varied in 30 ° increments between 0 ° and 180 °. Five constructs were tested to failure (anchor pullout) for each combination of angles using a Zwick tensile testing machine (Zwick Roell, Ulm, Germany). Results There were a total of 25 combinations. The greatest pullout strength was seen with a suture anchor inserted at 90 ° to the bone block with a pull angle of 90 ° to the bone (mean, 306 N; standard deviation [SD], 9 N). The weakest pullout strength was seen with a suture anchor inserted at 30 ° with the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> at 120 ° (i. e., opposite to the direction of insertion of the anchor) (mean, 97 N; SD, 11 N). A simulated deadman's angle of 45 ° with an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> of 150 ° produced a pullout strength of 127 N (SD, 4 N). The pullout strengths for each insertion angle were greatest when the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> was similar to the angle of insertion (P <. 0001, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Conclusions The angle of applied load to a suture anchor and the insertion angle significantly influence the biomechanical pullout strength of screw-in suture anchors. The insertion angle of the suture anchor should replicate the angle of applied load to ensure the optimum pullout strength...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the loads acting on the lumbar spine when traction therapy was given in the Fowler's position. The study had two parts: a theoretical analysis which showed that traction produced a flexion moment on the spine as well as axial distraction; and an experimental study which measured the flexion moment induced by the adoption of the Fowler's position. The Fowler's position is clinically essential in that it flexes the spine and takes up the slack of the posterior tissues before the traction force is applied. Hence the axial tension and flexion moment generated by the traction force are more effective in stretching the posterior tissues. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> on the traction harness influences the friction between the body and the couch. However, this consideration is not necessary if a split traction table is used. The mechanical effects of traction are compared with those produced by postero-anterior mobilisation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effectiveness of adding a buckling initiator which is used to reduce the initial peak force of a thin-walled circular tube under axial impact loadings. The buckling initiator is installed near the impact end of the circular tube and is composed of a pre-hit column along the axis of the tube and several pulling strips uniformly distributed around the top edge of the tube. This device functions just before the impact happens and does not affect the structural stiffness under its normal working conditions. By using two kinds of aluminum-alloy circular tubes, a series of quasi-static compression tests were conducted. The deformation mode, the initial peak force and the mean crushing force of the tubes with different number <b>of</b> <b>pulling</b> strips N, pre-hit height It and inclined <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pulling</b> strips theta(0) were studied in the experiments. The results reveal that by using this buckling initiator, the large progressive deformation of the axially crushed circular tube switches from ring mode or mixed mode to diamond mode. Although specimens with N = 2, 3 and 4 were tested, the stable deformation tended to diamond mode with lobe number N = 3. With suitable selection of pre-hit height It, the initial peak force could be reduced by more than 30 %. In addition, a simplified theoretical analysis is conducted to illustrate the reduction of the initial force as well as the energy dissipation mechanisms, leading to good agreements with the experimental results.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of myofibril growth proliferation were investigated {{in the red}} and white muscles of fish. In both types of muscle the ratio of lattice filament spacings between the Z disk and M line {{was found to be}} greater than that required for perfect transformation of a square into a hexagonal lattice. This mismatch was considered to result in the thin filaments being pulled obliquely instead of at right angles to the Z disk. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> of the thin filaments was measured in longitudinal sections. The splitting process was found to decrease the degree of pull. Splitting was also observed in transverse sections of the peripheral myofibrils. In both red and white fibres these myofibrils were found to commence splitting when they reached a size of approximately i- 2 /im diameter. Evidence from ultrastructural and autoradiographical studies suggested that growth of the myofibrils within the fibres is centrifugal. The outermost myofibrils appear to be the ones which are being built up and which split. The data indicated that in fish muscle a considerable number of filaments may be added to the daughter regions whilst splitting of the myofibril is still continuing...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{conventional}} knowledge {{for as long}} as ships have existed that the catenary effect of an anchor line augments the efficiency of an anchoring system. This is achieved by making the anchor line as heavy as possible thus lowering the effective <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> on the anchor. This notion has, however, come under criticism in recent times. Many small boat owners have shifted to lighter tauter lines for anchoring. The argument in favor of this new method is the cost savings associated with lighter anchoring and the tension relief that comes with using lighter and more elastic anchor lines. The {{purpose of this study is}} to therefore compare the performance of long slack lines that form catenary shapes with that of shorter taut lines. An analysis is presented that describes the surge motion of a small anchored boat exposed to an input forcing function and various retarding forces and effects. The anchoring system used in the analytical model results in a non-linear but symmetrical restoring force, which resists the force-induced motion of the boat. Two main types of anchor lines are considered: uniform-material and two-material anchor lines. Each anchor line is evaluated both in catenary configuration and taut configuration in terms of its ability to minimize the motions of the boat and tension force in the anchor line due to wind disturbances. by Jessy Mbagara Mwarage.

40|$|Background: The optimal {{method of}} {{replacement}} of the posterior cruciate ligament with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft is not known. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the mechanical responses to cyclic loading tests of bone-patellar ten-don-bone allograft replacements fixed to the tibia with one of two methods: a tibial tunnel or a tibial inlay technique. Methods: The proximal ends of sixty-two posterior cruciate graft replacements, thirty-one fixed with the tibial tunnel technique and thirty-one fixed with the tibial inlay technique in cadaver knees, were subjected to 2000 cycles of tensile force of 50 to 300 N with the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> at 45 ° to the tibial plateau. The central 10 mm of the medial and lateral halves of previously fresh-frozen bone-patellar tendon-bone preparations from cadaver knees were used as the grafts. Two pairs of tibiae were used for testing; the two types of fixation and the medial and lateral halves of the patellar tendons were distributed between the tibial pairs. Graft thickness was measured at the point of highest anticipated tissue deformation and at two additional lo-cations at distances from these points. The total change in graft length after cyclic loading at an applied force level of 200 N was recorded. Elongation of the graft during loading cycles between 20 and 200 N of applied tensile force was also mea-sured. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare all measurements between the inlay and tunnel tech-niques, and between the medial and lateral halves of the graft used for the inlay method. Results: Ten of the thirty-one grafts that had been passed through a tibial tunnel failed at the acute angle before 2000 cycles of testing could be completed; all thirty-one grafts that had been fixed to the tibia with use of the inlay method survived th...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{residual}} laxity after transtibial posterior {{cruciate ligament}} (PCL) reconstruction has been reported by several authors. The sharp angle where the graft exits the tibial tunnel, which is known as “killer turn”, {{is believed to be}} the main reason. The purpose of this study was to reveal the mechanism of “killer turn” and its effect on both graft and tunnel inlet. MethodsA total of 60 New Zealand white rabbits were included. All transtibial PCL reconstructions were performed in vitro using Achilles tendon autograft. The cyclic loading tests were conducted when reconstructed knees were subjected to 1500 cycles of tensile force of 50  N with the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>pull</b> at 45 ° to the tibial plateau. The tunnel inlet enlargement, graft elongation, stiffness, graft displacement, load to failure, and failure site were all recorded and analysed. ResultsFifty-eight New Zealand white rabbits were available for biomechanical evaluation. The subjects had significant graft elongation and tunnel enlargement. The graft displacement increased by a mean of 0. 92 ± 0. 36  mm (16. 70 %). At the 1500 th cycle, the grafts were significantly elongated by 5. 59 ± 4. 98 %, and the tunnel inlet diameter was also significantly enlarged by 12. 08 ± 4. 31 %. There was a linear correlation between total graft displacement and the two variables (R 2 = 0. 402, F= 18. 515, p< 0. 001). The coefficient for tunnel inlet enlargement was 0. 419 (p= 0. 006), and for graft elongation was 0. 583 (p= 0. 002). At the load-to-failure test, the failure load was 81. 19 ± 20. 13  N. Of the 58 grafts, 31 (53. 45 %) failed at the “killer turn”, 13 (22. 41 %) for the para-tunnel fracture, seven (12. 07 %) for the graft pull-out, and the remaining seven (12. 07 %) for the rupture at the mounting site. ConclusionThe mechanism of “killer turn” compromising posterior stability was that the repetitive friction between graft and tunnel inlet not only attenuated the graft, but also enlarged the tunnel inlet, leading to the displacement of the graft...|$|E
