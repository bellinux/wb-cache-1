40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This is {{the continuation of}} the development of a computer based radome design tool. Measured electric field patterns for a AGM- 88 High Speed <b>Antiradiation</b> <b>Missile</b> radome were used to validate the computer model. This computer model is based on a method of moments solution of the E-field integral equation for bodies of revolution. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} model and computer simulation are presented for a radome {{located in the}} near field of an antenna. Using the computer code described here, design tradeoffs can be performed between electrical, structural, and aerodynamic properties of the radome. The code {{is based on a}} method of moments solution to the E-field integral equation for bodies of arbitrary shape. Measured radiation patterns for AGM- 88 High Speed <b>Antiradiation</b> <b>Missile</b> (HARM) and AIM- 9 C missile radomes are compared to computed data. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|E
50|$|The AGM-122 {{was less}} capable than newer <b>antiradiation</b> <b>missiles,</b> {{such as the}} AGM-88 HARM, but also {{substantially}} cheaper, and its lighter weight enabled it to be carried by combat helicopters as well as fighter aircraft and fighter bombers.|$|R
5000|$|... 10 May 1972: Operation Linebacker {{operations}} {{began and}} involved concentrated {{air strikes against}} targets in North Vietnam above the 20th parallel north. During these operations VA-52’s aircraft flew armed reconnaissance, Alpha strikes (large coordinated attacks), mine seeding operations, tanker operations, and standard arm sorties (use of <b>antiradiation</b> <b>missiles</b> to destroy missile radar sites).|$|R
25|$|The {{first test}} firing of the Brazo missile was {{conducted}} in April 1974, with the missile, launched from a USAF F-4D Phantom II, successfully shooting down a BQM-34 Firebee drone; four follow-up tests over the following year continued the missile's successful record, {{with none of the}} test shots failing despite difficult test conditions. However, despite the Brazo's success, the follow-on ERASE (Electro-magnetic RAdiation Source Elimination) project was cancelled, and no air-to-air <b>antiradiation</b> <b>missiles</b> would enter service in the West.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Recent year’s {{electromagnetic}} (EM) {{devices are}} used {{more frequently in}} a network by military as well as civilian applications for communications, navigation, sensing and data storage. This trend leads to an increasing use of EM devices which {{may result in a}} complex operation in the future. It creates electronic warfare and disturbances. (iv) Offensive EA activities such as jamming an adversary’s radar or command and control systems, using <b>antiradiation</b> <b>missiles</b> to suppress an adversary’s air defenses, using electronic deception techniques to confuse an enemy. II. BASIC PRINCIPLE This process can be prevented by imposing a protective layer around the EM devices. A plastic shielding consisting of MEMS can provide lightweight shielding material for EM radiations. This is a matter of much concern to the military which is developing a highly digitized battlefield for command, control and communication. This shielding will be useful {{for a wide range of}} electronic equipments which are generally sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. The devices may be radio transmitters and receivers, measuring instruments and robot, cell phones, television sets and personal computers.
