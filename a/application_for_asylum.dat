Asylum seekers generally do not receive economic support. This, combined with a period where the asylum seeker is ineligible for a work permit is unique among developed countries and has been condemned from some organisations, including Human Rights Watch.|$|E

He explained that he had been asked to lose the fourth ODI on 4 November and that after hitting the winning runs he had received threats against his life and family. In April 2011, Haider withdrew his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>asylum</b> and returned to Pakistan after receiving assurances from Rehman Malik, Pakistan's interior minister, about his safety.
