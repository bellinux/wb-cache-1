5|$|The Iazyges, Quadi, Suebi and Marcomanni {{once again}} invaded Roman {{territory}} in 169. The Iazyges led an invasion into <b>Alburnum,</b> {{in an attempt}} to seize its gold mines. Marcus Claudius Fronto, a former general during the Parthian wars, then the governor of both Dacia and Upper Moesia, held them back for some time but was killed in battle in 170. The Quadi were the first to surrender, in 172. The known terms of the peace are that Marcus Aurelius installed a client king, Furtius, on their throne, and the Quadi were denied access to the Roman markets along the limes. The Marcomanni accepted a similar peace, but the name of their client-king is not known.|$|E
2500|$|Sapwood (or <b>alburnum)</b> is the younger, {{outermost}} wood; in {{the growing}} tree it is living wood, and its principal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the leaves and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, {{by the time they}} become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, [...] or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth hickory, or open-grown pines.|$|E
60|$|We do {{not learn}} much from learned books, but from true, sincere, human books, from frank and honest biographies. The {{life of a}} good man will hardly improve us more than {{the life of a}} freebooter, for the {{inevitable}} laws appear as plainly in the infringement as in the observance, and our lives are sustained by a nearly equal expense of virtue of some kind. The decaying tree, while yet it lives, demands sun, wind, and rain no less than the green one. It secretes sap and performs the functions of health. If we choose, we may study the <b>alburnum</b> only. The gnarled stump has as tender a bud as the sapling.|$|E
6000|$|The life in us is {{like the}} water in the river. It may rise this year higher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands; even this may be the eventful year, which will drown out all our muskrats. It was not always dry land where we dwell. I see far inland the banks which the stream anciently washed, before science began to record its freshets. Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of New England, of a strong and {{beautiful}} bug which came out of the dry leaf of an old table of apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer's kitchen for sixty years, first in Connecticut, and afterward in Massachusetts--from an egg deposited in the living tree many years earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it; which was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the heat of an urn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality strengthened by hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society, deposited at first in the <b>alburnum</b> of the green and living tree, which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned tomb--heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished family of man, as they sat round the festive board--may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society's most trivial and handselled furniture, to enjoy its perfect summer life at last! ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{work has}} as {{objective}} to determine {{and compare the}} variation of basic density of peroba's wood throughout the Aspidosperma polineuron, that specie belongs to Apocynaceae's family, known popularly as Peroba. The sample was carried in three selected trees at random form in dense Ombrófila¿s forest in Apiuna and President Nereus Ramos/SC. The trees were knocked and they had their changeable dendrometrics measured. The basic density was determined in samples of 1, 5 x 1, 5 x 5 cm, removed of the internal part of the record (cerne) and the external part (<b>alburnum),</b> having been these collected the height of chest (DAP), 0 %, 10 %, 50 %, 75 % and 95 % of morphologic inversion's point. Above this, two samples with branches called G 1 and G 2 were colleted. The basic density was gotten through {{the relation between the}} dry weight and the green volume of samples, revealing increasing of the base for the top of the tree. In the accomplishment of variance's performance (ANOVA) was not able to be verified significant differences between the averages of densities throughout the log and the branches. The average basic density was 0, 66 gcm 3. The uniformity found for basic density throughout the stem is a characteristic that confers the specie stability and security for its use in structural projects, however it´s necessary deeper studies to better scientific fundaments of its physical and technological properties...|$|E
