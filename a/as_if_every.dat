There was a frenzy of railway promotion in that year, and it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>every</b> locality must have its own line. The Scottish Central Railway had been described above; the Scottish Midland Junction Railway (SMJR), the Aberdeen Railway and the Dundee and Perth Railway also got their Acts {{on the same}} day.|$|E
500|$|Polly Shulman of The New York Times finds Quicksilver hard {{to follow}} and amazingly complex {{but a good}} read. However she notes that the {{complicated}} and clunky dialogue between the characters is a distraction. [...] She thinks a full appreciation {{of the work is}} only possible {{within the context of the}} remaining novels of The Baroque Cycle, and compares the novel to works by Dorothy Dunnett, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, calling it [...] "history-of-science fiction". In the post-publication review for The New York Times, Edward Rothstein remarks that the scope of the novel is at times detrimental: [...] "Unfortunately, in this novelistic cauldron it can sometimes seem as if mercury's vapors had overtaken the author himself, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>every</b> detail he had learned had to be anxiously crammed into his text, while still leaving the boundaries between fact and invention ambiguous". He considers the novel to be an [...] "experiment in progress", although the historical background is compelling.|$|E
500|$|Cuba's burgeoning tourist {{industry}} {{of the late}} 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, [...] "In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>every</b> Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's {{as if you were}} to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner." [...] The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street. Despite the appeal of the [...] "Buena Vista" [...] ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the [...] "Buena Vista Social Club" [...] than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island, such as reggaetón by luminaries such as Raul Zeballos, the creator of the genre. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.|$|E

2500|$|Goforth ministered at Yingkou (Newchwang), {{the final}} resting-place of Scottish missionary William Chalmers Burns. Burns’ impact {{was still being}} felt 40 years later among the Christian {{community}} of Yingkou. However, {{the same kind of}} repentance and prayer broke out, here as Goforth wrote: [...] "On entering the pulpit, I bowed as usual for a few moments in prayer. When I looked up it seemed to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>every</b> last man, woman and child in that church was in the throes of judgment. Tears were flowing freely, and all manner of sin was being confessed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the circle}} of her {{literary}} friends, Lokhvitskaya was surrounded by 'aura of adoration'; it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>every</b> man, according to a biographer, [...] "was a little in love with her." [...] Among them was Bunin. In a by and large grim gallery of his literary portraits (most of them crude caricatures), Lokhvitskaya {{was the only person}} whom he remembered fondly. [...] "Everything in her was charming: the sound of her voice, the liveliness of her speech, the glitter of her eye, her wonderful facetiousness. The colour of her face was exceptionally beautiful: opaque and smooth, like that of a ripe Crimean apple," [...] Bunin wrote in his memoirs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953, in {{a speech}} given in New York City, Lemkin {{described}} the Holodomor as the [...] "destruction of the Ukrainian nation" [...] and as the [...] "classic example of Soviet genocide," [...] going on {{to point out that}} [...] "the Ukrainian is not and never has been a Russian. His culture, his temperament, his language, his religion, are all different... to eliminate (Ukrainian) nationalism... the Ukrainian peasantry was sacrificed...a famine was necessary for the Soviet and so they got one to order... if the Soviet program succeeds completely, if the intelligentsia, the priest, and the peasant can be eliminated [...] Ukraine will be as dead <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>every</b> Ukrainian were killed, for it will have lost that part of it which has kept and developed its culture, its beliefs, its common ideas, which have guided it and given it a soul, which, in short, made it a nation... This is not simply a case of mass murder. It is a case of genocide, of the destruction, not of individuals only, but of a culture and a nation." ...|$|E

2500|$|The early reviews were {{generally}} favourable. [...] According to The Times, The Sorcerer [...] "achieved a genuine success, and, moreover, {{a success in}} every respect deserved". [...] The Era praised both libretto and music: [...] "the libretto, both in the prose and poetical portions, displays remarkable facility in writing fanciful and witty dialogue; and the lively flow of Mr. Sullivan's music, always tuneful, bright, and sparkling, and frequently reaching a very high standard of excellence, could hardly fail to please." [...] Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper called it [...] "a very amusing work", and Reynolds's Newspaper proclaimed it [...] "one of the best entertainments {{of the kind that}} has yet been placed on the stage". [...] As with their previous opera, Trial by Jury, the integration of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music was emphasised. [...] The Times commented that [...] "the music is spontaneous, appearing invariably to spring out of the dramatic situations, as though it was their natural concomitant"; The Musical Times mused that [...] "it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>every</b> composition had grown up {{in the mind of the}} author as he wrote the words"; and The Pall Mall Gazette called the union between composer and librettist [...] "well-assorted", arguing that [...] "the opera contains several very happily designed pieces, in which one cannot tell (and need not know) whether the merit of the original underlying idea belongs to the composer of the poem or to the author of the score".|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>every</b> one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
