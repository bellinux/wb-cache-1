25|$|Serif, or Roman, typefaces {{are named}} for the {{features}} {{at the ends of}} their strokes. Times Roman and Garamond are common examples of serif typefaces. Serif fonts <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> used class in printed materials, including most books, newspapers and magazines. Serif fonts are often classified into three subcategories: Old Style, Transitional, and Didone (or Modern), representative examples of which are Garamond, Baskerville, and Bodoni respectively.|$|E

The type 28s, being {{internally}} spacious {{and having a}} large rear entrance, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> amenable to reuse and on farms and in gardens they serve as cattle sheds and storage lockers. Other, more imaginative, pillbox applications recorded include use as a pub cellar, a conversion to a ladies' toilet, and an open-air theatre box office.|$|E
25|$|Chapati - Most common bread made {{in urban}} homes, where a tandoor is not available. Chapatis are cooked over a flat or {{slightly}} convex dark colored pan known as 'tava'. Chapatis {{are made of}} whole wheat flour and are thin and unleavened. Tortillas <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common analogous to chapatis, though chapatis are slightly thick. A variant, known as 'romali roti' (lit. Handkerchief bread), is very thin and very large in size.|$|E

Four of these, on Plato’s Timaeus, could by themselves form a monograph, and <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> distinguished and important work on Plato done within the last forty years.|$|E
25|$|Without climate feedbacks, a {{doubling}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration {{would result in}} a global average temperature increase of around 1.2°C. Water vapor amount and clouds <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important global climate feedbacks. Historical information and global climate models indicate a climate sensitivity of 1.5 to 4.5°C, with a best estimate of 3°C. This is an amplification of the carbon dioxide forcing by a factor of 2.5. Some studies suggest a lower climate sensitivity, but other studies indicate a sensitivity above this range. Partly because of the difficulty in modeling the cloud feedback, the true climate sensitivity remains uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The Manobo <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{numerous}} of {{the ethnic}} groups of the Philippines in the relationships and names of the groups that belong to this family of languages. Mention {{has been made of}} the numerous subgroups that comprise the Manobo group. The total Manobo population is not known, although they occupy core areas from Sarangani island into the Mindanao mainland in the provinces of Agusan del Sur, Davao provinces, Bukidnon, and North and South Cotabato. The groups occupy such a wide area of distribution that localized groups have assumed the character of distinctiveness as a separate ethnic grouping such as the Bagobo or the Higaonon, and the Atta. Depending on specific linguistic points of view, the membership of a dialect with a supergroup shifts.|$|E

25|$|Sore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common {{complaint}} {{after the}} birth. They are generally {{reported by the}} second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include {{too much pressure on}} the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.|$|E
25|$|Fatty acids are {{a family}} of {{molecules}} classified within the lipid macronutrient class. One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production, captured {{in the form of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When compared to other macronutrient classes (carbohydrates and protein), fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis, when they are completely oxidized to CO2 and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids (mainly in the form of triglycerides) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals, {{and to a lesser extent}} in plants. In addition, fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed (the cell wall, and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells, such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus). Fatty acids can also be cleaved, or partially cleaved, from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell, and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell. The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> well known group of these local hormones.|$|E
25|$|A {{diet that}} {{is rich in}} fruit and {{vegetables}} significantly {{reduces the risk of}} several diseases. Retinoids and vitamins A, C, and E <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> well-known and studied natural radioprotectors, but hormones (e.g., melatonin), glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and phytochemicals from plant extracts (including green tea and cruciferous vegetables), as well as metals (especially selenium, zinc, and copper salts) are also under study as dietary supplements for individuals, including astronauts, who have been overexposed to radiation. Antioxidants should provide reduced or no protection against the initial damage from densely ionizing radiation such as HZE nuclei, because the direct effect {{is more important than the}} free-radical-mediated indirect radiation damage at high LET. However, there is an expectation that some benefits should occur for persistent oxidative damage that is related to inflammation and immune responses. Some recent experiments suggest that, at least for acute high-dose irradiation, an efficient radioprotection by dietary supplements can be achieved, even in the case of exposure to high-LET radiation. Although there is evidence that dietary antioxidants (especially strawberries) can protect the CNS from the deleterious effects of high doses of HZE particles, because the mechanisms of biological effects are different at low dose-rates compared to those of acute irradiation, new studies for protracted exposures will be needed to understand the potential benefits of biological countermeasures.|$|E

He said, [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unlikable Muppets ever created". Bernsten attributed this notoriety to the Saturday Night Live writing staff rather than Jim Henson or Frank Oz. He said the staff's lack of motivation to produce imaginative writing contributed to bland dialogue between the characters.|$|E

500|$|But the Seattle and Tacoma faults <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> serious {{earthquake}} {{threat to}} the populous SeattleTacoma area. [...] A 2002 study of bridge vulnerability estimated that a magnitude 7 earthquake on the Seattle Fault would damage approximately 80 bridges in the SeattleTacoma area, [...] whereas a magnitude 9 subduction event would damage only around 87 bridges in all of Western Washington. The same {{study also found that}} with failure of just six bridges (the minimum damage for a Benioff M 6.5 event) there could be at least $3billion lost in business revenue alone. [...] Subsequent retrofitting by the Washington Department of Transportation and the City of Seattle would likely reduce damage to key bridges. But there is concern that such an earthquake on the Seattle Fault would devastate unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings, of which the City of Seattle is estimated to have around a thousand, concentrated in Capitol Hill, Pioneer Square, and the International District.|$|E
