5|$|Belushi {{had become}} a star in 1978 {{as a result of}} both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in National Lampoon's <b>Animal</b> <b>House.</b> At one point, he managed the triple feat of being the star of the week's top-grossing film, top-rated {{television}} show, and singing on the number-one album within a year. When Aykroyd and Belushi decided they could make a Blues Brothers film, the bidding war was intense. Universal Studios narrowly beat Paramount Pictures for the project.

40|$|According to {{theoretical}} considerations, green buffers {{of trees}} placed around emission sources, the so-called ‘vegetative environmental buffers’ improve air quality {{by reducing the}} concentrations of fine dust from <b>animal</b> <b>housing.</b> The reduction occurs because particles deposit onto the vegetative environmental buffers. However, deposition can only occur when emissions enter the vegetative environmental buffers. The configuration of the vegetative environmental buffer, such as height, shape and distance to the source, affects the fraction of emitted pollution from the <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> ventilators that actually is blown into the vegetative environmental buffer and thus is susceptible to deposition. To evaluate the efficiency of vegetative environmental buffers on the concentration of fine particles in the emitted pollution from <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> by ventilators, this fraction needs to be estimated. The {{aim of this study}} is therefore: to determine the fraction of ventilated air from <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> that is blown into a vegetative environmental buffer which totally surrounds the <b>animal</b> <b>housing,</b> at different wind directions and wind speeds...|$|R

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript {{of a book}} chapter {{published}} by Routledge in <b>Animal</b> <b>Housing</b> and Human–Animal Relations: Politics, Practices and Infrastructures on 17 / 05 / 16, available online: [URL] abstract: This book provides an in-depth investigation into the practices of <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> systems with international contributions from across the humanities and social sciences. By attending {{to a range of}} different sites such as the zoo, the laboratory, the farm and the animal shelter, to name a few, the book explores material technologies from the perspective that these are integrated parts of a larger biopolitical infrastructure and questions how <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> systems, and the physical infrastructures that surround central human-animal practices, come into being. The contributions in the book　show in various ways how physical infrastructures of <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> are always part of a much broader sociocultural and political infrastructure, where the material reality of housing systems combines with human and animal agents, with politics, and with practices. As such, the book explores what kind of practices and relations develop around the physical structures of <b>animal</b> <b>housing,</b> and by whom, and for whom, they are developed. This innovative collection will be of great interest to student and scholars in animal studies, more than human studies, geography, anthropology, and sociology...|$|R

5|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>House</b> {{was a great}} {{box office}} success despite its limited {{production}} costs and started an industry trend, inspiring other comedies such as Porky's, the Police Academy films, the American Pie films, Up the Academy (made by their rival magazine company: MAD), and Old School among others. Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are {{among those who have}} had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis' use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy believable became the traditional approach for film comedies.|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios, {{which had}} won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take {{advantage}} of Belushi's popularity in the wake of Saturday Night Live, <b>Animal</b> <b>House,</b> and the Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film {{one of the most expensive}} comedies ever produced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>House</b> was {{the first}} film {{produced}} by National Lampoon, the most popular humor magazine on college campuses in the mid-1970s. The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine’s writers were recent college graduates, hence their appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a Lampoon writer and the magazine’s first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university's elite Spee Club). Kenney {{was responsible for the}} first appearances of three characters that would appear in the film, Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973's National Lampoon’s High School Yearbook, a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P. E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} carbon dioxide {{production}} from farm animals; more specifically, it addresses {{the possibilities of}} using the measured carbon dioxide concentration in <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> as basis for estimation of ventilation flow (as the ventilation flow is a key parameter of aerial emissions from <b>animal</b> <b>houses).</b> The investigations include measurements in respiration chambers and in <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> mainly for growing pigs and broilers. Over the last decade a fixed carbon dioxide production of 185 litres per hour per heat production unit, hpu (i. e. 1000 W of the total animal heat production at 20 oC) has often been used. The article shows that the carbon dioxide production per hpu increases with increasing respiration quotient. As the respiration quotient increases with body mass for growing animals, the carbon dioxide production per heat production unit also increases with increased body mass. The carbon dioxide production is e. g. less than 185 litres per hour per hpu for weaners and broilers and higher for growing finishing pigs and cows. The analyses show that the measured carbon dioxide production is higher in full scale <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> than measured in respiration chambers, {{due to differences in}} manure handling. In respiration chambers there is none or very limited carbon dioxide contribution from manure; unlike in <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> where a certain carbon dioxide contribution from manure handling may be foreseen. Therefore, it is necessary to make a correction of data from respiration chambers, when used in full scale animal buildings as basis for estimation of ventilation flow. Based on the data reviewed in this study, we recommend adding 10 % carbon dioxide production to the laboratory based carbon dioxide production for <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> with slatted or solid floors, provided that indoor manure cellars are emptied regularly in a four weeks interval. Due to a high and variable carbon dioxide production in deep straw litter houses and houses with indoor storage of manure longer than four weeks, we do not recommend to calculate the ventilation flow based on the carbon dioxide concentration for these houses...|$|R

40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) is volatilized {{from animal}} manure in buildings, during manure storage, and {{following}} land application of manure. Of these sources, land application of manure {{is probably the}} largest contributor of ammonia emissions from livestock and poultry operations; in the UK, land application of manure is the single largest source of such emissions (IGER Innovations, 2004). However, land application typically occurs during short time periods and management practices, such and injection or rapid incorporation of manure into the soil, can minimize ammonia losses through volatilization. In contrast, ammonia emissions from both <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> facilities and manure storage units are continuous year-round.
