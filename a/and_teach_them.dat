5|$|Firestar's Quest, {{the first}} Warriors Super Edition, was {{released}} on 25 August 2007. It is set between The Darkest Hour and Midnight and details Firestar and his mate Sandstorm's journey to restore SkyClan, the fifth Clan of the forest that is driven out when a town is built and scattered when it is attacked by rats in its new home. Firestar and Sandstorm find rogues and house cats, {{some of whom are}} descendants of the former SkyClan <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> how to hunt, fight, and follow the warrior code. When a house cat named Echo dreams of starry cats, Firestar realizes that the dream was sent by StarClan, indicating that Echo should be SkyClan's medicine cat. Echo is taught all that Sandstorm was taught before leaving ThunderClan with Firestar on their quest. She is named Echosong. While SkyClan is rebuilding its ranks, rats attack as they did when SkyClan first came to the gorge. SkyClan defeats them by joining together under the direction of Firestar, Leafdapple (later Leafstar), and Sharpclaw, her deputy later on. Firestar manages to kill the leader of the rats, after which the rats leave. During the rat attack, Firestar loses a life, leaving him with only seven, and a warrior called Rainfur is killed. Towards the end, Echosong dreams of dappled leaves, indicating that Leafdapple should be the new leader. She is named Leafstar and receives her nine lives, meeting Starclan. The former leaders that drove the ancient Skyclan out apologize in Starclan. Cherrypaw and Sparrowpaw are then made warriors (Cherrytail and Sparrowpelt) and Bouncekit, Tinykit, and Rockkit become apprentices (Bouncepaw, Tinypaw, and Rockpaw). The epilogue describes the birth of Squirrelkit and Leafkit, Firestar and Sandstorm's only kits.|$|E
25|$|In March 1994, Durbin {{proposed}} {{an amendment to}} the Improving America's Schools Act that required schools that receive Federal drug prevention money to teach elementary and secondary students about the dangers of tobacco in addition to those of drugs and alcohol. The amendment also required that schools warn students against tobacco <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> how to resist peer pressure to smoke.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{some other}} states, blacks were better {{established}} {{both before and after}} the civil war. Nearly half the population was free before the war, and some had accumulated property. Half the population lived in cities. Literacy was high among blacks and, as Democrats crafted means to exclude them, suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> how to resist. Whites did impose racial segregation in public facilities and Jim Crow laws, which effectively lasted until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.|$|E

25|$|Lunars often shun civilization; rather, they shun {{forms of}} civilization characterised by Dragon-Blooded oppression and exploitation, preferring society with humans and spirits {{far beyond the}} borders of the satrapies. Some of these Stewards lead or guide and {{sometimes}} breed tribes of anthropomorphic animals known as Beastmen <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> self-sufficiency. Others go into deep seclusion in their territories to absorb themselves in primitive, hand-to-mouth freedoms and commune with the small, simple gods of the natural environment. Finally, some even revel in the unaccountable warping effects of the Wyld and, forgoing the characteristic silvered tattoos, become increasingly unstable until becoming Chimera: inhuman beings known as with no consistent form.|$|E
25|$|MacKillop {{started work}} {{at the age of}} 14 as a clerk in a {{stationery}} store in Melbourne. To provide for her needy family, in 1860 she took a job as governess at the estate of her aunt and uncle, Alexander and Margaret Cameron in Penola, South Australia where she was to look after their children <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them.</b> Already set on helping the poor whenever possible, she included the other farm children on the Cameron estate as well. This brought her into contact with Fr Woods, who had been the parish priest in the south east since his ordination to the priesthood in 1857 after completing his studies at Sevenhill.|$|E

God heeded Manoah and sent the angel to the woman as she sat alone in the field. Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, and he said that he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E

25|$|Pratt {{believed}} that Native Americans were the equals of whites, and founded Carlisle to immerse {{their children in}} white culture <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> English, new skills and customs, {{in order to help}} them survive. After the end of Great Sioux War in 1877, the Lakota people were impoverished, harassed and confined to a reservation. At the time, many people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. The U.S. government urgently sought a progressive educational model to rapidly assimilate Indians into white culture. Whether this could be achieved and how rapidly it could be done was unknown. Pratt believed he could make use of the Carlisle facility. He thought its proximity to officials in Washington, D.C. would help him educate officials about the Indian capacity for learning.|$|E
25|$|Every spring, Fairport {{students}} celebrate Brotherhood/Sisterhood Week. The week {{is focused}} around Civility, Awareness, Respect, and Embrace (CARE). The event is most prominent at FHS, where a different activity takes place {{each day of}} the week. Monday is Family Talk Day, during which a student and an adult are selected to speak to the students. Tuesday consists of a presentation during which student voices writings are read. The writings anonymously tell students' feelings about CARE. On Wednesday, a community member is asked to speak. On Wednesday of the 2007 celebration, Rachel's Challenge visited the school. The program encouraged students to improve the atmosphere of their school. The program impacted the students in a large way, partly because they had lost a beloved member of the student body the night before. Wednesday is also the annual Junior-4th Grade walk. The district's 4th and 11th graders walk the village streets together to build relationships with each other. Thursday's program is known as Unplugged, and is a non-stop musical performance available to students with free periods or lunch. Friday concludes the eventful week with Outreach Day. On this day, the entire school is bused to the three elementary schools. Students meet with their new little brothers and sisters for an hour. They play games <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> about CARE. A song written about this week by former students Sean Lyness, John Cieply, Pat Dupont, and David Lachance is played yearly.|$|E
500|$|From the West, Vivekananda revived {{his work}} in India. He {{regularly}} corresponded with his followers and brother monks, offering advice and financial support. His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service, and were strongly worded. He wrote to Akhandananda, [...] "Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes {{of the town of}} Khetri <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> religion. Also, let them have oral lessons on geography and such other subjects. No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes, and saying [...] "Ramakrishna, O Lord!"—unless you can do some good to the poor". In 1895, Vivekananda founded the periodical Brahmavadin to teach the Vedanta. Later, Vivekananda's translation of the first six chapters of The Imitation of Christ was published in Brahmavadin in 1889. Vivekananda left for India on 16 December 1896 from England with his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin. On the way they visited France and Italy, and set sail for India from Naples on 30 December 1896. He was later followed to India by Sister Nivedita, who devoted {{the rest of her life}} to the education of Indian women and India's independence.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} June 2013 at Filmistan, Mumbai. Hindustan Times {{reported that the}} set was ready at Filmistan studio, but following Chopra's father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised {{that it would not}} be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra as she got hurt several times; she says, [...] "They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really hit you. So I had to get hit a lot and that was really hard." [...] Robert Miller, the sports coordinator for films such as Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Chak De! India (2007), was hired to choreograph the fight sequences.|$|E
500|$|Locke wrote Some Thoughts Concerning Education in {{response}} to his friend Samuel Clarke's query on how to educate his son, so the text's [...] "principal aim", as Locke states at the beginning, [...] "is how a young gentleman should be brought up from his infancy." [...] This education [...] "will not so perfectly suit the education of daughters; though where the difference of sex requires different treatment, it will be no hard matter to distinguish" [...] (Locke's emphasis). This passage suggests that, for Locke, education was fundamentally the same for men and women—there were only small, obvious differences for women. This interpretation is supported by a letter he wrote to Mrs. Clarke in 1685 stating that [...] "since therefore I acknowledge no difference of sex in your mind relating ... to truth, virtue and obedience, I think well to have no thing altered in it from what is [...]" [...] Martin Simons states that Locke [...] "suggested, both by implication and explicitly, that a boy's education should be along the lines already followed by some girls of the intelligent genteel classes." [...] Rather than sending boys to schools which would ignore their individual needs <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> little of value, Locke argues that they should be taught at home as girls already were and [...] "should learn useful and necessary crafts of the house and estate." [...] Like his contemporary Mary Astell, Locke believed that women could and should be taught to be rational and virtuous.|$|E

2500|$|Carlisle {{was created}} with the {{explicit}} goal of assimilating Native Americans into mainstream European-American culture. [...] "The goal of acculturation {{was to be}} accomplished by [...] "total immersion" [...] in the white man's world." [...] Pratt founded Carlisle to immerse Native American children in mainstream culture <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> English, new skills, and customs. Pratt's slogan was [...] "to civilize the Indian, get him into civilization. To keep him civilized, let him stay." [...] Pratt's approach was harsh but {{an alternative to the}} commonly-held goal of extermination of Native Americans. A positive outcome of a Carlisle education was the student's increased multilingualism.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{teachers}} consider Zhan Zhuang to be {{the most}} important practice in Xing Yi, while others neglect to train <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> altogether. The use of the Santi Shi (三体势) Zhan Zhuang as the main training method in Xing Yi dates back to Li Luoneng - the founder of modern version of the art. In Dai XinYi, the central and most important training method is called 'Squatting Monkey' - a dynamic movement exercise rather than a dynamic posture held in place. In the Geng Jishan/Deng Yunfeng/Rose Li tradition, the phrase Santi is sometimes replaced by [...] "central equilibrium stance".|$|E
2500|$|Hence, [...] school {{teachers}} {{are part of}} the intelligentsia who recruit children in elementary school <b>and</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> politics — to advocate for or to advocate against a public policy — as part of community-service projects; which political experience later assists them in earning admission to university. In that manner, the intellectuals of a society intervene and participate in social arenas of which they might not possess expert knowledge, and so unduly influence the formulation and realization of public policy. In the event, teaching political advocacy in elementary school encourages students to formulate opinions [...] "without any intellectual training or prior knowledge of those issues, making constraints against falsity few or non-existent." ...|$|E
