50|$|A {{chemical}} sensor is a self-contained <b>analytical</b> <b>device</b> {{that can provide}} information about the chemical composition of its environment, that is, a liquid or a gas phase. The information is provided {{in the form of}} a measurable physical signal that is correlated with the concentration of a certain chemical species (termed as analyte). Two main steps are involved in the functioning of a {{chemical sensor}}, namely, recognition and transduction. In the recognition step, analyte molecules interact selectively with receptor molecules or sites included in the structure of the recognition element of the sensor. Consequently, a characteristic physical parameter varies and this variation is reported by means of an integrated transducer that generates the output signal.A chemical sensor based on recognition material of biological nature is a biosensor. However, as synthetic biomimetic materials are going to substitute to some extent recognition biomaterials, a sharp distinction between a biosensor and a standard chemical sensor is superfluous. Typical biomimetic materials used in sensor development are molecularly imprinted polymers and aptamers.|$|E
50|$|The {{hardware}} (traditionally metal tubing, compression fittings, valves, regulators, rotameters and filters) {{associated with}} extractive sampling is collectively {{referred to as}} the sampling system. Sample systems are used to condition or adjust the sample conditions (pressure, amount of particulate allowed, temperature and flow) to a level suitable for use with an <b>analytical</b> <b>device</b> (analyzer) such as a gas chromatograph, an oxygen analyzer or an infra red spectrometer. Despite the simple explanation just given, modern sampling systems can be quite large, complex, and expensive. The design features of analytical sample systems have changed little, when the discipline of Process Analytics began in Germany, right through until the present day. An example of an early analyzer and sample system used at the Buna Chemical Works (Schkopau, Germany), is shown in the following photograph. Process analytics remains exceptional in {{the fact that it is}} the last outpost of low level automation (retains manual adjustments and visible checks) within the process industries.|$|E
40|$|Even though high {{precision}} <b>analytical</b> <b>devices</b> are developed in {{qualitative and quantitative}} determination of substance or substances in matrix samples (biological, environmental, food etc.), <b>analytical</b> <b>devices</b> mostly fail determining in matrix environment. Due to such reasons, clean-up process is needed to take (purification) and concentrate (enrichment) the substance in matrix environment. Liquid-liquid (LLE) extraction is commonly used in preparation of the samples. In recent years, liquid phase micro extraction (LPME) methods minimizing organic solvent used in liquid-liquid extraction are developed. Of these methods, hollow fiber liquid phase micro extraction (HFLPME) is widely used...|$|R

50|$|A {{biosensor}} is an <b>analytical</b> <b>device,</b> {{used for}} the detection of an analyte, that combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector. The sensitive biological element (e.g. tissue, microorganisms, organelles, cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc.) is a biologically derived material or biomimetic component that interacts (binds or recognizes) with the analyte under study. The biologically sensitive elements can also be created by biological engineering.The transducer or the detector element (works in a physicochemical way; optical, piezoelectric, electrochemical, etc.) transforms the signal resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into another signal (i.e., transduces) that can be more easily measured and quantified.The biosensor reader device with the associated electronics or signal processors that are primarily responsible for the display of the results in a user-friendly way. This sometimes accounts for the most expensive part of the sensor device, however it is possible to generate a user friendly display that includes transducer and sensitive element (holographic sensor). The readers are usually custom-designed and manufactured to suit the different working principles of biosensors.|$|E

40|$|Presented is a {{covariant}} {{theory of}} fermions interacting via a gauge field where the many-fermion {{system is a}} superconducting fluid. The theory uses the <b>analytical</b> <b>device</b> of a metric tensor field to represent the gauge-invariant coupling of the fermions via a 4 -potential field. The theory is rewritten as unitary evolution equations on a spacetime lattice, which in turn lead to a quantum algorithm of gauge field theory. The quantum algorithm uses a qubit array to represent both the spacetime lattice and the particles contained in the space. When the fermion's Compton wavelength is large compared to the spatial grid scale, the Euler-Lagrangian equations of the theory and the low-energy expansions of the unitary evolution equations are the same equations of motion. On a quantum computer, the quantum algorithm is an efficient emulator of a many-fermion system. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1609. 02225.

30|$|Although {{many studies}} {{investigated}} analytical systems for both analytical and point-of-care (POC) applications [14 – 16], detecting biomolecules at concentrations below {{the limit of}} detection (LOD) is still a critical issue for <b>analytical</b> <b>devices.</b> To address this problem, an ICP-based preconcentrator has been developed [17, 18] for enhancing the LOD. In many cases, the preconcentration plug, particularly used for the delivery of preconcentrated samples to external equipment and devices, needs to deliver the samples with minimal dispersion; however, the {{dispersion of the sample}} plug is a critical issue [19]. When the electric field is removed, the force balance between external hydraulic force/electric field and depletion force cannot be maintained. Hence, the ICP preconcentration plug is drastically dispersed in the fluidic channel, which severely hampers the use of preconcentration <b>devices</b> with external <b>analytical</b> <b>devices</b> (i.e., mass spectrometry and sensors).|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} {{carried out}} during my PhD was principally {{addressed to the}} development of portable microfluidic <b>analytical</b> <b>devices</b> based on biospecific molecular recognition reactions and CL detection. In particular, the development of biosensors required the study of different materials and procedures for their construction, with particular attention {{to the development of}} suitable immobilization procedures, fluidic systems and the selection of the suitable detectors. Different methods were exploited, such as gene probe hybridization assay or immunoassay, based on different platform (functionalized glass slide or nitrocellulose membrane) trying to improve the simplicity of the assay procedure. Different CL detectors were also employed and compared with each other in the search for the best compromise between portability and sensitivity. The work was therefore aimed at miniaturization and simplification of <b>analytical</b> <b>devices</b> and the study involved all aspects of the system, from the analytical methodology to the type of detector, in order to combine high sensitivity with easiness-of-use and rapidity. The latest development involving the use of smartphone as chemiluminescent detector paves the way {{for a new generation of}} <b>analytical</b> <b>devices</b> in the clinical diagnostic field thanks to the ideal combination of sensibility a simplicity of the CL with the day-by-day increase in the performance of the new generation smartphone camera. Moreover, the connectivity and data processing offered by smartphones can be exploited to perform analysis directly at home with simple procedures. The system could eventually be used to monitor patient health and directly notify the physician of the analysis results allowing a decrease in costs and an increase in the healthcare availability and accessibility...|$|R
