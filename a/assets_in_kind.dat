40|$|The General Utilities {{doctrine}} {{is the name}} given to the now largely defunct tax rule that a corporation does not recognize a gain or a loss on making a liquidating or nonliquidating distribution of an appreciated or depreciated asset to its shareholders. The roots of the doctrine, {{can be traced to}} a regulation promulgated in 1919 that denied realization of gain or loss to a corporation when making a liquidating distribution of an <b>asset</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> No regulatory provision existed which specified the extent to which realization would or would not be triggered by a nonliquidating distribution such as a dividend or a stock redemption. In General Utilities 2 ̆ 6 Operating Co. v.

40|$|Our {{research}} group ISRI (InCormation Syslems Reuse on Internet) {{is working in}} a new classification scheme for reusable software (assets) {{based on the idea}} of hyper-spherical finders. The Finder metaphor deals with a multidimensional space where the components are positioned according to its functional description. and vision fields. hiper-spheres, which can move in space and see the components. Our approach has some advantages over other techniques and methodologies, for example: we start with an empty space (the universe) and automatically fill it with reusable assets, which describe the application domain, but the space itself is dynamically generated as components are inserted; furthermore, we can build different finders, alter its radius or its kind of movement, without the need of reclassifying the repository, allowing a dynamical classification. We developed and tested a simple but practical method to compute similarities, allowing to locate <b>assets</b> <b>in</b> this <b>kind</b> of universe, generating finders and modifying them, querying the universe and retrieving similar components. The tested values of recall and precision were similar or better than other known methods but ours is by far easier to implement and maintain.

Inmedieval iconography, the researches of Jérôme Baschet have been successful: using bar charts, herecommends for instance the use of statistics to link the frequency of a theme according to periods.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} theory of the {{financing}} of investment in a modern capitalist economy, following the approach developed by Hyman P. Minsky. We argue that the current financial crisis {{that began with the}} collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the United States in 2007 provides a compelling reason to show how his approach offers us a grounding in the workings of financial capitalism. Even if the spreading global financial crisis is successfully contained this time around, it is likely that analyses will incorporate a substantial dose of Minsky's ideas for many years to come. What we present is an alternative to the standard approach that was developed beginning in the early 1970 s, based on the efficient markets hypothesis that relegates money and finance to the sidelines. Minsky vehemently denied the relevance of such a theory, at least for a modern capitalist economy with complex, expensive, and long-lived capital <b>assets.</b> <b>In</b> our <b>kind</b> of economy, the method used to finance positions <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> is of critical importance, both for theory and for real-world outcomes. In the first section we present the investment theory of the business cycle developed by John Maynard Keynes, and then examine Minsky's extension that added a financial theory of investment. This allowed Minsky to analyze the evolution, over time, of the modern capitalist economy toward fragilitywhat is well known as Minsky's financial instability hypothesis. In the subsequent section, we update Minsky's approach to finance with a more detailed examination of asset pricing and of the evolution of the banking sector. In the final section we briefly review the insights that such an approach can provide for analysis of the current global financial crisis...|$|R
