5|$|The Model School {{was part}} of the {{national}} schools programme proposed in 1831 in which each county in Ireland would have at least one school that would serve as an example to other national schools in the area and as a teacher training establishment (although teacher training did not take place <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> school). Initially it had a multi-denominational intake, offered such services as night classes and industry-relevant vocational courses, and was enthusiastically supported by William Brownlow who is thought to have brought the school to the town. It was undermined, however, by church interests, which were opposed to its lack of ecclesiastical control, and criticism of the efficiency of its management, hence losing much of its earlier prestige as the premier educational establishment in the town. Over the years, the intake of Nationalist/Catholic students steadily increased, due mainly to being situated in the Catholic area of Lurgan. The student body is now almost 100% Catholic.|$|E

This action likely does not contribute to the herb's possible sedative effects, which would be expected from an agonist, rather than an inverse agonist, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> binding site. Hydrophilic extractions of the herb commonly sold over the counter, however, probably do not contain significant amounts of isovaltrate. Valerenic acid in valerian stimulates serotonin receptors as a partial agonist, including 5-HT5A which is implicated in the sleep-wake cycle.|$|E

25|$|By 1825, Spark's trading {{business}} had greatly expanded, {{and he was}} chartering ships to coastal trade routes. A year later, his {{business had}} grown even more, and he started a shipping agency. Through this agency, Spark sold incoming cargoes, exporting stores to places such as Hobart, colonial produce to Calcutta, and wool consignments (the first {{of what would be}} very many wool consignments) to London, backloading merchandise when it was possible. Additionally, Spark worked as a sort of agent for farmers and country settlers by purchasing their produce and selling them supplies such as livestock and stores, as well as the occasional ploughman or overseer. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> time, Spark owned more than six thousand acres (24km²) of land on the Hunter River and a nine-acre (4 hectare) grant at Woolloomooloo; Spark had developed a passion for land ownership. In 1835, the designer John Verge (who also built Elizabeth Bay House) helped Spark complete his property, now named Tusculum outside of Wolloomooloo Hill (now known as Potts Point). It now houses The Royal Australian Institute of Architects.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, at {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, Napoleon ordered Ney to capture La Haye Sainte at whatever the cost. Ney accomplished this with what was left of D'Erlon's corps soon after 18:00. Ney then moved horse artillery up towards Wellington's centre and began to destroy the infantry squares at short-range with canister. This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square. Wellington's centre was now {{on the verge of collapse}} and wide open to an attack from the French. Luckily for Wellington, Pirch I's and Zieten's corps of the Prussian Army were now at hand. Zieten's corps permitted the two fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on Wellington's extreme left to be moved and posted behind the depleted centre. Pirch I Corps then proceeded to support Bülow and together they regained possession of Plancenoit, and once more the Charleroi road was swept by Prussian round shot. The value of this reinforcement <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> moment can hardly be overestimated.|$|E

They wanted to start the season with an episode {{centering}} on the Simpson family. The story was pitched by writer George Meyer at a story retreat. Story retreats were held twice a year at a hotel room close to the studio lot, where all the writers gathered to pitch their ideas. Seventeen episodes were pitched <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> story retreat. Out of them all, Weinstein considered this episode to be the best, and he thought the pitch by Meyer was the best he had ever heard.

500|$|Bowlby later {{stated that}} he had {{concluded}} that, contrary to the focus of psychoanalysts on the internal fantasy world of the child, the important area to study was how a child was actually treated by his parents in real life {{and in particular the}} interaction between them. He chose the actual removal of children from the home <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> time because it was a specific event, the effects of which could be studied, and because he believed it could have serious effects on a child's development and because it was preventable. In addition, views that he had already expressed about the importance of a child's real life experiences and relationship with carers had been met by [...] "sheer incredulity" [...] by colleagues before World War II. This led him to see that far more systematic knowledge was required of the effects on a child of early experiences. Bowlby and his colleagues were pioneers of the view that studies involving direct observation of infants and children were not merely of interest but were essential to the advancement of science in this area.|$|E
500|$|A {{major reason}} for GE's {{interest}} in the collaboration, rather than building a 10-ton engine on their own, was that the SNECMA project was {{the only source of}} development funds for an engine in this class <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> time. GE was initially considering only contributing technology from its CF6 engine rather than its much more advanced F101 engine, developed for the B-1 Lancer supersonic bomber. The company was faced with a dilemma when the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) project in 1972 which included funding {{for the development of a}} 10-ton engine – either to build a [...] "limited" [...] technology 10-ton engine with SNECMA, or a similar engine with [...] "advanced" [...] technology on their own. Concerned that the company would be left with only the [...] "limited" [...] engine in its portfolio if it did not win the Air Force contract (for which it was competing with Pratt & Whitney and a General Motors division with its [...] "advanced" [...] engine), GE decided to apply for an export license for the F101 core technology.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} musical number, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] / [...] "Someone Like You", was acclaimed as {{its main}} highlight. Raymund Flandez described Rivera's vocals as [...] "electrifying" [...] and [...] "golden".

[...] Votta called it the best performance since the cast's rendition of [...] "Don't Stop Believin' in the season one finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", and stated, [...] "Naya Rivera's powerful vocals and the strong arrangement still packs the emotional punch Glee was targeting." [...] Chaney awarded the sequence a [...] "A+" [...] grade: [...] "Given the emotional stakes raised by Santana's outing, which happened in the scene right before this performance, {{and the fact that it}} marked the series's 300th musical performance, this marriage" [...] of the two Adele songs, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] and [...] "Someone Like You", was [...] "all the more powerful". Moyler asserted that the number was [...] "perfection" [...] and said, [...] "This is why I watch Glee. It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little whispers to Santana bringing tears to my eyes singing 'Someone Like You' as if it was the last song she'll ever sing in her damn life." [...] Cinema Blend's Melissa Duko stated that the show [...] "hit it out of the park" [...] and added that it was her favorite performance of the season. Slezak gave the number an [...] "A+" [...] and wrote, [...] "Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele, and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele's glorious original parts." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named the mash-up one of Glee best performances.|$|E
