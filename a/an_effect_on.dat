Milk records and samplings were carried out five times during milking period from May to September. Individual milk samples were analyzed for: total solids (TS), fat (F), protein (P), casein (CN), whey protein (WP), lactose (L). In addition the samples from 20 ewes were analyzed for: pH, titratable acidity (TA), rennet clotting time (RCT), rennet curd quality (RCQ), somatic cell count (SCC) and urea (U). In the study the effects of lactation stage, parity, litter size and month of lambing on chosen parameters were evaluated, as well as their interactions with LS.
