500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender's proposal and allowed him to do it. Lender said, [...] "Steve gave you the opportunities to do things that would really be memorable, if you could sell him on it." [...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>held</b> its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I closed my eyes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>held</b> the note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning." ...|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>held</b> {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>held</b> on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E

I am very pleased to have known him and I feel very sorry for Jamie and his wife Mary." [...] David Graham who voiced Gordon Tracy, Parker, Brains and Kyrano said it was [...] "a very sad day".|$|E
2500|$|In {{a report}} by {{forensic}} psychiatrist Adelheid Kastner, Fritzl's mother is described as unpredictable and abusive. Fritzl referred to himself as an [...] "alibi" [...] child, meaning that his mother only gave birth to him to prove {{that she was not}} barren and could produce children. Fritzl claims that his pathological behavior is innate. He admits that he planned to lock his daughter up during his prison stint for the earlier rape conviction so that he could contain and express his [...] "evil side". He said, [...] "I was born to rape, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>held</b> myself back for a relatively long time. I could have behaved a lot worse than locking up my daughter." [...] The forensic psychiatrist diagnosed Fritzl as having a [...] "severe combined personality disorder" [...] which included borderline, schizotypal, and schizoid personalities and a sexual disorder and recommended that Fritzl receive psychiatric care {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

60|$|She seemed shy, at once {{very near}} <b>and</b> very remote. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> her hand awkwardly until the {{carriage}} stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give her to me! Hand her up!" [...] exclaimed the lady, as {{she rushed}} over, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>held</b> {{the little one}} on my shoulder, the lady drew her up and clasped the child, dolls and all, to her breast.|$|R
