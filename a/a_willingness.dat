This study examines interpersonal interaction {{and the effects}} of likeability on two attributes that are central to many organizations: commodity prices as negotiation outcomes and <b>a</b> partner's <b>willingness</b> to engage in collaboration. Specifically, we aim to answer: how does interpersonal likeability impact negotiation outcomes in terms of commodity prices and how does it affect <b>a</b> partner's <b>willingness</b> to engage in collaboration? Based on social exchange theory we draw hypotheses that are tested using data gathered from experiments with 220 participants. The findings indicate that likeability significantly influences <b>a</b> partner's <b>willingness</b> to engage in collaboration but does not significantly influence negotiation profits.

The results were as follows: 1) Mothers who had "only received an oral explanation" at the time of prenatal notification showed <b>a</b> significantly lower <b>willingness</b> to adapt themselves soon after delivery. Mothers given "explanations using photos of the current and postoperative conditions" showed <b>a</b> significantly stronger <b>willingness</b> to accept the situation at the time of notification, and adapt themselves soon after delivery; 2) Mothers given an "explanation about surgical treatment" felt significantly weaker senses of shock, denial, and sorrow soon after delivery, and showed <b>a</b> significantly strong <b>willingness</b> to adapt themselves soon after delivery; 3) Mothers receiving an "explanation about public aid (for rehabilitation of disabled children) " showed <b>a</b> significantly stronger <b>willingness</b> to adapt themselves and accept the situation soon after delivery; 4) Mothers given an "explanation on self-help groups (parents 2 ̆ 7 meetings) " showed <b>a</b> significantly stronger <b>willingness</b> to accept the situation soon after delivery; 5) Mothers "feeling positive about support from nurses" tended (p= 0. 066) to show <b>a</b> stronger <b>willingness</b> to adapt themselves soon after delivery; 6) Mothers who had "consulted a specialist surgeon before delivery" showed <b>a</b> significantly stronger <b>willingness</b> to adapt themselves and accept the situation soon after delivery...|$|R
50|$|In economics, {{willingness}} to accept (WTA) is the minimum {{amount of money that}} а person is willing to accept to abandon a good or to put up with something negative, such as pollution. It is equivalent to the minimum monetary amount required for sale of a good or acquisition of something undesirable to be accepted by <b>an</b> individual. Conversely, <b>willingness</b> to pay (WTP) is the maximum amount an individual is willing to sacrifice to procure a good or avoid something undesirable. The price of any goods transaction will thus be any point between <b>a</b> buyer's <b>willingness</b> to pay and <b>a</b> seller's <b>willingness</b> to accept. The net difference between WTP and WTA is the social surplus created by the trading of goods.|$|R

In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.|$|E

Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware, public entertainments, funerary monuments for family members or coworkers, and religious dedications such as altars.
