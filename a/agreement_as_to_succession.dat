B) Settlement of an inheritors calling mechanism, {{especially in the}} event of a Power of Appointment (the representative has some disposition capabilities on the inheritance), with remission to the moment of its exercise (#17). C) Regulation of the Heir and Legatee Status, including presumptions of the Heir Status of certain Legatees (# 19 & 20). D) A definition of the Inheritance debts, which includes the maintenance payable to the deceased’s descendants; and the establishment of a responsibility for the inheritance debts limited to the value, in the moment of the call to the successor, of de assets acquired (#21). A system for separating the inherintace´s and the heirs´s own goods and debts. E) The forced succession regulation is extended to all the Basque Autonomic Community and the forced portion reduced to 1/3 of the patrimony net value (#49). Ancestors are excluded from forced succession (#47). F) The traditional widow allowance is extended with a Right of habitation in the spouses’ home during widowhood. G) The intestate succession provisions splits between Trunk Lineage Statutory assets and the rest of the deceased’s patrimony (#111 & 112). This intestate succession passes by right of representation to the issue of a deceased’s beneficiary (#113 & 116.2). In non Trunk real state the subsequent intestate successors are: The descendants, the widow/er (#114), ascendants (#115), collateral ancestors (#116), and if there is no surviving person within the Basque Community Administration escheats the assets as a trustee to pass to herself, to the County Council of the deceased’s last residence and to the municipality of the latter last residence, by third parts and by means of benefit of inventory. Therefore, an overall intestate succession system is generated to any Basque Community civil residents. H) Reservations and Recessions [...]|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the post mortem mandate, an {{agreement}} used to protect some interests arising after the mandator’s death, both in Italian legal system and in Roman Law. Given that the latest doctrine has considered invalid a post mortem mandate where {{the nature of the}} mandatory’s tasks is economic, as it does not comply with art. 458 Cod. Civ., this article explores the issues suggesting that the recent introduction of the ‘reverse mortgage’ within the Italian legal system could be considered as a new step towards overcoming the prohibition of <b>agreements</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>succession.</b> After analysing the current legislation, also within the framework of European private law, the research dwells on post mortem mandatum in Roman law, trying to show that such consensual contract could be considered <b>as</b> a succession <b>agreement.</b> After having demonstrated the difference between the mandatum post mortem (understood as a contract) and other testamentary dispositions defined as mandatum post mortem as well, a source showing the possible economic nature of the Roman mandatum post mortem is considered, to conclude that there were Roman law cases, like that of Gaio in D. 17. 1. 13, proving the existence of bilateral agreements intended to fulfil an economic function casually related to the mandator’s death...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} the <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> proceedings is {{the central}} point. By means of an <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> proceedings, parties diverge from procedural law. It is relevant to conduct research into <b>agreements</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> proceedings, <b>as</b> they may contribute to a swift and efficient course of the civil proceedings. In addition, research into these agreements {{can result in a}} better insight into the question about the control over the proceedings. Who ultimately has the right to determine the course of affairs during the proceedings? Is it the parties, whose substantive rights are at issue, or is it the government, which makes the civil proceedings available? Three main questions are to be distinguished in this research. Firstly, the admissibility of <b>agreements</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> proceedings has been examined. To what extent can parties validly conclude an <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> proceedings? Secondly, the effect of <b>agreements</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> proceedings has been examined. What are the consequences of an <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> proceedings concluded by parties? Finally, it has been investigated what rules are applicable to such agreements. Promotor: H. J. SnijdersWith summary in Englis...|$|R
