500|$|The iPad 2 {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews, praising its Apple A5 processor and 720p camera. Joshua Topolsky of Engadget said that [...] "for {{those of you}} who haven't yet made the leap, feel free to take <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> dive in – the iPad 2 is {{as good as it gets}} right now. And it's really quite good." [...] Jason Snell of Macworld said the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "let's {{just take}} <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> examine {{the rules that}} govern {{election}} spending in Britain and Canada (countries which, the last time I looked, were still counted among the world's leading democracies). In Britain, [...] "third party" [...] expenditure is capped at 5 per cent of the expenditure authorised for political parties in the 12 months prior to polling day.|$|E
2500|$|George Will {{suggested}} that America could use bin Laden's death to [...] "draw <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> some pertinent conclusions", among them that [...] "bin Laden was {{brought down by}} intelligence gathering that more resembles excellent police work than a military operation." [...] He added, [...] "There remains much more to al-Qaeda than bin Laden, {{and there are many}} more tentacles to the terrorism threat than al-Qaeda and its affiliates. So 'the long war' must go on. But perhaps such language is bewitching our minds, because this is not essentially war." ...|$|E
60|$|Helen got {{a little}} air, that was like hot pin-points in her lungs, <b>and</b> then <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> then full, gasping respiration.|$|R
60|$|The Rube drew <b>a</b> long, <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{held out}} his hand. I sensed another stage in the {{evolution}} of Whit Hurtle.|$|R
60|$|He had {{strength}} {{enough to}} stop her. <b>A</b> few <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> he was himself again, shaken and with a heart beating like a steam-engine, but able at least to talk intelligently.|$|R
60|$|He breathed <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{looked around}} the room before his gaze fixed again on Duane.|$|E
60|$|He {{expelled}} <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> for a space stood {{staring in}} silence at a passing slug.|$|E
60|$|Jim breathed <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{looked around}} the room before his gaze fixed again on mine.|$|E
6000|$|He carried {{down the}} stairs into the Courtyard, [...] But there he made no stay, [...] He just tied up his Garters, took <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] <b>And</b> ran like the wind away.|$|R
60|$|Dauncey drew in <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of realisation, <b>and</b> {{his face}} for a moment glowed.|$|R
5000|$|Take <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> diaphragmatic <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> hold it {{in during}} the movement, thus {{creating}} an outward pressure on the core to further stabilize the lumbopelvic hip complex and core throughout the motion.|$|R
60|$|I drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> slowly {{pressed on}} the trigger. The buck stood {{still as a}} stone.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that Pawnee Brown paused, drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> wiped the cold {{perspiration}} from his brow.|$|E
60|$|They look at {{one another}} {{significantly}} for a moment. Than Richard exhales <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> turns towards Judith.|$|E
60|$|He paused, {{peering over}} to where Trent was sitting with grim, {{immovable}} face, listening with little show of interest. He drew <b>a</b> long, <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> moved over nearer to the doorway. His manner was suddenly changed.|$|R
6000|$|ANDERSON (exhaling <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief, <b>and</b> dabbing his perspiring brow {{with his}} handkerchief). Thank God, I was in time! ...|$|R
60|$|He drew <b>a</b> long <b>and</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{before he}} began to speak he searched himself for some comfort or encouragement, while Lemuel anxiously scanned his face.|$|R
6000|$|Lawford took <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> quietly {{faced her}} again. 'In the old churchyard, Widderstone; I was looking at--at the gravestones.' ...|$|E
60|$|He took <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> stood simmering. Miss Smith {{came forward}} and, with a smothered giggle, took the mate's arm and {{squeezed}} it.|$|E
60|$|She was roused {{from these}} semi-delirious speculations {{in the sun}} furnace by Siegmund's waking. He opened his eyes, took <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> looked smiling at Helena.|$|E
60|$|We all drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief; <b>and</b> Corporal John (as {{the most}} {{considerable}} junior present) {{explained to him}} it was intended for a public building, a kind of prefecture.|$|R
60|$|Gerald wavered for a moment, but {{his brief}} militant mood was ebbing fast. After a faint protest he shuffled off, and Sally heard him go into her room. She breathed <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief <b>and</b> {{turned to her}} task.|$|R
5000|$|Breathe In. Breathe Out. {{is named}} after a song that she {{recorded}} with Matthew Koma, which according to Duff, [...] "stuck with her" [...] throughout the recording process of the album. She further explained: [...] "Over {{the past few years}} of my life it's just been something that really helped me—just taking <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> in <b>and</b> letting <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> out. It can be a good thing, it can be a struggle, it can be a power thing—it's just a good reminder for everyone to remember to do that. It's a relief." ...|$|R
6000|$|Duane drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> {{sheathed}} his gun. He felt {{calm and}} cool, glad the fray was over. One violent expression burst from him. [...] "The fool!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Get sentence? D'you mean this?' She half {{closed her}} eyes, drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> shuddered. '"Notice" [...] I call it. Sir John {{thought it was}} all lies.' ...|$|E
60|$|His {{subordinates}} {{took the}} hint, and bolted down the hollow {{as hard as}} they could ride, while I drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> turned towards the rescue party.|$|E

5000|$|Aankh Micholi: Eyes {{of one of}} {{the players}} are closed with a {{handkerchief}} and they have to find the other players in the defined area. The eyes are closed by the handkerchief and then they with many people around, they have to determine where their partners are. Sometimes this game is also played among the couples by their bumps. It is not an easy game, so before starting the game, players take <b>a</b> long <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> smell the fragrance of their spouses, where it is believed that the senses will save their day.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Seal drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> {{restrained}} herself, <b>and</b> then burst out, looking out, too, upon Russell Square and Southampton Row, {{and at the}} passers-by, [...] "Ah, if {{only one}} could get {{every one of those}} people into this room, and make them understand for five minutes! But they MUST see the truth some day.... If only one could MAKE them see it...." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dick drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{even after}} Belding had {{departed}} he forgot {{for a moment}} about the letter in his hand. Then he unfolded the paper and read: ...|$|E
60|$|The night passed slowly. Tommy {{lived through}} an eternity of hours, {{but at last}} he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> {{clutched}} the picture firmly.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he was {{any such}} fool as to promise that he wouldn't {{talk to me}} on a subject"--Lapham drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> then made the plunge--"that I brought up----" ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the top of}} {{the high}} bridge they could see far away the {{magnificent}} spires and splendid domes of the superb city, sparkling like brilliant jewels as they towered above the emerald walls. The shaggy man drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of awe <b>and</b> amazement, for never had he dreamed that such a grand and beautiful place could exist--even in the fairyland of Oz.|$|R
6000|$|She drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief, <b>and</b> {{dropped into}} the nearest chair. If Horace had stayed a moment longer--she felt it, she knew it--her head would have given way; she would have burst out before him with the terrible truth. [...] "Oh!" [...] she thought, {{pressing}} her cold hands on her burning eyes, [...] "if I could only cry, now there is nobody to see me!" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that answer}} her {{strength}} failed {{her for the}} first time. She drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief, <b>and</b> leaned on the chimney-piece for support. Mr. Bashwood was the only person present who noticed that she was overcome. He led her to {{the opposite end of the}} room, where there was an easy-chair, leaving the landlady to hand the restoratives to the surgeon as they were wanted.|$|R
