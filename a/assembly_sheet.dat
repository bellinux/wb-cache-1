40|$|The {{bacteriophage}} φ 29 replication protein p 1 self-interacts in vitro, generating highly ordered structures. Specifically, the 53 -amino acid protein p 1 ΔN 33, which {{retains the}} sequence of p 1 spanning amino acids Met 34 to Lys 85, assembles into two-dimensional protofilament sheets. The region of protein p 1 located between residues Glu 38 and Asn 65 presumably forms an α-helical coiled-coil structure. Here we have examined the role of this coiled-coil sequence {{in the formation of}} protofilament sheets. Using sedimentation assays and negative-stain electron microscopy analysis, we demonstrate that residues Leu 46, Met 53, and Leu 60, but not Leu 39, are essential for p 1 ΔN 33 <b>assembly</b> into <b>sheets.</b> Remarkably, replacement of Leu 46 by Val shifts the pathway of molecular assembly, leading to the formation of filamentous polymers ∼ 10 nm in diameter. These results show, for the first time, that a short coiled-coil motif can mediate protein <b>assembly</b> into protofilament <b>sheet</b> structures.

40|$|In {{automotive}} and aeronautic fields, {{controlling the}} final shape of flexible <b>assemblies</b> (with <b>sheet</b> metal parts) {{is a key}} issue. Even assuming as known the shape errors in single manufactured parts, the assembly process can cause wide variability due to their flexibility and to the choice of fixtures and clamps {{as well as to}} the fastening technique adopted. Here it is strategic to analyse different assembly configurations at the beginning of the design phase and chose the one that assures less variability on the key characteristics to be achieved. This paper presents a FEM-based computer tool able to statistically analyse variations occurring in assembly processes of flexible parts. After assigning fixtures, clamping points, fastening joints and assembly sequence, the tool quickly outputs the statistical variability of the key characteristics. It is so possible to span a variety of design solutions predicting failures and controlling final variations. A case study will show how it works. ...|$|R

In this process outer surface, limiting the extent of electrode indentation is traditionally managed by controlling the heat balance and electrode size. Design of experiment approach where 23 factorial designs were used. The three factors selected are weld force weld current and weld time and each factor was varied with two Levels. Tension shear load were taken for response. Direct and indirect resistance spot welding trials were conducted and regression equations were obtained. The effect of parameters on Tension shear breaking load was analyzed [...] The observations on Tension, shear load were discussed [...] Failure behaviour was analyzed after every test. Since spot welds during service are expected to perform well under different loading conditions these results will be useful for optimum design.

30|$|Mechanical {{exfoliation}} of graphite on the pre-patterned electrodes is {{a popular}} method to fabricate high-quality graphene sheet-based electrical circuits. The extremely low throughput and lack of position precision severely limit the controllable fabrication of graphene sheet-based electrical circuits [5]. Reduction of graphene oxide provides an alternative method to produce large quantities of reduced graphene oxide sheets (RGOS) [6]. The ease of material processing, low cost of synthesis, and mechanical flexibility make RGOS become a perfect candidate for the fabrication of electrical circuits. In addition, RGOS exhibit a highly sensitive response to the outer environment. Thus, it is meaningful to explore the electrical properties of the RGOS for application. The RGOS was prepared by chemical reduction of graphene oxide sheets (GOS). Graphene sheets can be randomly deposited on the prefabricated electrodes by drop-coating suspension to fabricate graphene sheet-based electrical circuits. However, this method is not suitable for controllable fabrication of electrical circuits. Thus, directed <b>assembly</b> of graphene <b>sheets</b> at predetermined locations is required.|$|R

This framework is based on a surface-based deformation, which calculates the vertex positions so that the mean curvature normal is preserved at each vertex in a least squares sense. While existing surface-based deformation techniques cannot simultaneously deform assembly mesh models, our method allows us to smoothly deform disconnected meshes by propagating the rotations and translations through disconnected vertices. In addition, we extend our deformation technique to handle non-manifold conditions, because shell structure models may include nonmanifold edges. We have applied our method to assembly mesh models of automobile parts. Our experimental results have shown that our method requires almost the same pre-processing time as existing methods and can deform practical assembly models interactively...|$|R
