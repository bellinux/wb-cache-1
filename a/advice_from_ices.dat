40|$|To {{categorize}} {{the current}} environmental {{health status of}} the Northeast Atlantic and the North Sea, ecological quality objectives (EcoQOs) have been formulated by OSPAR in recent years for different ecological quality elements such as the contamination of the marine environment with anthropogenic heavy metals and organochlorines. To measure it, coastal bird eggs have proven to provide a favorable matrix. In 2005, following <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> <b>ICES,</b> OSPAR agreed on the threshold concentrations proposed as EcoQOs for these two major substance groups in bird eggs. In a pilot study, residues of the heavy metal mercury (Hg) and the organochlorines PCBs (62 congeners summarized = ΣPCB), DDT and metabolites (ΣDDT), HCB and the different HCH isomers (ΣHCH) were analyzed in Common Tern Sterna hirundo or Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea and Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus eggs collected at in total 21 sites in seven nations surrounding the North Sea. For the majority of sites, sampling took place in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The methods of sampling and analyzing were performed according to internationally recognized standards (JAMP, OSPAR). The major aims of this report are: - to suggest an actualized threshold concentration for Hg for which only preliminary target values had been proposed - to test the suitability of the Arctic Tern as a potential alternative species to replace the Common Tern at sites where the latter does not occur in sufficient numbers - to present spatial contamination patterns and temporal developments - to address whether the hitherto existing EcoQO objectives are fulfilled - to give recommendations for monitoring, assessment and management of this EcoQO in the future - to mention the advantages of species and matrix {{as well as the}} limitations of the application of this EcoQO - to discuss how the preconditions for a potential inclusion of the chemical monitoring with seabird eggs into a coordinated environmental monitoring program (CEMP) can be fulfilled (see above) - to give suggestions for combining the EcoQO program with other existing or planned monitoring programs for the marine environment...|$|E

The PGCCDBS was established in 2002 {{in response to the}} EC-ICES Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) requesting ICES to provide support for the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF). It implements the ICES Quality Assurance Framework to ensure that datasets and parameters supporting assessments and advice for the ICES area are based on i) statistically-sound sampling schemes; ii) correct and consistent inter-pretation of biological material such as otoliths and gonads; iii) technology that improves accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection; iv) comprehensive and easily sourced documentation, and v) efficient collaboration between PGCCDBS, ex-pert groups and other bodies in relation to data collection. The 2012 meeting of PGCCDBS focused on work completed since last year, and planned work for 2012 and 2013, in the following topics which formed the basis of the Terms of Reference: - Stock-based biological parameters from sampling of fishery and survey catches (age, growth, maturity, fecundity, sex ratio); - Fleet/métier related variables (discards estimates and length/age composi-tions of landings and discards) and statistical design of sampling schemes; - Data collection technology (hardware, and software such as WebGR and the Regional Data bases); - Implementation of the ICES Quality Assurance Framework; - Addressing recommendations and requests for <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> <b>ICES</b> expert groups (including through PGCCDBS data contact persons), and RCMs. In addition, the PGCCDBS provided views on the revision of the Data Collection Framework, focusing on the need for statistically-sound, regional sampling pro-grammes and task-sharing to improve cost effectiveness. The PGCCDBS met in plenary with PGMed to review the outcomes {{of a wide range of}} workshops and age exchanges conducted since PGCCDBS 2011 and the workplan for 2012. On the basis of this review and the PGCCDBS long-term planning process, the following workshops and exchanges were proposed for 2013 – 2014 : - Age workshops: WKARBLUE - Workshop on Age Reading of Blue whiting (June 2013); WKNARC 2 - Workshop of National Age Readings Coordinators (May 2013); WKSABCAL - Workshop on the Statistical Analysis of Biological Calibration Studies [postponed until 2014]; WKAVSG - Workshop on Age Validation Studies for Gadoids (April 2013); WKMIAS - Workshop on Micro increment Daily Growth in European Anchovy and Sardine (October 2013). - Sampling design workshops: WKPICS 3 - Workshop on the Practical Im-plementation of Statically Sound Catch Sampling programmes (Nov. 2013). - Age exchanges (Sprat - full exchange North sea only; Mackerel - small ex-change; Herring (Norwegian spring spawner) - small exchange; Saithe -full exchange using only images; Dab - 2012 exchange postponed until 2013; Sea Bass - full exchange). - Proposals for study contracts on i) anglerfish ageing (Lophius piscatorius); ii) stock- and component related issues for the herring in the West of Scotland, West of Ireland, Irish Sea and North Sea; iii) Supporting design based regional data collection programmes. - Proposal for a series of training courses covering the design of statistically sound catch sampling for fisheries monitoring programmes, and for a theme session at the 2013 ICES Annual Science Conference – “Improving statistical survey methods for monitoring commercial catches. The PGCCDBS report also contains a full and updated list of national age readers and co-ordinators, and recommendations on ways of streamlining and improving the ef-fectiveness of the system of recommendations passed between ICES expert groups, planning groups, RCMs and DCF Liaison Meeting. The ToRs for PGCCDBS 2013 were also discussed and agreed, see Annex 15, and it was also agreed that the PGCCDBS 2013 meeting will be held in Belfast, Northern Ireland...|$|E

The PGCCDBS met in plenary with PGMed to review the outcomes {{of a wide range of}} workshops and age exchanges conducted since PGCCDBS 2012 and the workplan for 2013. On the basis of this and the PGCCDBS long term planning process, further workshops and exchanges were proposed for 2014 and beyond. These include: - Age and maturity workshops: WKSABCAL, the Workshop on the Statistical Analysis of Biological Calibration Studies (which had been postponed); WKARA, workshop on age reading of anglerfish Lophius spp will be con-sidered during the 2014 meeting, and a workshop will be proposed for 2015 if any advances in the knowledge of age reading of anglerfish have been made. - Sampling design workshops: in order to take forward the work of the series of WKPICS (Workshop on the Practical Implementation of Statistical Sound catch Sampling Programmes) and SGPIDS (Study Group on Practical Implementation of Discard Sampling Plans) which finish in 2013, PGCCDBS proposes the establishment of a Working Group on Commercial Catches to provide ongoing support for the design, implementation and analysis of sampling programmes for commercial fisheries. - Large-scale age exchanges: Whiting (Merlangius merlangus); Megrim (Lepidorhombus spp); Sole(Solea solea); Sprat (Sprattus sprattus, all areas); Horse mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel (T. picturatus and T. mediterraneus) - PGCCDBS 2013 also updated the list of national age readers and co-ordinators, and this updated list was uploaded onto the European Age Readers Forum (EARF). Other proposals developed by PGCCDBS are: - Proposals for study contracts on i) anglerfish ageing (Lophius piscatorius); ii) Study proposal on age determination and maturity staging of species not previously subjected to biological sampling for analytical assessments. - Proposal for a training course covering the design of statistically sound catch sampling for fisheries monitoring programmes - ICES cooperative research report (CRR) on the Protocols on the ageing of dif-ferent fish species in the ICES area. PGCCDBS further developed its proposal for the CRR and and developed a work plan for this. PGCCDBS developed work plans for intersessional work related to development of Quality Assurance reports for fishery sampling, including testing a prototype QA report with selected ICES stock assessment expert groups, and circulating a ques-tionnaire to collect information on national approaches to the construction and appli-cation of age-length keys. The ToR’s for PGCCDBS 2014 were also discussed and agreed, see Annex 11, and it was also agreed that the PGCCDBS 2014 meeting will be held in Constanta, Romania, Monday the 10 th of February – Friday the 14 st of February 2014...|$|E

40|$|Although {{individuals}} can derive substantial benefits from exchanging information and ideas, many individuals {{are reluctant to}} seek <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> others. We find that people are reticent to seek advice for fear of appearing incompetent. This fear, however, is misplaced. We demonstrate that individuals perceive those who seek advice as more competent {{than those who do}} not seek advice. This effect is moderated by task difficulty, advisor egocentrism, and advisor expertise. Individuals perceive those who seek advice as more competent when the task is difficult than when it is easy, when people seek <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> them personally than when they seek <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> others, and when people seek <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> experts than from non-experts or not at all...|$|R

These include: - Age and maturity workshops; - Sampling design workshops; - Large-scale age exchanges. PGCCDBS 2014 also updated the list of national age readers and co-ordinators, and this updated list was uploaded onto the European Age Readers Forum (EARF). Other proposals developed by PGCCDBS are: * Proposals for study contracts on - Collaborative Study on anglerfish (Priority 1) - Collaborative Study on improvement of WebGR (Priority 1) - Improving accuracy in fish age estimation through understanding of the link between environmental conditions and physiological responses recorded in the otolith macrostructure (Priority 2) - Exploration and Development of new facilities in RDB-FishFrame 5. 0 (Priority 1) - Support design based regional data collection programmes (Priority 1) PGCCDBS further developed a work plan for intersessional work to more widely test prototype Quality Assurance reports for fishery sampling with selected ICES stock as-sessment expert groups, for evaluation by WGCATCH in November 2014. The new ICES Working Group on Commercial Catches (WGCATCH) and the Working Group on Biological Parameters (WGBIOP) will take over many of the responsibilities of PGCCDBS. Cessation of PGCCDBS would lose many other important capabilities. A proposal was developed for a major revision of the PG to focus more on the end use of data. Renamed as the Planning Group on Data Needs for Assessment and Advice (PGDATA), the new group would: design a Quality Assurance Framework for assess-ment EGs to evaluate data quality and its impact on assessments, particularly within the benchmarking process, and test this in regional case studies; develop and test ana-lytical methods for identifying improvements in data quality, or collections of new data, that have the greatest impacts on the quality of advice; engage with end users (ICES EGs & SSGs, RCMs/RCGs; stakeholder Advisory Committees, STECF, European Commission and other RFMOs) to raise awareness of what types and resolution of management decisions (e. g. by fleet or area) can realistically be supported by present or proposed data collections; advise on objective methods to apply criteria (e. g. as pro-posed by STECF EWG 13 - 02 on Review of DC-MAP) for evaluating requests by end-users for new or amended data collections within the new DCF/DC-MAP; and plan workshops and studies focused on specific methodological development needs.
