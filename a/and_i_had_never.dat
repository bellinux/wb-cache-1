'Hound Dog' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen her get up and be moved so much by anything. It really impressed me, {{the power of the}} music. I started getting records immediately after that." [...] By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as [...] "mesmerizing... like someone from another planet." [...] After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School.|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever {{you have to do to}} get me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E

There was no ill-intent on my part <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen ever, in 43 years of having a security clearance, a covert operative's name in a memo.

2500|$|His {{student and}} collaborator, Vladimir Steklov, {{recalled}} his first lecture {{in the following}} way: [...] "A handsome young man, almost {{of the age of}} the other students, came before the audience, where there was also the old Dean, professor Levakovsky, who was respected by all students. After the Dean had left, the young man with a trembled voice started to lecture a course on the dynamics of material points, instead of a course on dynamical systems. This subject was already known to the students from the lectures of professor Delarue. But what Lyapunov taught us was new to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen this material in any textbook. All antipathy to the course was immediately blown to dust. From that day students would show Lyapunov a special respect." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{investigation}} by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, undercover video was obtained of kosher slaughtering practices at a major kosher slaughterhouse run by Agriprocessors in Postville, Iowa. The methods used there involved clamping the animals into a box which is then inverted for slaughter, followed by partial dismemberment of the animal before it was dead. Those methods have been condemned as unnecessarily cruel by PETA and others, including Grandin and the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, but are endorsed by the Orthodox Union, which supervises the slaughterhouse. An investigation by the USDA resulted in some minor operational changes. A lawsuit under Iowa law is pending. Grandin's comment was [...] "I {{thought it was the}} most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> ever seen that kind of procedure done before. ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prohibition}} of stunning {{and the treatment}} of the slaughtered animal expressed in shechita law limits the extent to which Jewish slaughterhouses can industrialize their procedures. The most industrialized attempt at a kosher slaughterhouse, Agriprocessors of Postville, Iowa, became the center of controversy in 2004, after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released a gruesome undercover video of cattle struggling to their feet with their tracheas and esophagi ripped out after shechita. Some of the cattle actually got up and stood {{for a minute or so}} after being dumped from the rotating pen. Dr. Temple Grandin, told Mason City, Iowa's Globe Gazette, [...] "I thought it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> ever seen that kind of procedure done before. … I've seen kosher slaughter really done right, so the problem here is not kosher slaughter. The problem here is a plant that is doing everything wrong they can do wrong." [...] While Agriprocessors has been criticized by both secular and Jewish organizations for both its human and animal rights violations, the Jewish Orthodox Union (OU) made note to point out that the kashrut of a product is not contingent upon [...] "the conditions in which it is produced. [...] The OU's condonation of Agriprocessors as a possibly inhumane, yet appropriately glatt kosher company has led to discussion as to whether or not industrialized agriculture has undermined the place of halakha (Jewish law) in shechita as well as whether or not halakha has any place at all in Jewish ritual slaughter.|$|E
