500|$|Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits was {{announced}} on March 5, 2009, and released on June 9, 2009. Reflecting its title, Modern Hits incorporates songs published {{within the last}} five years of its release, and the developers had to balance what songs were included {{in order to make a}} setlist with a wide appeal. The engine of the game has no major changes, but Vicarious Visions stated that it has continued to work on strum detection on the DS touchpad to meet a wide range of playstyles. The interface, however, has been revised over the previous two On Tour titles to feature a more modernized look (particularly in-game on the touch screen side). The game includes a new single player career progression using [...] "Fan Requests" [...] to create a new non-linear progression through the songs in the games. These were added to help move away from gameplay that was [...] "just going, playing a venue, and then moving on to the next one" [...] and instead to [...] "open the world up". The developers also noted that the Fan Requests helped to tap into the way that players had previously played games in the series, setting their own personal goals for certain songs. Audio designer Jason Willey created the game's theme song (titled [...] "S.U.P.R.A.H.U.M.A.N.") through his two-man band, Protoshredanoid, to capture the Modern Hits theme of the game, and after demonstrating <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song to the rest of the team, were asked to create the whole song. The theme song was released as a free download for Guitar Hero World Tour the week before the game's release.|$|E

2500|$|The Maha Bodhi Society (MBS) was {{established}} by Acharya Buddharakkhita in 1956 at Bangalore {{with the objective of}} propagating the teachings of the Buddha and to provide the inspiration and facilities for putting that teaching into practice through spiritual, social, educational activities. The first act of the Acharya was to plant <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holy Bodhi tree from Bodh Gaya at the premises of the proposed Society. This tree has grown with the Society and is venerated. The Maha Bodhi Society Temple, a relatively new structure, was then built with the main shrine replicating the historic tower at Bodh Gaya. Temple as built is a brick structure with a central tower of [...] height. The Stupa that represents a basic factor in the teaching of the Buddha has also been built {{at the entrance to the}} temple, which is made of granite and it enshrines a relic of the Buddha. The temple, the stupa and the Bodhi tree in the temple complex now form a unique landmark in Bangalore.
