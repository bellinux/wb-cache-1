5|$|The most fertile period (the {{time with}} the highest {{likelihood}} of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation. In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second {{and the beginning of}} the third week. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness.|$|E

5|$|A lead atom has 82 electrons, {{arranged}} in an electron configuration of 4f145d106s26p2. The combined {{first and second}} ionization energies—the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons—is close to that of tin, lead's upper neighbor in the carbon group. This is unusual; ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus, and more shielded by smaller orbitals. The similarity of ionization energies {{is caused by the}} lanthanide contraction—the decrease in element radii from lanthanum (atomic number 57) to lutetium (71), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> small radii of the elements after hafnium (72). This is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide 4f electrons. The combined first four ionization energies of lead exceed those of tin, contrary to what periodic trends would predict. Relativistic effects, which become significant in heavier atoms, contribute to this behavior. One such effect is the inert pair effect: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long.|$|E
5|$|According to Schwarz et al., seven traits unite K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, and {{separate}} them from other species referred to Theriosuchus. These include {{the presence of}} only two unique tooth morphotypes; the choanae being placed in shallow grooves rather than a bowl-like depression; the relatively wide top of the skull; the presence of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> limited contact between the lacrimal and nasal. Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs from other species in lacking teeth with low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest {{on the side of}} the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and the front of the squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{reserves}} of crude oil are non-commercial, Jordan has the 5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world, which could be commercially exploited in the central and northwestern regions of the country. Official figures estimate the kingdom's oil shale reserves at more than 70 billion tonnes. Attarat Power Plant, which will start construction in late 2017, is a $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant that will be completed in 2020 with a total capacity of 470 megawatts. The project {{is part of the}} kingdom's visionary plan that aims to diversify its energy resources by 2025.

5|$|Due to the unanticipated {{relocation}} of Arlene, only one tropical cyclone watch or warninga tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Brownsville to Matagorda on June19was ever {{issued by the}} NHC {{in association with the}} cyclone. Issued 21hours before landfall, the warning was discontinued after the system moved inland. Prior to the warning, Arlene had satisfied the criterion for a tropical storm watch as a developing tropical depression. However, the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the watch {{as a result of the}} poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time. Given the weak nature of Arlene <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> unpopulated extent of coast which it impacted, evacuations were minimal – only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola, Texas due to the threat of flooding.|$|E
5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded {{increased}} pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Mainframe {{computers}} are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely {{available to the}} general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.|$|E

5|$|Mayflies are {{distributed}} {{all over the}} world in clean freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. They tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropic ecozone, while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds.|$|E
5|$|The Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) is the all-university {{undergraduate}} {{student government}} of Michigan State University. It is unusual amongst university student governments for its decentralized bicameral structure, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> non-existent {{influence of the}} Greek system. The structure has since changed to a single General Assembly as part of reorganization in the late 2000s. ASMSU representatives are nonpartisan and many are elected in noncompetitive races. Their mission is to enhance the individual and collective student experience through education, empowerment, and advocacy by education {{to the needs and}} interest of students. Some services they offer include: free blue books, low cost copies and printing, free yearbooks, interest free loans, funding for student organizations, free legal consultation, and iClicker and graphing calculator rentals.|$|E
5|$|In January1975, Caltrans {{presented}} {{plans to}} realign SR76 away from Mission Avenue {{and move it}} to {{the south side of}} the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, at the start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR76 would be delayed because of the funding issues <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the environmental impact report. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.|$|E

5|$|Klein was {{appointed}} general of division in 1799 {{and crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl in Jean-Baptiste Jourdans Army of the Danube. He commanded the right flank of the Advance Guard, under command of François Joseph Lefebvre. His command included the 4th and 5th Hussar Regiments, the 17th Dragoons, the 1st Chasseurs à cheval, a light horse regiment, two companies of horse artillery, two of foot artillery, and a company of sappers. At the Battle of Ostrach, Klein's cavalry helped to secure the village of Hosskirch, a strategically important forward post, prior to the general engagement. After the French losses at Ostrach and the subsequent Battle of Stockach, Jourdan ordered a general withdrawal to the Black Forest. The reserve cavalry and most of Klein's division crossed the mountains and quartered near Offenburg, where their horses could find better forage. Despite the organized withdrawal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> secure positions {{on the western side}} of the Black Forest, the army was in shambles. Jourdan placed his chief of staff Jean Augustin Ernouf in provisional command and went to Paris to complain about the state of his army, its equipment and its provisions. Discipline in the ranks disintegrated. Most of the divisional generals left their posts, except for Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino, Joseph Souham, Dominique Vandamme and Klein. In May, Andre Massena received overall command of both the Army of the Danube and the Army of Helvetia; Klein's column joined Massena near Zurich.|$|E
