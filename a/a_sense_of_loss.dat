5|$|The {{significance}} of the events at Beaumont-Hamel {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme was perhaps most strongly felt by the Dominion of Newfoundland, as it was the first great conflict experienced by that dominion. Newfoundland was left with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> that marked an entire generation. The effects on the post-war generation were compounded by chronic financial problems caused both by Newfoundland's large debt from the war, and a prolonged post-war economic recession due to a decline in the fisheries.|$|E
25|$|The {{preservation}} of local varieties in Singapore {{has been of}} increasing concern in Singapore since the 2000s, especially among the younger generation of Chinese youths. This sudden revival of other varieties can mainly {{be attributed to a}} feeling of disconnection between the younger and the elder generations, as well as <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of identity from their own linguistic roots for many others. While more work has to be put in to revive these varieties, the recent 2014 Singapore Teochew Festival held in Ngee Ann City can be regarded as a positive sign that more people are becoming more actively involved in reconnecting with their linguistic roots.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway's {{descriptions}} of the Michigan landscape, {{which would have been}} familiar to him as in his youth he summered at the family's Walloon Lake cottage in Northern Michigan, are presented in a vague and dreamlike manner. Ronald Berman sees Hemingway's treatment of landscape as like a painter's canvas on which he presents Nick's state of mind. The {{descriptions of}} the river's water have been compared to American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau's {{descriptions of the}} pond in Walden. Biographer Meyers sees the story as a blend of American primitivism and sophistication; Nick evidences <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> which is [...] "not simply grace under pressure—but under siege". Nature is perceived as good and civilization as bad—a pervasive theme in American literature, found in such American classics as Mark Twain's 19th-century Huckleberry Finn and in William Faulkner's 20th-century Go Down, Moses.|$|E

500|$|David Julyan {{composed}} the film's synthesized score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as Vangelis's Blade Runner and Hans Zimmer's The Thin Red Line. While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds {{to differentiate between}} the color and black-and-white scenes: [...] "brooding and classical" [...] themes in the former, and [...] "oppressive and rumbly noise" [...] in the latter. Since he describes the entire score as [...] "Leonard's theme", Julyan says, [...] "The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> you feel {{but at the same}} time you don't know what it is you have lost, a sense of being adrift." [...] Initially, Nolan wanted to use Radiohead's [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights. Instead, David Bowie's [...] "Something in the Air" [...] is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of [...] "Treefingers", is included on the film's soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|The five [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{are often}} {{interpreted}} as representing Wordsworth's opposing views {{of nature as}} well as meditations on the cycle of life. They describe a variety of relationships between humanity and nature. For example, Lucy {{can be seen as}} a connection between humanity and nature, as a [...] "boundary being, nature sprite and human, yet not quite either. She reminds us of the traditional mythical person who lives, ontologically, an intermediate life, or mediates various realms of existence." [...] Although the poems evoke <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss,</b> they also hint at the completeness of Lucy's life—she was raised by nature and survives in the memories of others. She became, in the opinion of the American poet and writer David Ferry (b. 1924), [...] "not so much a human being as a sort of compendium of nature", while [...] "her death was right, after all, for by dying she was one with the natural processes that made her die, and fantastically ennobled thereby".|$|E
500|$|Poulenc {{turned to}} opera {{only in the}} latter half of his career. Having {{achieved}} fame by his early twenties, he was in his forties before attempting his first opera. He attributed this to the need for maturity before tackling the subjects he chose to set. In 1958 he told an interviewer, [...] "When I was 24 I was able to write Les biches [...] it is obvious that unless a composer of 30 has the genius of a Mozart or the precociousness of Schubert he couldn't write The Carmelites– the problems are too profound." [...] In Sams's view, all three of Poulenc's operas display a depth of feeling far distant from [...] "the cynical stylist of the 1920s": Les mamelles de Tirésias (1947), despite the riotous plot, is full of nostalgia and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> In the two avowedly serious operas, Dialogues des Carmélites (1957) and La Voix humaine (1959), in which Poulenc depicts deep human suffering, Sams sees a reflection of the composer's own struggles with depression.|$|E

500|$|After her miscarriage, much of {{the hostility}} from the family evaporates, with the {{exception}} of J.R. He openly despises her and her brother. In 1979, Pam is told by Digger's doctor that Digger was a carrier of neurofibromatosis, and that she and Cliff, as his children, were carriers; as neurofibromatosis is a potentially fatal disease to infants. Ironically, Pam soon discovers she is pregnant again. As before, however, tragedy strikes as a rattlesnake frightens Pam's horse when she is out riding and throws her, causing a second miscarriage. [...] In 1980, Pam watches Digger die slowly and painfully {{as a result of his}} decades of heavy drinking. On Digger's deathbed, he tells Pam that she's not his biological child, but born after an affair her mother had with Hutch McKinney. Overwhelmed by <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> after Digger's death and deathbed confession, she pushes to find out more about what happened to her mother. She develops a notion – a dream born out of grief – that perhaps her mother isn't dead after all. Then a private investigator turns up evidence that her mother had not died as Digger had believed, but was alive in Houston. Meanwhile, Bobby has taken over Ewing Oil while J.R. is convalescing after being shot. Pam watches her husband get deeper and deeper into the heart of business in an effort to prove himself, and takes note of Bobby's instinctive attraction to power, which she realizes might be a danger to their marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Connected to {{the concept}} of holding is what Winnicott called the anti-social tendency, {{something}} which he argued [...] "may be found in a normal individual, or in one that is neurotic or psychotic". The delinquent child (Winnicott thought) was looking for a sense of secure holding lacking in their family of origins from society at large. He considered antisocial behaviour as a cry for help, fuelled by <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of integrity, when the familial holding environment was inadequate or ruptured.|$|E
40|$|Harold Pinter's Ashes to Ashes (1996) {{addresses}} different notions such as gender, politics, {{masculinity and}} language.   Julia Kristeva's theory of melancholia and depression, {{as one of}} the most important psychological theories, strives to elaborate the condition of melancholic subject. She remarks that the melancholic subject, unable to share her / his melancholia with others, suffers from <b>an</b> unsignified <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> which causes her / his psyche to be wounded. Ashes to Ashes explores the melancholic condition of the female protagonist who suffers from <b>an</b> unsignified <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> This study is an attempt to trace the signs of melancholia — regarding Kristeva's theory of melancholia — which reveal through Rebecca's fragmented dialogues, dream-like memories and tense monologues. </p...|$|R

However, in his biography Moyles goes on to say that he mended his relationship with Peel and felt <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> that he had not got to know him before his death.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} of their second studio album Hook Me Up in 2007, The Veronicas gained success with their first Australian number-one hit [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] and their global {{breakthrough}} song [...] "Untouched". To support the album, the duo embarked on two tours: the Australian Hook Me Up Tour and their global Revenge Is Sweeter Tour in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Once touring had ended in 2010 they had enough of promoting the album and were [...] "ready to move on." [...] Feeling <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of identity and a need to rediscover themselves Jessica and Lisa decided to part ways temporarily.

2500|$|MTV Unplugged in New York was {{released}} on November 1, 1994. The following week, it debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 and sold 310,500 copies, which was the highest first-week sales of Nirvana's career. The album received positive reviews from critics. Q magazine said that as an acoustic ensemble, the band sounded [...] "most moving, possessed of a ragged glory", while Rolling Stone found the record [...] "stirring and occasionally brilliant" [...] with [...] "spare and gorgeous spots everywhere", highlighting the band's chemistry on [...] "All Apologies" [...] and Cobain's unaccompanied performance of [...] "Pennyroyal Tea". Ben Thompson from Mojo felt that unlike most [...] "unplugged" [...] releases, the format's [...] "colourless, generic aspect" [...] and not seeing the actual performance benefits Nirvana's record because of how intense it seems in light of Cobain's death. In Entertainment Weekly, David Browne also felt unsettled listening to it: [...] "Beyond inducing <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> for Cobain himself, Unplugged elicits a feeling of musical loss, too: The delicacy and intimacy of these acoustic rearrangements hint at where Nirvana (or at least Cobain, who was said to be frustrated with the limitations of the band) could have gone." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre, {{the poem is}} an ode, {{which makes it a}} poem that is both prayer and {{contains}} a celebration of its subject. However, this celebration is mixed with questioning and this hinders the continuity of the poem. The poem is also related to the elegy in that it mourns the loss of childhood vision, and the title page of the 1807 edition emphasises the influence of Virgil's Eclogue 4. Wordsworth's use of the elegy, in his poems including the [...] "Lucy" [...] poems, parts of The Excursion, and others, focus on individuals that protect themselves from <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> by turning to nature or time. He also rejects any kind of fantasy that would take him away from reality while accepting both death and the loss of his own abilities to time while mourning over the loss. However, the elegy is traditionally a private poem while Wordsworth's ode is more public in nature. The poem is also related to the genre of apocalyptic writing in that it focuses on what is seen or the lack of sight. Such poems emphasise the optical sense and were common to many poems written by the Romantic poets, including his own poem The Ruined Cottage, Coleridge's [...] "" [...] and Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Percy Bysshe Shelley's Hymn to Intellectual Beauty and The Zucca.|$|E
