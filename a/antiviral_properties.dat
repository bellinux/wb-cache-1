2500|$|Ribavirin is {{possibly}} best {{viewed as a}} ribosyl purine analogue with an incomplete purine 6-membered ring.

Such 5' imidazole riboside derivatives show antiviral activity with 5' hydrogen or halide, but the larger the substituent, the smaller the activity, and all proved less active than ribavirin.

40|$|IFITMs are broad {{antiviral}} {{factors that}} block incoming virions in endosomal vesicles, protecting target cells from infection. In {{the case of}} HIV- 1, we and others reported {{the existence of an}} additional antiviral mechanism through which IFITMs lead to the production of virions of reduced infectivity. However, whether this second mechanism of inhibition is unique to HIV or extends to other viruses is currently unknown. To address this question, we have analyzed the susceptibility of a broad spectrum of viruses to the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity by IFITMs. The results we have gathered indicate that this second <b>antiviral</b> <b>property</b> of IFITMs extends well beyond HIV {{and we were able to}} identify viruses susceptible to the three IFITMs altogether (HIV- 1, SIV, MLV, MPMV, VSV, MeV, EBOV, WNV), as well as viruses that displayed a member-specific susceptibility (EBV, DUGV), or were resistant to all IFITMs (HCV, RVFV, MOPV, AAV). The swapping of genetic elements between resistant and susceptible viruses allowed us to point to specificities in the viral mode of assembly, rather than glycoproteins as dominant factors of susceptibility. However, we also show that, contrarily to X 4 -, R 5 -tropic HIV- 1 envelopes confer resistance against IFITM 3, suggesting that viral receptors add an additional layer of complexity in the IFITMs-HIV interplay. Lastly, we show that the overall antiviral effects ascribed to IFITMs during spreading infections, are the result of a bimodal inhibition in which IFITMs act both by protecting target cells from incoming viruses and in driving the production of virions of reduced infectivity. Overall, our study reports for the first time that the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity is a conserved <b>antiviral</b> <b>property</b> of IFITMs and establishes IFITMs as a paradigm of restriction factor capable of interfering with two distinct phases of a virus life cycle...|$|R
2500|$|The VP24 and VP35 [...] {{structural}} proteins of EBOV play a {{key role}} in this interference. When a cell is infected with EBOV, receptors located in the cell's cytosol (such as RIG-I and MDA5) or outside of the cytosol (such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9), recognize infectious molecules associated with the virus. On TLR activation, proteins including interferon regulatory factor 3 and interferon regulatory factor 7 trigger a signaling cascade that leads to the expression of type 1 interferons. The type 1 interferons are then released and bind to the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptors expressed on the surface of a neighboring cell. Once interferon has bound to its receptors on the neighboring cell, the signaling proteins STAT1 and STAT2 are activated and move to the cell's nucleus. This triggers the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which code for proteins with <b>antiviral</b> <b>properties.</b> EBOV's V24 protein blocks the production of these antiviral proteins by preventing the STAT1 signaling protein in the neighboring cell from entering the nucleus. The VP35 protein directly inhibits the production of interferon-beta. By inhibiting these immune responses, EBOV may quickly spread throughout the body.|$|E

Confocal microscopy of actin and tubulin redistribution was also performed.

The confocal microscopy result showed increase in the tubulin intensity (79. 6 %) of infected BHK 21 cells treated with the ligand, compared with the non-treated cells (54. 8 %).

Continuous treatment or short-term pretreatment of uninfected CD 4 -expressing human T-cell lines with 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT) reduces the ability of these cells to participate in syncytium formation when mixed with chronically infected cells. The effect of AZT on syncytium formation is observed both as a {{reduction in the number of}} syncytia and as a reduction in the size of the syncytia that are detected.

Maximum syncytium reduction is observed with the continuous presence of AZT; however, pretreatment for times as short as 15 min results in a significant reduction in syncytium formation.
