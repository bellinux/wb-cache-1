500|$|Homer is [...] "a (happy) {{slave to}} his various appetites", and would gladly sell his {{soul to the}} devil in {{exchange}} for a single donut. He has an apparently vacuous mind but at times exhibits a surprising depth of knowledge about various subjects, such as the composition of the Supreme Court of the United States, Incan mythology, bankruptcy law, and cell biology. Homer's brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed, however, by much longer and consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a low IQ of 55 which has variously been attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene" [...] (which eventually causes every male member of the family to become incredibly stupid), his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive cranial trauma, and a crayon lodged in the frontal lobe of his brain. In the episode [...] "HOMR" [...] (season 12, 2001) Homer gets surgery to remove the (newly discovered) crayon from his brain, boosting his IQ to 105, but although he bonds very well with Lisa, his newfound capacity for understanding and reason makes him less happy <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> Moe to reinsert a crayon, causing his intelligence to return to its previous level. Homer often debates with his own mind, which is expressed in voiceover. His brain has a record of giving him dubious advice, sometimes helping him make the right decisions, but often failing spectacularly. It has even become completely frustrated and, through sound effects, walked out on him. Homer's conversations with his brain were used several times during the fourth season, but were later phased out after the producers [...] "used every possible permutation". These exchanges were often introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work on.|$|E

500|$|Season four began {{expanding}} on {{the series}} long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You have to ask yourself, in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always [...] "go for the prize".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long {{to tell the story}} of what happened with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." [...] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] was also the name of an American basketball player.|$|E
500|$|During {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Edwards was key in Accrington's strong {{defensive}} record, with the team conceding just one goal in their first seven league fixtures. In October 2010, Edwards scored his first and second goals of the season when he scored twice from the penalty spot in Accrington's 7–4 home win against Gillingham. He scored his third goal of the 2010–11 season in a 4–2 home defeat to Cheltenham Town, scoring a penalty in the 88th minute, only serving as a consolation with Accrington 4–1 down at the time. Three days later, on 2 November 2010, Edwards scored from the penalty spot again, this time in a 5–2 away defeat at eventual champions Chesterfield. His fifth goal of the season came courtesy of a 21st-minute penalty in a 1–1 draw at Bradford City, before he scored another goal at Morecambe in a 2–1 away win on 1 January 2011. A month later, on 1 February, Edwards scored yet again against Morecambe, this time in a 1–1 home draw, salvaging a point by scoring a late penalty. His eighth goal of the campaign came three weeks later, scoring a header from Charlie Barnett's cross in the 82nd minute to give Accrington a 2–1 away win at Wycombe, their first win in five league matches. Edwards took his goal tally into double figures when he scored two first-half penalties in a 3–0 home win against Stockport County on 8 March 2011. He missed a penalty in a 3–1 defeat at Gillingham four days later, before scoring three days later in a 3–1 home win against Burton Albion — scoring from six yards out following good work from Terry Gornell. He scored his twelfth goal of the season with an 82nd-minute penalty in a 3–1 win against Southend United on 5 April 2011, moving Accrington into the play-off places in League Two. Three days later, Edwards scored again from the penalty spot, scoring a 79th-minute penalty to give Accrington the lead against ten man Macclesfield Town, although a late goal courtesy of Vinny Mukendi earned Macclesfield a point. Accrington cemented a place in the League Two play-offs after finishing fifth, Edwards played in both of the semi-final matches against Stevenage, which Accrington lost by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. Edwards scored a total of 13 goals from defence in 51 appearances during Accrington's 2010–11 campaign, finishing as Accrington's joint top goalscorer for the season alongside Terry Gornell and Sean McConville. He was offered a two-year contract extension {{at the end of the}} season. Accrington assistant manager Jimmy Bell stated [...] "Phil has been offered a good deal and we're quietly confident, although there have been a few rumours about one or two clubs being interested. But Phil has been here since he was young, he can't drive, he gets looked after by the club <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> lifts in to training, so he feels quite settled here".
