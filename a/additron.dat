By the time Rogers Majestic pushed Kates to develop a working model for the Exhibition, he had been working on the tubes for a year, developing several revisions, and the University of Toronto team felt that the development was too slow to attempt to integrate them into the UTEC.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known publicly demonstrated {{electronic game}} {{was created in}} 1950. Bertie the Brain was an arcade game of tic-tac-toe, built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. To showcase his new miniature vacuum tube, the <b>additron</b> tube, he designed a specialized computer to use it, which he built {{with the assistance of}} engineers from Rogers Majestic. The large metal computer, which was four meters tall, could only play tic-tac-toe on a lightbulb-backed display, and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 to September 9, 1950. The game was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players. After the exhibition, Bertie was dismantled, and [...] "largely forgotten" [...] as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects {{at the same time that}} he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Additron</b> was an {{electron}} tube designed by Dr. Josef Kates, circa 1950, {{to replace the}} several individual electron tubes and support components required to perform the function of a single bit digital full adder.

50|$|The {{electronic}} {{function of}} the Computron design incorporated steered, rather than gated, multiple electron beams. Additionally, the Computron {{was based on the}} ability of a secondary electron emission target, under electron bombardment, to assume the potential of the nearest collector electrode. The <b>Additron</b> Tube design by Josef Kates gated electron beams of a fixed trajectory with several control grids which either passed or blocked a current. The Computron was a complex cathode ray tube while the <b>Additron</b> was a triode with multiple grids and targets.|$|E

He then spent time working for Rogers Vacuum Tube Company, (now Royal Philips Electronics), for the next 4 years in the development and manufacturing of radar and radio tubes. This background gave him a solid foundation on which to pursue his work in 1948 at the University of Toronto, Computation Centre where he participated in the design and building of UTEC the first pilot model of a computer built in Canada. Dr. Kates also built the first digital game playing machine (Bertie the Brain) which was exhibited at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition and which used a special electron tube of his own design, the <b>Additron</b> Tube. He also designed Toronto's automated traffic signalling system in 1954 - the first in the world.|$|E
