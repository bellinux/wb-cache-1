5000|$|Currently, CBTI {{programs}} {{fall into}} one of two categories: <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> programs or automated assessment programs. <b>Actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> programs are based on statistical or actuarial prediction (e.g., statistical analyses, linear regression equations and Bayesian rules), which is empirically based while automated assessment programs consist of a series of if-then statements derived by expert clinicians and informed by published research and clinical experience. For the purposes of this article, both types will be referred to as computer-based test interpretations (CBTIs). The use of CBTIs is found in a variety of psychological domains (e.g., clinical interviewing and problem rating), but is most commonly utilized in personality and neuropsychological assessments. [...] This article will focus on the use of CBTIs in personality assessment, most commonly using the MMPI and its subsequent revised editions.|$|E
5000|$|The health {{management}} system (HMS) is an evolutionary medicine regulative process proposed by Nicholas Humphrey [...] in which <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> of fitness and economic-type cost-benefit analysis determines the body’s regulation of its physiology and health. This incorporation of cost-benefit calculations into body regulation provides a science grounded approach to mind-body phenomena such as placebos that are otherwise not explainable by low level, noneconomic, and purely feedback based homeostatic or allostatic theories.|$|E

The expected revenues were broken down into Government's direct contribution (approximately $39,273,000); premium contributions (approximately $28,825,000); and revenue from investment returns, co-payments and surcharges (approximately $6,210,000). [...] Under some pressure from the public, the Government requested a fresh <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> in 2015.

40|$|In 2008, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services Bureau of Elderly and Adult Services (BEAS) and the National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD), {{with funding}} {{provided}} by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), collaborated to construct an <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessment</b> to classify BEAS clients by their likelihood of elder maltreatment and/or self-neglect in the future. Studies in adult and juvenile corrections and child welfare have demonstrated that active service intervention with high risk clients can reduce criminal recidivism and the recurrence of child maltreatment (Wagner, Hull, & Luttrell, 1995; Eisenberg & Markley, 1987; Baird, Heinz, & Bemus, 1981). The purpose {{of this research was}} to examine a large set of individual and referral characteristics, determine their relationship to subsequent elder self-neglect and/or maltreatment, and develop an <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessment</b> for BEAS workers to complete {{at the end of an}} investigation to inform their case decisions. BEAS and NCCD pursued development of an <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessment</b> with the goal of reducing subsequent maltreatment of elderly and vulnerable adults who have been involved in an incident of self-neglect or maltreatment by another person (i. e., abuse, exploitation, or neglect). The <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessment</b> described in this report provides BEAS workers with a method to more accurately identify high risk clients and therefore more effectively target service interventions in an effort to protect their most vulnerable clients...|$|R
50|$|Computer-based test {{interpretation}} (CBTI) {{programs are}} technological tools {{that have been}} commonly used to interpret data in psychological assessments since the 1960s. CBTI programs are used for a myriad of psychological tests, like clinical interviews or problem rating, but are most frequently exercised in psychological and neuropsychological assessments. CBTI programs are either empirically based or clinically based. The empirically based programs, or <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> programs, use statistical analyses to interpret the data, while the clinically based programs, or automated assessment programs, rely on information from expert clinicians and research. Although CBTI programs are successful in test-retest reliability, there have been major concerns and criticisms regarding the programs' ability to assess inter-rater and internal consistency reliability. Research {{has shown that the}} validity of CBTI programs has not been confirmed, due to the varying reports of individual programs. CBTI programs are very efficient in that they save time, reduce human error, are cost effective, and are objective/reliable, yet limited in that they are not always used by adequately trained evaluators or are not integrated with multiple sources of data. As technology continues to transform our modern society, computer-based interpretation programs have the possibility to expand their software and even alleviate some of the current concerns with the programs' methodology.|$|E

40|$|Recidivism {{within the}} sexually violent {{predator}} (SVP) population has gained worldwide attention {{because of the}} lack of protection offered to the victims that may lead to loss of life. Behavioral theory suggests that accuracy of predictive behaviors based on empirical judgement is more reliable than that based on clinical judgement. The purpose of this research was to see whether three <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> tools, Static- 99, PCL-R, and MnSOST-R, could predict recidivism and whether the combination of the three-increased predictive value in the Texas SVP population. As yet, the literature provides no evidence. The Texas Open Record System provided assessment scores and violations of 90 SVPs committed during fiscal years 2009 - 2013. Texas had 58. 9 % violated commitment laws within the SVP population of the civil commitment program. The scores on these three assessment tools were analyzed along with the violations using bivariate logistic regression. According to the results, Static- 99, PCL-R, and MnSOST-R can, in combination, predict recidivism better than any tool by itself in the Texas SVP. However, individually, only the PCL-R approached significance as a predictor. This study could lead to positive social change in both the targeted treatment of labeled SVP and in the accuracy of predicting recidivism among SVPs. Therapists should use the three <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> tools when developing treatment plans, intervention techniques, and when adjusting supervision requirements to assist in both targeted treatment and to reduce the number of victims...|$|E

50|$|Risks {{can come}} from various sources {{including}} uncertainty in financial markets, threats from project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters, deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause.

Several risk management standards have been developed including the Project Management Institute, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, actuarial societies, and ISO standards.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{opinions}} of judges and probation officers on the inclusion of risk assessment information in pre-sentence reports. This thesis analyzes data related to opinions on risk obtained through interviews, questionnaires, and pre-sentence reports. This data was collected within a national project examining the overall use of pre-sentence reports in Canada. The introduction also provides a brief overview of the role of pre-sentence reports in the Canadian judicial system, the role of risk in criminal justice, and experience in England and Wales, New Zealand, and Australia relating to the implementation of guidelines for the use of <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessments</b> by probation offices. Results indicate that both judges and probation officers strongly endorse the importance of information on an offender's risk of recidivism in the sentencing process, particularly in cases involving violence. Both judges and probation officers also expressed a preference for a narrative assessment process in interviews. However, <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessments</b> were used and identified as important in the majority of pre-sentence reports examined. Despite agreement as to its importance, there is currently a great deal of variation in the presentation of risk information across Canada.

40|$|The present article {{discusses}} {{the three main}} approaches to violence risk assessment, clinical judgement, <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment,</b> and structured clinical judgement, informing the reader of the comparative benefits and short-comings of these methods of violence risk assessment. In particular, the present article highlights the controversy within the literature surrounding clinical judgement in comparison to actuarial assessments of violence risk, and proposes that the statistically significant ‘improvements ’ of violence prediction when using actuarial scales in comparison to clinical predictions of dangerousness do not necessarily measure the skill of the clinician adequately. Specifically, an assessment of ‘dangerousness ’ does not equal a prediction of violent recidivism. It is argued that clinicians are not predictive forecasters of risk, as in actuarial scales, but are, rather, trained to manage risk.

40|$|As {{evidenced}} by {{the passage of the}} Adam Walsh Act and the comprehensive media coverage of several high-profile cases, 2 ̆ 2 The prediction of criminal behavior is {{perhaps one of the most}} central issues in the criminal justice system 2 ̆ 2 (Andrews 2 ̆ 6 Bonta, 1998, p. 211). Recent research has generally documented the superiority of actuarial prediction over clinical judgment in decision-making across various domains including risk assessment (Harris, et al., 1993; Grove 2 ̆ 6 Meehl, 1996; Grove, et al., 2000). Several actuarial sexual recidivism risk assessment tools are now well-established (e. g.

In response to this debate, many clinicians have argued for the use of adjusted <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment.</b> However, there is currently not a single study documenting the accuracy of adjusted actuarial risk assessment.;The current examines the impact of these overrides on predictive accuracy. Specifically, the study examines the overall accuracy of the purely actuarial assessments versus the adjusted actuarial assessments. Because adjusted <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> is more costly in terms of personnel and time and because it opens the door for subjective bias, justification for this method should require it to result in significantly greater accuracy that purely actuarial adjustment.;The full sample for this study was comprised of 383 cases in which there had been a clinical override of the Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool-Revised (MnSOST-R) in the assigned risk level. ROC Analyses indicated that adjusting MnSOST-R actuarial risk levels based on clinical factors did not result in increased accuracy. Although MnSOST-R levels were nominally more accurate than adjusted risk levels, the difference was not significant. There was no evidence that the direction of the adjustment significantly affected accuracy. These results must be considered to be exploratory because of the small number of sexual recidivists (19) due to the short period of follow-up, which was as short as 2 to 3 years for many in the sample...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} UK House of Lords (Wells v Wells [1999] AC 345), the Ogden Tables (tables of actuarial multipliers) effectively became {{the primary source of}} assessing future loss in personal injury litigation. In 2003, the Hong Kong Ogden Tables (based on Hong Kong mortality rates) were published. There are two major actuarial assumptions underlying the multipliers in the Ogden Tables: (1) the survival probability distribution, and (2) the risk-free rate of return (net of inflation). There is a likelihood that the actual survival distribution and rate of return {{may turn out to be}} different from those assumed in the computation. Furthermore, the Ogden Tables provide only a single estimate of the multipliers, leaving judges and lawyers with limited information about the underlying uncertainty.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the factors considered by forensic examiners when evaluating sexually violent predators (SVP) for civil commitment under Florida 2 ̆ 7 s “Jimmy Ryce Act. ” The project was funded by a pre-doctoral research grant awarded by the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (ATSA). ^ This study proposed two specific research questions. First, what is the direct relationship between <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessment</b> scores and recommendations for sex offender civil commitment? Second, which other variables are likely to influence SVP commitment decisions, and to what degree? The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine if risk assessment practices are evidence-based, and whether offenders selected for commitment meet statutory criteria. ^ The purposive sample of 450 SVPs was drawn from the population of sex offenders evaluated for civil commitment in Florida between July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2001. Data were extracted from SVP evaluations provided by the Florida Department of Children and Families. Using multivariate logistic regression, this correlational research design examined the relationship between the dependent variable, commitment decision, and several sets of independent variables. The independent variables were derived from a review of the literature, and were grouped conceptually according to their degree of correlation with sex offense recidivism. Independent variables included diagnoses, <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessment</b> scores, empirically validated static and dynamic risk factors, consensus based risk factors, evaluator characteristics, and demographics. This {{study investigated}} the degree to which the identified variables predicted civil commitment decisions. ^ Logistic regression results revealed that the statistically significant predictors of recommendations for sex offender civil commitment were <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessment</b> scores, diagnoses of Pedophilia and Paraphilia NOS, psychopathy, younger age of victim, and non-minority race.

40|$|Currently, a {{majority}} of actuarial risk-assessment tools for sexual recidivism contain static risk factors that measure {{various aspects of the}} offender's prior criminal history in adulthood. The goal of the current study was to assess the utility of extending static risk factors, by using developmental and criminal career parameters of offending, in the <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> of risk of violent/sexual recidivism. The current study was based on a sample of 204 convicted sexual aggressors of women incarcerated in the province of Quebec, Canada between April 1994 and June 2000. Semistructured interviews were used to gather information on the offender's antisocial history prior to adulthood, and police records were used to collect data on the criminal career of these offenders in adulthood. For an average follow-up period of approximately 4 years, the violent/sexual recidivism rate for the sample was 23. 7 %. The results provided support for the inclusion of both developmental and criminal career indicators for the prediction of violent/sexual recidivism. More specifically, recidivists were characterized by an early onset antisocial trajectory and a pattern of escalation of antisocial behavior between childhood and adolescence. The findings suggest that risk assessors should look beyond broad adult criminal history data to include aspects of antisocial development to improve predictive accuracy.

40|$|Purpose: No formal {{assessment}} of life expectancy {{in women with}} BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations in these genes has been reported previously. We have evaluated life expectancy using actuarial analysis and assessed the effect of breast and ovarian cancers on premature death in> 1, 000 BRCA 1 / 2 carriers. Methods: Families with pathogenic mutations in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 have been ascertained in a 10 -million population region of United Kingdom since 1996. Mutation carriers and their first-degree relatives were used {{in an analysis of}} breast and ovarian cancer incidence and mortality as well as to derive and compare an <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> of life expectancy. Results: Six hundred twelve BRCA 1 and 482 BRCA 2 female mutation carriers were identified from 482 families. Life expectancy was significantly reduced for BRCA 1 carriers compared with BRCA 2 (P = 0. 0002). This effect was attributable to an increased death rate from ovarian cancer (P = 0. 04). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a better long-term survival from early-stage ovarian cancer in BRCA 2 carriers but no significant differences in deaths from breast cancer or from women presenting with late-stage ovarian cancer. There was no other major contributing cause to death other than breast/ovarian cancer in BRCA 1 / 2 female carriers. Conclusion: Interventions to reduce ovarian cancer inci-dence are likely to have a greater effect on life expectancy in BRCA 1 compared with BRCA 2 carriers.

The second dimension is how the clinical or educational variables are used to group children into different categories. Traditionally, psychologists group children by similar clinical test profiles. Newer <b>actuarial</b> <b>assessment</b> techniques render placement decisions based on statistical probability. ^ Procedures and Methods. Test data on 85 elementary special education students were utilized to compare placement decisions rendered according to each classification model. All students had psychological evaluations housing clinical variables, and individual educational plans housing educational variables. ^ The Clinical Traditional model was created by using the special education categorical label to which each student was assigned. The Clinical Actuarial and Educational Actuarial models were derived through Ward 2 ̆ 7 s (1963) hierarchical clustering technique which sorted children by statistical similarity on either the clinical or educational variables. These models were then analyzed by multiple discriminant analysis for explication purposes. ^ Results. Analyses of all data indicated that the Clinical Actuarial model had {{the highest percentage of}} children correctly placed (90...|$|E

In general, offense-based classification systems are used for their simplicity and uniformity. They allow classification decisions to be made via administrative or judicial processes. Risk-assessment-based systems, which employ <b>actuarial</b> risk <b>assessment</b> instruments {{and in some cases}} clinical assessments, require more of personnel involvement in the process. Some states, like Massachusetts and Colorado, utilize multidisciplinary review boards or judicial discretion to establish registrant tiers or sexual predator status.|$|R

Although considerable variation exists in how these {{tools are applied}} in criminal justice settings, many international jurisdictions are beginning to use risk instruments to structure, inform, and/or determine an increasing range of corrections-management practices including arrest, diversion, bail, pre-sentence reports, sentencing, prison classification, and parole decisions. The most common use of these tools is to predict recidivism in cases involving violent, youth, or sexual offenders (Cunningham an...|$|R
