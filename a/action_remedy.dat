40|$|This {{guideline}} is {{the first}} Malaysian standard (MS 2072 : 2008) which aims to provide guidance to assist the planning, site selection, design and implementation of partial, short-term, or early <b>action</b> <b>remedies</b> undertaken at contaminated sites. This guideline {{was developed by the}} Working Group on Site Remediation {{under the auspices of the}} Environmental Management Industry Standards Committee, and subsequently approved by the same Committee on 3 December 2007 without amendments. The purpose of this guideline is to manage, control or reduce the risks posed by contaminated sites. The early <b>action</b> <b>remedies</b> and strategies are applicable to the management of other regulatory processes such as Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007, Environmental Quality Act 1974 and Local Government Act 1976. This standard identifies and describes a standard process, technical requirements, information needs, benefits and strategy for early <b>action</b> <b>remedies</b> undertaken at contaminated sites. It is applicable to contaminated sites as defined by the Department of Environment and Department of National Solid Waste Management. The guideline highlights the basic activities associated with implementing an early action such as the construction of a Conceptual Site Model (CSM), estimation of risk(s), identification of exposure control, development of interim, selection of the desired solution(s), attainment of legal authority, design and execution of selected solution(s) and post-implementation monitoring of the CSM...|$|R
40|$|A {{class action}} brought under the New York statute (modeled after Federal Rule 23 of Civil Procedure) is an {{appropriate}} procedural device for remedying the continual breaches of the commuter carriage contract. In Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Puritan Coal Mining Co., the Supreme Court held that the common law mandates that common carriers treat passengers reasonably. Additionally, in the contract carriage, the carrier impliedly guarantees that the vehicle is in sound and proper order. Individual suits, unfortunately, have {{little effect on the}} actions of the common carriers; only nominal damages have been awarded in commuter actions against railroads for equipment failure, unreasonably delays, and poor conditions. However, the class <b>action</b> <b>remedy</b> may be helpful to the consumer [...] and thus [...] the commuter. Article 9 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), which was changed in 1975, changed the class action statute in New York to provide a more flexible, functional scheme for certifying classes and to prescribe basic guidelines for judicial management of class actions. Courts have narrowly interpreted Article 9 of the CPLR, however, and this interpretation should be broadened to align with the article 2 ̆ 7 s legislative purpose...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{estimate}} the deterrence effects of U. S. merger policy tools {{with respect to}} the composition of future merger notifications. Data from the Annual Reports by the U. S. DOJ and FTC allow industry based measures over the 1986 - 1999 period of the conditional probabilities for detection (eliciting an investigation), punishment (eliciting an antitrust action), and severity of punishment (eliciting prohibitions versus remedies) – deterrence variables somewhat akin to the traditional deterrence variables from the crime and punishment literature. We find both the conditional probability of detection and even more so the conditional probability of punishment to yield deterrence effects; however, the conditional probability of eliciting a severe punishment (prohibitions versus remedies) does not indicate significant deterrence. These results suggest that second-request-investigations and antitrust <b>actions</b> (<b>remedies</b> and prohibitions) generally involve deterrence; yet, prohibitions do not involve significantly more deterrence than do remedies...|$|R

The parties {{with an interest in}} the trust may have certain expectations and requirements of the trustee. The main responsibility and accountability ascribed to and expected of the trustee are for the proper maintenance and administration of the trust and its assets. The parties with an interest in the trust may be classified according to how closely involved or affected they are by the existence of the trust. The parties closest to the trust are listed as the founder, beneficiaries and co-trustees. Parties with a judiciary, legislative and administrative interest in the trust include the Master of the High Court, the High Court and the auditors as well as accountants of the trust. The parties with an interest in the trust may not be satisfied with the actions or performance of the trustee. These parties may seek <b>actions</b> and <b>remedies</b> to hold the trustee accountable. These <b>actions</b> and <b>remedies</b> may be found in legislation, the literature, common law or court judgements.

Furthermore, this study aims at assessing if the difference in the system of judicial protection is justifiable and adequate in the light of “ the Union’s objective [...] . to provide citizens with a high level of safety, within an area of freedom, security and justice ”. It is maintained that such difference has become untenable as it denies individuals both access to justice and effective judicial protection.
