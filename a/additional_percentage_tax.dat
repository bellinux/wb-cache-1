Its focus is Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), where the system has remained to be a popular policy instrument over twenty years. This research had been prepared in 2014 and was conducted during 2015 in five CEE countries that use the <b>percentage</b> <b>tax</b> designation system: Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. It focused on four areas: 1) What the <b>percentage</b> <b>tax</b> designation system actually is and what it is not, 2) What is its role in funding of the non-profit sector, 3) What are its side effects and 4) What is the connection between the policy making and the results? The research had a form of expert panel through country research associates that worked according to the unified methodology, using secondary quantitative and qualitative data. The data including the expert opinion were organized into the project's database...|$|R

40|$|Public debt has surged {{during the}} current global {{economic}} crisis {{and is expected to}} increase further. This development has raised concerns whether public debt is starting to hit levels where it might negatively affect economic growth. Does such a tipping point in public debt exist? How severe would the impact of public debt be on growth beyond this threshold? What happens if debt stays above this threshold {{for an extended period of}} time? The present study addresses these questions with the help of threshold estimations based on a yearly dataset of 101 developing and developed economies spanning a time period from 1980 to 2008. The estimations establish a threshold of 77 percent public debt-to-GDP ratio. If debt is above this threshold, each <b>additional</b> <b>percentage</b> point of debt costs 0. 017 percentage points of annual real growth. The effect is even more pronounced in emerging markets where the threshold is 64 percent debt-to-GDP ratio. In these countries, the loss in annual real growth with each <b>additional</b> <b>percentage</b> point in public debt amounts to 0. 02 percentage points. The cumulative effect on real GDP could be substantial. Importantly, the estimations control for other variables that might impact growth, such as the initial level of per-capita-GDP.

Nationwide, a lower <b>percentage</b> of <b>tax</b> filers donated to charity in Canada (21. 8 %) than in the United States (25. 0 %). Similarly, Canadians (at 0. 56 %) gave a lower percentage of their ag-gregate income to charity than did Americans (at 1. 39 %). The general trend in recent years is that a declining <b>percentage</b> of Canadian <b>tax</b> filers are donating to charity and they are donating less as a percentage of income. The <b>percentage</b> of <b>tax</b> filers donating to charity varies significantly among US states and Canadian provinces and territories.

40|$|Creating a {{successful}} energy tax policy requires understanding the markets {{that the energy}} policy targets. This paper analyzes coal, natural gas, and oil markets {{to determine the extent}} to which these fuel prices move together. Results indicate that a stable long-run relationship between coal and oil prices existed until 1974 and that this relationship changed after 1974. The long-run relationship between coal, natural gas, and oil prices implies that a single fuel tax in these markets would not be effective as a single tax policy. Similarly, an equal <b>percentage</b> <b>tax</b> on these energy sources, which does not change relative prices initially, would not keep relative prices unchanged in the long run. Energy policy must take account of the long-run relationship between different energy prices. Otherwise, the long-run results of energy policy could be quite different than intended".

40|$|Background:The {{approval}} of direct-acting antivirals for Interferon-free treatment revolutionized the therapy of chronic Hepatitis C infection. As of August 2014, two treatment regimens for genotype 1 infection received conditional approval in the European Union: Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin for 24 weeks and Sofosbuvir and Simeprevir {{with or without}} Ribavirin for 12 weeks. We aim to analyze the cost-effectiveness of both regimens in Germany. Methods: We set up a Markov model with a lifetime horizon to simulate immediate treatment success and long-term disease progression for treatment-naive patients. The model analyzes both short-term and long-term costs and benefits {{from the perspective of}} the German Statutory Health Insurance. We apply the efficiency frontier method, which was suggested by German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care for cost-effectiveness analysis in Germany. Results: The efficiency frontier is defined by dual therapy and first generation direct-acting antiviral Boceprevir, yielding a maximum of  1, 447. 69 per <b>additional</b> <b>percentage</b> point of sustained virologic response gained. Even without rebates, Sofosbuvir/Simeprevir is very close with  1, 560. 13 per <b>additional</b> <b>percentage</b> point. It is both more effective and less expensive than Sofosbuvir/Ribavirin. Conclusions: In addition to higher sustained virologic response rates, new direct-acting antivirals save long-term costs by preventing complications such as liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and ultimately liver transplants, thereby offsetting part of higher drug costs. Our findings are in line with the guidance published by German Society for Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases, which recommends Sofosbuvir/Simeprevir for Interferon ineligible or intolerant patients...|$|R

The units in which tax was described — amount of money or <b>percentage</b> <b>tax</b> rate — were manipulated orthogonally. There was a strong metric effect: Participants favored progressiveness more when tax was described as a percentage rather than amount.
