After our descent from the trees only body-parts remained ticklish that could not be touched by passing leaves (<b>arm</b> <b>pits,</b> sole of our feet etc.). It is also possible to show the further development of this trait which finally led to the upcoming of humor.|$|R

50|$|Hyraxes share several unusual {{characteristics}} with {{elephants and}} the Sirenia (manatees and dugongs), which {{have resulted in}} their all being placed in the taxon Paenungulata.

Female hyraxes have a pair of teats near their <b>arm</b> <b>pits</b> (axilla), as well as four teats in their groin (inguinal area); elephants have a pair of teats near their axillae, and dugongs and manatees have a pair of teats, one located close {{to each of the}} front flippers. The tusks of hyraxes develop from the incisor teeth as do the tusks of elephants; most mammalian tusks develop from the canines. Hyraxes, like elephants, have flattened nails on the tips of their digits, rather than curved, elongated claws which are usually seen on mammals.|$|R
