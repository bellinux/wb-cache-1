25|$|As of 2007, the American Heart Association {{no longer}} {{recommends}} antibiotics for endocarditis prophylaxis before certain procedures {{in patients with}} aortic insufficiency. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> to prevent endocarditis before gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures is no longer recommended for any patient with valvular disease. Cardiac stress test is useful in identifying individuals that may be best suited for surgical intervention. Radionuclide angiography is recommended and useful when the systolic wall stress is calculated and combined to the results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antibiotic</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> is {{used before}} an {{incision}}. The uterus is incised, and this incision is extended with blunt pressure along a cephalad-caudad axis. The infant is delivered, and the placenta is then removed. The surgeon then {{makes a decision}} about uterine exteriorization. Single-layer uterine closure is used when the mother does not want a future pregnancy. When subcutaneous tissue is 2cm thick or more, surgical suture is used. Discouraged practices include manual cervical dilation, any subcutaneous drain, or supplemental oxygen therapy with intent to prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|Postpartum {{infection}} {{is one of}} the main causes of maternal death and may account for 10% of maternal deaths globally. Caesarean section greatly increases the risk of infection and associated morbidity (estimated to be between 5 and 20 times as high), and routine use of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> to prevent infections is recommended. Infection can occur in around 8% of women who have caesareans, largely endometritis, urinary tract infections and wound infections. The use of preventative antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section decreased wound infection, endometritis, and serious infectious complications by about 65%. Side effects and effect on the baby is unclear.|$|E
30|$|All {{patients}} were assessed for suitability pre-operatively and had radiological fibroid mapping using either ultrasound or MRI. Patients were given written information regarding their procedure and counselled preoperatively about their recovery and anticipated discharged within 24  h. Also, following the concerns regarding {{the possibility of}} dissemination of malignant cells during the morcellation process [7], we considered the information provided by national and international societies [8, 9] and devised a leaflet explaining the risks of morcellation. This leaflet contained not only information about the potential risk of dissemination of malignancy {{and the risk of}} upstaging a leiomyosarcoma, but also the possible risks of visceral injury. All {{patients were}} also given <b>antibiotics</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> at induction of anaesthesia and appropriate thromboprophylaxis.|$|R

Some children with VUR remain entirely asymptomatic, while others may develop pyelonephritis, renal scarring, and potentially progressive renal insufficiency. There are still many areas of VUR diagnosis, management, and timing of intervention that remain controversial today. This review attempts to synthesize the best available current evidence from the literature dealing with VUR screening, diagnosis, and treatment {{in order to provide}} the practitioner with an organized and evidence-based approach to the disease.

40|$|It {{is known}} that urinary tract is very common source of {{infection}} and UTIs are second most common reason people visit their doctors each year. Escherichia coli is responsible for large majority of UTIs. UTIs is most commonly diagnosed bacterial infection in woman. Population at risk of complication include older woman, pregnant woman. Continuous <b>antibiotics</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> are used to treat and prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, frequent antibiotic use can result in vaginal and intestinal dysbiosis as well as antibiotic resistance. Thus, it is desirable to seek alternative methods of prevention and treatment of simple UTIs. Few herbal antimicrobial agents Vaccinium macrocarpon (Cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (Bilberry; Blueberry), Berberine, Arctostaphylos uva ursi (Bearberry) are proved to be very effective in preventing and treating urinary tract infections...|$|R
25|$|In the past, {{bacteremia}} {{caused by}} dental procedures (in most cases due to streptococci viridans, which reside in oral cavity), {{such as a}} cleaning or extraction of a tooth {{was thought to be}} more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a dentist or a dental hygienist be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia. Although there is little evidence to support <b>antibiotic</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> for dental treatment, the current American Heart Association guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians and patients.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{systemic}} <b>antibiotics</b> <b>prophylaxis,</b> orthopedic implants still remain highly susceptible to bacterial adhesion and resulting in device-associated infection. Surface modification {{is an effective}} way to decrease bacterial adhesion. In this study, we prepared surfaces with different wettability on titanium surface based on TiO 2 nanotube to examine the effect of bacterial adhesion. Firstly, titanium plates were calcined to form hydrophilic TiO 2 nanotube films of anatase phase. Subsequently, the nanotube films and inoxidized titaniums were treated with 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctyl-triethoxysilane (PTES), forming superhydrophobic and hydrophobic surfaces. Observed by SEM and contact angle measurements, the different surfaces have different characteristics. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) adhesion on different surfaces was evaluated. Our experiment results show that the superhydrophobic surface has contact angles of water greater than 150 ∘ and also shows high resistance to bacterial contamination. It is indicated that superhydrophobic surface may be a factor to reduce device-associated infection and could be used in clinical practice...|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the use of}} <b>antibiotic</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> {{to prevent}} {{post-operative}} infections, resulting from bacteraemia, and infective endocarditis was practiced by dentists, especially in patients at high risk (i.e. with heart problems). However, according to new recommendations from the National Institution for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), <b>antibiotic</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> should not be offered for all patients at risk of infective endocarditis. This {{is due to the}} ever-increasing antibiotic resistance and there is no or very little evidence to show whether <b>antibiotic</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> is effective or ineffective against post-operative infections. Ethically, there is still a need to discuss with patients, the benefits and disadvantages of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> before they make a decision on whether they will go through with it or not.|$|E

40|$|In {{advanced}} non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) the clinical {{benefit of a}} platinum-based doublet is only modest, therefore, attenuated dosed three-drug combinations are investigated. We hypothesized that with adequate support a full dosed chemotherapy triplet is feasible. The study was designed as a dose finding study of paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive patients. Paclitaxel was given as a 3 -h infusion on day 1, followed by fixed doses of teniposide (or etoposide) 100 mg/m(2) days 1, 3, 5 and cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) day 1 every 3 weeks. As myelotoxicity was expected to be the dose-limiting toxicity, prophylactic G-CSF and antibiotic support was evaluated. Indeed, paclitaxel 120 mg/m(2) resulted in dose-limiting neutropenia, despite G-CSF support. Teniposide/etoposide day 1, 3, 5 was less myelotoxic compared to day 1, 2, 3. G-CSF support allowed paclitaxel dose-escalation to 250 mg/m(2). The addition of prophylactic antibiotics enabled dose-escalation to 275 mg/m(2) without reaching MTD. In conclusion, G-CSF and <b>antibiotics</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> enables the delivery of a full dosed chemotherapy triplet in previously untreated NSCLC patient...|$|R

Patients with moderate or serious injuries underwent immediate surgical exploration and decompression with wide debridement in combination with <b>antibiotics</b> and tetanus <b>prophylaxis.</b> Six of seven mild injuries could be well treated with conservative therapy. One nevertheless still needed a surgical exploration. Sixteen patients with a moderate injury had good results.

40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a gram {{positive}} anaerobic rod that {{is responsible}} for dermal infections and acute fatal septicemia in cetaceans, as well as disease in poultry, swine, and humans. An 8 year-old male wild-caught Russian beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) was diagnosed with E. rhusiopathiae septicemia after a history of acute inappetance, anorexia, and lethargy. The beluga received {{the first of a series}} of vaccines for E. rhusiopathiae with the Pfizer ERBACR PLUS bacterin prior to clinical disease. Hematological and biochemical abnormalities early in the disease process included a marked leukocytosis, mild increase in serum protein and globulin, mild thrombocytopenia, and anemia beginning 14 days after presentation. Blood culture confirmed the presence of E. rhusiopathiae septicemia. Medical therapy included <b>antibiotics,</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> for fungal disease, anti-inflammatory agents, appetite stimulants, gastroprotectants, vitamin supplements and herbal remedies. Approximately 3. 5 months after the onset of disease, the beluga was clinically stable and his blood values were all within normal limits. The success in this case is attributed to the early and aggressive initiation of antibiotic therapy, the choice of antibiotics, and prior vaccination...|$|R
40|$|RECENTLY, {{attention}} has gradually {{moved away from}} the quantity and technique of surgical procedures towards the quality of the work. It is in this vein that this study was focused on wound infection following orthopaedic surgery. This has been studied in other centres and the reported incidence has varied from 1. 68 per cent (Wilson et al. 1972) to as high as 19. 8 per cent when hip arthroplasty alone has been considered (Patterson and Brown 1972; Bingham, Fleenor and Church 1974). Most authors have a reported wound infection rate of 4 to 11 per cent for total hip arthroplasty (Cruess, Bickel and von Kessler 1975, McKee and Watson-Farrar 1966, Bergstrom, Lidgren and Lindberg 1974) and, with the introduction of a laminar air-flow tent, this incidence has been reduced to 3. 8 per cent (Charnley 1972, Dupont and Charnley 1972). The main organisms cultured from the wounds in the reported series were Staphlococcus aureus, E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. This study reports the incidence of wound infection in an orthopaedic unit over a five-year period.
