We determine the optimum D 2 D activation probability and threshold, building on analytical expressions for the coverage probabilities and <b>area</b> spectral <b>efficiency</b> of D 2 D links derived using stochastic geometry.

50|$|Although {{catalytic}} reactors {{are often}} implemented as plug flow reactors, their analysis requires more complicated treatment. The rate of a catalytic reaction {{is proportional to}} the amount of catalyst the reagents contact, as well as the concentration of the reactants. With a solid phase catalyst and fluid phase reagents, this {{is proportional to the}} exposed <b>area,</b> <b>efficiency</b> of diffusion of reagents in and products out, and efficacy of mixing. Perfect mixing usually cannot be assumed. Furthermore, a catalytic reaction pathway often occurs in multiple steps with intermediates that are chemically bound to the catalyst; and as the chemical binding to the catalyst is also a chemical reaction, it may affect the kinetics. Catalytic reactions often display the so-called falsified kinetics, i.e. the apparent kinetics differ from elementary chemical kinetics due to physical transport effects.|$|E

5000|$|The Kepler {{architecture}} {{employs a}} new Streaming Multiprocessor Architecture called SMX. The SMX {{are the key}} method for Kepler's power efficiency as the whole GPU uses a single [...] "Core Clock" [...] rather than the double-pump [...] "Shader Clock". The SMX usage of a single unified clock increases the GPU power efficiency {{due to the fact}} that two Kepler CUDA Cores consume 90% power of one Fermi CUDA Core. Consequently, the SMX needs additional processing units to execute a whole warp per cycle. Kepler also needed to increase raw GPU performance as to remain competitive. As a result, it doubled the CUDA Cores from 16 to 32 per CUDA array, 3 CUDA Cores Array to 6 CUDA Cores Array, 1 load/store and 1 SFU group to 2 load/store and 2 SFU group. The GPU processing resources are also double. From 2 warp schedulers to 4 warp schedulers, 4 dispatch unit became 8 and the register file doubled to 64K entries as to increase performance. With the doubling of GPU processing units and resources increasing the usage of die spaces, The capability of the PolyMorph Engine aren't double but enhanced, making it capable of spurring out a polygon in 2 cycles instead of 4. With Kepler, Nvidia not only worked on power efficiency but also on <b>area</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Therefore, Nvidia opted to use eight dedicated FP64 CUDA cores in a SMX as to save die space, while still offering FP64 capabilities since all Kepler CUDA cores are not FP64 capable. With the improvement Nvidia made on Kepler, the results include an increase in GPU graphic performance while downplaying FP64 performance.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{conceptual}} model is proposed concerning how leaf <b>area</b> <b>efficiency</b> (stemwood growth per unit leaf area) changes with leaf area for trees within a stand. Greater leaf area is generally associated with (i) improved light environment due to greater height and (ii) a lower ratio of photosynthetic to nonphotosynthetic tissue.
