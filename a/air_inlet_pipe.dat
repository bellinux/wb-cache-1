40|$|This thesis aims at {{improving}} our knowledge on swirl combustors. The work presented here {{is based on}} Large Eddy Simulations (LES) coupled to an advanced combustion model: the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC). Numerical predictions have been systematically compared and validated with detailed experimental datasets. In order to analyze further the physics underlying the large numerical datasets, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has also been used throughout the thesis. Various aspects of the aerodynamics of swirling flames are investigated, such as precession or vortex formation caused by flow oscillations, as well as various combustion aspects such as localized extinctions and flame lift-off. All the above affect flame stabilization in different ways and are explored through focused simulations. The first study investigates isothermal air flows behind an enclosed bluff body, with the incoming flow being pulsated. These flows have strong similarities to flows found in combustors experiencing self-excited oscillations and can therefore be considered as canonical problems. At high enough forcing frequencies, double ring vortices are shed from the air pipe exit. Various harmonics of the pulsating frequency are observed in the spectra and their relation with the vortex shedding is investigated through POD. The second study explores {{the structure of the}} Delft III piloted turbulent non-premixed flame. The simple configuration allows to analyze further key combustion aspects of combustors, with further insights provided on the dynamics of localized extinctions and re-ignition, as well as the pollutants emissions. The third study presents a comprehensive analysis of the aerodynamics of swirl flows based on the TECFLAM confined non-premixed S 09 c configuration. A periodic component inside the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> and around the central bluff body is observed, for both the inert and reactive flows. POD shows that these flow oscillations are due to single and double helical vortices, similar to Precessing Vortex Cores (PVC), that develop inside the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> and whose axes rotate around the burner. The combustion process is found to affect the swirl flow aerodynamics. Finally, the fourth study investigates the TECFLAM configuration again, but here attention is given to the flame lift-off evident in experiments and reproduced by the LES-CMC formulation. The stabilization process and the pollutants emission of the flame are investigated in detail. This work was supported by the European Commission through the Marie Curie Project MYPLANET...|$|E
40|$|In truck manufacturing, {{the exhaust}} and <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pipes</b> are {{specialized}} equipment that requires highly skilled, heavy machinery and small batch production methods. This paper describes {{a project to}} develop the computer numerically controlled (CNC) pipe bending process for a truck component manufacturer. The company supplies a huge range of heavy duty truck parts to the domestic market and is a significant supplier in Australia. The company has been using traditional methods of machine assisted manual pipe bending techniques. In a drive of continuous improvement, the company has acquired a pre-owned CNC bending machine capable of bending pipes automatically up to 25 bends. However, due to process mismatch, this machine is only used for single bending operation. The researchers studied the bending system and changed the manufacturing process. Using an example exhaust pipe as the benchmark, a significant drop of manufacturing lead time from 70 minutes to 40 minutes for each pipe was demonstrated. There was also a decrease of material cost due to the multiple bends part in one piece without cutting excessive materials for each single bend {{like it used to}} be...|$|R

40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} {{of water}} vapour are powerful indicators of meteorological processes {{on a broad}} range of scales, reflecting evaporation, condensation, and air mass mixing processes. With the recent advent of fast laser-based spectroscopic methods, it has become possible to measure the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour in situ at a high temporal resolution. Here we present results from such comprehensive airborne spectroscopic isotope measurements in water vapour over the western Mediterranean at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Measurements have been acquired by a customized Picarro L 2130 -i cavity-ring down spectrometer deployed onboard the Dornier 128 D-IBUF aircraft together with a meteorological flux measurement package during the HyMeX SOP 1 (Hydrological cycle in Mediterranean Experiment special observation period 1) field campaign in Corsica, France, during September and October 2012. Taking into account memory effects of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe,</b> the typical time resolution of the measurements was about 15 – 30  s, resulting in an average horizontal resolution of about 1 – 2  km. Cross-calibration of the water vapour measurements from all humidity sensors showed good agreement under most flight conditions but the most turbulent ones. In total 21 successful stable isotope flights with 59 flight hours have been performed. Our data provide quasi-climatological autumn average conditions and vertical profiles of the stable isotope parameters δ D, δ 18 O, and d-excess during the study period. A d-excess minimum in the overall average profile is reached in the region of the boundary-layer top, possibly caused by precipitation evaporation. This minimum is bracketed by higher d-excess values near the surface caused by non-equilibrium fractionation, and a maximum above the boundary layer related to the increasing d-excess in very depleted and dry high-altitude air masses. Repeated flights along the same pattern reveal pronounced day-to-day variability due to changes in the large-scale circulation. During a period marked by a strong inversion {{at the top of the}} marine boundary layer, vertical gradients in stable isotopes reached up to 25. 4  ‰  100  m − 1 for δ D and 24. 0  ‰  100  m − 1 for the d-excess...|$|E

The momentum of the water flow in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> against the now closed waste valve causes a water hammer that raises the pressure in the pump, opens the delivery valve 5, and forces some water to flow into the delivery pipe 3. Because this water is being forced uphill through the delivery pipe farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows; when the flow reverses, the delivery check valve closes. Meanwhile, the water hammer from the closing of the waste valve also produces a pressure pulse which propagates back up the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> to the source where it converts to a suction pulse that propagates back down the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe.</b> This suction pulse, with the weight or spring on the valve, pulls the waste valve back open and allows the process to begin again.|$|R

The SAFL Baffle is a stormwater treatment device created at the University of Minnesota's St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Previous research by Howard et al. 2011 showed {{that when the}} SAFL Baffle is retrofitted into a sump manhole, it improves {{the ability of the}} sump to collect sediment at low flow rates and retain captured sediment at high flow rates. The purpose of this research was to know how a SAFL Baffle performs when: 1. Clogged with debris like trash and vegetation 2. Installed in a sump manhole with an outlet pipe 90 degrees to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> 3. Installed in a sump manhole with water entering through an inlet grate and <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> Tests were performed at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory on a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 6 -ft (1. 8 m) deep sump, a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 3 -ft (0. 9 m) deep sump, a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 1 -ft (0. 3 m) deep scale model sump, and a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 0. 5 -ft (0. 15 m) deep scale model sump. All of the sumps were equipped with the SAFL Baffle, and were evaluated using two metrics: 1. How well the system captures sediment at low flow rates (Removal Efficiency Testing) 2. How well the system retains the previously captured sediment at high flow rates (Washout Testing) When a SAFL Baffle was clogged with stormwater debris, water traveled underneath of the SAFL Baffle. If the sump was deep, performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle did not change significantly. However, if the sump was shallow, significant washout was exhibited in the sump. This washout problem in shallow sumps was mitigated when a SAFL Baffle with hole diameters equal to 5 -in (12. 7 cm) was installed in the sump. Sumps with outlet pipes located 90 degrees to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> exhibited significant washout of previously captured sediment during high flow rates. With a SAFL Baffle installed at an angle between 90 - 120 degrees of the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe,</b> washout sharply decreased. At low flow rates, a SAFL Baffle installed at a 113 degree angle with respect to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> captured more sediment than a SAFL Baffle installed in a standard, straight flow-through sump. In the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle that received water from an <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> and an <b>inlet</b> grate from above, washout rates were highest when the flow rate from the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> was less than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Similarly, the ability of the device to capture sediment decreased when the flow rate from the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> was less than three times greater than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Through extensive testing, it was determined that the standard sumps equipped with the SAFL Baffle should be used downstream of stormwater sewers such that the drainage basin of the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> is at least three times the drainage basin of the inlet grate. Under this condition, the flow from an inlet grate from above does not impact the performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle...|$|R
