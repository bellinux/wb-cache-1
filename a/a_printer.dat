5|$|Florida {{honored the}} American {{alligator}} in 1987, but the Gators have titled the University of Florida's teams since 1911. In that year, <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> made a spur-of-the-moment decision to print an alligator emblem on {{a shipment of}} the schools football pennants; the mascot stuck, perhaps because the team captain's nickname was Gator.|$|E
5|$|Hilde Levi {{was born}} in Frankfurt, Germany, on 9 May 1909, the {{daughter}} of Adolf Levi, the sales director of a metal company, and his wife Clara (née Reis), the daughter of <b>a</b> <b>printer.</b> Hilde had an older brother called Edwin.

5|$|The type-B plug has a near square {{cross-section}} {{with the}} top exterior corners beveled. As part of a removable cable, it inserts into an upstream port on a device, such as <b>a</b> <b>printer.</b> On some devices, the type-B receptacle has no data connections, being used solely for accepting power from the upstream device.

5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} an apprenticeship, Evans {{went into}} business for himself. By the early 1850s, he {{had established a}} reputation as <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> of covers for a type of cheap novels known as yellow-backs. In the early 1860s, he began to print children's toy books and picture books {{in association with the}} printing house Routledge and Warne. His intention was to produce books for children that were beautiful and inexpensive. For three decades he produced multiple volumes each year, first illustrated by Crane, and later by Caldecott and Greenaway.|$|E
5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E

5|$|Bondfield's brother Frank had {{established}} himself in London some years earlier as <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> and trades unionist, and in 1894, having saved £5, {{she decided to}} join him. She found London shopworking conditions no better than in Brighton, but through Frank her social and political circles widened. She became {{an active member of}} the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks (NUSAWC), sometimes missing church on Sundays to attend union meetings. Her political and literary education was centred on the Ideal Club, where she met Bernard Shaw, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Under the influence of these socialist luminaries, she joined the Fabian Society and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP).|$|E
5|$|Born in the Melbourne {{suburb of}} Preston on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury {{was the second}} son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, née Steel. Growing up in Prahran, Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billycarts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends. Kingsbury {{attended}} Windsor State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at Melbourne Technical College. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as <b>a</b> <b>printer,</b> Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business, a job he disliked.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Evans (23 February 1826 – 21 August 1905) was a {{prominent}} English wood engraver and colour printer during the Victorian era. Evans specialized in full-colour printing, which, {{in part because of}} his work, became popular in the mid-19th century. He employed and collaborated with illustrators such as Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway and Richard Doyle to produce what are now considered to be classic children's books. Although little is known about his life, he wrote a short autobiography before his death in 1905 in which he described his life as <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> in Victorian London.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Marquis {{enrolled}} at University Medical College, Kansas City. A year of study {{was sufficient to}} allow him to practice medicine under the supervision of his father at Bosworth, Missouri, where the pair set up a practice and opened a drugstore. The practice was not very successful, so Marquis and his wife moved to Coloma where he worked under the supervision of another doctor. Marquis completed his studies with financial help from his wife's family and summer work as <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> in Anaconda. He graduated March23, 1898, and returned to Montana. His daughter, Minnie-Ellen, was born soon after in Anaconda.|$|E

5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{was founded}} in 1866 as <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> of {{standardized}} business forms. It began developing and marketing digital products in the 1960s.

By the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds had won contracts with all of the Big Three automotive manufacturers, as well as some insurance businesses. The company went public in 1961, but was re-formed as a private company in 2006, when it was merged with Universal Computer Systems, resulting in a culture clash between the two companies.|$|E
5|$|The Marshalsea was {{technically}} {{under the}} control of the Knight Marshal, but was let out to others who ran it for profit. For example, in 1727 the Knight Marshal, Philip Meadows, hired John Darby, <b>a</b> <b>printer,</b> as prison governor, who in turn leased it to William Acton, a butcher (who was later tried for murdering three of its prisoners). Acton had previously worked as one of the prison's turnkeys. He paid Darby £140 a year (roughly £) for a seven-year lease, giving him the right to act as resident warden and chief turnkey, and an additional £260 for the right to collect rent from the rooms, and sell food and drink.|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with <b>a</b> <b>printer</b> or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external modem port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.|$|E
