5|$|The base {{tuition fee}} per unit in UPLB is ₱1,000 (US$23). As with all UP constituents, UPLB {{implements}} the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP). Under the program, students with annual family incomes between ₱1,000,000 (US$23,000) and ₱500,000 (US$11,500) <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> the base tuition fee, while those with annual family incomes above ₱1,000,000 <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> ₱1,500 (US$35) per unit. Students with annual family incomes between ₱500,000 and ₱135,000 (US$3,110) <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> ₱600 (US$14) per unit; {{those who have}} between ₱135,000 and ₱80,000 (US$1,840) <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> ₱300 (US$7); while those who have below ₱80,000 are not charged any fees. Additional financial assistance may be accessed through the Student Loan Board, which pays up to 80 percent of the tuition. Scholarship and loan programs are also offered by some UPLB units, such as the College of Veterinary Medicine.|$|E

5|$|Human rights organisations accuse {{police and}} {{military}} forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists. Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> with holding political opponents {{at the behest of}} the government. However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.|$|E
50|$|There would <b>be</b> no <b>charge</b> for any {{vehicles}} travelling between 6.30 pm and 7 am {{or between}} 9.30 am and 4 pm. Vehicles travelling {{out of the}} charging rings between 7 am and 9.30 am would not <b>be</b> <b>charged,</b> and vehicles entering the charging rings between 4 pm and 6.30 pm would not <b>be</b> <b>charged.</b> There would <b>be</b> no <b>charge</b> for any vehicles weekends or on Bank Holidays.

5|$|The toll {{portion of}} SR 133 employs a barrier toll system, where drivers <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> {{flat-rate}} tolls {{based on what}} particular toll booths they pass through. Tolls are collected at selected on- and off-ramps; and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza, which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange).|$|E
50|$|A {{person may}} not even know if they <b>were</b> <b>charged.</b> If they <b>are</b> worried they may have <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> with a crime, they can contact an {{attorney}} {{to find out if}} they <b>were</b> <b>charged.</b> A police officer may also charge someone after they investigate the possible crime they committed.|$|R
25|$|The {{three men}} <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> with {{involvement}} in 29 separate incidents, including 21 murders and eight more attacks where victims survived. Suprunyuk <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> with 27 of the cases, including 21 counts of capital murder, eight armed robberies, and {{one count of}} animal cruelty. Sayenko <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> with 25 instances, including 18 murders, five robberies and one count of animal cruelty. Hanzha <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> with two counts of armed robbery stemming from a 1 March 2007 incident in Dniprodzerzhynsk.|$|R

5|$|After {{the opening}} on Downtown Line, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan {{announced}} that public transport fare rules will be reviewed {{to allow for}} transfers across MRT lines at different stations as the rail network is getting denser. Currently, commuters <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> a second time when they make such transfers. He added that the Public Transport Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate “fast, seamless” public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines {{is expected to be}} completed in the first quarter in 2018.|$|E
5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices <b>are</b> <b>charged.</b> One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E

Jordan Wagner, 21, <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> with being an accessory after the fact to murder.|$|R
5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary falls {{under the authority of}} the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, and the supreme court. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court of Justice that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> with high treason or harming national security.|$|E
5|$|London's {{first and}} only cable car, known as the Emirates Air Line, opened in June 2012. Crossing the River Thames, linking Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in {{the east of the}} city, the cable car is {{integrated}} with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although special fares <b>are</b> <b>charged.</b> Costing £60 million to build, it carries over 3,500 passengers every day, although this is very much lower than its capacity. Similar to the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline Emirates.|$|E
5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

5|$|The College {{is almost}} entirely self-financed, {{and is not a}} {{recipient}} of any regular public funding. Its officers do have official salaries, which {{are paid for by the}} Crown. The salaries of the officers were raised during the reign of King James I, but were reduced under William IV. These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional fees <b>are</b> <b>charged.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} of the motorway, BINA Istra, reported 65.8 million kuna (8.9 million euro) of {{income in the}} first half of 2011; an increase of 30.8 percent compared to the same period in the previous year. The figure includes the entire Istrian Y system, i.e. the A9 motorway and the A8 motorway. A major factor causing the increase is attributed to the introduction of the closed toll system, where tolls <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> at every junction, which replaced an open toll system where the toll was charged at the Mirna Bridge and the Učka Tunnel only.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
