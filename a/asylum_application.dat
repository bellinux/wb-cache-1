25|$|Earlier in 2006, a TV {{programme}} {{had reported}} that MP Hirsi Ali had provided false information on her <b>asylum</b> <b>application</b> in 1992 concerning her name, date of birth, and country {{where she had}} been residing prior to seeking asylum. Members of her family interviewed for the TV programme denied her earlier claims that she had sought asylum to prevent an arranged marriage that she objected to, stating instead that she had agreed to it. A government investigation raised many questions about the veracity of these claims.|$|E

The same day that the report was posted, Didi was found hanged in the aircraft control tower at Malé International Airport in an apparent suicide.|$|E
25|$|In May 2006 the TV {{programme}} Zembla {{reported that}} Hirsi Ali had given false {{information about her}} name, her age, and her country of residence when originally applying for asylum. In her <b>asylum</b> <b>application,</b> she had claimed to be fleeing a forced marriage, but the Zembla coverage featured interviews with her family, who denied that claim. The program alleged that, contrary to Hirsi Ali's claims of having fled a Somali war zone, the MP had been living comfortably in upper middle-class conditions safely in Kenya with her family for at least 12 years before she sought refugee status in the Netherlands in 1992.|$|E

25|$|If an {{asylum seeker}} {{is inside the}} United States {{and has not been}} placed in removal proceedings, he or she may file an {{application}} with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, regardless of his or her legal status in the United States. However, if the asylum seeker is not in valid immigration status and USCIS does not grant the <b>asylum</b> <b>application,</b> USCIS may place the applicant in removal proceedings, in that case a judge will consider the application anew. The immigration judge may also consider the applicant for relief that the asylum office has no jurisdiction to grant, such as withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Since the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act passed in 1996, an applicant must apply for asylum within one year of entry or be barred from doing so unless the applicant can establish changed circumstances that are material to his or her eligibility for asylum or exceptional circumstances related to the delay.|$|E
25|$|Hirsi Ali {{admitted}} that she had lied about her full name, date of birth, {{and the manner in}} which she had come to the Netherlands, but persisted in saying she was trying to flee a forced marriage. She noted that her first book, The Son Factory (2002), provided her real name and date of birth. She had also stated these in a September 2002 interview published in the political magazine HP/De Tijd. and in an interview in the VARA gids (2002). Hirsi Ali asserted in her 2006 autobiography (2007 in English) that she made full disclosure of the matter to VVD officials when invited to run for parliament in 2002. It is not known on what grounds she received political asylum. On the issue of her name, she applied under her grandfather's surname in her <b>asylum</b> <b>application,</b> to which she was entitled; she later said it was to escape retaliation by her clan. In the later parliamentary investigation of Hirsi Ali's immigration, the Dutch law governing names was reviewed. An applicant may legally use a surname derived from any generation as far back as the grandparent. Therefore, Hirsi Ali's application, though against clan custom of names, was legal under Dutch law. The question of her age was of minor concern. Media speculation arose in 2006 that she could lose her Dutch citizenship because of these issues, rendering her ineligible for parliament. At first, Minister Rita Verdonk said she would not look into the matter. She later decided to investigate Hirsi Ali's naturalisation process. The investigation found that Hirsi Ali had not legitimately received Dutch citizenship, because she had lied about her name and date of birth. However, later inquiries established that she was entitled to use the name Ali because it was her grandfather's name. Rita Verdonk moved to annul Hirsi Ali's citizenship, an action later overridden at the urging of Parliament.|$|E

The Ninth Circuit held that the conversion treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected constituted mental and physical torture." [...] The court rejected the argument that the treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected did not constitute persecution because they had been intended to help her, not harm her, and stated [...] "human rights laws cannot be sidestepped by simply couching actions that torture mentally or physically in benevolent terms such as 'curing' or 'treating' the victims".|$|E

2500|$|The Dublin {{regulation}} {{determines the}} EU {{member state responsible}} to examine an <b>asylum</b> <b>application</b> to prevent asylum applicants in the EU from [...] "asylum shopping", where applicants send their applications for asylum to numerous EU member states {{to get the best}} [...] "deal," [...] instead of just having [...] "safety countries", or [...] "asylum orbiting", where no member state takes responsibility for an asylum seeker. By default (when no family reasons or humanitarian grounds are present), the first member state that an asylum seeker entered and in which they have been fingerprinted is responsible. If the asylum seeker then moves to another member state, they can be transferred back to the member state they first entered. This has led many to criticise the Dublin rules for placing too much responsibility for asylum seekers on member states on the EU's external borders (like Italy, Greece and Hungary), instead of devising a burden-sharing system among EU states.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 May 2006, {{after the}} {{broadcast}} of the Zembla documentary, news stories appeared saying that Hirsi Ali was likely {{to move to the}} United States that September. She was reported to be planning to write a book entitled Shortcut to Enlightenment and to work for the American Enterprise Institute. On 16 May Hirsi Ali resigned from Parliament after admitting that she had lied on her <b>asylum</b> <b>application.</b> In a press conference she said that the facts had been publicly known since 2002, when they had been reported in the media and in one of her publications. She also restated her claim of seeking asylum to prevent a forced marriage, stating: [...] "How often do people who are seeking refuge provide different names? The penalty of stripping me of my Dutch citizenship is disproportional." [...] Her stated reason for resigning immediately were the increasing media attention. Owing to the fact that a Dutch court had ruled in April 2006 that she had to leave her house by August 2006, she decided to relocate to the United States in September 2006.|$|E

However, upon a closer examination of the number of <b>asylum</b> <b>applications</b> per country of origin, the effects appeared to be quite differential.
