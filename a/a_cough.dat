5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include <b>a</b> <b>cough,</b> a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness. A rapid respiratory rate {{is defined as}} greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old. In children, low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are more sensitive than hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope or increased respiratory rate. Grunting and nasal flaring may be other useful signs in children {{less than five years}} old.|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} {{prevalence of}} pertussis infection {{and its associated}} host and environmental factors to generate information that would guide strategies for disease control. In a cross-sectional study, 449 children aged 3 months to 12 years with persistent cough lasting ≥ 14 days were enrolled and evaluated for pertussis using DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ELISA serology tests. Pertussis prevalence was 67 (15 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 12 - 18)) and 81 (20 % (95 % CI: 16 - 24)) by PCR and ELISA, respectively among 449 participating children. The prevalence was highest in children with > 59 months of age despite high vaccination coverage of 94 % in this age group. Study demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between pertussis and non-pertussis cases. Of the 449 children, 133 (30 %) had <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> household member and 316 (70 %) did not. Among 133 children that had <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> household member, sex of child, sharing bed with <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> household member and having <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> individual in the neighborhood were factors associated with pertussis. Children that had shared a bed with <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> household individual had seven-fold likelihood of having pertussis compared to children that did not (odds ratio (OR) 7. 16 (95 % CI: 1. 24 - 41. 44)). Among the 316 children {{that did not have}} <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> household member, age 40 years of age were the factors associated with pertussis. Age 59 months of age, suggesting the possibility of waning immunity. The factors associated with pertussis varied by presence or absence of <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> household member...|$|R

5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children under five are fever, cough, and fast or difficult breathing. Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe {{signs and symptoms}} in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E

25|$|Codeine is an opiate used {{to treat}} pain, as <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> medicine, and for diarrhea. It is {{typically}} {{used to treat}} mild to moderate degrees of pain. Greater benefit may occur when combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Evidence does not support its use for acute cough suppression in children or adults. In Europe it is not recommended as <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> medicine in those under twelve years of age. It is generally taken by mouth. It typically starts working {{after half an hour}} with maximum effect at two hours. The total duration of its effects last for about four to six hours.|$|E

25|$|Situated {{above the}} larynx, the {{epiglottis}} {{acts as a}} flap which closes off the trachea during the act of swallowing to direct food into the esophagus. If food or liquid does enter the trachea and contacts the vocal folds it causes <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> reflex to expel the matter {{in order to prevent}} pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of pertussis are <b>a</b> paroxysmal <b>cough,</b> inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from pertussis {{has been documented}} to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> spell or <b>an</b> inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles {{the likelihood that the}} illness is pertussis. The absence of <b>a</b> paroxysmal <b>cough</b> or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.|$|R

25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{dextromethorphan}} is as <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> suppressant, for the temporary relief of cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation (such as commonly accompanies the flu and common cold), {{as well as}} those resulting from inhaled particle irritants. However, controlled studies have found the symptomatic effectiveness of dextromethorphan similar to placebo. This could also serve {{as an example of the}} power of the placebo effect.|$|E
25|$|Acute bronchitis, {{also known}} as a chest cold, is short term {{inflammation}} of the bronchi of the lungs. The most common symptom is <b>a</b> <b>cough.</b> Other symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, and chest discomfort. The infection may last from a few to ten days. The cough may persist for several weeks afterwards with the total duration of symptoms usually around three weeks. Some have symptoms for up to six weeks.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to other}} {{chemicals}} available to 18th century regular physicians, opium was a benign {{alternative to the}} arsenics, mercuries, or emetics, and it was remarkably successful in alleviating {{a wide range of}} ailments. Due to the constipation often produced by the consumption of opium, {{it was one of the}} most effective treatments for cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea. As <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> suppressant, opium was used to treat bronchitis, tuberculosis, and other respiratory illnesses. Opium was additionally prescribed for rheumatism and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{bronchitis}} {{usually has}} <b>a</b> <b>cough</b> that lasts around three weeks. In more than 90% of cases {{the cause is}} a viral infection. These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution. A small number of cases are due {{to high levels of}} air pollution or bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella pertussis. Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and NSAIDs to help with the fever.|$|E

30|$|Only {{one case}} of herniated lumbar disc {{associated}} with whooping cough is reported, probably {{as a result}} of the pressure effect from the tremendous force produced in the thoracic and abdominal cavity during <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> access [8]. Vertebral fractures are reported in some cases associated with seizures in patients suffering from epilepsy [9, 10]. The authors assume that the forces generated during a tonic–clonic seizure can result in axial skeletal trauma, including thoracic or lumbar burst fractures. In the same way, the contraction force developed during <b>a</b> <b>coughing</b> access, although quantitatively lower, could result in a vertebral fracture if there is a subcortical bone defect of the screw tracks.|$|R
