25|$|Feeling rejected, Peter is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up,</b> when {{during an}} open house at Lou Ferrigno's mansion which Peter is trying to sell, he meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), an {{investor}} who is attending the showing simply to pick up divorced women {{and take advantage of}} the free food. The two quickly become friends, especially bonding over their mutual adoration of the progressive rock band Rush. Peter introduces Sydney to Zooey at their engagement party, but the meeting takes an unfortunate turn when a nervous Sydney makes a very awkward toast.|$|E
25|$|However, Toronto was not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> on Bargnani yet and {{committed}} the entire summer coaching {{him to become}} a more effective interior player, forcing him to drive to the basket more and settle less for jump shots. The arrival of six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal also meant that Bargnani was likely to come off the bench in most games, with Bosh and O'Neal forming the starting frontcourt. During the summer he worked hard on his body, putting up some more weight (adding some 15 pounds of muscle); this work showed his effects in the first games of the regular campaign, when the Italian was more willing to rebound in traffic and drive to the basket. He also seemed to rediscover his shooting stroke, had better shot selection and became a consistent shot-blocker, and he was soon moved to the starting line-up as small forward.|$|E

500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> and go home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, about a {{year after}} the launch of the Tank Girl comic in the British {{magazine}} Deadline, its publisher, Tom Astor, began looking for a studio interested in making a film adaptation. While several studios, including New Line Cinema, expressed interest, progress was slow. Rachel Talalay's stepdaughter gave her a Tank Girl comic to read while she was shooting her directorial debut film, [...] (released in 1991). Talalay read the comic between takes and became interested in directing a Tank Girl film. She contacted Astor and, after hearing nothing for almost a year, was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> trying to secure the rights when he gave her permission to make the film. Talalay pitched the film to Amblin Entertainment and Columbia Pictures, who both turned it down. Talalay turned down an offer from Disney as she did not believe the studio would allow the levels of violence and the sexual references the plot required. An offer from MGM was accepted. Talalay worked closely with the Tank Girl comic's co-creators Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett during the film's production, and selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer. The studio was unhappy with Hardwicke, who was relatively unknown at the time, being chosen over more experienced designers and Talalay had to meet with the producers to persuade them to allow Hardwicke to work on the project. Tedi Sarafian wrote the screenplay, which marked his debut production credit, and Gale Tattersall was chosen as cinematographer. Believing that MGM would not allow the depiction of a bestial relationship in the film, the romance between Tank Girl and Booga was only written into the second or third version of the script, after the character was already established in the minds of people involved in the production. By this stage, Booga: [...] "was a character and not just a kangaroo [...] it wasn't an issue anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fence â€“ In {{the early}} days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge which {{connected}} Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge was a meeting place for students. In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area. The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence. Administration was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> and tear it down but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition. The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as [...] "the Cut." [...] Students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may [...] "take" [...] the fence. The fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6am. Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered [...] "the world's most painted object," [...] by the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|E
