500|$|Though former Nickelodeon {{president}} Albie Hecht, a Jewish person himself, was dumbfounded by {{the accusation}} and deemed it absurd, Herb Scannell, {{president of the}} company in 1998, responded to the complaints and apologized to ADL. Scannell issued a statement promising that neither the strip nor the character would ever be published again. In the statement, he also noted, [...] "Unfortunately, the creators of the strip made an error in judgment by referencing the Kaddish. I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> however well-meaning, the use of the Kaddish in the comic strip was inappropriate." [...] Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, responded via a press release in which they thanked Scannell for his speedy response and commended the company in general for understanding the issue at hand; Foxman concluded by saying, [...] "We appreciate Nickelodeon’s long record of creative and quality programming and understand that it was not their intention to offend." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{described}} by FIRE, [...] "Roger Slatt, Director of the School of Geology and Geophysics, began to unconstitutionally monitor Deming's {{letters to the}} newspaper and include them in three professional evaluations, until directed to stop by OU President David L. Boren. A former US Senator, Boren had stated in a 2001 editorial, [...] "a university {{is a place of}} many diverse viewpoints where free speech is encouraged." [...] In June 2003, Boren wrote to Deming, saying, [...] "I fully <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> your political views should not be included as a factor in your post-tenure review." [...] In a July 24, 2003 email, Dean Snow complained that [...] "it is doubly frustrating that President Boren...has shown such sympathy for Deming.", and wrote that he would try to convince Deming's department head to [...] " [...] basically ignore and then marginalize Deming.… As long as we keep our i’s dotted and our t’s crossed, all Deming can really do is make noise and cause a bit more paperwork.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When Brodie Innes sent on {{a sermon}} by E. B. Pusey, Darwin responded {{that he could}} [...] "hardly see how {{religion}} & science can be kept as distinct as he desires, as geology has to treat {{of the history of}} the Earth & Biology that of man.— But I most wholly <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there is no reason why the disciples of either school should attack each other with bitterness, though each upholding strictly their beliefs. You, I am sure, have always practically acted in this manner in your conduct towards me & I do not doubt to all others. Nor can I remember that I have ever published a word directly against religion or the clergy." [...] In response to an enquiry about the same sermon from the botanist Henry Nicholas Ridley, Darwin stated that [...] "Dr Pusey was mistaken in imagining that I wrote the Origin with any relation whatever to Theology", and added that [...] "many years ago when I was collecting facts for the Origin, my belief in what is called a personal God was as firm as that of Dr Pusey himself, & as to the eternity of matter I have never troubled myself about such insoluble questions.— Dr Pusey's attack will be as powerless to retard by a day the belief in evolution as were the virulent attacks made by divines fifty years ago against Geology, & the still older ones of the Catholic church against Galileo". Brodie Innes deplored [...] "unwise and violent" [...] theological attacks on his old friend, for while they had disagreements, [...] "How nicely things would go if other folk were like Darwin and Brodie Innes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord," [...] {{answered}} the tall fedai, {{and his hand}} trembled as he spoke, [...] "most mighty lord, I had no orders as to {{the killing of the}} crew from your lips, and the Frank Lozelle told me <b>that</b> he had <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> they should be spared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With {{my company}} of the 67th, I would go anywhere. And, <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> at this present moment I know more of soldiering than they;--but place me on that open ground where you found us, armed as you please, {{and half a dozen}} of my friends, with rifles, in the woods round about me; which would get the better? You know best, Mr. Braddock's aide-de-camp!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!--listen!" [...] Paula cried, with {{sparkling}} eyes. [...] "We {{have a new}} prophet. Hear Mr. Graham. He's {{worthy of}} your steel, of both your steel. He <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> music is the refuge from blood and iron and the pounding of the table. That weak souls, and sensitive souls, and high-pitched souls flee from the crassness and the rawness {{of the world to}} the drug-dreams of the over-world of rhythm and vibration--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it was the}} boys' fault," [...] replied Dr. Barwaithe. [...] "The line broke, {{and that}} started the whole thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{enough to}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> she is charming," [...] said the consul. [...] "I dined with them, and saw {{them at the}} consulate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you cannot educate {{tropical}} and semi- tropical {{people in}} England; and you don't {{want to make}} them English Christians, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have only}} {{got to say}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> find late hours don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have made up your mind to cut it altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all <b>that's</b> wanting--that <b>you</b> {{should take}} up her cause!" [...] the Countess went on. [...] "I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> however, <b>that</b> {{it was much}} too soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The amount {{contained}} is variable," [...] said Challenger, [...] "depending {{upon the}} pressure and care with which it has been bottled. I am inclined to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Roxton, <b>that</b> this one is defective." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you do {{not answer}} my question. Do you bring any {{accusation}} against me? If so, I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you had better go to your lawyer." ...|$|E
60|$|BURGE. On the {{contrary}} {{it will be}} fought on nothing else. I believe a program is a mistake. I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> principle is what we want.|$|E

6000|$|... "But suppose I am {{convinced}} on good evidence--as I am--that {{this state of}} mind of yours is transient, and <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> went off as you propose, you would by-and-by repent, and feel <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had let yourself slip back from the point you have been gaining by your education till now? Have you not strength of mind enough to see <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had better act on my assurance for a time, and test it? In my opinion, so far from <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{should be free to}} turn yourself into a colonist and work in your shirt-sleeves with spade and hatchet--in my opinion you have no right whatever to expatriate yourself until you have honestly endeavored to turn to account the education you have received here. I say nothing of the grief to your mother and me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> sir, <b>that</b> {{somebody}} {{should be here}} to help me look after the boy, but not Mr Burns. I am sorry {{to have to say}} it, but I do not trust Mr Burns.' ...|$|R
60|$|As you do {{not mention}} your own health, or that of Lady Gomm, I infer with {{pleasure}} <b>that</b> the climate <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> both. <b>That</b> this may continue to be so is my earnest and sincere wish, in which Mrs. Wordsworth cordially unites.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are hardly}} likely {{to choose the}} exact moment when {{we are to be}} away, but I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the risk must not be run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Grace {{has nothing}} to do with it. I only {{referred}} it to that source because I thought you would do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} {{questioned}} your wisdom in breaking it off," [...] Deane said quietly. [...] "Under the circumstances, I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it {{is a very}} good thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We may be {{very useful}} in going out to bring convoys in," [...] Major Warrener replied, [...] "and to cut off convoys of the enemy, to scout generally, and to bring in news; still, I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Dick, <b>that</b> I hope we may be sent off for duty elsewhere. Hullo! what's that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in <b>that,</b> Patsey. Well, we will {{regard the}} matter as settled. As {{long as the}} army hangs together, so long will we remain with it; after that we will carry out the plans we talked over, and make for the coast by the way which seems most open to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we {{have talked}} of this before," [...] the other said, [...] "and I quite <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> if we all had the pluck of men {{we ought to be}} able to {{overpower}} the warders, in spite of their firearms. Of course some of us would get killed, but no one would mind that if there was but the remotest chance of getting away. The question is what we should do with ourselves when we were once outside the prison. Of course I know that there are two or three hundred settlers, but there would not be much to be got out of them, and life among those black fellows, even if they were civil to us, which I don't suppose they would be, would not be worth having." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dr. Mulbridge colored. [...] "Excuse me," [...] he said, [...] "if, {{even under}} the circumstances, I can't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the {{position}} taken by the regular practice is ridiculous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what is to}} be done? for I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> if possible, John Dormay must {{escape from}} the {{punishment}} he deserves. But how is it to be done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} be a {{disadvantage}} to go as a soldier," [...] Dick said, after a pause; [...] "but what disguise would you recommend us to choose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel convinced," [...] he said, [...] "that you are right. I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I believe <b>that</b> Inspector Jacks has {{had that}} idea for some little time now." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE. Have you {{discovered}} the elixir {{of life or}} have you not? If not, I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Lubin <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are wasting our time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> except <b>that</b> {{it is just}} {{possible}} that a slave may escape. You see, on our way up to Khartoum if we defeat the Mahdi's troops--which we certainly shall do--all the country will no doubt submit, {{and there would be}} in the first place the chance of his being given up to us, and in the second of his escape." ...|$|R
60|$|I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there's no {{situation}} like the Champs Elysées--really, there is scarcely {{anything like it}} in Europe, if you put away Venice--for a situation in a city.|$|E
60|$|P.S.--You were {{perfectly}} right about your Uncle Donald's moustache, but I don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it is more}} his misfortune than his fault. I think he does it on purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} be best to say nothing about it, till we hear that the facts are known. What has been done once, may be done again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With a {{great deal}} of pleasure, sir, at any time," [...] said Mr. Knightley, laughing, [...] "and I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> entirely, <b>that</b> it will be a much better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] she said, [...] "that {{we have been}} very frivolous. I <b>agreed</b> to dine <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we might speak {{together}} of this unfortunate person, Leslie Guest. You saw him last night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't hold <b>with</b> Mr. Jennings <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hid the Moonstone," [...] said Sergeant Cuff. [...] "But I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must {{certainly}} {{have taken it}} back to your own room." ...|$|R
