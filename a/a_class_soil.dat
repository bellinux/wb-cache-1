Design/methodology/approach - We introduced soil constitutive equation in a FE software initially designed for the metal forming. We performed the numerical integration of the non-linear ploughing problem. Non-linearities encountered by the problem can be summed up: as soil constitutive equation (idealized with non-associated compressible plastic law), unilateral frictional contact conditions (with a rigid body), geometrical non-linearities (the ploughing tool) and large deformation range. To handle such difficulties we performed several numerical methods as implicit temporal scheme, Newton-Raphson, non-symmetric iterative solver, as well as proper approximation on stress and strain measures. Findings - Main results deal with the validation of the integration of the non-linear constitutive equation in the code and a parametric study of the ploughing process. The influence of tool geometric parameters on the soil deformation modes and on the force experienced on the tools had been point out. As well, the influence of soil characteristics as compressibility had been analyzed. Research limitations/implications - This research is devoted to perform a numerical model applicable for a large range of soil treatment tools and for <b>a</b> large <b>class</b> of <b>soil.</b> However, taking into account all kind of soil is utopist. So limitations met are essentially related to the limit of the accuracy of the elasto-plastic idealization for the soil.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, Bishop’s {{proposal}} for a generalized stress extending Terzaghi’s stress to unsaturated states gained a large audience. Despite the complexity introduced in some aspects of modelling or stress representation, such an approach allows to model in a simple manner particular features of unsaturated soil behaviour. In this paper, an alternative choice for this parameter is proposed and validated using either shear strength or elastic stiffness experimental data from a set of soils ranging from almost granular materials to high plasticity clays. A physical interpretation in terms of microstructurally trapped water is provided. It is shown {{that the amount of}} trapped water is closely linked to the definition of χ. When the amount of non-free water increases (increasing plasticity indices), a significant deviation of χ values from the degree of saturation is observed. It is thus concluded that the hypothesis stating that Bishop’s χ parameter equals the degree of saturation of water is only approximately valid for <b>a</b> particular <b>class</b> of <b>soils,</b> namely those having a marked granular nature...|$|R

The material exhibits engineering properties similar to those of soft limestone or sandstone and a lightweight aggregate.

Threshold electrolyte concentration of the flocculated suspensions was significantly correlated with CROSS of the dispersed suspensions. The cationic flocculating charge of the flocculated suspensions, which incorporates the individual flocculating powers of the cations, was significantly correlated with CROSS. However, these types of relations will depend on several soil factors even within <b>a</b> given <b>soil</b> <b>class.</b> Therefore, we have derived the dispersive potential of an individual soil from which we calculated the required cationic amendments to maintain flocculated soils and their structural integrity.

40|$|Local soil {{conditions}} are often critical for earthquake resistant design. For economic reasons, {{the most effective}} tool, microzonation with zone specific design spectra, can not be carried out for all relevant industrial and residential areas. Site-specific investigations are only done in special cases. Therefore in most buildings codes, like the current Swiss Code SIA 261, the influence of local site conditions is taken into account by design spectra for different <b>soil</b> <b>classes.</b> These <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> for the geological conditions of Switzerland and their corresponding amplification functions have been re-evaluated in a national research project, presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The taxonomic {{hierarchy}} and nationwide distribution of soils with a salic horizon were studied using the USA Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database {{to provide a}} more holistic view of the role of soil-forming factors in pedogenesis than from isolated case studies. Soils with a salic horizon occupied an area of 11 000 km 2, i. e., 0. 1 % of land area in the contiguous USA. These soils occur narrowly in three great groups (Aquisalids, Haplosalids and Halaquepts), 11 subgroups, and 97 soil series. Soils with a salic horizon commonly had a mesic (50 % of soil series) or thermic (19 %) soil-temperature <b>class,</b> <b>an</b> aquic (89 %) soil-moisture <b>class,</b> <b>a</b> mixed mineral <b>class</b> (79 %), <b>a</b> calcareous (52 %) reaction <b>class,</b> <b>a</b> superactive (59 %) cation exchange activity <b>class,</b> and <b>a</b> fine (24 % of soil series), fine-loamy (24 % of soil series), or fine-silty (19 % of <b>soil</b> series) particle-size <b>class.</b> <b>Soils</b> with <b>a</b> salic horizon were concentrated in the Basin and Range Province of western USA. The key pedogenic processes leading to the development of salic horizons were salinization, gleization, and calcification, with some evidence for argilluviation and silicification.

40|$|Soil sealing is a {{degradation}} {{problem that}} involves different factors, processes and mechanics. Different methods and methodologies to assess those factors and processes can reflect different results {{and levels of}} soil structure degradation within the same soil, under different climate and management conditions. Standardized methods were evaluated for assessing soil sealing in five Venezuelan soils, with different texture and organic carbon content. The objective is to select indicators for predicting soil sealing. The {{results showed that the}} amount of water stable aggregates (WSA), the medium weight diameter (MWD) of the aggregates, the particles with diameter < 0. 25 mm (P 250), the absolute sealing index (ASI), the consistency index (C 5 - 10) and the soil losses from simulation rainfall were able to evaluate the stability of the soil surface structure. However when all the methods were compared based on the classification criteria of each method, the MWD and C 5 - 10 had <b>a</b> discrepant <b>class</b> of <b>soil</b> sealing degradation when compared with other methods. The WSA, P 250, ASI methods and soil characteristics as SOM chemical fractions and particles between 2 and 100 μm diameters, had high correlations among each other but all had good relationship with soil losses under simulated rainfall. From this study it can be concluded that a simple laboratory method is enable to evaluate soil surface sealing susceptibility but the method needs to be validated under field conditions as well...|$|R
