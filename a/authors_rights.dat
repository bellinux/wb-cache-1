While the previous period could be characterized as a time of reaching a high degree of normative protection of <b>author's</b> <b>rights,</b> primarily from the aspect of collective organizations for the protection of <b>author's</b> <b>rights,</b> recent changes have significantly reduced those rights. The paper treats, using the comparative method, the position of organizations for the protection of <b>author's</b> <b>rights,</b> along with {{the fact that}} they have a limited possibility to influence use of object of those rights, currently set and limited by the state, while especially problematic is the fact that the right of remuneration has been abolished for certain users (craftsmen). The question is: to what extent have the legal changes prevented the abuse of monopoly by the organizations for the protection of <b>author's</b> <b>rights</b> and to what extent have those changes crossed the line of legality, affecting the decrease and cancellation of absolute rights and personal rights, thus breaching international conventions and European values. Although the latest legal changes were an opportunity to improve the regulations and prevent any kind of abuse of monopoly, that opportunity was missed. The future period should be used to bring to a reasonable extent the need to prevent monopoly abuse, so as not to limit the <b>author's</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|R

The article {{describes}} the challenges of copyright protection in the digital world. Starting from the observation that copyright {{is one of the}} most disputed regulative systems in the 21 st century, it analyses the reasons for the intensity of the public and political debate. The analysis comes to the conclusion that the main reason for this is the radical change of impact copyright law has undergone since computers and Internet access found their way into almost every household. What was designed as a regulative system for professional market players became a statutory code of conduct for the general public. However, the necessary steps to acknowledge this elementary change were never taken by the legislators.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s {{the need for}} an {{overhaul}} in the approach to scholarly publishing was recognized. A drastic change would revise the economic model on which publishing was based, give <b>authors</b> <b>rights</b> to their own works in open access repositories and enable consumers across the world to access scholarly materials, building a flow of valuable information for the common good. The revolution has yet to materialize, though small but welcome achievements have been made. The open access business model has gained a foothold with the Public Library of Science (PLoS), and scientists receiving grants through the National Institutes of Health must submit manuscripts to the PubMed Central digital archive. Several universities mandate that faculty members deposit their scholarly articles in institutional repositories, and the Compact for Open Access Publishing Equity promotes open publishing by supporting authors. Librarians are both part of the problem and part of the solution. Instead of worrying about paying rising subscription fees, they could use their position to influence authors to take advantage of open access channels despite publish-or-perish pressures. Recent legislative and presidential initiatives, geared to disseminating publicly funded research, may be effective in moving open access closer to transforming the traditional system of scholarly communication...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between the author and his/her artistic creation is very specific {{and at the same}} time a strong one. Such relation defies any property and affective connection that an individual may have with an object (Caron, 2011, 25). Copyright constitutes precisely the legal embodiment of the author’s intimate relationship with his/her work. Copyright is a plurality of legal provisions that belongs to the author of the work, in order to protect his/her ownership and eventually the commercial exploitation of such work. In this context, the author, through legal provisions and international conventions duly ratified by Albania, enjoys a relevant legal arsenal in order to defend his/her artistic works so that such works may have a live of its own (Vivant & Bruguière 2009, 23). One of these legal measures is the contract, which in legal doctrine is well known as the author’s contract. By means of such contract, the author has the right to distribute, reproduce, license or certify rights related to his/her artistic work. In this regard, the contract is an irreplaceable tool in the hands of the author to distribute the work and to give it an undeniable value, turning it into one of the most valuable intangible assets in civil circulation. The contract of the author, as the name indicates it, is a contract that obeys to the rules of civil law with respect to the quality of the parties, the characteristics of the object of the contract, its conclusion, the determination of remuneration and the term of duration. On the other hand, it is undeniable that the contract of the author contains rules which are not specifically contemplated by the Civil Code, such as rules relating to the form, interpretation and existence of some sui generis contracts provided in Law 9380 / 2005 “On copyright and related rights” (hereinafter referred to as “Law 9380 / 2005 ” or “Law on Copyright”) as well as in the Draft Law On <b>Authors</b> <b>Rights</b> (hereinafter referred to “Draft Law”). From this point of view, this paper will analyze two key moments: the fact that the author’s contract originates from the civil law principles and on the other hand the fact that such contract has its own autonomy from such principle...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese comics {{industry}} is several {{times larger than}} that of comparable nations, {{and in the past}} ten years, it has made inroads in the west. This paper analyzes the reasons for the vast success of the Japanese comics industry compared to the other two great comics industries, the American and the French. The first chapter deals with the basics of production: Japanese comics are well distributed; available everywhere when American comics are only sold in specialised comics stores. Japanese comics run as serials in thick (1000 -page) magazines and are then collected into 250 -page paperbacks; these publications are much more attractive to readers and retailers than the 36 -page B 4 leaflets the American comics {{industry is}} producing. The French comics industry has a better format: hardbound, 44 -page, A 4 albums; luxurious publications that retail at a high price; and while the American comics industry has been virtually taken over by Japanese-translated comics in the past two years, in France, the Japanese comics have taken no more than one third of the market. Cartoonist is an attractive profession in Japan; the many 1000 -page magazines that must be filled each month or week provide many cartoonists with a reasonably stable lower middle class lifestyle, and the cartoonists retain the ownership of their own creations, meaning that the most popular cartoonists can become very wealthy. The American comics industry is offering a work-for-hire contract where the cartoonists are paid per page and all <b>authors</b> <b>rights</b> belong to the publisher, meaning that there is little incentive for cartoonists to create new characters and concepts. Then, the Japanese comics industry enjoys a synergy with animated film that neither the American or French industries have been able to build. The 1000 -page magazines that have millions of readers are a natural content provider for TV and film, and since Japanese comics are not necessarily for children, there are also many animated cartoons produced for the video market, containing more violence and nudity than broadcast standards will allow. Chapter two looks at some aspects of comics creation in Japan. Japanese comic serials do not run eternally; they are feuilletons with beginnings and finales. This is interesting to readers and convenient to the comics magazines, as it leaves up space for new titles. Japanese comics draw readers in more than western comics because they use cinematic techniques (pans, close-ups, movable point of view) and have varied page lay-outs where western comics have their panels in grids as regular as a brick wall. The dichotomy between the realistic (serious) and the cartoony (humorous) drawing styles, which is the most important dichotomy in western comics, is much less pronounced in Japanese comics; Japanese cartoonists tend to use a simple, caricatured style that allows them to work fast. The detailed drawing style preferred in France means that cartoonist take years to produce a 44 -page album, so the development of new titles and genres happens at a snail s pace: partly for that reason, a handful of old titles continue to sell hundreds of thousands of copies, but new successes are few and far between. Both in America and France, comics have had problems with censorship that aimed to make all comics safe for children. The American comics industry in particular never fully recovered from the 1954 outcry against violent comics, which led to the establisment of the Comics Code Authority, a censorship body that not only cuts out sexual references and excessive violence, but also demands that comics never create disrespect for established authority and that good must triumph over evil in every story. The Japanese comics industry has been able to build its youth market because it has been allowed to create morally ambiguous stories with nudity and violence as much as the film industry has. In the third chapter, {{we take a look at}} comics as a form of literature or art. There have been a few Japanese cartoonists who have had ambitions in this direction, but while the monthly deadlines and cheap publications are a conductive environment for popular entertainment, Japanese cartoonists would need to be able to work without a set deadline if they were to produce comics that could be considered serious literature. An animation director can set up his own studio, finance each project separately and take the time he needs, and the award-winning Miyazaki Hayao is the most successful cartoonist in the world today because he has the freedom to operate independently, taking three years to finish a film. Japanese cartoonists do not tend to take on the role of serious artists that comment on society; their work is entertainment, but as comic sales in Japan are showing signs of decline, the comics industry is attempting to develop more socially conscious stories, and has struck gold with Burakku Jakku e Yoroshiku, a series about Japan s cynical medical industry...|$|E
