He curried support from the five constitutional officers in those counties (sheriff, Commonwealth's attorney, clerk of the court, county treasurer, and commissioner of revenue). This {{formed the basis of}} the Byrd Organization, which dominated Virginia politics well into the 1960s. They carefully vetted candidates for statewide office, and Byrd only made <b>an</b> <b>endorsement,</b> <b>or</b> [...] "nod," [...] after consulting with them. Without his [...] "nod," [...] no one could win statewide office in Virginia. While he was governor, he shortened the ballot so that only three officials ran statewide: the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. This limited opportunities to challenge the candidates that he wanted to run. His secondary roads bill in 1932, which became known as the Byrd Road Act, did not apply to the state's independent cities.|$|E

5000|$|Sandra Day O’Connor was {{unpredictable}} {{in many of}} her court decisions, {{especially those}} regarding First Amendment Establishment Cause issues. This {{might be due to}} the fact that instead of letting herself be guided by her conservative ideologies, she decided on a case-by-case basis and voted with careful deliberation in a way that she felt benefited individual rights and the Constitution (which she viewed to be “an ever changing work in progress.”) Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said, “O’Connor was a conservative, but she saw the complexity of church-state issues and tried to choose a course that respected the country’s religious diversity” (Hudson 2005). O’Connor voted in favor of religious institutions, such as in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, Mitchell v. Helms, and Rosenberger v. University of Virginia. Conversly, in Lee v. Weisman she was part of the majority in the case that saw religious prayer and pressure to stand in silence at a graduation ceremony as part of a religious act that coerced people to support/participate in religion, which is strictly prohibited by the Establishment Clause. This is consistent with a similar case, Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, involving prayer at a school football game. In this case O’Connor joined the majority opinion that stated prayer at school football games violates the Establishment Clause (Oyez, 2016). O'Connor was the first justice to articulate the [...] "no endorsement" [...] standard for the Establishment Clause. In Lynch v. Donnelly, O'Connor wrote for a 5-4 majority that a nativity scene in a public Christmas display did not violate the First Amendment because it was not expressing <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>or</b> disapproval of any religion.|$|E
