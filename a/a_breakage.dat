25|$|One Australian {{study of}} 184 men looked at penis length and {{circumference}} {{in relationship to}} condom breakage or slippage. 3,658 condoms were used. The study found that when used correctly condoms had <b>a</b> <b>breakage</b> rate of 1.34% and a slippage rate of 2.05%, for a total failure rate of 3.39%. Penile dimensions did not influence slippage, but penis circumference and broken condoms were strongly correlated, with larger sizes increasing the rate of breakage.|$|E

25|$|The miners took {{to these}} devices without {{hesitation}} as their pay was not calculated {{until they had}} reached their underground workplace. Contemporary safety studies concluded that, although intrinsically dangerous, {{the use of a}} man engine was in practice safer than climbing long ladders: it was less risky to be carried {{up at the end of}} a hard shift than to climb a ladder and risk falling because of exhaustion. In some mines, particularly in Germany, wedges or collars placed just above close-fitting rollers, or chains, were installed to limit any drop should <b>a</b> <b>breakage</b> occur.|$|E
2500|$|A compact {{fluorescent}} lamp (CFL) uses a fluorescent lamp tube which is curved or folded {{to fit into the}} space of an incandescent bulb and contains a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp. Compared to general-service incandescent lamps giving the same amount of visible light, CFLs use one-fifth to one-third the electric power, and may last eight to fifteen times longer. [...] Newer phosphor formulations have improved the perceived color, with [...] "soft white" [...] CFLs judged subjectively similar to standard incandescent lamps. Objections more specifically relating to {{compact fluorescent}} light bulbs include the different quality of light produced by phosphor-based lamps compared to incandescent lamps and that compact fluorescent light bulbs contain small amounts of mercury, a potent neurotoxin, which is especially dangerous to children and pregnant women, and made more serious by the confined area mercury would be dispersed in the event of <b>a</b> <b>breakage</b> indoors. Environmental concerns about mercury contamination from CFLs have been raised, but CFLs can be shown to result in less mercury in the environment compared to traditional incandescent bulbs due to the significant reductions in power plant emissions. Thus, use of energy-efficient bulbs can actually reduce the amount of mercury released into the environment. Compact fluorescent lamps start poorly when very cold, and most types cannot be dimmed. A few specialist applications are unsuitable for CFLs.|$|E
2500|$|A {{court of}} inquiry convened in Wellington, New Zealand, {{published}} its findings on the sinking in a report dated 15 September 1930; the report was issued by the United Kingdom′s Board of Trade in London on 11 December 1930. The court found that the sinking resulted from <b>a</b> <b>breakage</b> of the starboard propeller shaft that not only punctured Tahiti′s hull at her stern, admitting water to her shaft tunnel – which the court deemed survivable – but also tore {{a hole in the}} bulkhead that divided the shaft tunnel from her engine room and No. 3 hold. The court found that the latter hole ultimately caused the ship to sink, as the increasing weight of water flooding the shaft tunnel widened the hole in the bulkhead despite the crew′s effort to contain the flooding and eventually overwhelmed their damage control efforts. The court found both the crew and officials who had certified the ship′s compliance with standards of seaworthiness blameless in the sinking, stated that the breaking of a propeller shaft was a common event at sea but the level of damage sustained by Tahiti in the breaking of her propeller shaft was exceedingly rare, and determined that Tahiti′s sinking was [...] "due to a peril of the sea which no reasonable human care or foresight could have avoided." ...|$|E

6000|$|If a man {{frequently}} passes unjust judgments, {{takes up}} false attitudes, intermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and {{falls into the}} consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make amends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the less ugly because they are ascribed to [...] "temper." [...] Especially I object to the assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is either an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour. If his temper yesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause <b>a</b> <b>breakage</b> in my rib, I feel it no compensation that to-day he vows he will drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day {{as long as he}} lives. Yesterday was what it was, my rib is paining me, it is not a main object of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in his lifelong gentleness. The utmost form of placability I am capable of is to try and remember his better deeds already performed, and, mindful of my own offences, to bear him no malice. But I cannot accept his amends.|$|E
