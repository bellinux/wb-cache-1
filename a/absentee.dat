5|$|All ballots, <b>absentee</b> ballot envelopes, {{and voting}} {{machines}} were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, <b>absentee</b> ballots were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 <b>absentee</b> ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. <b>Absentee</b> ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the <b>absentee</b> ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of <b>absentee</b> ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated <b>absentee</b> ballot voting results. The 2010 election race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E
5|$|Maharashtraian Brahmins were <b>absentee</b> landlords {{and lived}} off the surplus without tilling the land {{themselves}} per ritual restrictions. They were {{often seen as}} the exploiter of the tiller. This situation started to change when the newly independent India enshrined in its constitution, agrarian or land reform. Between 1949–1959, the state governments started enacting legislation {{in accordance with the}} constitution implementing this agrarian reform or Kula Kayada in Marathi. The legislation led to the abolition of various <b>absentee</b> tenures like inams and jagirs. This implementation of land reform had mixed results in different States. On official inquiry, it was revealed that not all <b>absentee</b> tenures were abolished in the State of Maharashtra as of 1985. Other social and political issues include anti-Brahminism and the treatment of Dalits.|$|E

40|$|Background Prior absence is an {{important}} predictor for sickness absence, but {{little is known about}} the recurrence among frequent and/or long-term <b>absentees,</b> over a longer period of time. Aim To monitor sickness absence among frequent and long-term <b>absentees</b> in order to investigate their risk of recurrent absence. Methods Longitudinal cohort study in employees working in three large Dutch postal and telecommunications companies. In the first year of study, we distinguished employees who were absent four times or more (frequent absence), employees who were absent for >= 6 weeks (long-term absence), combined frequent and long-term absence and a reference population. The absence rates in these groups were followed-up for 4 years. Results The study population (n= 53 990) comprised 4126 frequent <b>absentees,</b> 3585 long-term <b>absentees,</b> 979 combined frequent and long-term <b>absentees</b> and a reference population (n = 45 300). Frequent <b>absentees</b> had a higher risk of recurrent frequent absence when compared to the reference population, with rate ratios (RR) amounting to 4. 9 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 4. 7 - 5. 1] in men and 3. 2 (95 % CI 3. 0 - 3. 4) in women. They also had a higher risk of developing long-term absence: RR = 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 8 - 2. 0) in men and 1. 5 (95 % CI 1. 4 - 1. 6) in women. Long-term <b>absentees</b> had high risk of recurrence: RR = 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 8 - 2. 0) in men and RR = 1. 4 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 1. 5) in women. Conclusions Employees with prior frequent and/or long-term absence were at risk of recurrent absence. Frequent absence was a prognostic factor predicting future long-term absence...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Frequent and {{long-term}} <b>absentees</b> were monitored over 5 years {{with regard to}} the risk of work disability and job termination. Methods: A prospective longitudinal cohort study in 53 990 employees of Dutch postal and telecommunications companies. In {{the first year of the}} study, employees who were absent four times or more (frequent absentees; n = 4126), for 6 weeks or more (long-term absentees; n = 3585), and combined frequent {{and long-term}} <b>absentees</b> (n = 979) were distinguished, together with a reference population consisting of 45 300 employees. The disability rate (defined as the number of employees who were absent for > 1 year per 100 employee-years) and the risk of job termination were determined over a period of 4 years. Results: In the reference population, women had a higher disability rate (2. 2 per 100 employee-years) than men (0. 8 per 100 employee-years). Frequent <b>absentees</b> had a disability rate amounting to 2. 5 per 100 employee-years in men and 4. 2 per 100 employee-years in women. Longterm <b>absentees</b> had a disability rate of 6. 7 per 100 employee-years in men and 9. 1 per 100 employee-years in women. Combined frequent and long-term <b>absentees</b> had an even higher disability rate. The risk of employment being terminated (involuntarily) was higher in prior <b>absentees</b> as compared with the reference population (RR = 1. 2 - 2. 1 for job termination and RR = 1. 5 - 2. 5 for involuntary job termination). In men, absences due to neoplasms, mental disorders and respiratory disorders were associated with an increased disability risk as compared with musculoskeletal disorders. Neoplasms and mental disorders were also associated with a higher risk of job termination in men, whereas infectious and neurological diseases were associated with a higher risk of job termination in women. Conclusions: Prior frequent and/or long-term <b>absentees</b> show high work disability in a 4 -year follow-up period. Moreover, they are at higher risk of (involuntary) job termination...|$|R
