5|$|Dayton {{is subject}} to severe weather typical of the Midwestern United States. Tornadoes are {{possible}} from the spring to the fall. Floods, blizzards, and severe thunderstorms can <b>also</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E
5|$|General {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. Significant nail clubbing may <b>also</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Poisoning may <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> {{following}} {{the use of}} a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) due to faulty diving air compressors.|$|E
50|$|Long {{distance}} {{spread of}} PSTVd usually occurs via infected seeds but transmission via aphids (Myzus persicae) <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> {{but only in}} the presence of PLRV (potato leaf roll virus). Mechanical transmission <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> once it has been introduced to an area.|$|R
50|$|Editing <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> in rat.|$|R
5000|$|In all syllables {{closed by}} a {{laryngeal}} in PIE, whether lengthening of a preceding vowel occurred or not. In particular, it <b>also</b> <b>occurred</b> in syllables with a sonorant diphthong. It probably <b>also</b> <b>occurred</b> when the preceding vowel {{was already in}} the lengthened grade.|$|R
5|$|Some {{areas of}} the {{riparian}} buffer of Eddy Creek contain woody herbaceous plants. Strip mine overburden piles covered in forests <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> in the creek's riparian area.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of titanium {{in the waters}} of the Black Creek watershed is less than 0.17 milligrams per liter and the {{concentration of}} zirconium is less than 0.055 milligrams per liter. Small amounts (less than 0.01 milligrams per liter) of vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> in the water. The cobalt concentration in mine waters in the watershed ranges from 0.07 to 0.93 milligrams per liter and the nickel concentration ranges from 0.09 to 1.2 milligrams per liter. Copper, silver, tin, and lead <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Attributive Adjectives {{after the}} noun they modify, and inflect for number and gender. Adjectives may <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> alone, {{in which case}} they become an NP. Practically all {{adjectives}} also have a verbal form used for predicative purposes, which behaves just like a normal verb.|$|E
50|$|Palatalization <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> in many words.|$|R
50|$|Sex-specific {{mortality}} of embryos <b>also</b> <b>occurs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Myctophum nitidulum <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> in the Galapagos.|$|R
5|$|Cerebellar atrophy {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemannâ€“Pick disease. Cerebellar atrophy can <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> {{as a result of}} exposure to toxins including heavy metals or pharmaceutical or recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Major floods <b>also</b> <b>occurred</b> in 1974 and 2012.|$|R
50|$|A minor ionic <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> in line 11.|$|R
50|$|Imbrius <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> as a surname of Eetion.|$|R
5|$|Extremely rare albino individuals, {{sometimes}} called white panthers, <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> among jaguars, {{as with the}} other big cats. As usual with albinos in the wild, selection keeps the frequency close to the rate of mutation.|$|E
5|$|Glassmakers {{throughout}} history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass {{manufacture of glass}} fiber was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. Glass fibers can <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> naturally, as Pele's hair.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reversals}} <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> {{in lines}} four and eight. Potential initial reversal occur in lines one, five, seven, nine, and twelve; while potential mid-line reversals occur in lines three, seven, and thirteen.|$|E
50|$|Major floods <b>also</b> <b>occurred</b> in 1974 and 2012.|$|R
50|$|Ringing <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> in the wavelet-based JPEG 2000.|$|R
50|$|Three major {{corporate}} events <b>also</b> <b>occurred</b> in 2006.|$|R
5|$|Logarithms <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> in {{log-normal}} distributions. When the logarithm of {{a random}} variable has a normal distribution, the variable {{is said to}} have a log-normal distribution. Log-normal distributions are encountered in many fields, wherever a variable is formed as the product of many independent positive random variables, for example in the study of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Microdontia of {{a single}} tooth {{is more likely to}} occur in a maxillary lateral incisor. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in {{pituitary}} gigantism and pineal hyperplasia. It may <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> {{on one side of the}} face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.|$|E
5|$|Other mating systems, {{including}} polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity, <b>also</b> <b>occur.</b> Polygamous breeding systems {{arise when}} females {{are able to}} raise broods {{without the help of}} males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Candicine <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> {{in several}} plants of Citrus genus.|$|R
25|$|Assembly <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> in Pakistan, Malaysia and South Africa.|$|R
25|$|The Jacobian <b>also</b> <b>occurs</b> in {{the inverse}} {{function}} theorem.|$|R
5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|Postovulatory follicles are {{structures}} formed after oocyte release; they do {{not have}} endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can <b>also</b> <b>occur,</b> but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
5|$|Seizures may <b>also</b> <b>occur</b> as a {{consequence}} of other health problems; if they occur right around a specific cause, such as a stroke, head injury, toxic ingestion or metabolic problem, they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.|$|E
