5|$|With {{the spread}} of {{cardiovascular}} surgery in India, the annual scientific meeting of the thoracic <b>and</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> surgeons was held independently in 1985 under the new title Association of Thoracic <b>and</b> <b>Cardiovascular</b> Surgeons of India. In 1990 the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons was registered at Bombay. On 15 June 1991, the Association of Thoracic <b>and</b> <b>Cardiovascular</b> Surgeons of India was dissolved through a unanimous resolution passed by its general body during its annual meeting in Bombay, and its entire membership, funds, and assets were transferred to the new Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons. Panday was elected as {{the first president of}} the latter society on 15 June 1991. The following year, the Fellowship of the Association (F.I.A.C.S) was instituted and regular biannual publication of the Journal of the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons commenced.|$|E

5|$|Siddiqui's first {{breakthrough}} in research {{came when he}} successfully isolated an antiarrhythmic agent in 1931 from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina. He named the newly discovered chemical compound as Ajmaline, after his mentor Hakim Ajmal Khan {{who was one of}} the illustrious practitioners of Unani system of medicine in South Asia. Later on, Siddiqui also extracted other alkaloids from Rauwolfia serpentina that included Ajmalinine, Ajmalicine (C21H24N2O3), Isoajmaline, Neoajmaline, Serpentine and Serpentinine. Many of these are still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders <b>and</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> ailments, especially as antiarrhythmic agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year.

It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
