40|$|Determination of {{the causes}} of the Permian-Triassic {{boundary}} (PTB) biotic crisis is hindered primarily by the diachronous nature of the used PTB, poor stratigraphic control of compared Upper Permian and Lower Triassic faunas, especially in continental biotopes, poor knowledge of the lower and middle Scythian faunas from many environments, and by interpolation of the unknown (lower and middle) Scythian diversity from the known Upper Permian and Middle Triassic diversity data in many major fossil groups. Most of these problems can be resolved by using the first appearance datum (FAD) of Hindeodus parvus as either an isochronous PTB, or as an isochronous marker level very close {{to the base of the}} Triassic; careful studies of fossil-rich, complete continental boundary sections (e. g., Dalongkou in Sinkiang), and utilisation of uninterpolated diversity data, which are based on known Scythian data, for the reconstruction of the extinction and recovery patterns in all fossil groups. The most important features of the PTB biotic crisis are: (1) Among the marine biota, only the plankton and the warm-water benthos, nektobenthos and nekton are strongly affected by the PTB biotic crisis. (2) The recovery of the warm-water nekton and nektobenthos was very fast (after one conodont zone). The recovery of the warm-water benthos, some of the plankton (radiolarians) and the terrestrial plant productivity was strongly delayed for several million years, and occurred only in the upper Olenekian (upper Scythian) and in the Middle Triassic. (3) The number of the Lazarus taxa that re-appeared in the upper Olenekian and above all in the Middle Triassic, is very high (about 50 %) and in some fossil groups 90 - 100 % at generic level. The reconstruction of the scenario for the PTB biotic crisis requires not only the consideration of the uninterpolated extinction and recovery patterns of all fossil groups across all environments, but must also account for the main features of geological evolution from the Middle Permian to the Lower Triassic. The most important causal factors in the PTB biotic crisis are the extinction event at the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary that restricted the diverse Upper Permian warm-water benthos to the Tethyan shelves, the long-lasting, widespread Siberian Trap volcanism (Dzhulfian-lower Scythian) which was the greatest volcanic event during the Phanerozoic, and the very strong explosive felsic to intermediate volcanism around the PTB, close to the margin between eastern Tethys and Panthalassa. These volcanic activities resulted in those climatic changes that were directly and indirectly (as cause of the oceanic superanoxia) responsible for the PTB biotic crisis, such as periodic cooling of the climate by volcanic dust and sulphate aerosols (mainly caused by the Siberian Trap <b>volcanism),</b> <b>acid</b> rain, a 3 - 6 month “volcanic winter” at low latitudes and the strongly reduced input of sunlight during the uppermost Dorashamian (both caused by the very strong explosive volcanism at the Tethys/Panthalassa margin), followed by global warming in the lower Scythian, and uppermost Dorashamian to lower Scythian superanoxia...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Late Cretaceous and Paleocene lissamphibians (e. g., {{salamanders}} and albanerpetontids) and squamates (e. g., lizards and snakes) {{are common}} {{components of the}} nonmarine vertebrate fossil record of North America. However, {{within the context of}} the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction (ca. 66 million years ago) those clades have received little attention relative to other aspects of the continental biota (e. g., dinosaurs, mammals). This dissertation represents the first comprehensive study of salamander (Caudata) and salamander-like lissamphibians (Allocaudata: Albanerpetontidae) and nonmarine squamates leading up to and across the K-Pg boundary. The primary impetus behind these studies was to better determine the timing, mode, and severity of lissamphibian and squamate extinctions and to address the proposed causal mechanisms of the mass extinction and their ancillary effects prior to (e. g., climate change, Deccan Traps <b>volcanism,</b> <b>acid</b> rain) and at the K-Pg boundary (e. g., bolide impact, thermal pulse). To assess lissamphibian and squamate diversity patterns leading up to and across the K-Pg boundary, my coauthors and I documented temporal species richness, taxonomic composition, and turnover. The larger lissamphibian dataset (2021 specimens versus 200 in squamates) allowed for additional quantitative measures of diversity to be calculated including faunal evenness, heterogeneity indices, and relative abundance distributions. Species-level diversity was recorded from a succession of ≥ 45 temporally constrained vertebrate microfossil localities of the uppermost Cretaceous Hell Creek and lowermost Paleocene Tullock formations of Garfield County, northeastern Montana, USA. Results of the caudate and allocaudate study revealed a stepwise pattern of species loss during the last ca. 200 k. y. of the Cretaceous (based on new and revised age determinations of the study area). Five of nine species were either extirpated (33 %) from the local area or went extinct (22 %) at or near the K-Pg boundary. Declines in species diversity and significant changes in community structure coincided with those species losses. Combined, these results suggest growing ecological stress in the local caudate and allocaudate faunas prior to the bolide impact at the K-Pg boundary. Squamates suffered high species extinctions (81 %) during the last ca. 200 k. y. of the Cretaceous which were concentrated nearer the K-Pg boundary. Though species extinctions were highest across the K-Pg boundary, low to high levels of turnover (appearances and disappearances) in the squamate faunas of northeastern Montana occurred throughout most of the depositional duration of the Hell Creek Formation (ca. 1. 9 Ma). Coincident with a moderate level of local squamate turnover that occurred more than ca. 300 k. y. before the K-Pg boundary was the loss of chamopsiids and platynotans possessing monocuspid and fang-like teeth, respectively, from the lower to upper halves of the Hell Creek Formation. A similar but less pronounced biostratigraphic pattern has been observed in other aspects of the local vertebrate faunas (euselachians, lissamphibians, turtles, and mammals). The caudate fauna of the earliest Paleocene satisfies several expectations of early post-extinction recovery faunas in being species depauperate (five species), predominated by a “bloom” taxon (Opisthotriton kayi), and invaded by immigrants (Proamphiuma cretacea). A Lazarus taxon (the caudate Prodesmodon copei) reappeared as early as the Pu 2 / 3 of the local section. The squamate fauna during that interval possessed two chamopsiid lizards. Chamopsiids are part of a clade thought to have gone extinct during the K-Pg mass extinction. These new records suggest that chamopsiids were a “dead clade walking” as they failed to recover in abundance or diversity following the extinction. Several new fossil lissamphibians and squamates were documented in this dissertation including a new fossil salamander (proteid) and several lizards (indeterminate iguanomorph, six scincomorphs, and five anguimorphs) from the Hell Creek Formation. Results of my systematic and phylogenetic work demonstrate that the Hell Creek Formation of the study area contains the taxonomically richest caudate and squamate assemblages known from the Mesozoic of North America. My coauthored description and phylogenetic analysis of a new stem iguanian lizard from the slightly older deposits of the Two Medicine Formation (Campanian) of northwestern Montana has yielded important insights into the evolution of Iguanomorpha during the Late Cretaceous. The new taxon, Magnuviator ovimonsensis gen. et sp. nov., represents the oldest unequivocal iguanomorph from North America and is the sister taxon to a clade of paracontemporaneous iguanomorphs (Temujiniidae) from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Its phylogenetic relationships imply that crown iguanians were likely absent from North America prior to the K-Pg boundary despite previous claims. Combined, these systematic and phylogenetic studies add to the growing taxonomic inventory of the lissamphibian and squamate fossil record and enhance our understanding of their evolution within Montana, across the Western Interior of North America, and across the northern landmasses of Laurasia during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleocene...|$|R

As a generalisation the rocks dip towards the northeast and become younger in that direction. The base of the sequence consists of basic (Komatiitic) lavas, and this is overlain by basic pyroclastic volcanic rocks. Towards the end of the basic pyroclastic stage a centre of <b>acid</b> <b>volcanism</b> developed, and the sulphide deposits can be related to exhalite activity during the waning stages of <b>acid</b> <b>volcanism.</b> The termination of basic pyroclastic volcanism was followed by deposition of a sequence of basic volcanogenic sediment and/or waterlain tuff, and extrusion of local pillow lava units. Abundant basic intrusions may be contemporaneous with the build-up of the volcanic pile. The volcanic sequence was intruded by the Burlington Granodiorite on the west, and Cape Brule Porphyry on the east.

At {{the scale of the}} Mako Group, the Mesorhyacian Sandikounda-Soukouta granodioritic suite and coeval intermediate to <b>acid</b> <b>volcanism</b> (2. 18 - 2. 14 Ga) reflect the consumption of the Eorhyacian juvenile crust during early collision stages. The breakup of Eo-Rhycian rocks, between 2. 14 and 2. 10 Ga has resulted in the formation of a main detrital basin that is now referred as the Dialé-Daléma Group.

Geological and structural surveys in a wide area surrounding Los Azufres reveal that this complex is situated in an area of unusual concentration of <b>acid</b> <b>volcanism,</b> consisting of four pyroclastic units and several dome complexes. Although a complete caldera structure is not morphologically evident, several facts suggest a long collapse history at Los A zufres:- the {{geothermal field}} lies at the centre of a subcircular depressed area (27 × 26 km in size) filled by a distinctive fluviolaeustrine sequence:- Middle to Late Miocene rocks bound to the south and to the north of this depression and are encountered only at depth inside it;- four large ignimbritic suites of latest Miocene and Pliocenc age outcrop outside the depression;- volume estimations of these pyroclastic products are comparable with the missing volume of the depressed area:- no alternative caldera structures exist in a radius of 200 km from Los Azufres;- dacitic to rhyolitic lavas, principally extruded as dome complexes, were emplaced inside this depression during the Pleistocene. Los Azufres is therefore interpreted as a nested caldera of latest Miocene and Pliocene age, The recent regional tectonic evolution of the central sector of MVB comprises a Late Miocene-Early Pliocene left-lateral transcurrent phase, followed by a Late Pl iocene-Quaternary transtensional one.

40|$|The NE - SW {{trending}} G?rdes basin {{developed in}} the early Miocene as indicated by palynological data and K-Ar dating of igneous rocks. In the basin centre rhyolitic and dacitic volcanic domes cut the Neogene sedimentary filling and ophiolitic basement of the Izmir-Ankara suture zone. Geochronological data and field relationships demonstrate that compressional movement on this suture zone had ceased, at least, before the latest Oligocene. The palynological data from the E-W trending Alasehir and Buyuk Menderes graben fillings indicate that these major extensional structures started to develop during middle Burdigalian-middle Serravallian. Consequently, it is concluded that N-S extensional tectonics in west Turkey commenced in the early Miocene. It {{is evident from the}} age determinations of the G?rdes basin and the Alasehir and Buyuk Menderes grabens that the E-W and NE-SW trending grabens / basins developed coevally under a N-S extensional regime during the early Miocene in west Turkey. This joint initiation of basins is inconsistent with both the cross graben and the multi-phased extensional models. In west Turkey, the latest Oligocene-early Miocene calcalkaline intermediate and <b>acid</b> <b>volcanism</b> with an inherited subduction-related geochemical signature occurred under the N-S extensional regime. Due to the continuation of extension after the late Miocene the thickness of the lithosphere would be reduced and consequently alkaline volcanism became dominant in this advanced stage of extension (late Miocene and younger). This change in nature of volcanism is not related to a change of regional tectonic regime as previously thought. It is apparent from the above findings that the tectonic escape and back-arc spreading models cannot explain the commencement of extensional regime due to the younger triggering events, the collision of Eurasia / Arabia in Langhian-Serravallian and inception of the roll-back process in late Serravallian-early Tortonian. Alternatively it is proposed that N-S extensional tectonics is related to spreading and thinning of the crust which commenced in the early Miocene. This occurred immediately after the cessation of compressional regime due to the high thermal profile of the crust in west Turkey...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFelsic volcanics {{constitute}} {{a primary source}} of uranium for forming an economic deposit. All over the world, volcanic rocks have not received due attention they deserve in uranium exploration. The volcanogenic deposits have been grouped with “other deposits”, as they {{constitute a}} meager< 0. 5 % of world uranium resources. Exploration inputs {{in the western world}} have identified a number of uranium deposits associated with volcanic rocks. The uranium resources contributed by volcanic type deposits all over the world stand at 3, 62, 000 te U 3 O 8 (IAEA 2008 Compilation). The significance of acid volcanic rocks as a potential uranium source lies in the readily leachable form of their uranium content. A detailed study carried out in Australia to understand the spatial and temporal relationsh ip between the uranium deposits and the unmineralized, uranium enriched rocks from across the continent clearly indicated the role of the acidic volcanics as a potential provenance. Among the acid volcanics, rhyolites form an ideal source followed by welde d tuffs, ignimbrites, etc. The alkali or topaz rhyolite is ideal for its enrichment in many lithophile elements including uranium, which are amenable to subsequent leaching by meteoric water. In India the uranium exploration activities in the early 50 s till the 90 s were mainly confined to the Singhbhum Shear Zones, the Himalayas,Meghalaya plateau, parts of Central India and the geological environs of the Dharwar Craton. The granitic rocks, especially the peraluminous biotite – granite was always considered as a potential source for uranium and the geological environs closer to these granites always remained the first order targets. A number of small to medium size uranium deposits have been identified in Singhbhum Shear Zone, parts of Cuddappah, Bhima Basins and in Meghalaya. Now since the significance of the volcanic rocks, especially the felsic volcanics as a potential source of uranium has been clearly understood, it is imperative to reorient our exploration strategy to tap the potential of these volcanic rocks. The Malani Magmatic Province (MMP) in the northwestern part is the largest suite of an -orogenic acid volcanics in India occupying an area of 50000 sqkm. The Proterozoic Basins of India are replete with volcanic activity, mainly <b>acid</b> <b>volcanism.</b> In the southern and Central India, Dharwar and parts of Central Indian Craton also witnessed significant acidic igneous activities.

In view of this the Proterozoic Basins mentioned above and the geological environs adjacent to the MMP deserve a re -look to have a proper assessment of their uranium potential, using integrated exploration inputs...|$|E

Two central volcanoes were active in the Esja region; the Kjalarnes volcano was active for about 0. 6 million years and was succeeded after a short interval by the Stardalur volcano, which remained active for about 0. 3 million years. Flood-basalt volcanism was concomitant with the central volcanism, and most of the olivine tholeiites are considered to have been erupted in fissures and shield volcanoes unrelated to the central volcanoes. Igneous activity apparently migrated eastwards with time, reflecting the westward crustal drift away from the active volcanic zone, which is a subaerial extension of the mid-Atlantic ridge. The volcanics are tilted and downfaulted towards the east. The irregular topography created by the glaciations in Esja repeatedly prevented lavas erupted in the active volcanic zone from spreading over the tectonically less active neighbour- hood, thus producing angular unconformities in the stratigraphic succession from which the tectonic history of the region can be read. The Esja evidence suggests that tectonic activity is chiefly restricted to the active volcanic zone, and that the crust becomes tectonically inactive soon after it has drifted away from the active zone. Intrusive activity in Esja can be divided into three phases. The oldest dykes in the region trend N 25 Â°E and contemporaneous sheets dip towards the Kjalarnes peninsula, where the intrusive activity culminated in the formation of a multiple dolerite sheet. This intrusion may have been preceded by a caldera collapse in the Kjalarnes area. After the intrusion of the Kjalarnes dolerites the regional trend of dykes changed to N 40 Â°E, and a narrow dyke swarm (representing up to 20 % dilation) cut across the Kjalarnes central volcano. The dyke swarm was succeeded by cone sheets focussing to the south of Leidhamrar, and the second phase culminated in the intrusion of large dolerite sheets in Ãverfell and LauganÃ­pa. Following a brief interval, during which flood-basalt volcanism was dominant in Esja, the Stardalur central volcano became active and, during its life span, minor intrusions were predominantly in sheet form. Caldera collapse in the Stardalur volcano was followed by the intrusion of basic cone sheets, large dolerite sheets, a sill and finally a laccolith within the caldera. Long after the caldera had been filled the caldera fault zone dominated over the regional fault pattern at depth so that basic and acid volcanics alike were erupted concentrically with and parasitically to the Stardalur caldera. Large dolerite intrusions in Esja are found chiefly within or at the boundaries of the thick hyaloclastite units, and there is evidence of dykes cutting straight through lava successions, but spreading out laterally to form sill-like bodies once they enter the less coherent hyaloclastites. A survey of the literature shows that the majority of large basic intrusions. in Iceland are accommodated in relatively soft and "structureless" host rocks, such as tuffaceous hyaloclastites, sediments, vent and caldera agglomerates, hydrothermally propylitized lavas, and "hot" and still partly liquid acid intrusive material. The majority of the large intrusions are in the form of inclined sheets, but sills and laccoliths are formed when the intrusions are emplaced at shallow levels (perhaps less than 1 km) in the crust. The coincidence of central volcanoes having a great bulk of shallow level intrusions, with positive gravity anomalies, and the sites of shallow depth to layer 3 in Iceland strongly suggests that crustal layer 3 consists mostly of basic intrusions. A comparison of the densities of primary and secondary minerals of tholeiitic rocks suggests that infilling of vesicles of porous basalt lavas by secondary minerals will not make the rock as dense as a non-porous rock of the same composition. The estimated density difference of 0. 2 g/cm 3 between crustal layers 2 and 3 can apparently not be ascribed to secondary alteration of subaerial lavas, but can readily be explained by a transition from altered lavas to non-porous intrusives. It is proposed that the sharp boundary between layers 2 and 3 results from the lavas at the base of layer 2 reaching a degree of alteration at which the rock becomes sufficiently incoherent to accommodate large basic intrusions. The "metamorphic boundary" proposed by PÃ¡lmason (1971) to explain the correlation between the thermal gradient and depth to layer 3 in Iceland is not therefore primarily a density boundary, but a boundary at which the lavas loose their strength as a result of alteration and host voluminous dense intrusives. The large scale features of crustal layer 3 in Iceland can be explained within the framework of this model. There is a complete range in composition from olivine tholeiites to rhyolites in the Esja volcanic succession, and the majority of the rocks contain some phenocrysts. Crystal fractionation appears to be a feasible mechanism to explain the chemical variation within at least the basaltic rocks in Esja, but whether the intermediate and acid rocks are formed by extensive fractionation or by partial melting of crustal material cannot be answered. The apparent coincidence in time of the emplacement of large basic intrusives and the commencement of intermediate and <b>acid</b> <b>volcanism</b> in eastern Esja may suggest that the rise of voluminous basic magmas has raised the thermal gradient sufficiently to produce the intermediate and acid rocks by partial melting {{at the base of the}} crust. Positive gravity anomalies associated with the Kjalarnes and Stardalur central volcanoes are attributed to high level intrusives in the core regions of the two centres. Specific gravity measurements of the chemically analysed rocks from Esja show a range of densities from about 2. 5 (rhyolite) to about 3. 15 g/cm 3 (olivine tholeiite). Local gravity anomalies commonly found associated with central volcanoes are probably due both to local concentrations of rocks of different chemistry and to a high percentage of intrusives. A comparison of the average density of the crust in eastern Iceland and that of the crust on the Iceland-Faeroe ridge suggests that a considerable part of the negative Bouguer gravity anomaly of Iceland (Einarsson 1954) can be explained in terms of geochemical differences between the volcanics of Iceland and those of the surrounding areas. The similarity of the gravity profiles from the aseismic Iceland-Faeroe ridge and from the active Reykjanes ridge to the centre of Iceland suggests that, if a hot spot contributes to the bowl-shaped gravity anomaly of Iceland (Bott et al 1971), then it is not connected with layer 4 under the Reykjanes ridge. A positive magnetic anomaly associated with the Stardalur caldera is explained in terms of a thick pile of normal polarity eruptives within the caldera being surrounded essentially by reverse polarity eruptives. The combined effects of a high magnetite content (which may be caused by unusually high partial pressure of oxygen in the melt) and a high palaeofield strength may cause the very high magnetic intensity of lavas, which give rise to a sharp maximum within the Stardalur magnetic anomaly. Assuming a common cause for three other strong magnetic anomalies, which, with Stardalur, lie on a straight line and are separated regularly in space and time, the possibility of a mantle controlled "high partial pressure of oxygen spot" migrating at half the spreading speed along the spreading axis is discussed. </p...|$|E
