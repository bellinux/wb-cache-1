5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} {{are attached to}} a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons <b>and</b> <b>holes</b> from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E

30|$|The {{electron}} <b>and</b> <b>hole</b> {{responsible for}} the I 2 emission can be localized at different NDs in the low-temperature regime and then the electron <b>and</b> <b>hole</b> pair is spatially separated. Therefore, the recombination probability decreases significantly (non-emissive). Increasing the temperature, the electron <b>and</b> <b>hole</b> are thermally excited to the free-like state (emitting I 2), and the recombination of the electron <b>and</b> <b>hole</b> can take place again. We find that the Elow 2 value indicating the activation (localization) energy of the I 2 emission at low temperatures agrees well with the energy difference between Eact 1 and Eact 2; Eact 1 (490 meV) − Eact 2 (410 meV) = 80 meV (Elow 2 = 90 meV). From this correspondence, we attribute the gradual increase in the I 2 emission at the low-temperature region to the thermal excitation of the carriers from the dark state, where the electron <b>and</b> <b>hole</b> are localized in different individual NDs, to the free-like state among neighboring NDs.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps <b>and</b> <b>holes)</b> in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E

The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the effective-mass envelope-function theory, the electronic and optical properties of a spherical core-shell quantum-dot quantum well (QDQW) structure with one and two wells have been investigated. The results show that the energies of electron <b>and</b> <b>hole</b> states depend sensitively on the well thickness and core radius of quantum-dot quantum well structure. An interesting spatially separated characteristic of electron <b>and</b> <b>hole</b> in QDQW is found and enhanced significantly in the two-wells case.

50|$|Normally, {{excitons}} in a semiconductor have a {{very short}} lifetime due to the close proximity of the electron <b>and</b> <b>hole.</b> However, by placing the electron <b>and</b> <b>hole</b> in spatially separated quantum wells with an insulating barrier layer in between so called 'spatially indirect' excitons can be created. In contrast to ordinary (spatially direct), these spatially indirect excitons can have large spatial separation between the electron <b>and</b> <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> thus possess a much longer lifetime. This {{is often used to}} cool excitons to very low temperatures in order to study Bose Einstein condensation (or rather its 2 dimensional analog).|$|R

Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices <b>and</b> <b>holes</b> in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation.|$|E

Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used it at the end of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters <b>and</b> <b>holes</b> on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the fight with the Landlady and her husband are also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E

5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks {{spend much}} of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram {{ventilation}} and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices <b>and</b> <b>holes</b> to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within a particular area of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver the two of them into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E
5|$|The finder did not {{initially}} realise {{that he had}} found a Roman artefact and thought at first that it was a Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks <b>and</b> <b>holes</b> using resin and cyanoacrylate, retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E

5|$|With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark {{specializes in}} wriggling into narrow crevices <b>and</b> <b>holes</b> in the reef and extracting prey {{inaccessible}} to other reef sharks.

This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency sounds in the 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.|$|E
