5|$|Lafayette Square is one {{of three}} squares laid out in Joseph Ellicott's city plan. The square is located three blocks east of Niagara Square and is the second most {{important}} space in downtown Buffalo. The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid transit to the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in what is called the Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (<b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (<b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> eastbound connection to Clinton Street).|$|E
5|$|In 2017, for <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> Taipei–Zuoying trip, a THSR Standard Car adult {{ticket is}} NT$1,490, {{which was about}} $47 USD; a Business Car ticket fare is NT$1,950, about $62 USD. The cost of a non-reserved seat is {{approximately}} 3% less than the regular price. Business and standard car reserved ticket reservations are available 28 days prior to the date of departure (including the departure day).|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E

5|$|The two routes remain {{concurrent}} as they snake to {{the northwest}} through Tompkins County. Southwest {{of the city of}} Ithaca in the town of Ithaca, NY34 and NY96 meet NY13. The three routes continue northeast through the town, intersecting NY327 and NY13A before crossing over the inlet of Cayuga Lake and entering the city of Ithaca on Meadow Street. Here, NY96B reconnects to its parent at the junction of Clinton and Meadow Streets. North of this point, Meadow Street splits into <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> couplet, with Fulton Street carrying southbound traffic and Meadow Street handling northbound traffic. NY79, also routed on <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> couplet here, crosses NY96 at Green and Seneca Streets, with NY79 eastbound using one block of Fulton Street to travel from State Street to Green Street.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, {{the balance}} of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much {{depleted}} and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In {{a desperate attempt to}} slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, US25 {{was changed}} to traffic along <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> pairing of streets on the {{southwest}} side of Port Huron. Northbound traffic remained on Military Avenue while southbound traffic was diverted to Electric Avenue. Two US25A routings were created in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first, near Erie, was numbered in 1937, and renumbered US24A by 1945. The second in Port Huron provided access to the Blue Water Bridge from the mainline of the highway starting in 1940. That last segment of US25 to be paved was completed near Port Hope {{at the end of}} the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival.

5|$|M-58 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with M-47 (Midland Road) near the Tittabawassee River in Saginaw Township. It runs east on State Street through a commercial {{area in the}} township. Continuing east, the adjoining properties transition to residential buildings. Between Avalon and Lathrop avenues, M-58 splits into <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> pairing of streets: eastbound traffic continues along State Street, but westbound traffic uses Davenport Avenue, one block to the north. Just east of this split, M-58 crosses into the City of Saginaw.|$|E
5|$|MD 198 {{continues}} east as Sandy Spring Road, which {{drops to}} four lanes {{as the road}} leaves Burtonsville. The route crosses the MontgomeryPrince George's county line and temporarily expands to six lanes between the intersection with Old Gunpowder Road and Bond Mill Road and the state highway's junction with I-95 in West Laurel. The junction is a cloverleaf interchange with a flyover ramp from westbound MD 198 to southbound I-95. MD 198 again becomes six lanes at {{the east end of}} the interchange where the highway enters the city of Laurel. At Ninth Street, the state highway splits into <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> pair that uses Gorman Avenue eastbound and Talbott Avenue westbound. MD 198 meets the southern end of MD 216 (Seventh Street) and intersects US 1, which comprises <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> pair that uses Washington Boulevard southbound and Second Street northbound. East of US 1, Gorman and Talbott Avenues come together to form Fort Meade Road, a six-lane divided highway that crosses CSX's Capital Subdivision, which carries MARC's Camden Line.|$|E

5|$|NY376 follows Raymond Avenue {{for about}} a mile (1.6km) to the hamlet of Arlington. Here, it meets US44 and NY55, both of which follow <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> couplet along Haight Street (eastbound) and Maple Street (westbound) through the city of Poughkeepsie. In between the two streets, NY376 intersects Main Street (CR114). The route ends upon {{intersecting}} westbound US44 and NY55, {{at which point the}} routing of NY376 becomes an unnumbered town road named Van Wagner Road.|$|E
5|$|NY92 {{begins as}} a city-maintained highway at an {{intersection}} with US11 (State Street) in downtown Syracuse. The route heads eastward on East Genesee Street, passing under I-81 before splitting into <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> couplet at Almond Street. For the next two blocks, the eastbound and westbound lanes of NY92 are separated by a small park situated within the block formed by Almond Street, Forman Avenue, and both directions of Genesee Street. The couplet ends just east of Forman Avenue, at which point NY92 continues on as a highway two lanes wide with dedicated cycle lanes in each direction.|$|E
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses.

Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E

It comes to an interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway) and crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line adjacent to Penn Station serving Amtrak and MARC's Penn Line. Past the train station, MD 2 intersects the southern terminus of MD 25, which follows <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> pair along eastbound Lanvale Street (carrying the southbound direction) and westbound Lafayette Avenue (carrying the northbound direction), before it comes to its northern terminus at US 1 and US 40 Truck (North Avenue).|$|E

In the off-season, Glass filed for arbitration, looking for <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> contract to ensure an NHL salary. He was re-signed on July 12, 2010, to a one-year contract worth $625,000.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
