5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>African</b> Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E

Kolkana refused to sell or donate the land {{back to the city}} of West Palm Beach, but halted any plans for construction on the property. In 1992, city work crews located human remains on the property using a backhoe. The bones were reburied, but their locations were marked. Resident Robert Hazard established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition in 1999 as a non-profit organization used to reacquire the land and solicit donations for a memorial complex. The complex was originally intended to include an educational center and a museum <b>about</b> <b>African</b> American pioneers and migrant farm workers, at a cost of approximately $6.1million. Organizations such as the Sankofa Society proposed a less sophisticated plan of erecting an information wall and a large marble headstone, at a far less expensive cost of about $43,000.|$|E

25|$|A 1999 {{study showed}} that among churchgoers, those who go to {{segregated}} or primarily white churches {{are more likely to}} exhibit racist behaviors or to have prejudiced ideas <b>about</b> <b>African</b> Americans.

500|$|An era of {{independent}} filmmaking brought different stories, writers, and directors to films. [...] Desert Hearts arrived in 1985, {{to be one}} of the most successful. Directed by lesbian Donna Deitch, it is loosely based on Jane Rule's novel Desert of the Heart. It received mixed critical commentary, but earned positive reviews from the gay press. The late 1980s and early 1990s ushered in a series of films treating gay and lesbian issues seriously, made by gays and lesbians, nicknamed New Queer Cinema. Films using lesbians as a subject included Rose Troche's avant garde romantic comedy Go Fish (1994) and the first film <b>about</b> <b>African</b> American lesbians, Cheryl Dunye's The Watermelon Woman, in 1995.|$|E

In it, he distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He {{lashed out at}} those who critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: [...] "no man can understand another whose language he does not speak (and 'language' here does not mean simply words, but a man's entire world view)."
