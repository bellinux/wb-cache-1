There are seven flow resistances (or pressure drops) encountered by the working fluid stream for the inverse Brayton cycle. Two of these, the friction through the blades and vanes of the compressor and the expander, {{are related to the}} isentropic efficiencies. The remaining flow resistances are always present because of the changes in flow cross-section at the compressor inlet and outlet, heat exchanger inlets and outlets and expander inlet and outlet. The analytical formulae about the cooling load of refrigeration cycle, the heating load of heat pump cycle and other coefficients are derived, which indicate that the thermodynamic performance for open inverse Brayton cycle can be optimized by adjusting the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (or the distribution of pressure losses along the flow path).
