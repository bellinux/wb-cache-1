5|$|The Benjamin Franklin impersonator flirts with Pam <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> {{much to her}} chagrin. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) teases {{her about}} this and Jim playfully asks if she sees any {{potential}} with him. Embarrassed, and feigning that she is over Jim, Pam tells Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) that she's ready {{to be set up}} with one of his friends from business school, which visibly pains Jim.|$|E
5|$|Kyoto held {{a year-long}} celebration commemorating the 1000th anniversary of Genji in 2008, with poetry competitions, {{visits to the}} Tale of Genji Museum in Uji and Ishiyama-dera (where a life size {{rendition}} of Murasaki <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> was displayed), and women dressing in traditional 12-layered Heian court Jūnihitoe and ankle-length hair wigs. The author and her work inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin-offs. The design on the reverse of the first 2000 yen note commemorated her and The Tale of Genji. A plant bearing purple berries has been named after her.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{became a}} popular subject of {{paintings}} and illustrations highlighting {{her as a}} virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> in Ishimyama Temple, staring at the moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject of hanging scrolls in the 17th century. The Tale of Genji became a favorite subject of Japanese ukiyo-e artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, {{by the middle of}} the Edo period the mass-produced ukiyo-e prints made the illustrations accessible for the samurai classes and commoners.|$|E

25|$|Soon after, on April 30, 1936, Carothers {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences, a very high honor. Carothers was the first {{industrial}} organic chemist to receive this honor. Yet by June 1936, in spite of this honor which validated his contributions to science, Carothers could not shake the depression that prevented him from working. In early June he was admitted involuntarily to the Philadelphia Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, a prestigious mental hospital, where his psychiatrist was Dr. Kenneth Appel. One month later he was given permission to leave the institute to go hiking in the Tyrolean Alps with friends. The plan was for him to day hike with Dr. Roger Adams and Dr. John Flack for two weeks. After they left, he stayed on, hiking by himself, without sending word to anyone, even his wife. On September 14, he suddenly appeared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> at the Experimental Station. From that point on Carothers was not expected to perform any real work at the Experimental Station. He would often go in and visit. He began living in Whiskey Acres again, after his wife had agreed with Dr. Appel that she was not strong enough to watch over Carothers.|$|E
500|$|On April 25, 1988, {{at the age}} of 52 (and 14 {{months after}} the death of Andy Warhol), Solanas died of {{pneumonia}} at the Bristol Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. A building superintendent at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas: [...] "Once, he had to enter her room, and he saw her typing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk.</b> There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her. What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery." [...] Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously.|$|E
5000|$|The prologue is {{a letter}} from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, {{addressed}} [...] "To my lawyer, Saxonberg", accompanied by a drawing of <b>her</b> writing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> office <b>desk.</b> It serves as the cover letter for the 158-page narrative, and provides background for changes to her last will and testament.|$|R
60|$|For {{half an hour}} she {{remained}} in the office, but she left promptly <b>at</b> five-thirty, though <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> was choked with work and though Mr. Ross telephoned {{that he would be}} back before six, which was his chivalrous way of demanding that she stay till seven.|$|R

500|$|On {{the evening}} of February 5, Murray spoke {{on the phone with}} her older sister, Kathleen, while Murray was on duty at her campus-security job. They {{discussed}} Kathleen's relationship problems with her fiancé. Around 10:30p.m., while still on her shift, it was reported that Murray broke down in tears. When her supervisor arrived <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> Murray was [...] "just completely zoned out. No reaction at all. She was unresponsive." [...] The supervisor escorted Murray back to her dorm room around 1:20 am. When asked what was wrong, Murray said two words: [...] "My sister." [...] The contents of this call remained unknown until 2017, when Kathleen publicly explained the conversation: Kathleen, a recovering alcoholic, had been discharged from a rehabilitation clinic that evening, and on the way home, her fiancé took her to a liquor store, which caused an emotional breakdown.|$|E
2500|$|Updike {{was born}} in Reading, Pennsylvania, {{the only child of}} Linda Grace (née Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised in the nearby small town of Shillington. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother's {{attempts}} to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. [...] "One of my earliest memories", he later recalled, [...] "is of seeing her <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk...</b> I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper. [...] And I remember the brown envelopes that stories would go off in—and come back in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth, meanwhile, rehearsed for the {{upcoming}} day with her maids of honour, a sheet used {{in place of the}} velvet train and an arrangement of chairs standing in for the carriage. So that she could become accustomed to its feel and weight, the Queen also wore the Imperial State Crown while she went about her daily business, sporting it <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> at tea and while reading the newspaper. Elizabeth took part in two full rehearsals at Westminster Abbey, on 22 and 29 May, though other sources assert that the Queen attended either [...] "several" [...] rehearsals or one. The Duchess of Norfolk usually stood in for the Queen at rehearsals.|$|E
60|$|Far {{and farther}} below her shone {{the lights in}} the little hotel, and the busy and jocund scenes of her girlish life receded swiftly. <b>At</b> this moment <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> and the little sitting-room where the men lounged seemed a haven of peace and plenty, and the car, rocking and {{plunging}} through the night, was like a ship rising and falling on wild seas under unknown stars.|$|R

500|$|Entertainment Weekly named Dwight's line {{comparing}} {{his relationship}} with Michael to Mozart and Butch Cassidy as one of [...] "TV's funniest lines" [...] for the week ending October 10, 2005.

2500|$|Germain's {{parents did}} not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought {{inappropriate}} for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom {{to try to keep}} her from studying, but after they left she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics. As Lynn Osen describes, when her parents found Sophie [...] "asleep <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> in the morning, the ink frozen in the ink horn and her slate covered with calculations," [...] they realized that their daughter was serious and relented. After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Crabapple {{was living}} in a studio near Zuccotti Park. [...] Occupy Wall Street protesters had begun to use the Park as a camp to stage their movement, artists began {{creating}} posters and Crabapple decided to contribute work and engage in the movement. [...] "Before Occupy I felt like using my art for activist causes was exploitive of activist causes," [...] she told the Village Voice. [...] "I think what Occupy let me do was it allowed me to instead of just donating money to politics or just going to marches, it allowed me to engage my art in politics." [...] Artists and journalists who had {{come from all over the}} world to report on the protests were using Crabapple's apartment as an [...] "impromptu salon" [...] for the Occupy movement. In Discordia (2012), British journalist Laurie Penny remembered how [...] "Occupy Wall Street had set up camp two streets away from Crabapple's apartment in Manhattan and we'd just spent a sleepless week documenting arrests. [...] Molly perched <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> churning out protest posters and handing them to activists to copy and wheat-paste all over the financial district...After three days, the word went out that there was an apartment near the protest camp where you could find hot drinks, basic medical attention and a place to charge your gadgets and file copy. The flat became a temporary sanctuary for stray activists and journalists" [...] "I started doing protest posters," [...] Crabapple recalled. [...] "And in doing these, I found my voice." [...] Author Matt Taibbi called Crabapple [...] "Occupy's greatest artist", [...] noting the use of the [...] "vampire squid" [...] theme in her Occupy artwork. [...] Crabapple, a fan of Taibbi's writing, had read his 2009 Rolling Stone article, [...] "The Great American Bubble Machine". [...] In the article, Taibbi referred to Goldman Sachs as [...] "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money." [...] When Crabapple used Taibbi's metaphor as a stencil depicting a vampire squid and released it for anyone to use, it went viral throughout the Occupy movement.|$|E

6000|$|A golden day of {{sunlight}} and azure blue of sky {{ushered in the}} month of June. [...] "Many Waters" [...] was a world of verdant green. Lenore had all she could do to keep from flying to the slopes. But as every day now brought nearer the possibility of word from her father, she stayed at home. The next morning about nine o'clock, while she was <b>at</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>desk,</b> the telephone-bell rang. It did that many times every morning, but this ring seemed to electrify Lenore. She answered the call hurriedly.|$|R
60|$|She had {{gazed at}} the {{addressed}} envelope, smiled (I was looking up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from my <b>desk),</b> and at last took it up with an effort of sanctimonious repugnance. But she remained with it in <b>her</b> hand looking <b>at</b> me {{as though she were}} piously gloating over something she could read in my face.|$|R
5000|$|Sean T. Collins of Rolling Stone ranked Donna 7th on {{his list}} of the 30 Best 'Twin Peaks' Characters stating, [...] "Other images took a tighter hold on {{audience}} imaginations, but nothing conveyed the tragedy of Laura Palmer's death like her best friend Donna looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> empty <b>desk,</b> realizing what it meant, and starting to sob uncontrollably right there in homeroom. Donna was {{the heart of the}} high-school-kids material on the show, the character who was the most square and reserved, and also the most cognizant that what happened to Laura could happen to anyone.

5000|$|As part of {{its regular}} {{on-going}} series of full-page caricatures of celebrities, drawn by Frantz Kantor, and known collectively as [...] "Kantor's Celebrity Skins", a cartoon was published on page 33.

Beneath the artwork, in large print, was the caption [...] "Anne Fulwood".As soon as she {{became aware of the}} matter, Fulwood threatened both Penthouse and Kantor with a defamation action.|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins as}} Swift, dressed {{as an office}} worker, passes through the lobby to the {{elevator}} and greets the people she meets. As the elevator's door closes, Swift begins to sing, looking indolent and slothful, seeing the people surrounding her in the elevator. As the elevator reaches the thirteenth floor, people surrounding her start to exit, nudging her. Swift then walks {{in the office and}} sluggishly sits <b>at</b> <b>her</b> office <b>desk</b> while a man disturbs her. She then walks around the office to use the office's printer (which is first out of paper, out of toner, and then disappears altogether); waits for a man who is noisily drinking water at a water cooler in the staff room; and eats while two women laugh and talk about her behind <b>her</b> back. Later <b>at</b> <b>her</b> office <b>desk,</b> Swift takes a sticky note written by her and her boyfriend (portrayed by Zach Gilford) stating that they loved each other first. Swift turns on the computer, watching and smiling at various videos of her and her boyfriend. She takes a look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> watch and leaves the office in a better mood than when she arrived. Swift waits for a bus outside. On the bus, Swift watches more videos on a Sony Tablet S of moments with her boyfriend. The bus stops at the airport. Swift gets off and looks around. Her boyfriend then emerges from the sliding doors of the airport, revealing to the audience that he was overseas serving in the military. Swift breaks into a smile, drops everything that she is carrying, and runs into her boyfriend's arms. They embrace each other as the video ends.|$|R
60|$|I found Mr Abney {{pacing the}} room, {{a look of}} {{annoyance}} on his face. <b>At</b> the <b>desk,</b> <b>her</b> back to me, Audrey was writing.

She did not look round when I came in, nor when Mr Abney spoke my name, but went on writing as if I did not exist.|$|R
6000|$|Trafford {{found her}} just {{returned}} from a walk in Kensington Gardens and writing a note <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> under the narrow sunlit window that looked upon the High Street. [...] "Finish your letter, little mother," [...] he said, and took possession of the hearthrug.|$|E
6000|$|She {{began to}} make friendships. [...] "Chas.," [...] the office-manager, stopped often <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> to ridicule--and Mr. Fein to praise--the plans she liked to make for garden-suburbs which should be filled with poets, {{thatched}} roofs, excellent plumbing, artistic conversation, fireplaces, incinerators, books, and convenient trains.|$|E
6000|$|Taking a seat <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> {{she began}} a letter, [...] "Captain Curtis, Dear Sir--" [...] But this seemed so palpably a {{continuance}} of her repellent mood that she tore it up, and started {{another in the}} spirit of friendliness and contrition which had seized upon her: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{prison was}} round her now! She {{looked at the}} walls, colour washed, pale green and chocolate, at the large windows with frowsy geraniums against the pale glass, at the long rows of desks, {{arranged}} in a squadron, and dread filled her. This was a new world, a new life, with which she was threatened. But still excited, she climbed into <b>her</b> chair <b>at</b> <b>her</b> teacher's <b>desk.</b> It was high, and her feet could not reach the ground, but must rest on the step. Lifted up there, off the ground, she was in office. How queer, how queer it all was! How different {{it was from the}} mist of rain blowing over Cossethay. As she thought of her own village, a spasm of yearning crossed her, it seemed so far off, so lost to her.|$|R
60|$|Even as {{she spoke}} she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate. Those had been her very words! Intuition told her that he, too, was {{thinking}} of that time. Now he had found <b>her</b> <b>at</b> his <b>desk,</b> and, {{as if that were}} not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid open at his signature. Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.|$|R
6000|$|So {{brilliant}} was the snow-glare {{that when}} she entered the house she saw the door-knobs, the newspaper on the table, every white surface as dazzling mauve, and her head was dizzy in the pyrotechnic dimness.

The world was so luminous that she sat down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> rickety little <b>desk</b> in the living-room to make a poem. (She got no farther than [...] "The sky is bright, the sun is warm, there ne'er will be another storm.") ...|$|R
