5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up {{only a small fraction of}} the British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: <b>acetaminophen.</b> After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought <b>acetaminophen</b> to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E
5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States {{or other}} {{countries}} where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling <b>acetaminophen</b> drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, <b>acetaminophen</b> rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively {{small portion of the}} pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.|$|E
5|$|One {{strategy}} for reducing harm done by <b>acetaminophen</b> overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an emetic or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet {{sold in the}} UK which combined 500mg paracetamol with 100mg methionine, an amino acid formerly used {{in the treatment of}} paracetamol overdose.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as <b>acetaminophen</b> poisoning, is caused by {{excessive}} use of the medication paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen).</b> Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{medication}} such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> {{helps in}} the management of pain associated with strep throat. Viscous lidocaine may also be useful. While steroids may help with the pain, they are not routinely recommended. Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Prevention is by washing {{hands and}} not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment with {{antibiotics}} is only recommended {{in those with}} a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. Pain can be treated with paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen.|$|E
5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants {{and these are}} enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found <b>acetaminophen</b> (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to <b>acetaminophen,</b> recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). <b>Acetaminophen</b> (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or <b>acetaminophen,</b> sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E
25|$|Lifestyle {{modification}} (such as {{weight loss}} and exercise) and analgesics are the mainstays of treatment. <b>Acetaminophen</b> (also known as paracetamol) is recommended first line with NSAIDs being used as add on therapy only if pain relief is not sufficient. This {{is due to the}} relative greater safety of <b>acetaminophen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pain {{relievers}} such as <b>acetaminophen,</b> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or opioids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetaminophen</b> (paracetamol, Tylenol) {{can cause}} liver damage in dogs. The toxic dose is 150mg/kg.|$|E
25|$|Poisoning {{with pain}} {{medications}} is common. Aspirin, paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen,</b> Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve) can all cause severe clinical signs in dogs, including vomiting blood, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Specifically, aspirin can cause metabolic acidosis and bleeding disorders, <b>acetaminophen</b> can cause liver disease, ibuprofen can cause kidney disease, and naproxen can cause ulcers in the stomach, which can perforate. Treatment {{depends on the}} clinical signs.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous N-acetylcysteine {{has been}} found to be {{beneficial}} in both <b>acetaminophen</b> toxicity and non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure.|$|E
25|$|In arm {{fractures}} in children, ibuprofen {{has been found}} to be as effective as a combination of <b>acetaminophen</b> and codeine.|$|E
25|$|The pain {{medication}} <b>acetaminophen</b> {{is the first}} line treatment for osteoarthritis. However, a 2015 review found <b>acetaminophen</b> to only have a small short-term benefit. For mild to moderate symptoms effectiveness is similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), though for more severe symptoms NSAIDs may be more effective. NSAIDs such as naproxen, while more effective in severe cases, are associated with greater side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Diclofenac {{may be the most}} effective NSAID.|$|E
25|$|Using antidepressants, <b>acetaminophen,</b> ibuprofen, or {{alcoholic}} beverages {{is thought to}} potentially suppress dreams, whereas melatonin may {{have the ability to}} encourage them.|$|E
25|$|The {{occasional}} {{reports of}} acetanilide-induced cyanosis prompted {{the search for}} supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives, such as phenacetin. After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was ultimately established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (known in the United States as USAN: <b>acetaminophen)</b> in the human body, {{and that it was}} this metabolite that was responsible for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. Acetanilide is no longer used as a drug in its own right, although the success of its metabolite – paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> – is well known.|$|E
25|$|Dextropropoxyphene is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} allergic to paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> or dextropropoxyphene, and in alcoholics. Dextropropoxyphene {{is not intended}} for use in patients who are prone to suicide, anxiety, panic, or addiction.|$|E
25|$|Glauber's salt, the decahydrate, was {{historically}} {{used as a}} laxative. It {{is effective}} {{for the removal of}} certain drugs such as paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> from the body, for example, after an overdose.|$|E
25|$|For {{use against}} pain, {{dihydrocodeine}} is usually formulated as tablets or capsules containing 15–16mg or 30–32mg {{with or without}} other active ingredients such as aspirin, paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen),</b> ibuprofen, or others.|$|E
25|$|NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) is a toxic {{byproduct}} {{produced during}} the xenobiotic metabolism of the analgesic paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen).</b> It is normally produced only in small amounts, and then almost immediately detoxified in the liver.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{concentrations}} of non-opiate substances relative to the diamorphine content of the drug, abuse and overdose of cheese are more dangerous than pure-form opiate overdoses. Emergency personnel must address the overdose effects of each component of the drug, since the contents and concentrations of each component vary widely among batches they must wait for either {{the completion of the}} toxicology report to begin treatment or wait for the effects of each drugs overdose to manifest. The <b>acetaminophen</b> content of the drug induces severe, irreversible damage to the liver when taken in high doses for long periods of time. Very high doses of <b>acetaminophen</b> are capable of producing acute liver failure and death within hours, patients who survive this acute phase of the toxicity generally require dialysis and eventually a liver transplant. Due to the many methods of preparation a user can not know how much <b>acetaminophen</b> is in any given batch and therefore can not reliably determine a safe dose. A dose of the last batch which produced no toxic effects may produce lethal effects in the next batch.|$|E
25|$|The salts {{pseudoephedrine}} hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate {{are found}} in many over-the-counter preparations, either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in combination with antihistamines, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan, and/or paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> or an NSAID (such as aspirin or ibuprofen).|$|E
25|$|Pain {{medication}} such as NSAIDs and <b>acetaminophen</b> (paracetamol) {{can help}} reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. Aspirin {{may be used in}} adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine has a {{theoretical}} but unproven benefit in paracetamol toxicity. This is because N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a metabolite of paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> {{that is responsible}} for its hepatotoxicity, is formed from it by the cytochrome P450 system (specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4).|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the {{reactive}} cytochrome P450-reactive metabolite formed by paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen),</b> which becomes toxic when GSH is depleted by an overdose of <b>acetaminophen,</b> glutathione is an essential antidote to overdose. Glutathione conjugates to NAPQI and helps to detoxify it. In this capacity, it protects cellular protein thiol groups, which would otherwise become covalently modified; when all GSH has been spent, NAPQI begins to react with the cellular proteins, killing the cells in the process. The preferred treatment for an overdose of this painkiller is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (often as a preparation called Mucomyst), which is processed by cells to L-cysteine and used in the de novo synthesis of GSH.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{treatments}} have some evidence for benefits include an exercise program. Paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> {{has not been}} found effective but is safe. NSAIDs are sometimes effective but {{should not be used}} after 30 weeks of pregnancy. There is tentative evidence for acupuncture.|$|E
25|$|The {{muscle relaxants}} cyclobenzaprine, {{carisoprodol}} with <b>acetaminophen</b> and caffeine and tizanidine are sometimes {{used to treat}} fibromyalgia; however as of 2015 they are not approved for this use in the United States. The use of NSAIDs is not recommended as first line therapy.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} EBV. Prevention is by not sharing {{personal}} items with or kissing those infected. Mono generally gets better on its own. Recommendations include drinking enough fluids, getting sufficient rest, and taking pain medications such as paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> and ibuprofen.|$|E
25|$|A {{symptomatic}} treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with {{drugs such as}} paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen</b> in the United States). Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating {{in the case of}} internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.|$|E
25|$|Before the FDA-directed recall, {{dextropropoxyphene}} HCl {{was available}} in the United States as a prescription formulation with paracetamol (<b>acetaminophen)</b> in ratio from 30mg / 600mg to 100mg / 650mg (or 100mg / 325mg {{in the case of}} Balacet), respectively. These are usually named Darvocet. Darvon is a pure propoxyphene preparation that does not contain paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|The Chicago Tylenol murders were {{a series}} of {{poisoning}} deaths resulting from drug tampering in the Chicago metropolitan area in 1982. The victims had all taken Tylenol-branded <b>acetaminophen</b> capsules that had been laced with potassium cyanide. A total of seven {{people died in the}} original poisonings, with several more deaths in subsequent copycat crimes.|$|E
25|$|Hyponatraemia is {{an almost}} {{universal}} finding due to water retention and a shift in intracellular sodium transport from inhibition of Na/K ATPase. Hypoglycaemia (due to depleted hepatic glycogen store and hyperinsulinaemia), hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia and Metabolic alkalosis are often present, independent of renal function. Lactic acidosis occurs predominantly in paracetomol (also known as <b>acetaminophen)</b> overdose.|$|E
