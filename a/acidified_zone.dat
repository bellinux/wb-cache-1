40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) {{injection}} {{into deep}} geologic formations can potentially reduce atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases. Sequestering less-pure CO{sub 2 } waste streams (containing H{sub 2 }S and/or SO{sub 2 }) {{would be less}} expensive or would require less energy than separating CO{sub 2 } from flue gas or a coal gasification process. The long-term interaction of these injected acid gases with shale-confining layers of a sandstone injection zone has not been well investigated. We therefore have developed a conceptual model of injection of CO{sub 2 } with H{sub 2 }S and/or SO{sub 2 } into a sandstone-shale sequence, using hydrogeologic properties and mineral compositions commonly encountered in Gulf Coast sediments of the United States. We have performed numerical simulations of a 1 -D radial well region considering sandstone alone and a 2 -D model using a sandstone-shale sequence under acid-gas injection conditions. Results indicate that shale plays a limited role in mineral alteration and sequestration of gases within a sandstone horizon for short time periods (10, 000 years in present simulations). The co-injection of SO{sub 2 } results in different pH distribution, mineral alteration patterns, and CO{sub 2 } mineral sequestration than the co-injection of H{sub 2 }S or injection of CO{sub 2 } alone. Simulations generate a zonal distribution of mineral alteration and formation of carbon and sulfur trapping minerals {{that depends on the}} pH distribution. The co-injection of SO{sub 2 } results in a larger and stronger <b>acidified</b> <b>zone</b> close to the well. Precipitation of carbon trapping minerals occurs within the higher pH regions beyond the acidified zones. In contrast, sulfur trapping minerals are stable at low pH ranges (below 5) within the front of the <b>acidified</b> <b>zone.</b> Corrosion and well abandonment due to the co-injection of SO{sub 2 } could be important issues. Significant CO{sub 2 } is sequestered in ankerite and dawsonite, and some in siderite. The CO{sub 2 } mineral-trapping capability can reach 80 kg per cubic meter of medium. Most sulfur is trapped through alunite precipitation, although some is trapped by anhydrite precipitation and minor amount of pyrite. The addition of the acid gases and induced mineral alteration result in changes in porosity. The limited information currently available on the mineralogy of natural high-pressure acid-gas reservoirs is generally consistent with our simulations...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) {{injection}} {{into deep}} geologic formations could decrease the atmospheric accumulation of this gas from anthropogenic sources. Furthermore, by co-injecting H{sub 2 }S or SO{sub 2 }, the products respectively of coal gasification or combustion, with captured CO{sub 2 }, {{problems associated with}} surface disposal would be mitigated. We developed models that simulate the co-injection of H{sub 2 }S or SO{sub 2 } with CO{sub 2 } into an arkose formation {{at a depth of}} about 2 km and 75 C. The hydrogeology and mineralogy of the injected formation are typical of those encountered in Gulf Coast aquifers of the United States. Six numerical simulations of a simplified 1 -D radial region surrounding the injection well were performed. The injection of CO{sub 2 } alone or co-injection with SO{sub 2 } or H{sub 2 }S results in a concentrically zoned distribution of secondary minerals surrounding a leached and acidified region adjacent to the injection well. Co-injection of SO{sub 2 } with CO{sub 2 } results in a larger and more strongly <b>acidified</b> <b>zone,</b> and alteration differs substantially from that caused by the co-injection of H{sub 2 }S or injection of CO{sub 2 } alone. Precipitation of carbonates occurs within a higher pH (pH > 5) peripheral zone. Significant quantities of CO{sub 2 } are sequestered by ankerite, dawsonite, and lesser siderite. The CO{sub 2 } mineral-trapping capacity of the formation can attain 40 - 50 kg/m{sup 3 } medium for the selected arkose. In contrast, secondary sulfates precipitate at lower pH (pH < 5) within the <b>acidified</b> <b>zone.</b> Most of the injected SO{sub 2 } is transformed and immobilized through alunite precipitation with lesser amounts of anhydrite and minor quantities of pyrite. The dissolved CO{sub 2 } increases with time (enhanced solubility trapping). The mineral alteration induced by injection of CO{sub 2 } with either SO{sub 2 } or H{sub 2 }S leads to corresponding changes in porosity. Significant increases in porosity occur in the acidified zones where mineral dissolution dominates. With co-injection of SO{sub 2 }, the porosity increases from an initial 0. 3 to 0. 43 after 100 years. However, within the CO{sub 2 } mineral-trapping zone, the porosity decreases to about 0. 28 for both cases, because of the addition of CO{sub 2 } mass as secondary carbonates to the rock matrix. Precipitation of sulfates at the acidification front causes porosity to decrease to 0. 23. The limited information currently available on the mineralogy of naturally occurring high-pressure CO{sub 2 } reservoirs is generally consistent with our simulations...|$|E

This study investigates and compares, through reactive transport modelling, the potential short-term (5 y) reactivity of CO 2 gas streams ˗ pure or containing ancillary gaseous compounds (SO 2 : 0 ˗ 1. 5 % Wt) ˗ with the reservoir-rock of a limestone aquifer at 75 °C. The modelling approach simulates the co-injection of CO 2 -(SO 2) gases, through injection of CO 2 (under supercritical form) and simultaneous injection of a SO 2 (as a dissolved species solution) rich brine with TOUGHREACT [1]. The numerical simulation results indicate {{the development of an}} acidification front (pH < 5) following the progression of the gas migration in the reservoir. After an injection period of 5 years, the <b>acidified</b> <b>zone</b> extends up to 500 m from the injection well, independently of the impurity percentage of the CO 2 gas stream. In close proximity of the injection well (0 - 10 m), substantial calcite dissolution, together with albite and K-feldspar dissolution, result in a drastic increase of the permeability (1 order of magnitude) and porosity (x 2). When CO 2 is injected alone, anhydrite also precipitates in this reservoir zone. Significant calcite dissolution is also predicted in the zone 50 - 100 m ˗ a highly reactive zone˗ resulting in a local permeability and porosity increase. Because of its high solubility, SO 2 mainly remains in the brine (SO 2 content lower in the CO 2 -rich phase than in the injected gas stream), decreasing its pH/Eh (relatively to pure CO 2). Dissolved SO 2 is lowly reactive with reservoir minerals...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} fine taxonomic and {{functional}} analyses of polychaetes associated with rocky reefs along a gradient of ocean acidification (OA) at the volcanic CO 2 vent system off the Castello Aragonese (Ischia Island, Italy). Percent cover of algae and sessile invertebrates (a determinant of polychaete distribution) was classified into functional groups to disentangle the direct effects of low pH on polychaete abundance from the indirect effects of pH on habitat {{and other species}} associations. A total of 6459 polychaete specimens belonging to 83 taxa were collected. Polychaete species richness and abundance dramatically dropped under the extreme low pH conditions due to the disappearance of both calcifying and non-calcifying species. Differences in distribution patterns indicate that the decreasing pH modified the structure and biological traits of polychaete assemblages independent of changes in habitat. A detailed taxonomic analysis highlighted species-specific responses to OA, with closely related species having opposing responses to decreasing pH. This resulted {{in an increase in}} the abundance of filter feeders and herbivores with decreasing pH, while sessile polychaetes disappeared in the extreme low pH zones, and were replaced by discretely motile forms. Reproductive traits of the polychaete assemblages changed as well, with brooding species dominating the most <b>acidified</b> <b>zones.</b> The few taxa that were abundant in extreme low pH conditions showed high tolerance to OA (e. g. Amphiglena mediterranea, Syllis prolifera, Platynereis cf. dumerilii, Parafabricia mazzellae, Brifacia aragonensis), and are promising models for further studies on the responses of benthic organisms to the effects of reduced pH...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} corrosion of a {{reinforcing steel}} bar {{embedded in concrete}} {{and the effect of}} corrosion coupling on the bar/concrete interface induced by the variation of corrosion potentials with concrete depth. Two separate numerical models were used to simulate the corrosion process which included: a two-dimensional finite element model for mass transport of oxygen and chloride to the bar/concrete interface; and, a one-dimensional model for the corrosion current flow through the electrolyte induced by corrosion potential differences on the bar/concrete interface. A novel approach to corrosion modeling in reinforced concrete that had not been identified in the literature was used. This new approach, incorporated: variable solution conductivity developed from concentrations within the pore solution; anodic and cathodic areas modified to maximize corrosion current through the electrolyte; and, kinetics of corrosion set by the pore solution chemistry. Various reinforcing configurations and moisture conditions were evaluated within the simulation to obtain insight into the effect these variables have on corrosion potentials measured on the concrete surface and the corresponding corrosion currents generated on the bar/concrete interface. Variables related to bar diameter, concrete cover, and bar spacing where all shown to affect corrosion potentials and current densities on the bar/concrete interface and the concrete surface where field measurements are obtained. Moisture conditions were found to have the largest impact on corrosion potentials and current density’s on the bar/concrete interface. When relative humidity’s of 90 % or higher were used, simulated corrosion potentials on the concrete surface under high chloride conditions were found to reach values identified in ASTM C 876 and Alberta Transportations Deck Testing Guidelines that indicate active corrosion. However, when moisture conditions were reduced to below 90 % relative humidity, simulated corrosion potentials on the concrete surface for high chloride concentrations did not achieve values that indicate a high probability of corrosion. This result suggests a secondary mechanism must be present on the bar/concrete interface that changes the chemical composition within the pore solution to shift the kinetics of corrosion to an environment that will produce the negative corrosion potentials recognized as indicating a high probability of corrosion. Therefore, a new mechanism is proposed that outlines the process necessary for the pore solution on the bar/concrete interface to transition the kinetics of corrosion to an actively corroding state at low relative humidity. This mechanism requires local acidification of the pore solution along portions of the bar where anodic processes are increased due to the presence of chloride and reduced oxygen availability. Reaching this environment requires free OH- to be consumed without replenishment from the surrounding environment by either diffusion from high pH areas or dissolution of the hardened portions of the pore structure. The proposed mechanism begins with corrosion by-products formed when Fe 2 + reacts with free OH-, precipitates from the pore solution onto the pore structure as Fe(OH) 2. Once precipitated, the contact area between pore solution and hardened portions of the pore structure are reduced which restricts the dissolution process for restoring OH- removed from the electrolyte. Additionally, precipitation of Fe(OH) 2 reduces the flow of OH- from the surrounding high pH zones as the pore structure is restricted. Both mechanisms result in a pH gradient being formed with <b>acidified</b> <b>zones</b> created on the bar/concrete interface in the anodic regions. These <b>acidified</b> <b>zones</b> cause the kinetics of corrosion to transition from a passivated state, towards an environment similar to carbonation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCarbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) is widely {{accepted}} {{as one of}} main solutions to mitigate global warming in the world. However, the still-high cost of CCS {{is one of the}} major concerns, in particular in developing China. In the other hand, emission control of H 2 S and SO 2 has already become the urgent need, and the reduction target has been set in the 11 th Five-Year Plan of China. Therefore, co-storage of CO 2 +SO 2 or CO 2 +H 2 S may be an effective way to reduce CCS cost, e. g. due to saving the de-sulphur device, and enable CCS to has an earlier deployment opportunity. In this paper, we try to, at first, reveal some key problems, i. e., trapping mechanism, injectivity and leakage risk, for co-injection and co-storage of CO 2 and the strong acid SO 2 into subsurface spaces in a certain gas field in China. The output of this gas field includes about 6. 8 % H 2 S and 4. 6 % CO 2. Then, we want to insight into the possibilities and potentials of co-storage of CO 2 +SO 2 by numerical studies. After widely referring all opened and published scientifical and technical literature, we develop a model to study a porous media system associated with the thermo-hydro-chemical coupling interactions. The hydrogeology and mineralogy of the injected formation are extracted from the historical materials of the gas field. We have performed several numerical simulations with consideration of a sandstone-clay sequence under acid-gas injection conditions. The clay formation is supposed as a sealed cap rock for the co-storage disposal system. The study examines the impact of SO 2 co-injection on the pH of formation brine. Co-injection of CO 2 with SO 2 results in a larger and more strongly <b>acidified</b> <b>zone,</b> and alteration differs substantially from that caused by the injection of CO 2 alone. The mineral alteration induced by injection of CO 2 with SO 2 leads to corresponding changes in porosity.

40|$|The {{construction}} of the Dempster Highway, a 736 km long gravel road located in the northern Yukon Territory, {{is believed to have}} initiated acid rock drainage nearby Eagle Plains. In this study, the spatio-temporal potential of dendrogeochemistry to understand the impacts of acidity on black spruce is testes and geochemical methods are used to examine the origin of acid rock drainage. The dendrogeochemical results suggest that the {{construction of}} the Dempster Highway in the 1970 's did not initiate acid rock drainage near Eagle Plains, since elevated concentrations of trace and heavy metals were recorded in the 1940 's, comparatively to the control site. However, in the <b>acidified</b> <b>zone,</b> there is an increase in trace metals in the 1970 's, suggesting that the {{construction of the}} road amplified the release of acidity by exposing fresh pyrite-rich shale to the surface. The acidified stream, which originates from the excavated area, has a pH value averaging 3. 1 +/- 0. 3 and a solute concentration several orders of magnitude greater than the surface water collected from the adjacent control site. Active layer soluble ions are also characterized by a similar geochemical trend, although their concentration is slightly less. The plot of solute concentrations of the acidified stream and active layer soluble ions versus sulfates give similar slopes, suggesting a recycling of solutes, it is proposed that, after acid rock drainage was initiated, the effect of seasonal freeze-thaw of the active layer played an important rote in maintaining and recycling the acidity in the stream. During the freeze-back of the active layer, Fe sulfate minerals would precipitate, thus producing a large amount of H + that would be stored in the active layer. During the thaw season, this acidity would be released, thus enhancing further dissolution of clays and alumino-silicate minerals. The release of these contaminants by acid rock drainage, not only causes a perturbation of the water quality, but has a negative impact on the sensitive nearby Arctic ecosystem. The vegetation surrounding the acidified stream shows important signs of deterioration, a higher rate of mortality and zones without vegetation. This absence of vegetation has an impact on the depth of seasonal thaw by increasing the depth by twice compared to the adjacent control site...|$|E

A similar sort of reaction {{can be made by}} mixing hydrogen peroxide with ferric iron (Iron III). When the peroxide is catalyzed by soluble iron it forms hydroxyl radicals(·OH) that oxidize contaminants such as chlorinated solvents, fuel oils, and BTEX. Traditional Fenton's reagent usually requires a significant pH reduction of the soils and groundwater in the treatment zone to allow for the introduction and distribution of aqueous iron as iron will oxidize and precipitate at a pH greater than 3.5. Unfortunately, the contaminated groundwater that needs to be treated has a pH level that is at or near neutral. Due to this, there are controversies on whether ISCO using Fenton's reagent is really a Fenton reaction. Instead, scientists call these reactions Fenton-like.However, some ISCO vendors successfully apply pH neutral Fenton's reagent by chelating the iron which keeps the iron in solution and mitigates the need for <b>acidifying</b> the treatment <b>zone.</b> The Fenton chemistry is complex and has many steps, including the following: ...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{profiles}} in 10 persistently bare areas (i. e. scalds), mainly located in coastal backswamps of New South Wales, Australia, were examined for chromium-reducible sulfur content and selected chemical properties. At 5 of the sites, the adjacent paddocks with vegetation cover were also examined. All of the tested sites had {{been affected by}} the extensive drainage of the surrounding acid sulfate soil (ASS) landscapes and the consequent oxidation of pyrite. All sites had low pH values in the surface soil layers and these low pH values extended for up to 150 cm into the underlying unoxidised blue/grey pyritic estuarine gels. This {{can be attributed to the}} downward diffusion of acidity, either produced in the overlying oxidised zones of these soils or transported laterally across the landscape to these low-lying areas. <b>Acidified</b> unoxidised pyritic <b>zones</b> 120 cm thick can evidently form within several decades after drainage disturbance. At the scalded sites the depth from the soil surface to the main pyritic zone varied from the surface to 3 ̆e 200 cm depth, indicating that this variable is not critical to ASS scald formation. For most of the sites examined, the chromium-reducible sulfur contents in the surface soil layers were appreciably higher than those in the immediately underlying soil layers. In most of the vegetated sites the chromium-reducible sulfur content in the surface layers was considerably higher than for the adjacent scalded site. The conditions necessary for pyrite formation (i. e. adequate supplies of organic matter, soluble iron, sulfate, and waterlogging) were found to exist at all sites, and the pyrite accumulations in these surface soil layers are considered to be neo-formed. The vegetated soil-profile pyrite and pH results were very similar to their scalded counterparts except that they had an extra 20 – 40 cm layer of vegetation and mulch that was missing from the scalded profiles. This indicates that there is considerable potential for more extensive scalding in these ASS areas...|$|R
