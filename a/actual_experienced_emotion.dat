40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the impact of emotion regulation on the intensity bias in guilt and shame. Fifty-two undergraduates either forecasted their emotions and emotion regulation following a guilt- and shame-eliciting situation or reported their <b>actual</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>emotions</b> and employed emotion regulation. Results showed a clear intensity bias, that is, forecasters predicted to experience more guilt and shame than experiencers actually experienced. Furthermore, results showed that forecasters predicted to employ less down-regulating emotion regulation (i. e. less acceptance) and more up-regulating emotion regulation (i. e. more rumination) than experiencers actually employed. Moreover, {{results showed that the}} intensity differences between forecasted and experienced guilt and shame could be explained (i. e. were mediated) by the differences between forecasted and actually employed emotion regulation (i. e. acceptance and rumination). These findings provide support for the hypothesis that the intensity bias can—at least in part—be explained by the misprediction of future emotion regulation...|$|R

40|$|Childbirth {{is often}} the most central event in a woman's life—the {{cornerstone}} by which everything before and after is measured. The intensity of the experience varies greatly, but the incredible miracle of bearing a child leaves an indelible impression.

The process of childbirth has changed dramatically in this country, going from a primarily community centered women's event, to one centered in hospitals with highly trained physicians and medical technology. While many of these changes and events have been documented, there seems to be less literature on the woman's <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> - the <b>emotions,</b> thoughts, and decisions surrounding her childbirth. The increasing medicalization of birth has undoubtedly brought about different experiences, but where we used to have midwife journals detailing each birth performed, there is no such avenue for interest currently.

40|$|The Phenomenological {{reflection}} of visual artifact {{methods such as}} the possibility of safe treatment of disturbing emotions of the child. Theoretical Foundations of salutogenetic use of Phenomenological {{reflection of}} visual artifact methods. Jiří Závora Abstract: The Phenomenological reflection of an authentic visual artifact represents a non- directive method enabling, {{in the framework of}} the salutogenetic support of individual protective features (framework: hardiness, resilience and sense of coherency), to cope with disquieting emotions. The functional viability of the method, confirmed at the theoretical modelling level, consists in evocating and maintaining a direct experience of the reflected phenomena and their authentic thematic representation. In the course of an <b>actual</b> <b>experience,</b> the disquieting <b>emotion</b> is made Avare through relating it to the artifact in question. In this way, the emotion is thematized at the level of somatic experience, its character "felt shift" and a long term personality change occurs. The aim of the project is to assess the various aspects of the functional viability of introspection as the underlying approach. It is applied for examining the somatic experience in the course of phenomenological reflection of visual artifact as the chief object of study. Key words: [...] ...|$|R
30|$|For the {{purposes}} of this annotation, we distinguish three types of target emotions: intended, expected and <b>experienced.</b> The intended <b>emotion</b> annotations are meant to capture the emotional response that the movie tries to evoke in the viewer, without taking into account whether it is actually successful. <b>Experienced</b> <b>emotion</b> annotations represent the <b>actual</b> emotional <b>experience</b> of an individual while watching a movie. Finally, expected emotion is the normative emotional response, the expected emotional experience of a random viewer. This distinction is typically overlooked [75]; however, we feel it is necessary simply by virtue of how different these emotional experiences may be; a “bad” movie may have very different intended and expected outcomes, while a viewer’s taste may lead to very different expected and experienced outcomes. While intended and expected outcomes are generally more useful, the <b>experienced</b> <b>emotion</b> annotations could be the basis of user-adapted predictions of emotion [76].|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 75) The present {{confusion and}} conflict in views of acting is {{harmful to the}} growth and creativity of the actor, It results from contradictory theories of acting based on incomplete theories of art. A comprehensive theory of art is that of Susanne K. Langer. Langer defines art as the creation of perceptible forms, or symbols, expressive of human feeling. Acting is an art and shares the fundamental characteristics of all arts. The actor is a maker of expressive forms. The expressiveness of all art works derives from two factors: their perceptible qualities and their structures. Thus the actor's realization of the abstract elements is essential to its expressiveness. However, the representational elements, too, have perceptible qualities and structures given to the "sense" of imagination. Furthermore, they create the primary illusion of acting and of the drama, virtual life. Thus the realization of these elements is likewise essential to the artistic expressiveness of the role. Prominent among these representational elements are {{the feelings of the}} character, which must be rendered through mimicry, <b>actual</b> <b>experience,</b> or something in between. Neither pure mimicry of <b>emotions</b> nor the <b>actual</b> <b>experiencing</b> of personal <b>emotions</b> during performance is satisfactory. Langer states that the actor "conceives and enacts" emotions. The writer develops a concept of "virtual emotions" genuinely experienced by the virtual being onstage, arising out of the total artistic circumstances and entering into the artistic form as a part of its expressiveness. The actor as maker of the complete form naturally includes all of its aspects in his single consciousness. A procedure called symbolic analysis, derived from Langer???s theory of art, can be applied to acting. The actor experiences as a result greater artistic creativity and satisfaction, new facility in making artistic choices and in integrating various techniques, and increased confidence in his result...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedAlthough {{there has}} been much recent {{attention}} paid to positive emotional states, relatively little rigor has been applied to investigating the nature of positive interpersonal emotions such as affection and desire. Emotion researchers and theorists tend to fall into one of two traps: either reducing positive interpersonal emotions to quantitative variables or abstracting these emotions into universal types and categories. None of these strategies treat the <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> of these <b>emotions</b> seriously.; In order to model the experience of positive interpersonal emotions, I conducted nineteen phenomenological interviews with eight participants. The interviews focused on multiple aspects of participants' good feelings about others, and participants were given an active role in selecting which feelings to describe and in differentiating between feelings. Interviews were transcribed and subjected to iterative compare-and-contrast analyses.; Nine distinct aspects of these feeling-experiences were identified: emotional feeling, symbolic meaning, cognition, perceptual awareness, bodily sensation, motivation, behavior, target, and context. Of these, the symbolic meaning (the feeling's implication for the relation between oneself and the other person), was most important in differentiating one type of feeling from another. Participants' feelings varied in seven dimensions: intensity, depth, duration, directionality, situated/generalized, power relationship, and type of connection. 'Situated/generalized' highlighted a continuum in participants' experiences between immediate emotional reactions and long-standing, background feelings. 'Directionality' proposed a three-way distinction between feelings directed towards the other, feelings coming from the other, and feelings shared with the other. Based on these distinctions, 45 different prototypes of positive interpersonal feelings were defined.; This model expands the concept of positive interpersonal emotions in severalways. First, the subjective <b>experience</b> of these <b>emotions</b> provides essential informationabout these emotions that is not reducible to observable data. Second, the typologicalspace for these emotions is reconfigured as a fluid landscape of overlapping regionswhere boundaries are frequently crossed, blurred, and blended. Third, the domain ofpositive interpersonal emotions is extended beyond emotional reactions towards the otherto include emotions received from the other, emotions shared with the other, andemotions fading but persisting in a generalized state...|$|R

40|$|Background: When {{a company}} tries to sell either {{products}} or services, {{it is important}} to consider the decision criteria on the purchasing side. Most often, there will be personal, emotional reasons that guide the purchaser’s preference in chosing suppliers, coexisting with the rational reasoning. Previous studies have shown that the emotional influence when it comes to decision making in purchasing is strongest in small businesses, however there is no information regarding what are the <b>actual</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>experienced</b> and in what context. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to find which basic emotions are most felt in different purchasing processes. Method: This research is based on a quantitative method where the information was gathered by sending out surveys to small businesses in Sweden. The respondents rated 27 emotions on a five point Likert scale for each of the four researched processes: Adaptive planning in purchasing, Accessing external expertise for purchasing, Similarities in attitude with supplier in evaluation and Involvement in purchasing consortia. Conclusion: Two of the four hypotheses were supported, suggesting that the basic emotion of happiness positively relates to similarity in attitude between the small business and the supplier and the emotion of fear positively relates to accessing external expertise.

40|$|Introduction Have {{you ever}} {{felt guilty about}} hurting a loved one, or been proud after {{achieving}} something that you always dreamed of? These emotions, but also embarrassment, shame, and hubris, are called self-conscious emotions. They are {{a special kind of}} emotions that cannot be described solely by examining facial movements (Darwin, 1872 / 1965) and that do not have clear, distinct elicitors (Lewis, 2000). Selfconscious emotions are cognitively complex and {{play a central role in}} the motivation and regulation of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Heatherton, 1994; Leith & Baumeister, 1998; Tangney & Fischer, 1995). Until now, most research concerning the relationship between self-conscious emotions and social behavior has focused on their anticipation affects of what people do (e. g., Gruenewald, Dickerson, & Kemeny, 2007; Keltner & Buswell, 1997; Tracy & Robins, 2004). The anticipation of negative self-conscious emotions such as shame or guilt can motivate avoidance of immoral or asocial behavior (I will not do that, otherwise I will feel ashamed), and the anticipation of positive self-conscious emotions such as pride can stimulate compliance with social and moral norms (If I do that, I will be proud of myself). Also, <b>actual</b> <b>experiences</b> of self-conscious <b>emotions</b> may exert an influence. For example, when people feel ashamed, they do certain things because of that (e. g., hide or try to appease). The aim of the present chapter is to shed some light on how <b>experiences</b> of self-conscious <b>emotions</b> are regulated and as such influence social behavior. We will start with a discussion concerning the definition of self-conscious emotions and how they differ from so-called basic emotions. Then the focus shifts to existing research concerning the influences of self-conscious emotions on moral and social behavior. We will discuss how these often-contrasting findings can be interpreted using an emotion-specific approach. Finally, two self-conscious emotions, namely shame and guilt will be highlighted. We will explain how our approach can clarify the contrasting, empirical findings concerning the influences of shame and guilt on behavior (e. g., Gilbert & Andrews, 1998; Lewis, 1971, 1992; Tangney & Dearing, 2002; Tangney & Fischer, 1995) ...|$|R

40|$|Potential vs. <b>Actual</b> <b>Experience.</b> A {{potential}} confound to {{the evidence}} presented in Figure 3 is that we observe only potential, not <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> in the data. A particular cause for concern is that declines in employment rates among high school dropouts in Figure 1 {{have led to a}} widening of the gap between potential and <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> among this group of workers. Consequently, it is possible that this form of reverse causality could account for some of the attening of the observed relationship between mean log earnings and potential experience in Figure 3, as older workers with high potential experience increasingly accumulate fewer years of <b>actual</b> <b>experience,</b> and thereby earn less. We perform a simple exercise that we believe provides an upper bound on the magnitude of this e¤ect. Imagine, counterfactually, that employment is i. i. d. across workers at any given point in time. In steady state, this will imply that the <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> of a worker is equal to the employment rate multiplied by potential experience. It follows that, in this environment, accounting for the di¤erence between potential and <b>actual</b> <b>experience</b> amounts simply to a rescaling of the horizontal axis in Figure 3 A, by a proportion equal to the employment rate. This exercise provides an upper bound for the magnitude of these e¤ects because employment is not i. i. d. across workers, but is rather persistent. In particular, by focusing on full-time, full-year workers we are considering workers who are more than averagely attached to the labor market.
