5|$|Before 1952, {{the inner}} German border could be crossed <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> point along its length. The {{fortification}} {{of the border}} resulted in the severing of 32railway lines, three autobahns, 31main roads, eight primary roads, about 60 secondary roads and thousands of lanes and cart tracks. The number of crossing points was reduced to three air corridors, three road corridors, two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for freight traffic.|$|E
5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> cost.|$|E
5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is an {{interactive}} drama action-adventure game, requiring the player {{to move and}} guide the character into interactions with objects and other non-player characters in the scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. <b>At</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> time, however, the player (or second player during a two-player game) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
5|$|Following the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, NASA {{conducted}} a safety {{review of the}} Apollo program. In response to this review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule {{to make room for}} the three astronauts who were being rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> point whilst they were at the Moon, should an anomaly occur. Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon. The proposal was considered, but rejected due to lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|In Oracle of Ages, {{the central}} item is the Harp of Ages, which Link uses to {{manipulate}} time and travel between {{the past and}} the present. In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> location on the map.|$|E

60|$|Had it been you or I {{swinging}} {{there at}} the end of that grass rope, the thing which presently happened would not have happened, for we could not have hung on so long as to have made it possible; but Tarzan was quite as much at home swinging by his hands as he was standing upon his feet, or, <b>at</b> least, <b>almost.</b> <b>At</b> <b>any</b> rate he felt no fatigue long after the time that an ordinary mortal would have been numb with the strain of the physical exertion. And this was his undoing.|$|R
5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. <b>At</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E
5|$|Link {{can travel}} from the Dark World to the Light World <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> outside {{location}} {{by using the}} Magic Mirror, and can travel back to the Dark World again from the same location using a temporary portal left behind on the map {{at the point where}} he reappears in the Light World. Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World to travel from the Light World to the Dark World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E

The choice of the DNA sequences is essential for successful self-assembly, and opens new ways of making nanosized monomolecular assemblies with predictable structure and size. The inclusion of designer nucleoside analogues further adds functionality with addressable groups, which have an influence on {{the function of the}} DNA nano-objects.

25|$|The Chapel of Reconciliation is {{somewhat}} unusual in that no masses or other services take place there; instead it is given over {{entirely to the}} Sacrament of Reconciliation. Priests from different countries observe a duty roster, which means that, <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> time of day, pilgrims from Europe (and occasionally further away) can find a priest who will hear their confession in their own language.|$|E
25|$|Most {{symptoms}} of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not {{turn out to}} represent underlying breast cancer. Fewer than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous, and benign breast diseases such as mastitis and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms. Nevertheless, {{the appearance of a}} new symptom should be taken seriously by both patients and their doctors, because of the possibility of an underlying breast cancer <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> age.|$|E

A packet sent to an anycast address is delivered to just one of the member interfaces, typically the nearest host, according to the routing protocol's definition of distance. Anycast addresses cannot be identified easily, they have the same format as unicast addresses, and differ only by their presence in the network <b>at</b> multiple points. <b>Almost</b> <b>any</b> unicast address can be employed as an anycast address.|$|R
40|$|BigARTM is a {{tool for}} topic {{modeling}} based on a novel technique called Additive Regularization of Topic Models. This technique effectively builds multi-objective models by adding the weighted sums of regularizers to the optimization criterion. BigARTM is known to combine well very different objectives, including sparsing, smoothing, topics decorrelation and many others. Such combination of regularizers significantly improves several quality measures <b>at</b> once <b>almost</b> without <b>any</b> loss of the perplexity...|$|R

Snorkeling can be done <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> beach along the Maui coast. Surfing and windsurfing are also popular on Maui.|$|E
25|$|Rush hour {{occurs on}} weekdays between 5 am and 10 am, {{and in the}} {{afternoon}} between 3 pm and 7 pm (although rush-hour traffic can occasionally spill out to 11 am and start again from 2:00 pm until as late as 10 pm, especially on Fridays). Traffic can occur <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> time, particularly before major holidays (including Thanksgiving, Christmas, and three-day weekends) and even on regular weekends when one otherwise would not expect it. Experienced Angelenos know {{that they need to}} factor traffic into their commute.|$|E
25|$|The convenience, low cost, and {{mobility}} {{of this method}} distinguish it from conventional testing and are the primary reasons for its growing popularity. The method is convenient because all required sound system, power generation and distribution and data acquisition and control equipment is brought to the test site. Equipment is usually leased for each test event. There is no large investment in a facility, equipment or personnel required {{on the part of}} the customer. A diesel generator is the preferred power source, therefore providing clean on-site electrical power in a consistent configuration for connection to the MSI power distribution equipment. This removes the demand for large quantities of power from the test facility. In addition, testing can be performed at a much lower cost per test compared to the installation, operation and maintenance of a more standard high intensity reverberant acoustic chamber system. Finally, mobility allows this test method to be performed <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> time and place in the normal test article integration and test flow. The test equipment is completely portable and no special facility or infrastructure is required.|$|E
50|$|According to Réti {{the opening}} was {{introduced}} into master {{play in the}} early part of 1923. Réti used the opening most famously to defeat José Raúl Capablanca, the reigning World Chess Champion, in a game at the 1924 New York tournament. Alexander Alekhine played the Réti in the 1920s, but <b>at</b> that time <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> game that began with Nf3 and c4 by White was considered to be the Réti. Réti popularized these moves against all defenses in the spirit of hypermodernism, and as the opening developed it gained structure and a clearer distinction between it and other openings.|$|R

25|$|Charles {{inherited}} the Portuguese Restoration War {{and soon after}} his accession Spain was plunged into the War of Devolution with France in the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté. As regent, Mariana managed the country's affairs {{through a series of}} favourites ("validos"), whose merits usually amounted to no more than meeting her fancy. Her validos included her confessor, Juan Everardo Nithard, whom she made Grand Inquisitor in 1666, and which gave him access to the Regency Council, from where he became the most important person of the Spanish Court. From then on he was the de facto prime minister or valido of Spain. The sheer size of the kingdom at that time made this kind of government increasingly damaging to the realm's affairs. By 1668, Nithard was desperate to reduce Spain's military commitments <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> price, and to end the Portuguese Restoration War; so he accepted the loss of the Crown of Portugal and formally recognized the sovereignty of the House of Braganza by signing the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty ceded the North African enclave of Ceuta to Spain, but marked the loss of Portugal and the Portuguese colonies. To end the War of Devolution, Nithard signed the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). However, the members of the Councils and in particular Charles's illegitimate half-brother John, a popular military commander, started intriguing to overthrow the queen-regent's favorite. In February 1669, a military revolt in Aragon and Catalonia led by John, who then proceeded to march toward Madrid, brought about Nithard's dismissal.|$|E
500|$|During the rehearsals that day, Harrison and McCartney had {{a heated}} {{disagreement}} over the lead guitar {{part for the}} song. Harrison's idea was to play a guitar phrase {{as a response to}} each line of the vocal, which did not fit with McCartney's conception of the song's arrangement, and he vetoed it. In a 1994 interview, McCartney said, [...] "looking back on it, I think, Okay. Well, it was bossy, but it was ballsy of me, because I could have bowed to the pressure." [...] Ron Richards, a record producer who worked for Martin at both Parlophone and AIR Studios, said McCartney was [...] "oblivious to anyone else's feelings in the studio", and that he was driven to making the best possible record, <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> cost.|$|E
500|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Dunkirk, people believed that the threatened invasion could come <b>at</b> <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> time. Churchill was at times personally pessimistic about Britain's chances for victory, telling Hastings Ismay on 12 June 1940 that [...] "ou and I will be dead in three months' time". German preparations would require {{at least a few}} weeks, but all defensive precautions were made with an extreme sense of urgency. In mid-1940, an invasion attempt could have occurred at any time, but some times were more likely than others: the phase of the moon, the tides and, most of all, the weather were considerations. The weather usually deteriorates significantly after September, but an October landing was not out of the question. On 3 October, General Brooke wrote in his diary: [...] "Still no invasion! I am beginning to think that the Germans may after all not attempt it. And yet! I have the horrid thought that he may still bring off some surprise on us." ...|$|E

He and Currie rented a townhouse in a Chicago suburb and spent months devising a plan that saw hundreds of outlets closed. Those stores that remained were renovated and rebranded {{in the hope of}} preserving the company’s stake in the U.S. market. Weston noted, [...] "it was in the cards that National Tea should be, or would be, disposed of.
