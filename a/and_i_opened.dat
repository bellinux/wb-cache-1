She opened in Bitter Sweet at the Iroquois Amphitheater, Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1954. Her production of The King <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> August 20, 1956, at the Starlight Theatre. While performing there, she collapsed. Officially, {{it was announced}} as heat prostration, {{but in fact it}} was a heart seizure.

500|$|The King <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> on Broadway on March 29, 1951, {{with a wide}} {{expectation}} of a hit by the press and public. [...] Both Hammerstein and Rodgers professed to be worried. [...] The composer complained that most people were not concerned about whether the show was good, but whether {{it was better than}} South Pacific. [...] Even the weather cooperated: heavy rain in New York stopped in time to allow the mostly wealthy or connected opening night audience to arrive dry at the St. James Theatre. [...] Margaret Landon, author of the book on which the musical was based, was not invited to opening night.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Bannon's {{books were}} {{featured}} in the documentary Before Stonewall about how {{gay men and lesbians}} lived prior to the 1969 Stonewall riots, wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: [...] "I picked up this paperback <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> it up... and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body that I had never felt before." [...] She was {{featured in the}} Canadian documentary [...] in 1992, which recounted women's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s. The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969 in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by Cleis Press again between 2001 and 2003—excluding The Marriage—with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.|$|E

The mean time to union was 16. 7 weeks and no fracture required bone grafting. Mobilisation of the patient and the range ofjoint movement were better than with other methods of treating tibial fractures. There was a 1. 6 % incidence of infection; 40. 8 % of patients had knee pain and 26. 4 % needed to have the nail removed. Other complaints were minor. We suggest that closed intramedullary nailing with an interlocking nail system is an excellent method of freating closed <b>and</b> type <b>I</b> <b>open</b> tibial fractures...|$|R
