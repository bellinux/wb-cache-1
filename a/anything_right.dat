500|$|Defectors {{from the}} Church say that from around 2002, Scientology leader David Miscavige began to {{publicly}} slap, kick, punch or shove {{executives at the}} base who had angered him. John Brousseau, the estate manager at Gold Base and a veteran Sea Org member, said that Miscavige repeatedly faulted his subordinates' work, [...] "constantly berating them, nitpicking everything they're doing, pointing out inadequacies, ineffectiveness, lack of results, blaming it all on them and their inability to do <b>anything</b> <b>right,</b> {{and on the other}} hand saying how he's got to do everything himself– he's the only one who can do anything right." [...] High-level meetings became tense affairs punctuated by [...] "profane, belittling rants". According to emails said to have come from Miscavige's [...] "Communicator"– the personal assistant responsible for passing on transcribed messages from the leader– he routinely berated subordinates with terms such as [...] "CSMF" [...] (meaning [...] "Cock-sucking motherfucker") and [...] "YSCOHB" [...] (meaning [...] "You suck cock on Hollywood Boulevard").|$|E

500|$|The band {{spent five}} months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, writing and {{recording}} {{what would become}} Never Say Die!. [...] "It took quite a long time", Iommi said. [...] "We were getting really drugged out, {{doing a lot of}} dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get <b>anything</b> <b>right,</b> we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." [...] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's [...] "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." [...] The album featured the singles [...] "Never Say Die" [...] and [...] "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing [...] "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.|$|E
500|$|Rumours {{has been}} {{acclaimed}} by music critics since its release. Robert Christgau, reviewing in The Village Voice, gave the album an [...] "A" [...] and {{described it as}} [...] "more consistent and more eccentric" [...] than its predecessor. He added that it [...] "jumps {{right out of the}} speakers at you". Rolling Stone magazine's John Swenson believed the interplay among the three vocalists was one of the album's most pleasing elements; he stated, [...] "Despite the interminable delay in finishing the record, Rumours proves that the success of Fleetwood Mac was no fluke." [...] In a review for The New York Times, John Rockwell said the album is [...] "a delightful disk, and one hopes the public thinks so, too", while Dave Marsh of the St. Petersburg Times claimed the songs are [...] "as grandly glossy as <b>anything</b> <b>right</b> now". Robert Hilburn was less receptive and called Rumours a [...] "frustratingly uneven" [...] record in his review for the Los Angeles Times, while Juan Rodriguez of The Gazette suggested that, while the music is [...] "crisper and clearer", Fleetwood Mac's ideas are [...] "slightly more muddled". The album finished fourth in The Village Voices 1977 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregated the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.|$|E
500|$|... "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was created}} by singer-songwriter-producer Angela Hunte, a native of Brooklyn, along with writing partner Jane't [...] "Jnay" [...] Sewell-Ulepic. Hunte {{grew up in the}} same {{building}} where rapper and hip hop artist Jay-Z lived—560 State Street, an address which is mentioned in the song. The track's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick. Hunte was ill during that summer, while Sewell-Ulepic's mother was ill. Hunte recalls, [...] "We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New York—about the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway system—but I would trade that for <b>anything</b> <b>right</b> now.' Before we left the hotel that night, we knew we would write a song about our city." [...] Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown, they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay-Z would like it and record it. When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded. However, in the summer of the same year, EMI Music Publishing's (EMI) Jon [...] "Big Jon" [...] Platt heard the track at a barbecue {{and fell in love with}} it, believing that [...] "it would be perfect for Jay-Z".|$|E

He went on to say [...] "There's other days, I go, 'What if it's crunch time, two minutes left, do you want the ball?' I don't know if I do." [...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want to remember it. It's tough. It's tough. I'll miss these guys. I'll miss this game. I just want every one to know that...I didn't plan on doing this. Way to put me on the spot." [...] Asked if he was indeed going to retire, Favre responded [...] "We'll see. We'll see. I don't want to say <b>anything</b> <b>right</b> now." [...] After the game, a Packers teammate said that Favre was just as emotional in a speech after the Seattle Seahawks game in 2005 at Lambeau Field when he was all but certain he was going to retire.|$|E

2500|$|Brando {{was born}} on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Marlon Brando, Sr. (1895-1965), a {{pesticide}} and chemical feed manufacturer, and Dorothy Julia (née Pennebaker; 1897-1954). Brando had two older sisters, Jocelyn Brando (1919-2005) and Frances (1922-1994). His ancestry included German, Dutch, English, and Irish. His patrilineal immigrant ancestor, Johann Wilhelm Brandau, arrived in New York in the early 1700s from the Palatinate in Germany. Brando was raised a Christian Scientist. His mother, known as Dodie, was unconventional for her time; she smoked, wore trousers and drove cars. An actress herself and even a theatre administrator, she helped Henry Fonda begin his acting career. However, she was an alcoholic and often had to be brought home from Chicago bars by her husband. In his autobiography, Songs My Mother Taught Me, Brando expressed sadness when writing about his mother: [...] "The anguish that her drinking produced was that she preferred getting drunk to caring for us." [...] Dodie and Brando's father eventually joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Brando harbored far more enmity for his father, stating, [...] "I was his namesake, but nothing I did ever pleased or even interested him. He enjoyed telling me I couldn't do <b>anything</b> <b>right.</b> He {{had a habit of}} telling me I would never amount to anything." [...] Brando's parents moved to Evanston, Illinois, when his father's work took him to Chicago, but separated when Brando was 11 years old. His mother took the three children to Santa Ana, California, where they lived with her mother. In 1937, Brando's parents reconciled and moved together to Libertyville, Illinois, a small town north of Chicago. In 1939 and 1941, he worked as an usher at the town's only movie theatre, The Liberty.|$|E
2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and care about her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do <b>anything</b> <b>right</b> in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has us well and truly hooked. It's not so much a 'whodunnit?' as a 'who-done-her?'" ...|$|E
