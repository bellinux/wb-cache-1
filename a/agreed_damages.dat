5000|$|Prior to {{judgment}} Bercow made two offers to settle out of court. Both were rejected by McAlpine, leading to Joshua Rozenberg, {{a lawyer and}} columnist for London's The Guardian newspaper, to opine [...] "that the undisclosed, <b>agreed</b> <b>damages</b> were higher than she had hoped." [...] McAlpine's solicitor Andrew Reid said: [...] "The apologies previously received from Mrs Bercow did not concede that her tweet was defamatory but clearly she must now accept this fact. Her failure to admit that her tweet was defamatory caused considerable unnecessary pain and suffering to Lord McAlpine and his family {{over the last six}} months. The judgment is one of great public interest and provides both a warning to and guidance for people who use social media." [...] Rozenberg noted: [...] "The law of defamation is well known to those who write for a living. One hopes Twitter users are beginning to learn what a powerful and potentially dangerous weapon they have at their fingertips. A tweet is more like a broadcast than an email and is subject to the law of libel in the same way." ...|$|E

40|$|An âagreed damages clauseâ is a {{contractual}} provision {{whereby the}} parties agree on the damages one party must pay if that party breaches a term. A valid <b>agreed</b> <b>damages</b> clause, known as a âliquidated damages clauseâ, is enforceable. An invalid <b>agreed</b> <b>damages</b> clause, known as a âpenalty clauseâ, is not. The âpenalty ruleâ is the legal doctrine that discriminates between {{the two types of}} clauses. This thesis adopts a rights-based, interpretive and formalist methodology to examine the penalty rule as it has evolved, and exists today, in Anglo-Australian commercial law. The investigation proceeds in three parts. First, this thesis restates the law. It derives a principled account of the rule from the leading cases. Second, the thesis justifies the law as restated. It reveals a theory that rationally explains the penalty rule, providing good or legitimate reasons why the rule is as it is. Finally, this thesis refines the restated law in the light of its theoretical justification. It takes interpretive steps to improve the penalty rule, casting the rule in the best possible light. This thesis concludes that a penalty clause is best understood as requiring one party, upon a default, to incur a detriment that is manifestly excessive in light of the clauseâs legitimate function. The refined penalty rule invalidates a penalty clause by rendering it partially unenforceable. Also, this thesis illustrates that the rule encapsulates a principle of preventing consensual civil punishment, and that corrective justice norms justify that principle. As such, the penalty rule ultimately instantiates corrective justice. Further, this thesis demonstrates that a classificatory, correctivist theory scores extremely well on several criteria for evaluating private law theories. Such a rights-based theory is highly transparent, powerfully coherent, and practically beneficial. It also displays a tight fit with the current law. In short, this thesis concludes that, viewed in the best possible light, the penalty rule is certain, elegant and (correctively) just. </p...|$|E

Moore then grabbed a pistol from one of the police officers and shot and killed him along with another officer and dispatcher before fleeing in a police car.

40|$|Abstract. Research on {{the fatigue}} {{resistance}} of mechanical components / structures has been proceeding {{for nearly a}} century and half. Yet, there is no universally <b>agreed</b> upon <b>damage</b> criterion which can predict most aspects of fatigue failure.

40|$|Part I of this Article {{examines}} {{the role of}} liquidated damage provisions and penalties {{in the context of}} a general theory of efficient breach of contract. The proof problems inherent in fully recovering idiosyncratic values within the context of operationally practical damage sanctions may prevent the non-breaching party from recovering his subjective expectations if recovery is limited to legally determined remedies. The expected cost of establishing true losses under conventional damage measures will thus induce parties who face uncertain or nonprovable anticipated losses to negotiate stipulated damage agreements. The current penalty rule subjects these agreements to costly review, based not on the fairness of the process, but on whether the initial estimate sufficiently mirrors the anticipated provable loss. Part II {{examines the}} hypothesis that, absent evidence of process unfairness in bargaining, efficiency will be enhanced by the enforcement of an agreed allocation of risks embodied in a liquidated damage clause. We argue that <b>agreed</b> <b>damage</b> measures and in terrorem provisions represent, under many circumstances, the most efficient means by which parties can insure against the otherwise non-compensable consequences of breach. Our hypothesis is then also tested against a series of conditions in order to identify alternative legal principles that may provide less costly means of avoiding the harmful effects whose perception apparently prompted the current penalty rule...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Many NDT systems {{used for}} damage {{detection}} in composites {{are difficult to}} apply to complex geometric structures, also, they are time-consuming. As {{a solution to the}} problems associated with NDT applications, an intelligent analysis system that supports a portable testing environment, which allowed various types of inputs and provided sufficient data regarding level of damage in a tested structure was designed and tested. The developed technique was a novel approach that allowed locating defects with good accuracy. Approach: This research presented a novel approach to fast NDT using intelligent image analysis through a specifically developed algorithm that checks the integrity of composite structures. Such a novel approach allowed not only to determine the level of damage, but also, to correlate damage detected by one imaging technique using available instruments and methods to results that would be obtained using other instruments and techniques. Results: Using the developed ICA algorithm, accurate classification was achieved using C-Scan and Low Temperature Thermal imaging (LTT). Both techniques <b>agreed</b> on <b>damage</b> classification and structural integrity. Conclusion: This very successful approach to damage detection and classification is further supported by its ability to correlate different NDT technologies and predict others...|$|R
