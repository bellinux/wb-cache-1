40|$|Our goal is {{to develop}} a {{rectifying}} antenna (rectenna) applicable to solar spectrum energy harvesting. In particular, we aim to demonstrate viable techniques for converting portion of the solar spectrum not efficiently converted to electric power by current photovoltaic approaches. Novel design guidelines are suggested for rectifying <b>antenna</b> <b>coupled</b> tunneling diodes. We propose a new geometric field enhancement scheme in <b>antenna</b> <b>coupled</b> tunneling diodes that uses surface plasmon resonances. For this purpose, we have successfully implemented a planar tunneling diode with polysilion/SiO 2 /polysilcon structure. An <b>antenna</b> <b>coupled</b> asymmetric tunneling diode is developed with a pointed triangle electrode for geometric field enhancement. The geometrically asymmetric tunneling diode shows a unique asymmetric tunneling current versus voltage characteristic. Through comparison with crossover tunneling diodes, we verified that the current asymmetry is not from the work function difference between the two electrodes. Results of RF rectification tests using the asymmetric diode demonstrate that our approach is practical for energy harvesting application. Furthermore, we describe how surface plasmons can enhance the electric field across the tunnel junction, lowering the effective “turn-on ” voltage of the diode, further improving rectification efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The current {{technology}} of high speed wireless communication exist the following weaknesses, limited bandwidth, bad transmitted channel, complex mobile {{environment and the}} quality of service under limited service time. The dispersing pilot pattern and the method of channel estimation using in MIMO-OFDM system couldn’t eliminate the same frequency interference caused by the OFDM frequency among different transmit-receive <b>antenna</b> <b>couples.</b> Aiming at these problems, we proposed a method of MIMO-OFDM channel estimation combining orthogonal pilot design. The data format of pilot is designed. It can retain the orthogonality of different sub-carriers of OFDM which are produced by different transmit-receive <b>antenna</b> <b>couples</b> or transmit-receive <b>antenna</b> <b>couple.</b> In wireless mobile environment, it can better estimate the channel parameters without any prior channel information. This method proposed in the paper has finished the design of the completely orthogonal pilot data symbol among the different subcarriers position of different transmittingreceiving antenna pair. And the pilot data symbols are distributed in the entire time-frequency grid of the channel reasonably, therefore this paper uses a FFT unit whose points are equal to the number of the OFDM subcarriers to realize the least-square channel estimation algorithm. In the process of channel estimation, the channel parameters estimation precision has increased because of the noise getting better inhibition, which reduces the least squares estimate noise sensitivity to the requirements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} <b>antenna</b> mutual <b>coupling</b> on signal {{correlation}} and {{bit error rate}} (BER) of a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system has been modelled. A MIMO-OFDM model with correlated channels is presented. The correlation matrices are determined with the <b>antenna</b> mutual <b>coupling</b> taken into account. The effect of <b>antenna</b> mutual <b>coupling</b> is characterised using the receiving and transmitting mutual impedances. A rigorous expression for the BER of the system employing quadrature phase-shift keying digital modulation is derived.

A single, typical, commercially available balun can cover frequencies from 3.5 - 30.0 MHz, or nearly the entire shortwave radio band.

50|$|In more {{sophisticated}} crystal receivers, the tuning coil is replaced with an adjustable air core <b>antenna</b> <b>coupling</b> transformer which improves the selectivity by {{a technique called}} loose coupling. This consists of two magnetically coupled coils of wire, one (the primary) attached to the antenna and ground and the other (the secondary) attached {{to the rest of}} the circuit. The current from the antenna creates an alternating magnetic field in the primary coil, which induced a current in the secondary coil which was then rectified and powered the earphone. Each of the coils functions as a tuned circuit; the primary coil resonated with the capacitance of the antenna (or sometimes another capacitor), and the secondary coil resonated with the tuning capacitor. Both the primary and secondary were tuned to the frequency of the station. The two circuits interacted to form a resonant transformer.|$|E

5000|$|The {{resistive}} load for HOMs {{can be implemented}} by having loop antennas located at apertures {{on the side of}} the beampipe, with coaxial lines routing the RF to outside of the cryostat to standard RF loads. Another approach is to place the HOM loads directly on the beampipe as hollow cylinders with RF lossy material attached to the interior surface, as shown in the adjacent image. This [...] "beamline load" [...] approach can be more technically challenging, since the load must absorb high RF power while preserving a high-vacuum beamline environment in close proximity to a contamination-sensitive SRF cavity. Further, such loads must sometimes operate at cryogenic temperatures to avoid large thermal gradients along the beampipe from the cold SRF cavity. The benefit of the beamline HOM load configuration, however, is a greater absorptive bandwidth and HOM attenuation as compared to <b>antenna</b> <b>coupling.</b> This benefit can be the difference between a stable vs. an unstable particle beam for high current accelerators.|$|E
