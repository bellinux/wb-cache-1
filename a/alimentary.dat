5|$|In {{the first}} volume, the {{specimens}} {{of the cabinet}} were divided into fifteen sections: healthy bones, diseased bones, soft parts about the bones, heart and blood vessels, organs of sense, vocal and respiratory organs, <b>alimentary</b> canal, organs accessory to the <b>alimentary</b> canal, urinary organs, female organs of generation, male organs of generation, utero-gestation, monstrosities, and parasites.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the <b>alimentary</b> canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The <b>alimentary</b> canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the <b>alimentary</b> canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the <b>alimentary</b> canal is the foregut (element 27 in {{numbered}} diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.|$|E
5|$|In the hindgut (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the <b>alimentary</b> canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory groups like the Carabidae, most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes. The <b>alimentary</b> canal basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed gizzard. This {{is followed by the}} midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of cecum, and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{cared for}} more than 4,500 patients (most of them Jews) from 20 countries, suffering from starvation, <b>alimentary</b> dystrophy, gangrene, necrosis, internal haemorrhaging, and typhoid fever. At least 500 patients died. Assistance was provided by volunteers from Oświęcim and Brzeszcze, who donated money and food, cleaned hospital rooms, delivered water, washed patients, cooked meals, buried the dead, and transported the sick in horse-drawn carts between locations. Securing enough food for thousands of former prisoners was a constant challenge. The hospital director personally went from village to village to collect milk.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the <b>alimentary</b> canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
5|$|To the poorest, Nerva granted allotments of land worth up to 60 million sesterces. He {{exempted}} {{parents and}} their children from a 5% inheritance tax, and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5% to their municipality to support the children of needy families; <b>alimentary</b> schemes which were later expanded by Trajan, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius. Furthermore, numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to Roman provinces. Namely, he abolished abuses of the Fiscus Iudaicus, the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay: some of his coins bear the legend FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATA (abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the Jewish tax).|$|E
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the <b>alimentary</b> canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E
25|$|The insect's {{digestive}} {{system is a}} closed system, with one long enclosed coiled tube called the <b>alimentary</b> canal which runs lengthwise through the body. The <b>alimentary</b> canal only allows food to enter the mouth, and then gets processed as it travels toward the anus. The <b>alimentary</b> canal has specific sections for grinding and food storage, enzyme production, and nutrient absorption. Sphincters control the food and fluid movement between three regions. The three regions include the foregut (stomatodeum)(27,) the midgut (mesenteron)(13), and the hindgut (proctodeum)(16).|$|E
25|$|Bovine {{papillomavirus}} (BPV) is a {{group of}} DNA viruses of the family Papillomaviridae that are common in cattle. Infection causes warts (papillomas and fibropapillomas) of the skin and <b>alimentary</b> tract, and more rarely cancers of the <b>alimentary</b> tract and urinary bladder. They are also thought to cause the skin tumour equine sarcoid in horses and donkeys.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common {{locations}} for a foreign body is the <b>alimentary</b> tract.|$|E
25|$|BPV-4 causes {{squamous}} cell carcinomas of the <b>alimentary</b> tract, and BPV-1/2 causes carcinomas and haemangioendotheliomas of the urinary bladder, {{in both cases}} in animals that have fed on bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Such cancers are common in locations where grazing land is infested with bracken, such as the western Scottish Highlands, southern Italy and the Nasampolai Valley in Kenya. Bracken contains several immunosuppressants and mutagens, including quercetin and ptaquiloside. Consumption of large quantities by cattle leads to an acute poisoning syndrome with symptoms of bone marrow depletion, while at lower levels of long-term consumption it acts as a cancer cofactor. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process; tumours also contain activated Ras, as well as mutation or downregulation of the tumour suppressor genes p53 in <b>alimentary</b> tract cancers and fragile histidine tetrads (FHIT) in urinary bladder cancers. Viral particles are not produced in either <b>alimentary</b> tract or urinary bladder tumours.|$|E
25|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats, and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion. The main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the <b>alimentary</b> canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The <b>alimentary</b> canal directs food in one direction: from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the <b>alimentary</b> canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae can infect a {{range of}} animal hosts, and both {{subspecies}} are of importance. However, the bacterium is frequently encountered as a colonizer of healthy animals, especially in the <b>alimentary</b> tract and genital region.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Niehues {{described}} a new CDG syndrome, CDG-Ib, {{which is caused}} by mutations in the enzyme metabolically upstream of PMM2, phosphomannose isomerase (PMI). A functional therapy for CDG-Ib, <b>alimentary</b> mannose was also described.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae {{subspecies}} equisimilis (SDSE) is a commensal {{in human}} <b>alimentary</b> tract and genital tract. Occasionally it is isolated from skin, but usually {{in relation to}} a chronic skin condition or some breach of the epithelial barrier.|$|E
25|$|The draft genome of {{the coffee}} berry borer {{consists}} of ca. 163 million base pairs (Vega et al. 2015. Caffeine demethylase {{has been shown to}} be responsible for caffeine breakdown in the <b>alimentary</b> canal of the insect (Ceja-Navarro et al. 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicity}} or irritating {{ability is}} usually not high, but it is sometimes enough to cause problems for the skin or for the tissues of the respiratory tract or <b>alimentary</b> tract (e.g., the mouth, larynx, esophagus, trachea, or lungs).|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{bioavailability}} of orally consumed glutathione is poor {{because the}} molecule, a tripeptide, is the substrate of proteases (peptidases) of the <b>alimentary</b> canal, {{and due to}} the absence of a specific carrier of glutathione at the level of cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|While the old cuticle {{is being}} digested, the new layer is secreted. All cuticular {{structures}} are shed at ecdysis, including the inner {{parts of the}} exoskeleton, which includes terminal linings of the <b>alimentary</b> tract and of the tracheae if they are present.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} ants farm aphids, {{protecting}} {{them on the}} plants they eat, eating the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their <b>alimentary</b> canals. This is a mutualistic relationship. These dairying ants milk the aphids by stroking them with their antennae.|$|E
25|$|In general, the <b>alimentary</b> {{system of}} Bothriolepis –which {{includes}} the organs involved in ingestion, digestion and removal of waste– {{can be described}} as simple and straight, unlike that of humans. It begins at the anterior end of the organism with a small mouth cavity located over the posterior area of the upper jaw plates. Posteriorly from the mouth, the <b>alimentary</b> system extends into a wider and dorso-ventrally flattened region called the pharynx, from which both the gills and lungs arise. The esophagus, which is also characterized as a dorso-ventrally flattened tube, extends from the mouth into the stomach and leads to a flattened ellipsoidal structure. This structure may be homologous to the anterior end of the intestine found in other fish. It must be noted that the flatness of these structures may have been exaggerated when the fossil specimens experienced tectonic deformation through geologic time. The intestine begins narrowly on the anterior end, expands transversely and then again narrows posteriorly towards the cylindrical rectum, which terminates just within the posterior end of the trunk carapace. While the <b>alimentary</b> system is primitive in nature and lacks an expanded stomach region, it is specialized by an independently acquired complex spiral valve, comparable to that in elasmobranchs and many bony fish and similar to that found in some sharks. A single fold of tissue rolled upon its own axis forms this specialized spiral valve.|$|E
25|$|A crop, or croup, is a {{thin-walled}} expanded {{portion of}} the <b>alimentary</b> tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.|$|E
25|$|A more bizarre {{example of}} {{commensalism}} occurs between the slim, eel-shaped pinhead pearlfish and a particular species of sea cucumber. The pearlfish enters the sea cucumber through its anus, and spends the day safely protected inside the seacucumbers <b>alimentary</b> tract. At night it emerges {{the same way}} and feeds on small crustaceans.|$|E
25|$|Since diatoms form an {{important}} part of the food of molluscs, tunicates, and fishes, the <b>alimentary</b> tracts of these animals often yield forms that are not easily secured in other ways. Marine diatoms can be collected by direct water sampling, though benthic forms can be secured by scraping barnacles, oyster shells, and other shells.|$|E
25|$|All bilaterians have a {{gastrointestinal}} tract, {{also called}} a gut or an <b>alimentary</b> canal. This is a tube that transfers {{food to the}} organs of digestion. In large bilaterians, the gastrointestinal tract generally also has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of feces (solid wastes). Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means (for example, through the mouth).|$|E
25|$|Promastigote {{is formed}} in the <b>alimentary</b> tract of the sandfly. It is an {{extracellular}} and motile form. It is considerably larger and more highly elongated, measuring 15–30µm in length and 5µm in width. It is spindle-shaped, tapering at both ends. A long flagellum (about the body length) is projected externally at the anterior end. The nucleus lies at the centre, {{and in front of}} which are kinetoplast and basal body.|$|E
25|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract (digestive tract, digestional tract, GI tract, GIT, gut, or <b>alimentary</b> canal) is an organ system within humans {{and other animals}} which takes in food, digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces. The mouth, oesophagus, stomach, and intestines {{are part of the}} {{gastrointestinal tract}}. Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the stomach and intestines. A tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs.|$|E
25|$|Experiments with P. h. humanus (body lice) {{emphasize}} the attendant hazards of lice copulation. A single young female confined with {{six or more}} males will die in a few days, having laid very few eggs. Similarly, death of a virgin female was reported after admitting a male to her confinement. The female laid only one egg after mating, and her entire body was tinged with red—a condition attributed to rupture of the <b>alimentary</b> canal during the sexual act. Old females frequently die following, if not during, intercourse.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>alimentary</b> canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax (adjacent to the fore-gut). The salivary glands (30) produce saliva; the salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium behind the hypopharynx; which movements of the mouthparts help mix saliva with food in the buccal cavity. Saliva mixes with food, which travels through salivary tubes into the mouth, beginning the process of breaking it down.|$|E
25|$|In children, {{abdominal}} radiography {{is indicated}} in the acute setting in suspected bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, foreign body in the <b>alimentary</b> tract, suspected abdominal mass and intussusception (latter {{as part of the}} differential diagnosis). Yet, CT scan is the best alternative for diagnosing intra-abdominal injury in children. For acute abdominal pain in adults, an abdominal x-ray has a low sensitivity and accuracy in general. Computed tomography provides an overall better surgical strategy planning, and possibly less unnecessary laparotomies. Abdominal x-ray is therefore not recommended for adults presenting in the emergency department with acute abdominal pain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the central}} circulatory system, the blood moves {{anteriorly}} {{from the tip}} of the abdomen {{to the front of the}} thorax through a sinus enveloping the <b>alimentary</b> canal, and posteriorly through a ventral blood vessel. The ventral vessel and the sinus communicate with each other by segmentally arranged ring vessels, and by a dorsal vessel, a transverse vessel, and a pair of circumesophageal vessels situated at the anterior end of the thorax. The dorsal vessel in some of the larger serpulids, like Serpula, possesses a valve and a muscular sphincter, probably to prevent backflow of blood from the transverse vessel.|$|E
25|$|At four (4) {{weeks of}} gestational development, the neural crest cells (the {{precursors}} of the nose) begin their caudad migration (from the posterior) towards the midface. Two symmetrical nasal placodes (the future olfactory epithelium) develop inferiorly, which the nasal pits then divide into the medial and the lateral nasal processes (the future upper lip and nose). The medial processes then form the septum, the philtrum, and the premaxilla of the nose; the lateral processes form {{the sides of}} the nose; and the mouth forms from the stomodeum (the anterior ectodermal portion of the <b>alimentary</b> tract), which is inferior to the nasal complex.|$|E
25|$|Boring's minor {{research}} strayed too {{far from}} Titchener's definition of psychology. It was at Titchener's suggestion {{that he decided to}} do his thesis on visceral sensibility. He conducted the study by placing a stomach tube in his own stomach {{to learn more about the}} sensations of the <b>alimentary</b> tract. The results indicated that the stomach and esophagus were more sensitive to temperature and pressure than had been realized. The studies indicate his interest, from an early age, in the physical and experimental components of psychology. In 1914, Boring's efforts were rewarded when he received his Ph.D.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a gram positive, beta-haemolytic, coccal {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the family Streptococcaceae. It is capable of infecting both humans and animals, but is most frequently encountered as a commensal of the <b>alimentary</b> tract, genital tract, or less commonly, {{as a part of}} the skin flora. The clinical manifestations in human disease range from superficial skin-infections and tonsillitis, to severe necrotising fasciitis and bacteraemia. The incidence of invasive disease has been reported to be rising. Several different animal species are susceptible to infection by S.dysgalactiae, but bovine mastitis and infectious arthritis in lambs (joint ill) have been most frequently reported.|$|E
