In situ photoemission spectroscopy experiments are used to characterize the interface between ZnTe and the wide band gap p-type semiconductor BaCuSeF. The contact is characterized by a null valence-band offset, a large conduction-band offset, and a chemically graded interface. By applying the transitivity rule for band offset and on the basis of similarities in chemical composition, BaCuSeF contact to chalcogenide photovoltaic absorber materials would be expected to have similar properties. By extension, BaCuChF (Ch=S,Se,Te) materials are suitable as p-layers in p-i-n double-heterojunction solar cells fabricated with CdTe, Cu(InGa) Se₂, and Cu₂ZnSnS₄ absorbers...|$|R

Transparent p – i – n heterojunction diodes are fabricated using heavily doped, p-type CuYO₂ and semi-insulating i-ZnO thin films deposited onto a glass substrate coated with n-type indium tin oxide. Rectification is observed, with a ratio of forward-to-reverse current as high as 60 in the range − 4 – 4 V. The forward-bias current–voltage characteristics are dominated by the flow of space-charge-limited current, which is ascribed to single-carrier injection into the i-ZnO layer. Capacitance measurements show strong frequency dispersion, which is attributed to i-ZnO traps. The diode structure has a total thickness of 0. 75 μm and an optical transmission of ∼ 35...|$|R

The origin of high hole conduction in BaCuQF (Q=S,Se) was investigated by photoemission measurements and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave band-structure calculations. In both compounds, the large dispersion {{near the top of the}} valence band is realized by admixed states of Cu 3 d and S 3 p or Se 4 p orbitals, indicating that high hole mobility is possible. In addition, the valence band maxima of BaCuQF are much closer to the vacuum level than most p-type transparent oxides, which leads to high hole stability in the valence band. The high hole mobility and stability in BaCuQF relative to most oxides afford a significantly larger p-type conductivity...|$|R

BaCuChF (Ch=S,Se,Te) surfaces and BaCuSeF interfaces with zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) were studied by photoelectron spectroscopy. BaCuChF compounds oxidize when exposed to ambient atmosphere. Se capping layers were studied as a means to produce representative surfaces for photoelectron spectroscopic measurements. Decapped BaCuSeF surfaces remain O-free and C-free when the Se layer is evaporated but they become F-deficient. The resulting surfaces have work functions of 4. 85 eV and Fermi levels located 0. 25 eV above the valence band maximum. In situ stepwise deposition of ZnPc on a BaCuSeF film surface produced a chemically inert interface with a hole-injection barrier of 0. 11 eV...|$|R
