40|$|<b>Allura</b> <b>red,</b> {{also known}} as Red dye # 40 and {{chemically}} represented as C 18 H 14 N 2 Na 2 O 8 S 2 is a common food coloring that {{has been found to}} cause medical problems in humans, but that has not been tested in other species. This experiment tests the effects of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> {{in the development of the}} painted lady butterfly, the most widely distributed butterfly in the world. We hypothesize that <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> will impede the development of painted lady butterflies, when mixed with their food. This experiment compares the effects of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> to that of pesticides on the declining bee populations of the world, as painted lady butterflies are also important pollinators. The experiment consisted of 40 caterpillars divided into four groups of ten, three groups of caterpillars received a dose of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> mixed into their food culture (High dose (Hi), Mid dose (Mid), Low dose (Lo)) and one group received culture only (Control (Con)). The time it took the caterpillars to develop in their chrysalises and to emerge was recorded to see if it took longer for the butterflies who were given dye to emerge. The higher the ratio of <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> dye to food culture, the longer it took the caterpillars to emerge. Additionally, there was a higher mortality rate among the butterflies who received more dye, as well as higher rates of deformities. In the Con group, all butterflies emerged within 3 days of each other. In Lo group, 2 caterpillars died before chrysalis, 1 never emerged, and 2 died in emersion. In Mid group, 3 caterpillars died before chrysalis, 1 never emerged, and 1 died in emersion. In the Hi group, 1 caterpillar died and 3 never emerged. There were several deformities (crumpled wings, frayed wings, no legs, etc.) in the groups that received <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> with their food culture...|$|R

All factors affecting the adsorption process were carefully studied {{and the conditions}} were optimized. Adsorption of E 129 onto activated carbon was found to increase by decreasing the mass of activated carbon, pH and ionic strength of the solution and by increasing temperature. The adsorption capacity of the activated carbon for <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> was relatively high. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity for E 129 dye was 72. 85 mg/g. Three adsorption models; Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin model were investigated regarding the adsorption of E 129.

40|$|Stora Enso, a big Swedish-Finnish forest {{industry}} company, {{wants to find}} {{a substitute for the}} dye that is used in their edge wick analyzes. The dye amaranth, that is used today, is a classified substance that is unhealthy and hazardous. It causes irritation to the eyes, skin and respiratory system. Edge wick is a method to determine the amount of penetrated liquid into the unprotected edges of a packaging board (the surfaces are covered with plastic). It is important to analyze liquid penetration to know that the board will sustain the liquids that it might be exposed to, for example sterilizing liquid (hydrogen peroxide), juice or wine. The dye is used as coloring agent for colorless solutions to enable visual evaluation of the penetration. In the present study several colorants were screened and evaluated in edge wick tests with the standard test liquids used at Stora Enso. Machine, pilot and handmade boards were used in the tests. Surface tension of some test liquids was also determined, as {{it is important to know}} if the dyes change the liquid properties since this may influence the penetration. The result of the tests was that a new dye was found, <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> AC. It has a similar chemical structure to amaranth and seems to act in the same way in different type of test conditions. The recommendation is that amaranth be substituted for <b>allura</b> <b>red</b> AC, since the latter is less hazardous and is not a classified substance...|$|R

Amaranth (AM). <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> (AR). Tartrazine(TZ) and Fast green (FG) on mild steel in 0. 5 M HCI was studied at 30 - 60 °C using weight loss, electrochernical and quantum chemical methods. Quantum calculation {{based on the}} density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the reactivities and selectivities of four (4) of the studied dyes. The effects of inhibitor concentration on the inhibition efficiency have been studied. Inhibition efficiency increased with increase in concentration of the all the studied dyes within the concentration range 25 - 50 pm. The results obtained showed that the experimental inhibition efficiency follows the order: Fast green (FU) > <b>Allura</b> <b>red</b> (AR) > Amaranth (AM) >Tartrazine (TZ). The potentiodynamic studies revealed that all the inhibitors are of mix-type. The adsorption of the studied dyes obeyed the Langrnuir adsorption isotherm. Some thermodynamic parameters such as the heat of adsorption, entropy of adsorption and free energy of adsorption have been calculated. Apparent activation energy has been calculated and discussed. Synergism parameter evaluated {{was found to be}} greater than unity for all the concentration of the dyes used suggesting that the increase in the inhibition efficiency of the dyes by the addition of KI is only due to the synergism. Density Functional Theory method was used utilized on the quantum chemical calculation performed both in vacuo and in solution using both the protonated and non-protonated species. The quantum chemical descriptors e. g. EHOMO, ELUMO and Fukui indices have been discussed and compared with the trend in experimental inhibition efficiencies. Master...|$|R

In fact, the study estimated that, on the average, consumers of red soft drinks consume 53. 1 litres per year, ranging from 39. 1 litres to 70. 7 litres of soft drink products under a scenario, or, 21. 3 litres, ranging from 12. 7 litres and 35. 9 litres under other hypotheses; while 9. 5 litres of red juice-based drinks are consumed per year, ranging between 7. 0 litres and 12. 5 litres, under a scenario, or, on the average, 6. 9 litres, ranging from 3. 2 litres and 17. 7 litres, under the other scenario. The amount of colorant in a red beverage ranges from 10. 9 mg/l in a red soft drink up to 55. 9 mg/l in a red-juice based product. The risk evaluation process showed that in all cases, the intake of E 129 was always lower than the Acceptable Daily Intake value.

The separation could be completed in less than 6 min when using 1 mmol/L ammonium formate-formic acid buffer (pH 3. 9) and acetonitrile as the mobile phases, gradient elution. The column temperature was kept at 35 degrees C. When the analytes were detected by ESI [...] MS under selected ion monitoring mode, the detection limits were 0. 01 - 1. 0 mu g/L except sucralose, sunset yellow FCF, acid red 13 which were 10, 2 and 2 mu g/L, respectively. The average recoveries ranged from 93. 8 % to 106 %. The relative standard deviations were less than 3. 1 %. This method is rapid, accurate, highly sensitive and suitable for the quality control of low concentration and mixtures of food additives which were illegally added to wines and other foods...|$|R
40|$|This {{guideline}} {{provides information}} on alternative colouring options for the reformulation of food and beverages, which currently contain {{one or more of}} the Southampton six colours (sunset yellow FCF (E 110), quinoline yellow (E 104), carmoisine (E 122), <b>allura</b> <b>red</b> (E 129), tartrazine (E 102), ponceau 4 R (E 124)). There is a selection of naturally derived colours and colouring foodstuffs available to manufacturers, which produce colours in the same red, orange and yellow range as the Southampton six colours. Unfortunately, colours derived from natural sources are less stable than the synthetic colours they are replacing and therefore an understanding of the properties and the stabilities of these colours is crucial for successful replacement. The guide gives an overview of the different colour options available and the different factors that should be considered when approaching colour reformulation in a food or beverage product. In some applications particularly those with a long shelf life which are heated and/or exposed to light and oxygen, it is more difficult to achieve the right colour, particularly if an exact match for an existing colour is needed. Some examples of colours used to replace some of the Southampton six colours in confectionery, beverages and processed meat and fish products are included within the review. Much help is available from food colour suppliers who are able to assist by not only offering samples of suitable colours but also technical advice as to which colours would be most suitable for a particular food application produced under particular manufacturing and packaging conditions with the required stability for the shelf life. It is recommended that food manufacturers work closely with colour suppliers, in order to get the optimum replacement colour for their product. page 1 1 Content...|$|R
40|$|Background Our {{aim was to}} {{identify}} which clinical features have value in confi rming or excluding the possibility of serious infection in children presenting to ambulatory care settings in developed countries. Methods In this systematic review, we searched electronic databases (Medline, Embase, DARE, CINAHL), reference lists of relevant studies, and contacted experts {{to identify}} articles assessing clinical features of serious infection in children. 1939 potentially relevant studies were identifi ed. Studies were {{selected on the basis}} of six criteria: design (studies of diagnostic accuracy or prediction rules), participants (otherwise healthy children aged 1 month to 18 years), setting (ambulatory care), outcome (serious infection), features assessed (assessable in ambulatory care setting), and suffi cient data reported. Quality assessment was based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria. We calculated likelihood ratios for the presence (positive likelihood ratio) or absence (negative likelihood ratio) of each clinical feature and pre-test and post-test probabilities of the outcome. Clinical features with a positive likelihood ratio of more than 5 · 0 were deemed <b>red</b> fl <b>ags</b> (ie, warning signs for serious infection); features with a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0 · 2 were deemed rule-out signs. Findings 30 studies were included in the analysis. Cyanosis (positive likelihood ratio range 2 · 66 – 52 · 20), rapid breathing (1 · 26 – 9 · 78), poor peripheral perfusion (2 · 39 – 38 · 80), and petechial rash (6 · 18 – 83 · 70) were identifi ed as <b>red</b> fl <b>ags</b> in several studies. Parental concern (positive likelihood ratio 14 · 40, 95 % CI 9 · 30 – 22 · 10) and clinician instinct (positive likelihood ratio 23 · 50, 95 % CI 16 · 80 – 32 · 70) were identifi ed as strong <b>red</b> fl <b>ags</b> in one primary care study. Temperature of 40 °C or more has value as a <b>red</b> fl <b>ag</b> in settings with a low prevalence of serious infection. No single clinical feature has rule-out value but some combinations can be used to exclude the possibility of serious infection—for example, pneumonia is very unlikely (negative likelihood ratio 0 · 07, 95 % CI 0 · 01 – 0 · 46) if the child is not short of breath and there is no parental concern. The Yale Observation Scale had little value in confi rming (positive likelihood ratio range 1 · 10 – 6 · 70) or excluding (negative likelihood ratio range 0 · 16 – 0 · 97) the possibility of serious infection. Interpretation The <b>red</b> fl <b>ags</b> for serious infection that we identifi ed should be used routinely, but serious illness will still be missed without eff ective use of precautionary measures. We now need to identify the level of risk at which clinical action should be taken. status: publishe...|$|R

Manage a wide range of juice drinks labeled in large numbers usually require a Material Supplementary Food (BTM). Use of synthetic dyes are always in fear that every moment of this material could otherwise unfit for use as a food additive. If the use of dyes can cause excessive disruption of health. Dyes contained in foods can be a promoter for a tumor or cancer causing substances can be classified as karsiogenik.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} food dyes studied were {{rose bengal}} (RB), phroxine (PL), amaranth, erythrosine B (ET), <b>allura</b> <b>red,</b> new coccine, acid red (AR), tartrazine, sunset yellow FCF, brilliant blue FCF, and indigo carmine. First, data confirmed that these dyes were not substrates for CYP 2 A 6, UGT 1 A 6, and UGT 2 B 7. ET inhibited UGT 1 A 6 (glucuronidation of p-nitrophenol) and UGT 2 B 7 (glucuronidation of androsterone). We showed the inhibitory effect of xanthene dye on human UGT 1 A 6 activity. Basic ET, PL, and RB in those food dyes strongly inhibited UGT 1 A 6 activity, with IC 50 values = 0. 05, 0. 04, and 0. 015 &#x 2009;mM, respectively. Meanwhile, AR of an acidic xanthene food dye showed no inhibition. Next, we studied the inhibition of CYP 3 A 4 {{of a major}} phase I drug-metabolizing enzyme and P-glycoprotein of a major transporter by synthetic food dyes. Human CYP 3 A 4 and P-glycoprotein were also inhibited by basic xanthene food dyes. The IC 50 values of these dyes to inhibit CYP 3 A 4 and P-glycoprotein {{were the same as}} the inhibition level of UGT 1 A 6 by three halogenated xanthene food dyes (ET, PL, and RB) described above, except AR, like the results with UGT 1 A 6 and UGT 2 B 7. We also confirmed the noninhibition of CYP 3 A 4 and P-gp by other synthetic food dyes. Part of this inhibition depended upon the reaction of O 12 originating on xanthene dyes by light irradiation, because inhibition was prevented by O 1 &#x 2009; 2 quenchers. We studied the influence of superoxide dismutase and catalase on this inhibition by dyes and we found prevention of inhibition by superoxide dismutase but not catalase. This result suggests that superoxide anions, originating on dyes by light irradiation, must attack drug-metabolizing enzymes. It is possible that red cosmetics containing phloxine, erythrosine, or rose bengal react with proteins on skin under lighting and may lead to rough skin...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakthroughs}} in material science have enabled industrialized fabrication {{and production of}} nanomaterials. To date, nanoscale materials {{have been shown to}} exhibit improved functionalities, providing numerous novel applications. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanomaterials have been widely utilized in the food industry due to their unique properties under light. Upon light irradiation, TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) generate highly active reactive oxygen species (ROS) therefore can be potentially used as light tunable antibacterial packaging materials. Moreover, it has also been reported that a considerable amounts of TiO 2 NPs is found as an ingredient in food, cosmetics, personal care, and pharmaceutical products. With improved photoactivity, nano TiO 2 generates higher amounts of ROS upon light irradiation that can result in oxidative damage. The present study investigates the combined effect of sunlight irradiation and TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) on sensitive antioxidants and food colors. Upon simulated sunlight irradiation, TiO 2 NPs weakened the radical scavenging ability of antioxidants by photocatalytic decomposition or surface adsorption. The decomposition of a widely used food azo dye FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) by sunlight activated TiO 2 NPs was also investigated. The mechanism is pH dependent, involving the depletion of two main ROS species, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. Compared with the photocatalyst TiO 2 sample P 25, food-grade TiO 2 NPs also showed strong ROS promoting ability and resulted in the degradation of selected synthetic dyes, including tartrazine, <b>allura</b> <b>red</b> and sunset yellow, as well as the semi-synthetic food color chlorophyllin sodium copper salt. Thus, TiO 2 NPs should be used with caution when added to or used in contact with food ingredients that depend solely on the existing antioxidants and colors in the system. The ability of TiO 2 to generate ROS was found to be phase-dependent. The rutile phase TiO 2 generated the least amount of ROS when compared to anatase phase and did not lead to noticeable color degradation in the studied light irradiation period. Thus, when possible, rutile phase TiO 2 should be used in food as it provides a more stable system compared to anatase and mixed phases. The results in this study provide clear insights on setting up proper protocols for evaluating and administrating nanosized TiO 2 in food uses...|$|R

In line with the European Union priorities in this matter, this project has been designed to identify and tackle the indicators that raise a <b>red</b> <b>ag</b> about which individuals or communities are being radicalised and recruited to commit violent acts of terrorism. Therefore, the main goals of this project will be twofold: On the one hand, it is needed to identify the main features and characteristics {{that can be used to}} evaluate a risk situation, to do that a risk assessment methodology studying how to detect signs of radicalisation (e. g., use of language, behavioural patterns in social networks [...] .) will be designed. On the other hand, these features will be tested and analysed using advanced data mining methods, knowledge representation (semantic and ontology engineering) and multilingual technologies. The innovative aspect of this project is to not offer just a methodology on risk assessment, but also a tool that is build based on this methodology, so that the prosecutors, judges, law enforcement and other actors can obtain a short term tangible results.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} favoritism {{at the design stage}} of complex procurement auctions. A local community of citizens wants to procure a complex good or project and lacks the ability to translate its preferences into operational technical specifications. This task is delegated to a public officer who may collude with one of the firms at the design stage of the procurement auction in exchange of a bribe. Assuming that it is prohibitively costly to provide a justification for many aspects, we investigate two simple accountability mechanisms that ask the public officer to justify one aspect of the project, with the threat of being punished if he fails: a random challenge mechanism and an alert-based mechanism that requires justifying one aspect on which the rivals of the winning contractor send a <b>red</b> <b>ag.</b> Relying on losing contractors enables the community to deter favoritism significantly more easily than the random challenge procedure as it allows to use information that is shared by potential contractors in the industry. The level of penalty needed to fully deter corruption is lower, independent of the complexity of the project and depends on the degree of differentiation within the industry. Below this threshold, favoritism occurs in some states of nature and we characterize and compare the different equilibrium patterns of corruption under both mechanisms. A more elaborate example suggests that the alert-based mechanism tends to lead to more standard specifications of projects...|$|R
40|$|Small silver {{nanoclusters}} are synthesized using polycytosines as matrices. Different size silver nanoclusters {{ranging from}} Ag 1 to Ag 7 exhibit bright emission maxima at blue (480 nm), green (525 nm), red (650 nm), and IR (720 nm) wavelengths with varying the excitation wavelengths. With electrophoresis, correlation of emission with mass spectra, the Ag cluster sizes are identified with blue emitters as Ag 5, green emitters as <b>Ag</b> 4, <b>red</b> emitters as <b>Ag</b> 3, and IR emitters as Ag 2. Ag 4 and Ag 5 {{appear to be}} partially oxidized while Ag 2 and Ag 3 are likely fully reduced. Silver cluster stability and their dynamics are observed from silver clusters encapsulated by polycytosine (Cm:Agn). From length study of polycytosine, the longer the polycytosine is, the more stable the larger clusters such as Ag 5 are. In time-dependent optical measurements, isosbestic points are observed from Cm:Agn by converting red and IR species into blue and green species, while {{in the case of}} temperature-dependent optical properties, with increasing temperature, the blue (oxidized Ag 5) and green (oxidized Ag 4) emitters convert into the <b>red</b> (<b>Ag</b> 3) and IR (Ag 2) emitters. NaCl-dependent optical measurements support the assignments of oxidized and fully reduced silver emitters. Circular dichroism (CD) is used to investigate conformational changes in Cm and Cm:Agn with varying conditions (time, temperature and NaCl) and the studies indicate that no conformational changes in Cm:Agn are observed from the time and temperature, while the conformational changes in Cm:Agn are observed from the NaCl studies. From pH-dependent emission study of Cm:Agn, the silver nanocluster dynamics slow down at high pH. Using confocal microscopy technique, single molecules on IR species, C 12 :Ag 2 are investigated and demonstrate that C 12 :Ag 2 is brighter and more photostable than Cy 5 which is known {{to be one of the}} best IR dyes. With low excitation power, molecules can be monitored for hours, giving bright blinking free, stable fluorescence. The photophysics of this new dye make it a promising candidate for single molecule studies in biological applications. Ph. D.
