50|$|With a {{background}} in composition, Georg Klein has developed a multi-faceted artistic practice, in which he works with sound, video, text, and photography. In his installations and interventions - in particular those in public spaces - he intensifies the visual, acoustic, situational and political aspects into an area of tension, in which visitors become involved, either on an interactive or participatory basis.The point of departure of his work is the investigation of sites and situations. He focuses on their inherent contradictions, which he transforms aesthetically so as to become a topic of discussion and deliberation. The theme of borders and their transgression, in psychological inner space and in political public space, {{plays an important role}} in his work, both in terms of content as well as form.With his site-specific installations, as well as his concert works and radio play-like sound walks, he challenges, in an irritating manner, his public’s perception of the border between art and reality. He plays with trans-border, <b>audio-visual</b> <b>communication</b> spaces using techniques such as the artistic fake, which lead the recipient into an uncertain terrain, to question identities, and, in a provocative fashion, forces the visitor to engage in critical reflection.In recent years, the artistic debate on societal power relations in politics and the economy has been the focus of his artistic as well as curatorial work. His interventions in both physical space and the public media have at times provoked strong reactions from the public and press, as his work has often made use of a subversive-affirmative strategy and has thereby abandoned the safe and secure framework of art.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of the perceived quality of audio-visual services at the end-user is becoming a crucial issue in digital applications due to the growing demand for compression and transmission of <b>audio-visual</b> services over <b>communication</b> networks. Content providers strive to offer the best quality of experience for customers linked to their different quality of service (QoS) solutions. Therefore, developing accurate, perceptual-based quality metrics is a key requirement in multimedia services. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art signal-driven perceptual audio and video quality assessment methods independently, and investigate relevant issues in developing joint audio-visual quality metrics. Experiments with respect to subjective quality results have been conducted for analyzing and comparing {{the performance of the}} quality metrics. We consider emerging trends in audio-visual quality assessment, and propose feasible solutions for future work in perceptual-based audio-visual quality metrics. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract — Dominance- a {{behavioral}} expression of power- {{is a fundamental}} mechanism of social interaction, expressed and perceived in conversations through spoken words and audio-visual nonverbal cues. The automatic modeling of dominance patterns from sensor data represents a relevant problem in social computing. In this paper, we present a systematic study on dominance modeling in group meetings from fully automatic nonverbal activity cues, in a multi-camera, multi-microphone setting. We investigate efficient audio and visual activity cues for the characterization of dominant behavior, analyzing single and joint modalities. Unsupervised and supervised approaches for dominance modeling are also investigated. Activity cues and models are objectively evaluated {{on a set of}} dominance-related classification tasks, derived from an analysis of the variability of human judgment of perceived dominance in group discussions. Our investigation highlights the power of relatively simple yet efficient approaches and the challenges of audio-visual integration. This constitutes the most detailed study on automatic dominance modeling in meetings to date.

40|$|Distance {{education}} is expanding in all continents, {{and the use}} of video has dominated internet. Synchronous Video Communication (SVC) has not been an option thoroughly investigated and practitioners, who use and design synchronous learning scenarios, are in urgent need of guidance. Distant learners face many barriers, and as a result, they drop out more frequently than on-campus students. Educators seem to be equally affected by the “transactional distance” and the new digital literacies needed for facilitating online learning. This study explores the educators’ perspective on how SVC could offer alternative educational forms and possibilities for distance learning. Findings had indicated that the use of visual communication and human to human contact (prosopogonosia: seeing faces) could have a strong impact on learning and teaching, therefore, a theory called Tele-proximity was formulated. Tele-proximity is defined as online embodiment that explains how instructors and students are connected in synchronous networked environment via tele-operations. SVC creates a sense of place or a stage where online identities perform and highlights recent research on <b>audio-visual</b> signals in <b>communication</b> and team work (Pentland, 2012, 2008). The theory can be seen {{as an extension of the}} Community of Inquiry Model (Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 2000) and a theoretical framework according to which learning objectives could be designed. Transactional distance could be minimized and may be implemented to facilitate more synchronous, visual, and humane options in distance education...|$|R
