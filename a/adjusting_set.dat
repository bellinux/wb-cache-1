40|$|Exceptional {{cost savings}} and quality {{improvements}} are being obtained from existing plastics forming machines by implementing a new management technique for <b>adjusting</b> <b>set</b> points and control inputs, i. e., through more effective supervisory control. Personal experience and tests such as Design of Experiments (DOE) are traditionally used to adjust these machines. Computer simulation software can also give some insights. The {{new technology is}} called "Sequential Process Optimization " (SPO), and {{it is much more}} thorough in satisfying customer, business, and technical needs. SPO is faster, less expensive, simpler and more adaptable than DOE or simulation; and more quantitative, disciplined and permanent than personal experience. Practical methods to apply SPO to plastic forming production include streamlined approaches for people to focus on the critical items for each part/machine. This results in management, operators and the technology having a common understanding of the needs and of the potentials being harnessed. SPO is used to both control and improve measurable aspects of performance such as all quality attributes, cycle times, scrap/rework rate, costs, and safety. The software sequentially uses actual operating data, develops and updates models based on this data, and recommends better settings on a run-by-run basis to achiev...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Smart grid {{support for}} demand {{response}} provides strategies for an electricity service provider to shed loads during peak usage periods with minimal consumer inconvenience. Direct load {{control is a}} strategy for doing this in which consumers enroll appliances such as electric water heaters, air conditioners, and battery vehicles in a program to respond to load shed instructions {{in exchange for a}} discount on electricity prices or other incentive. The effectiveness of direct control depends on the ability of the provider to verify that appliances respond to load shed instructions. A technique called non-intrusive load monitoring, in which electric power meter readings are used to identify loads generated by specific appliances, provides a practical strategy for load shed verification in residences. Non-intrusive load shed verification promises to greatly simplify trust assumptions required for the deployment of direct control. F D EMAND response is a corner stone ofsmart grid technology in which con-sumers are able to participate directly in en-ergy markets by limiting their usage during periods of emergency or peak demand. Direct control is an approach to demand response wherein an Electricity Service Provider (ESP) offers consumers discounts or other incentives if they agree to allow the ESP to send Load Shed Instructions (LSIs) to specified appliances. For instance, some ESPs offer such a program for <b>adjusting</b> <b>set</b> points on thermostats that control air conditioners. Other types of appli-ances have been involved in such programs, and even more are being considered as part of the smart grid. Direct control can save money for consumers and provide ESPs with valuable tools for controlling energy generation costs and grid stability. However, these benefits de-pend on knowing that LSIs will result in the ex-pected response by appliances. It is important that an appliance in such a program allow Load Shed Verification (LSV) to improve reliability and eliminate “free loaders ” who accept in-centives without implementing direct controls. This generates many challenges with trust since the appliance is owned and operated by the consumer while the integrity of its respons...|$|E
