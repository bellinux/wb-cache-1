5|$|Among the {{innovations}} in business {{caused by the}} use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.|$|E

With Räikkönen facing a five-second time penalty for crossing the pit exit line, Pérez behind him {{would not have to}} pass him to achieve third place <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> stayed within five seconds of him.

He broke that promise the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to attack a British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E

Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E

Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty.

But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M.

No longer was the Tribune {{to be a strong}} abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E

Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E
