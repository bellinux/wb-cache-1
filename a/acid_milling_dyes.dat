40|$|The {{influence}} of applied surfactants on dyeing of wool with <b>acid</b> <b>milling</b> <b>dye</b> at low temperature considering its chemical and morphological heterogeneity is examined. The presence of nonionic surfactant molecules reduces surface barrier to dye diffusion into the fiber.

30|$|There {{are many}} {{processes}} to dye wool fabric with acid dye. Many low-temperature wool dyeing processes {{have been proposed}} {{by the use of}} pretreatment and chemicals [4, 5] and enzyme or plasma pretreatments [6, 7, 8]. McNeil and McCall [9] introduced that ultrasound gave potential to reduce the chemical and extra energy requirements in wool dyeing with reactive and <b>acid</b> <b>milling</b> <b>dye.</b> Yukseloglu and Bolat [10] confirmed these improvements using ultrasound in dyeing of wool fabrics at 80 – 90  °C with a pre-metallized dye. Studies on wool dyeing explained that with the assistance of ultrasonic, a better fiber dye uptake% can be achieved with a variety of dyes in a shorter dyeing time period and at a lower temperature [11, 12, 13]. Such work was done by Shanker and Vanker on wool with natural dye and resulted good dry rub as well as wash fastness [14, 15]. Ultrasound significantly enhanced the application of dyes which have no optimum application procedures developed for wool or that have poor dye uptake% to wool [16], cotton [17, 18, 19] or other fibers [20]. Micro-cracking of the wool fiber cuticle was proposed as a method of increased dye uptake for samples that had undergone ultrasonic pretreatment in an alkaline scouring solution [21]. The collapse of bubble formed by ultrasonic irradiation within a liquid is dependent on its proximity to a surface. If collapse occurs in a bulk liquid away from a surface it results in an implosive collapse that can generate huge amounts of energy at the collapse location in the form of heat (5000  °C) and pressure (1000  atm), however, the ambient conditions of the liquid remain relatively unchanged. A collapse in close proximity to a solid surface is believed to be quite different in its morphology. It is widely held that the mechanism of bubble collapse close to a solid boundary layer involves an asymmetric collapse via a liquid jet (up to 400  km/h) through the bubble interior [22, 23, 24]. It is felt that the collapse of bubbles near to a surface reduces the thickness of the viscous boundary layer (normally 30  µm thick) as its thickness is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency [25]. A surface subjected to ultrasonic irradiation at 30  kHz has a 4.4  µm viscous boundary layer whereas one subjected to 900  kHz has one of ≈  0.8  µm. As diffusion rate of solution chemistry through the boundary layer is rate controlled a reduction in the thickness of this layer will result in an increase in molecules reaching the surface over time.|$|R

In this diploma thesis we investigated the effect of the heavy metal ions on NADPH-dependent phenol hydroxylase and catechol- 1, 2 -dioxygenase of C. tropicalis. Phenol hydroxylase was inhibited by Cu 2 + and Pb 2 + ions. Catechol dioxygenase was inhibited by all substances containing heavy metal ions (Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Cd 2 +, Cu 2 + and Pb 2 +), which were tested in this work. The most effective inhibition was produced by Pb 2 + followed by Mn 2 +, Cd 2 + Fe 2 + and Cu 2 + ions.
