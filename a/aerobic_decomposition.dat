5000|$|Petrified wood (from the Greek root petro meaning [...] "rock" [...] or [...] "stone"; {{literally}} [...] "wood {{turned into}} stone") {{is the name}} given to a special type of fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation. It {{is the result of}} a tree or tree-like plants having completely transitioned to stone by the process of permineralization. All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals (mostly a silicate, such as quartz), while retaining the original structure of the stem tissue. Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material. The petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried under sediment or volcanic ash and is initially preserved due to a lack of oxygen which inhibits <b>aerobic</b> <b>decomposition.</b> Mineral-laden water flowing through the covering material deposits minerals in the plant's cells; as the plant's lignin and cellulose decay, a stone mold forms in its place. The organic matter needs to become petrified before it decomposes completely. A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest.|$|E

Thus, in relation to the research conducted in Canada by Boisvert et al. 2012 the primary treatment plant in Barbados was found to be more effective in eliminating caffeine. Aeration of the raw sewage at the primary treatment plant in Barbados may have allowed for some <b>aerobic</b> microbial <b>decomposition</b> of caffeine or due to some adsorption of caffeine to sludge particles.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{emissions by}} power-dams in the tropics. Greenhouse gas emissions from tropical power-dams are produced underwater through biomass decomposition by bacteria. The gases produced in these dams are mainly nitrogen, {{carbon dioxide and}} methane. A methodology was established for measuring greenhouse gases emitted by various power-dams in Brazil. Experimental measurements of gas emissions by dams were made to determine accurately their emissions of methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) gases through bubbles formed on the lake bottom by decomposing organic matter, as well as rising up the lake gradient by molecular diffusion. The main source of gas in power-dams reservoirs is the bacterial <b>decomposition</b> (<b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic) of autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter that basically produces CO 2 and CH 4.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of intensive lowland rice (Orzyza sativa, L.) cropping in tropical Asia has been evaluated in on-station field experiments of double- or triple-cropped rice that have run {{for up to}} 30 + years. In those experiments managed at initially high yield levels, availability of soil nitrogen (N) and grain yields declined across several years, despite maintained quantities of total soil N and availability of fertilizer N. To explain the decrease in soil N availability, we investigated the quality, or chemical nature, of soil N under intensive rice cropping. Chemical characterization of soil organic matter (SOM) fractions extracted from the long-running field experiments associated intensive rice cropping with accumulation of incompletely decomposed materials derived from crop residues, including phenolic compounds. Under controlled conditions phenols chemically stabilize N, suggesting a mechanism for decreased availability of soil N. In order to further test this hypothesis under field mitigation options, in a new field experiment SOM quality and N cycling were compared for anaerobic decomposition of crop residues the conventional practice in lowland rice cropping versus <b>aerobic</b> <b>decomposition.</b> During four years, anaerobic decomposition led to gradual enrichment of young SOM with phenolic compounds and decreased N mineralization from young SOM during the growing season, as compared to <b>aerobic</b> <b>decomposition.</b> In-season N mineralization from one SOM fraction was inhibited by anaerobic decomposition relative to <b>aerobic</b> <b>decomposition</b> by up to 22 kg N ha.

For experiments that were begun during reactor shutdown, <b>aerobic</b> <b>decomposition</b> occurred at temperatures of < 55 °C. After 2 months of reactor operation, aerobic rates increased substantially at 55 and 70 °C, although maximum rates were observed at temperatures of ≤ 40 °C.

40|$|A {{process for}} the <b>aerobic</b> {{biological}} <b>decomposition</b> of guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) prior to extraction of the rubber by mechanical means was patented by Spence (1933). The process, called retting because of the loose analogy to the retting of flax {{for the production of}} linen fiber, produced a marked decrease in the impurities of the rubber and improved the physical properties of the vulcanized rubber. It also decreased the resinous acetone-soluble contam-inant from about 20 per cent of the crude rubber product to about 10 per cent, but no conclusions were drawn as to the agent responsible for the changes in composition and properties. The work reported in this paper is one phase of a reinvestigation of the retting of guayule by the natural microflora; it deals specifically with the decomposition of guayule resins. The resin of guayule is a mixture of acetone-soluble constituents of the plant. When the shrub is injured a clear resin exudes and dries. Other resin preparations were made by exhaustive extraction of guayule rubber with acetone and removal of the solvent. A variety of microorganisms normally present in the soil flora have been shown to oxidize compounds ordinarily considered relatively resistant to biochemical oxidation. Numerous species of bacteria have been found to oxidize phenols, and aromatic, alicyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The literature on these subjects prior to 1940 is briefly reviewed by Bushnell and Haas (1941).

30|$|Treatment {{of poultry}} feather waste under {{a mixture of}} both <b>aerobic</b> and {{anaerobic}} <b>decomposition</b> processes has been verified in this study. Feather waste generated from poultry industries can be monitored and efficiently managed by employing this strategy. The process adopted is a viable method of converting the useful nutrient present in feathers to soil nutrient {{that can be used}} to enhance the crop yield.

It is expected that proper composting of PFW might be an environment friendly, low-cost and sustainable strategy of PFW management. The role of TPFW in nutrient recycling to the soil will increase crop production and will help to improve the food security in meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the country.|$|R

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the initial stage of decomposition of two aquatic macrophytes (Typha domingensis and Eleocharis interstincta) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions; METHODS: The samples of aquatic macrophytes and water were collected in Cabiúnas lagoon, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the experiment 1 mineralization chambers were prepared with fresh plant fragments and water from the lagoon in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. DOC and CO 2 formation and O 2 consumption were measured during 30 days. In the experiment 2 mineralization chambers were prepared with aquatic macrophytes leachate and glucose for each experimental condition. CO 2 formation and O 2 consumption were measured during 1 day; RESULTS: In experiment 1 DOC concentrations in T. domingensis decomposition were higher. Despite this, CO 2 formation was more efficient in E. interstincta decomposition. The oxygen consumption increased in the beginning of decomposition and tended to stabilize towards the end. The O/C values increased in the beginning of decomposition and decreased thereafter. In experiment 2, <b>aerobic</b> <b>decomposition</b> presented higher CO 2 formation. E. interstincta leachate presented higher CO 2 concentration than T. domingensis; CONCLUSION: Our results showed that <b>aerobic</b> <b>decomposition</b> in the initial stages is higher only in T. domingensis mineralization. Oxygen consumption varies according to the alterations in the chemical composition of the detritus. The formation of CO 2 from T. domingensis and E. interstincta decomposition in the water column is irrelevant in Cabiúnas Lagoon. The low DOC release from fresh aquatic macrophytes detritus indicates that particulate organic matter mineralization is the main route of T. domingensis and E. interstincta decomposition...|$|E

Landfill leachate is a high-concentrated organic wastewater in which complex components are contained.

High survivals and excellent fry condition {{have been achieved}} for several commercially important endemic species produced for various projects. They include barramundi or sea bass, Lates calcarifer, Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata, dusky flathead, Platycephalus fuscus, sand whiting, Sillago ciliata, red sea bream or snapper, Pagrus auratus, banana prawn, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, and others. The consistent success of our standardised and relatively simple approach at different localities has led to it being incorporated into general fingerling production practices at several establishments in Australia. Although post-metamorphosis rearing methods have differed for each species investigated, due to various biological and behavioural traits and project requirements, these larval rearing methods have been successful with few species-specific modifications. Initially modelled on the Taiwanese approach to rearing Penaeids in aerated low-water exchange cultures, the approach similarly appears {{to rely on a}} beneficial assemblage of micro-organisms. Conceptually, these micro-organisms may include a mixture of the air-borne primary invaders of pure phytoplankton cultures when exposed to outdoor conditions. Whilst this would vary with different sites, our experiences with these methods have consistently been favourable. Mass microalgal cultures with eco-physiological youth are used to regularly augment larval fish cultures so that rearing conditions simulate an exponential growth-phase microalgal bloom.
