5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>table</b> on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
25|$|During the John F. Kennedy administration, the Entrance Hall (like {{most of the}} White House) {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} historic redecoration. The redecoration of the State Floor rooms, including the Entrance Hall, was overseen by American antiques autodidact Henry Francis du Pont and French interior designer Stéphane Boudin. Du Pont wanted a more historic approach to the White House, while Boudin preferred a French design aesthetic. Du Pont originally redecorated the Entrance Hall with two French pier tables, a settee, <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>table,</b> and two tables by Charles-Honoré Lannuier. Boudin had all but the pier tables removed, and his style is the one which remained {{over the next several}} decades.|$|E
25|$|Within 24hours of the 2010 Haiti {{earthquake}} {{a team of}} Combat Controllers {{from the}} 23rd Special Tactics Squadron stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida arrived at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. 28minutes after arriving the Combat Controllers assumed authority of air traffic control duties to allow planes carrying humanitarian aid to land safely. The Combat Controllers directed over 2,500 flights without incident from <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>table</b> using only hand radios. Under their direction planes {{were able to take}} off and land every five minutes, bringing in over 4 million pounds of supplies. The team leader of the Combat Controllers, Chief Master Sergeant Tony Travis, later was recognized as one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people of 2010 due to their efforts.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to outstanding artwork, Number 10 contains many exceptional {{pieces of furniture}} either owned by the house or on loan. One {{of the most striking}} and unusual is the Chippendale hooded guard's chair already mentioned that sits {{in a corner of the}} entrance hall. To its left is a long case clock by Benson of Whitehaven. A similar clock by Samuel Whichcote of London stands in the Cabinet anteroom. The White State Drawing Room contains elegant Adams furniture. The Green State Drawing Room contains mostly Chippendale furniture including <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>table</b> that belonged to Clive of India and a mahogany desk that is thought to have belonged to William Pitt the Younger and used by him during the Napoleonic Wars. In {{addition to}} the large carpet previously described, the Pillared State Drawing Room also contains a marble-topped table by Kent. The State Dining Room contains an elegant mahogany sideboard by Adam.|$|E
25|$|Pippa {{has been}} put to bed with a {{sleeping}} draught. Clarissa has set up <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>table</b> for bridge when her three guests arrive back, summoned by {{a phone call from}} her. She asks them to move the body to Costello's car which she knows is parked some distance from the house to a local wood. Their alibi will be the bridge game for which she has set up the cards with false scores to indicate the progress of some time having elapsed. She tells them that her motive is Henry's diplomatic visit. The three somewhat incredulous men fall in uneasily with her plan but only after Sir Rowland has been told by Clarissa of Pippa's supposed involvement. Wearing gloves supplied by Clarissa, they manage to move the body back into the recess, with the intention of moving him later, but are interrupted when the police unexpectedly arrive. Inspector Lord is there following a mysterious phone call to the station telling them that a murder has been committed at the house.|$|E
500|$|In early April 1945, Anna {{arranged}} for Rutherfurd {{to come over}} from her South Carolina estate in Aiken to meet her father at his [...] "Little White House" [...] in Warm Springs, Georgia, the small plain rustic cottage built at the polio therapy center by the heated mineral water springs resort that Roosevelt helped develop beginning in the 1920s. Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins were sitting there as the artist worked on her painting of FDR as he sat at <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>table</b> by the living room stone fireplace, fine-tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12, 1945. In this quiet domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other, Roosevelt suddenly placed his hand up on his forehead and temple, saying [...] "I have a terrific headache", then slumped over losing consciousness. Later his two doctors called in quickly said he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Since a thorough medical exam a year before, he had received increasingly more intensive care and concern from a young recently recruited private physician.|$|E

500|$|Mercer soon married wealthy socialite Winthrop Rutherfurd (1862–1944), {{a widower}} then in his fifties, but despite her {{marriage}} and Franklin's promise, the two remained in surreptitious, albeit infrequent contact {{in the three}} decades that followed. Especially during the War years, Franklin's daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, more frequently after Rutherfurd's death in 1944. [...] Mercer was in Warm Springs, Georgia, at the [...] "Little White House" [...] the President's long-time cottage and retreat, {{at the time of}} Roosevelt's death in April 1945. He was having his portrait painted, at Mercer's request, by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff in the living room – with Mercer and two female cousins attending. While sitting at <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>table</b> by the fireplace, reading an upcoming speech, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain {{in the back of my}} head." [...] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious. [...] Madame Shoumatoff, who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. [...] Mercer's presence in the house was not mentioned in the immediate press reports nor in any of the early published biographies.|$|E

It was said, at the time, that Williams had been for some time aware that a party of his own sort (desperadoes) had sworn away his life; and it was {{generally}} believed among the people that Williams's friends and enemies would make the assassination memorable--and useful, too--by a wholesale destruction of each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "'And it's you, you, who {{are telling}} me this!' cried Tomassov in an {{extremity}} of gratitude that was hardly greater than his admiration for the generosity of his future foe. Could a brother have done for him more! He sought to seize {{the hand of the}} French officer, but the latter remained wrapped up closely in his cloak. Possibly in the dark he had not noticed the attempt. He moved back a bit and in his self-possessed voice of a man of the world, as though he were speaking across <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>table</b> or something of the sort, he called Tomassov's {{attention to the fact that}} if he meant to make use of the warning the moments were precious.|$|E
