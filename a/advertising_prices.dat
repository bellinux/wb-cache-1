It was estimated that ITV would stand to make £9million in advertising revenue during the final, rising to £10million if it went to extra time and penalties; this compared with amounts of £2–3million normally received for its Wednesday night schedule and £3–4million for a Champions League final with no British teams involved.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} retail price image by offering an explanation for how and when stores can use their <b>advertised</b> <b>prices</b> to signal the prices of other products in the store. A model of a two-product retail market is presented in which stores <b>advertise</b> the <b>price</b> of one product and customers {{do not know the}} price of the other product before selecting which store to visit. In a model with full customer information, stores with different marginal costs charge different prices for each product. When customers do not know each store's marginal cost type, an opportunity arises for each store to signal its cost type using its <b>advertised</b> <b>prices.</b> In such a model, additional equilibria exist. In particular, stores with different costs may charge the same <b>advertised</b> <b>price</b> while continuing to charge different prices for the unadvertised product. Data from competing drycleaning stores is generally consistent with the model predictions. A number of additional properties of the equilibria are discussed and possible extensions to the model are proposed. signalling, <b>pricing,</b> <b>price</b> image, <b>advertising...</b>|$|R

We also compare results from two simple duopoly models, one with horizontal and the other with vertical differentiation, and find that only the model with horizontal differentiation is supermodular for the forms of advertising that are thought to raise price (e. g., persuasive advertising).

5000|$|When the {{application}} uses prices as the control instrument, setting prices to modulate sales, producing good time-phased forecasts may require using causal methods (sometimes {{referred to as}} econometric methods) {{to account for the}} relationship between the prices in effect at a point in time and the observed sales at that point in time. In this way, the relationship between price and sales volume, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "price response effect," [...] can be used to separate the underlying time-phased demand from the sales effects of price changes. Since the objective of these applications of pricing science is precisely to take best advantage of the sale volume effects of price changes, accounting for these effects can be a significant focus of the scientific work in support of these applications. The problem of identifying and estimating these effects is not trivial since, in addition to the price of a specific product, sales volume is affected by numerous other effects, some of which are under the control of the firm (e.g. <b>advertising,</b> <b>prices</b> of related goods) and other which are outside the control of the firm (e.g. competitors' prices, seasonality). In the domain of pricing science, these methods are typically referred to as Market Response Models.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze how {{competitive}} forces may influence how media firms like TV channels raise revenue. A media firm can either be financed by advertising revenue, by direct payment from the viewers (or the readers, if we consider newspapers), or by both. It is shown that the less differentiated the media firms’ content, the larger is the fraction of their revenue that comes from advertising. If the number of media firms increases, on the other hand, direct payment from the media consumers becomes more important. We also show that <b>advertising</b> <b>prices</b> are strategic substitutes, which implies that competition in <b>advertising</b> <b>prices</b> is distinctly different from price competition in other markets...|$|E
40|$|Presidential {{candidates}} in the U. S. compete by strategically placing their advertisements across markets based on each state’s potential to tip the election. The winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College concentrates most advertising in battleground states, thereby ignoring the majority of voters. We show that eliminating the Electoral College increases campaign reach, but unmasks several factors that still distort the geographic distribution of advertising. Using data from 2000 and 2004, we estimate an equilibrium model of advertising competition between presidential candidates. In a counterfactual with a direct vote, we find that all markets receive advertising, total expenditures rise by 25 %, and turnout increases by two million voters. However, systematically higher <b>advertising</b> <b>prices</b> in left-leaning markets lead to 20 % fewer exposures per voter compared to right-leaning markets. Equalizing <b>advertising</b> <b>prices</b> eliminates this distortion but reveals a funding asymmetry that tilts advertising the opposite direction: toward the left. Recomputing the equilibrium after equalizing the prices and candidates’ financial support yields a nearly uniform distribution of advertising exposures. This suggests that the Electoral College, <b>advertising</b> <b>prices</b> and candidate financial support are the primary sources of geographic variation in advertising, despite extensive local variation in voters ’ political preferences...|$|E
