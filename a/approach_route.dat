5|$|The Mall, a {{ceremonial}} <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> to the palace, {{was designed by}} SirAston Webb and completed in 1911 {{as part of a}} grand memorial to Queen Victoria. It extends from Admiralty Arch, across StJames's Park to the Victoria Memorial. This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state, and by the royal family on state occasions such as the annual Trooping the Colour.|$|E
5|$|In the East the Germans {{tried to}} {{overcome}} the resistance in the Grebbe Line by also deploying the other division of X Armeekorps, the 227. Infanteriedivision. It was ordered to break through a second attack axis near Scherpenzeel, where a dry <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> had been discovered through the inundations. The line in this area was defended by the Dutch 2nd Infantry Division. Two German regiments were to attack simultaneously, in adjacent sectors. However, after the regiment on the right, 366. Infanterieregiment, reached the start position for the attack, the regiment on the left, 412. Infanterieregiment, became delayed by flanking fire from the Dutch outpost line, the position of which had not been correctly determined. It allowed itself {{to get involved in}} fragmented firefights, and although the reserve regiment was also eventually brought forward, little progress was made against the outposts. Meanwhile, the waiting 366. Infanterieregiment was pounded by concentrated Dutch artillery fire and had to withdraw, resulting in a complete failure of the attack by 227. Infanteriedivision.|$|E
25|$|The CFA {{continued}} {{to study how}} Virginia should best connect to Arlington Memorial Bridge in 1929, and another set of preliminary plans were submitted by William Kendall in July 1930. But few of the problems facing the various plans were solved by November 1930, and the state and county still declined to choose an <b>approach</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

25|$|With no <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> {{actually}} having been chosen {{by both the}} state of Virginia and county of Arlington, study of all proposed routes continued. A joint CFA/NCPC study of the proposed approaches occurred on November 16, 1933. Three weeks later, the CFA recommended that bridges be built on both {{the north and south}} ends of Columbia Island, linking it with the mainland. The north bridge should link to Lee Boulevard, the commission said, and the south bridge should link to an approach from the south.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania Central Airlines Flight 410 {{departed}} Chicago at 13:52 for Norfolk with scheduled {{stops in}} Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Washington. The aircraft encountered a thunderstorm {{on the leg}} from Chicago to Cleveland; the leg from Cleveland to Pittsburgh was uneventful. Approximately 30 minutes after takeoff from Pittsburgh, the aircraft was informed of air traffic delays and deteriorating weather conditions on the approach to Washington. Flight 410 requested an alternate <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> requiring a descent from 7,000 feet to 2,500 feet. The pilot radioed in their position at 1,000-foot increments from 7,000 (at 18:05) to 3,000 feet (at 18:13). There was no further radio contact.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of I-95 in the Trenton area {{had not been}} finalized when the route was first designated. The BPR preferred using the Trenton Freeway (US 1 and Route 174), which was completed to Whitehead Road, but New Jersey and Pennsylvania proposed using the Scudder Falls Bridge and its <b>approach</b> (<b>Route</b> 129), opened in 1961 to Scotch Road (exit 3), {{due in part to}} low design standards of the Trenton Freeway. As a result, I-95 was routed to use the Scudder Falls Bridge approach. The approach to the Scudder Falls Bridge was extended in 1974, northeast to the planned interchange with the new I-95 freeway, and then east to US 1 as I-295.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} the first flight of the second wave—flown again by Sapre and Vinayraj—took off from Palali airbase however, the Tigers {{had been able to}} {{identify}} the <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> and moved troops and heavy machine guns to the rooftop of a building north of the field. As Sapre and Vinayraj approached their target zone, the Tigers directed heavy and sustained machinegun fire to the choppers, aiming at the cargo-hold. As the heavy machine gun fire pierced the metal skin of the helicopters, at least one commando on Vinayraj's flight was hit and wounded badly. The pilots however, were able to land and drop their load. Under increasingly intense ground fire, they took off to head back to Palali.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{were able}} to {{establish}} air superiority in Belgium. Having completed thorough photographic reconnaissance, they destroyed 83 of the 179 aircraft of the Aeronautique Militaire within the first 24 hours of the invasion. The Belgians flew 77 operational missions but this contributed little to the air campaign. As a result, the Luftwaffe was assured air superiority over the Low Countries. Because Army Group B's composition had been so weakened compared to the earlier plans, the feint offensive by the 6th Army {{was in danger of}} stalling immediately, since the Belgian defences on the Albert Canal position were very strong. The main <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> was blocked by Fort Eben-Emael, a large fortress then generally considered the most modern in Europe, which controlled the junction of the Meuse and the Albert Canal.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April 1987, the Pakistani {{troops at}} Quaid Post fired on the Indian {{soldiers}} at Sonam (6,400 m), killing two of them. The Indian Army then launched {{a plan to}} evict the Pakistanis from the Quaid Post. The 8th Battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (8th JAK LI) was given the task of capturing the Quaid Post. On May 29, a 13-member JAK LI patrol led by Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pande was asked to identify the best <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> to the Post, and mark it with ropes. The group started climbing the ice wall leading to the Quaid Post, but were detected by the Pakistani soldiers, when it was just 30 m from the top. The Pakistanis opened fire with a heavy machine gun, killing ten Indian soldiers, including Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pande. Before they were killed, the Indian soldiers managed to establish a number of footholds on the vertical ice wall with a pick axe, and had laid a rope to the top.|$|E

25|$|The {{weapon was}} moved long {{distances}} via rail on {{a variant of}} a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle bogies. When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground by lowering the suspension on its continuous track units' roadwheels on each side to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The Karl-Gerät proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be backed into position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the firing position had to be precisely leveled and the <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc. It could only be loaded at zero elevation, so {{it had to be}} re-aimed between every shot.|$|E
500|$|The next day, 29 March, the {{division}} consolidated their positions, planning {{to resume the}} assault on 30 March. McCarroll was given command of the assault. Position [...] "A" [...] was their main objective. The <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> would be along a ridge line between [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C," [...] which were to be neutralised by two troops in case the Turkish tried {{to intervene in the}} attack. Once [...] "A" [...] was captured, it was believed [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C" [...] would surrender.|$|E
500|$|The {{province}} of Zealand was {{exempt from the}} surrender; fighting continued there in a common allied effort with French troops. The Dutch forces in the province comprised eight full battalions of army and naval troops. They were commanded by Rear-Admiral Hendrik Jan van der Stad, who, being a naval officer, had been directly subordinated to Winkelman. [...] The area was under naval command because of the predominance of the naval port of Flushing {{on the island of}} Walcheren which controlled the access to Antwerp via the Western Scheldt. The northern islands of the province were defended only by a few platoons. The defence of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, the Dutch part of Flanders, was largely left to the Allies. The main Dutch army forces would thus be concentrated in Zuid-Beveland, the peninsula east of Walcheren, to deny the enemy this <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> to Vlissingen. Zuid-Beveland was connected to the coast of North Brabant by an isthmus; at its eastern and most narrow end the Bath Position had been prepared, occupied by an infantry battalion. This was mainly intended as a collecting line for possible Dutch troops retreating from the east. At its western end was the longer Zanddijk Position, occupied by three battalions.|$|E

500|$|When {{war with}} Mexico seemed imminent, {{topographic}} engineers {{were sent to}} the border to assist with the army's preparations. Raynolds served in Winfield Scott's Mexican-American War campaign which marched overland to Mexico City from the Gulf of Mexico seaport at Veracruz. After the war, the American army occupied Mexico City and the surrounding region. During the occupation, Raynolds and others set out to map and explore nearby mountains. Raynolds's party is credited with being the first confirmed to climb to the summit of Pico de Orizaba (...) which at [...] is the tallest mountain in Mexico and third tallest in North America. Over a period of several months, Raynolds and other officers from both the army and navy mapped the best <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> to Pico de Orizaba. To assist them in their climb, the party planned on taking grapnels attached to long ropes and primitive crampons in the form of shoes with projecting points to help ensure they could safely climb up cliffs and across glaciers. Told by local villagers that any attempt to reach the summit would be fruitless because no one had ever done it before, the Americans became even more determined to show the Mexicans it could be climbed.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 6 August, the Imperial Japanese Navy sent a force of four destroyers under Captain Kaju Sugiura—, , [...] of Sugiara's own Destroyer Division 4 and [...] of Captain Tameichi Hara's Destroyer Division 27—carrying about 950 {{soldiers}} and their supplies. The Japanese airfield at Munda on New Georgia, which the force at Vila was assigned to reinforce, {{was on the verge}} of being captured; it would actually fall later that day. The Imperial Japanese commanders expected that Vila would become the center of their next line of defense. The Japanese operational plan specified the same <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> through Vella Gulf as the three previous successful transport runs over the objections of Hara, who argued that repeating prior operations was courting disaster.|$|E
2500|$|Tobruk {{was pressed}} into use in June 1942 but the long <b>approach</b> <b>route</b> and Allied bombing led {{the effort to}} be {{abandoned}} in August. The German army assumed that the maximum distance a motorised army could operate from its base was [...] but about an average of a third of Axis lorries were unserviceable and [...] of the fuel delivered was consumed moving the remainder to the front. Fuel oil shortages in Italy, {{the small size of}} the ports in Libya and the need to meet civilian demand, meant the inefficient dispatch of large numbers of small convoys. Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH, German army high command) concluded that German forces in Libya could not be supplied sufficiently for a decisive offensive, unless Italian forces were withdrawn to Italy, which was a politically impossible condition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of an attack by a {{high-speed}} force, the attackers could pick the time and place of the attack, and expect to encounter only the aircraft already in the air along that route. Thus they could outnumber the defenders in any given area. To ensure there were a reasonable number of fighters along any <b>approach</b> <b>route,</b> huge numbers of aircraft would need to be in the air at all times covering all the routes. Even more aircraft would be needed to handle issues like refuelling, re-arming, and repair. Likewise, a huge number of pilots would be needed to crew the aircraft, as each pilot could only be expected to fly so long per day. Such a system was essentially impossible, {{and was one of the}} reasons it was widely believed that [...] "the bomber will always get through".|$|E
