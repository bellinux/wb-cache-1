40|$|In {{this study}} we {{undertook}} a global assessment of the morphological characteristics of disc cells in several species. Morphological cellular characteristics in mouse, deer, human foetal and ovine intervertebral disc (IVD) were assessed using histological and immunohistological techniques. Notochordal cells of differing morphologies were identified in these species. Progenitor cell nests were identified in mice in the outer AF at its juncture with the vertebral growth plate. The NP of <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> IVDs also contained distinctive colonies of dividing chondroid-like cells within a well defined basophilic aggrecan rich but versican negative matrix. These cells were of a different morphology to authentic disc fibrochondrocytes in the surrounding NP in a fibrous versican rich matrix. HA was also identified {{as a component of}} the chondroid cell-nests in the NP. These may represent a progenitor cell niche, HA {{has been shown to be}} associated with stem cell niches in a number of tissues where it has a role in the regulation of stem cell quiescence and maintenance of stem cell viability. Chondroid cell nests were also identified in IVDs in which disc degeneration had been induced by an annular lesion, these may be a source of cells for repair processes. The chondroid-disc cell population in the central <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> NP differed from all other cell types in foetal and newborn ovine, murine, or cervine IVDs and may represent resident adult progenitor cell population worthy of further study. Similar cellular arrangements have recently been identified in human IVDs, isolated and cultured and shown to express stem cell markers in monolayers and by flow cytometry. The animal species examined in the present study are commonly used in IVD repair studies, the remarkable biodiversity of disc cells observed across species indicate caution should be made in any extrapolations to the human IVD...|$|E
40|$|Meat {{quality is}} {{perceived}} by consumers as being connected with certain sensory characteristics. These are colour, texture, fragrance and tenderness (Ruiz De Huidobro et al., 2003). Some authors {{have studied the}} relationship between the different productive parameters such as rearing system, age, sex, etc., and the biological characteristics of muscles, sensory parameters, or those of economic interest such as carcass conformation and slaughter yield (Mandell et al., 1998; Byrne et al., 2000; Maltin et al., 2001; Maher et al., 2004; Sami et al., 2004).

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{characterize}} the developmental potential of prepubertal and <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> oocytes, analyzing the developmental speed to two-cell and blastocyst stages and its relationship with hatching from the zona pellucida, development after vitrification and the number and allocation of inner mass and trophoblastic cells. Prepubertal and <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> oocytes were matured and fertilized in vitro and first cleavage rates at 22, 26 and 32 h were recorded. Cleaved oocytes were cultured and blastocyst production was assessed at 6 – 9 days post-fertilization (dpf). Blastocysts from the two sources obtained on different days {{were divided into two}} groups: the first was vitrified, warmed and cultured in vitro to evaluate re-expansion of the blastocoelic cavity; blastocysts of the second were cultured separately to allow for hatching and count of trophoblastic and inner mass cells of hatched blastocysts by differential staining. We observed a significantly lower rate (P < 0. 01) of cleaved prepubertal oocytes at 22 and 26 h after fertilization while it was higher (P < 0. 01) at 32 h than in the adult ones. Adult blastocyst production was significantly lower (P < 0. 01) in prepubertal than in adult groups and began on the seventh dpf, later (P < 0. 01) than in the adult group, where they appeared on the sixth dpf. Prepubertal blastocysts hatched at a lower rate than the adult ones (P < 0. 01) and in both experimental groups faster blastocysts showed a higher (P < 0. 01) hatching rate. Similarly, prepubertal derived blastocysts showed lower viability after vitrification (P < 0. 01) compared to the adult counterparts, and in particular slower embryos had reduced viability after vitrification compared to the fastest (P < 0. 01). Cell number was not different between blastocysts of both groups obtained at 6 and 7 dpf, which were higher (P < 0. 01) than those obtained at 8 and 9 dpf. The ICM/trophoblast cell ratio was similar in 6 - and 7 -day obtained blastocyst and increased (P < 0. 01) in those obtained 1 or 2 days later. These findings show that differences in kinetic development between prepubertal and adult derived embryos reflect differences in developmental capacity of the oocytes from which they derive and could be indicative of embryo quality...|$|E

Animals were in grazing system based on Tifton - 85 pastures and were supplemented with concentrate. Lambs were slaughtered at 32 kg of live weight, at around 5 months of age. Ewes and wethers were slaughtered with 55 kg and 60 months of age. The iron values were differents between categories for those valued cuts muscles, with higher average to legs muscles from <b>adults</b> <b>ovine</b> of 3. 86 mg/ 100 g with regard to lambs of 1. 91 mg/ 100 g, respectively. The iron values of the muscles from half carcass didn't differ for that animal category, with 3. 38 mg/ 100 g average. The calcium values in muscles from half carcass and leg cut were higher to wethers (9. 84 e 7. 35 mg/ 100 g), intermediaries to ewes (6. 28 e 6. 54 mg/ 100 g) and smallers values to lambs (5. 30 e 4. 22 mg/ 100 g).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} renal denervation on renin mRNA levels in fetal and nonpregnant <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> renocortical tissue and in isolated juxtaglomerular cells under basal conditions and after stimulation. METHODS: The left kidney was denervated and the right kidney subjected to a sham procedure in nine ovine fetuses (136 - 141 days ' gestation) and 20 nonpregnant ewes. After 5 - 7 days the denervated and intact kidneys were obtained, and renin-containing renal cortical cells were isolated and cultured overnight. Then cells were treated with isoproterenol, forskolin, or isomethylbutyl xanthine (IBMX) for 4 hours. Total RNA was isolated and renin mRNA measured by RNase protection assay. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were measured in the incubation medium with a competitive enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: In adults, basal renin mRNA levels were significantly lower in denervated than in sham-operated kidneys. No diference was noted between denervated and intactfetal kidneys. Renin mRNA levels were significantly higher infetal than in adult kidney tissue, and cellsfromfetuses had greater increases in renin mRNA after stimulation than did cellsfrom adults.

40|$|Abstract. In a blunt, nonmissile, head impact {{model of}} {{traumatic}} brain injury in 4 – 5 -week-old Merino lambs, multiple foci of internal granular layer necrosis were found in all 10 impacted animals. This lesion has not previously been reported after human or animal head injury. Temporal lobe impact contusions, predomi-nantly microscopic (8 / 10) and contralateral contusions (2 / 10), parenchymal (10 / 10) and subarachnoid (10 / 10) hemorrhage, and widely distributed axonal injury were also observed. Although the precise pathogenesis of this focal granule cell necrosis and often attendant red cell change in Purkinje cells was unclear, an ischemic etiology due to trauma-related vascular damage is postulated.

Method. We applied 300 mg MPA/day in nine sheep for nine weeks and compared them with untreated animals (n= 9). The expression level of Ig receptormRNAwasdetermined in eight different <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> tissues (liver, kidney, je-junum, ileum, spleen, thymus, mesenteric and pharyngeal lymph nodes). For a reliable and sensitive mRNA quantifi-cation of Ig receptor subtypes, a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used with a relative- and tissue-specific efficiency corrected quantification model (REST). Results. Each tissueexhibitedan individual expressionpatternof FcRnandpIgRmRNA. Both typesof Ig receptorswere highly expressed in the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Medium-to-low expressions {{were found in the}} spleen, thymus, mesenteric and pharyngeal lymph nodes. FcRn mRNA was significantly down-regulated by MPA in the liver (p= 0. 02).

40|$|Seminiferous tubule fluid {{production}} in adult rats was studied using {{the technique of}} unilateral efferent duct ligation (EDL), the production rate representing the difference in testis weight over the time since ligation. Following EDL, fluid {{production in}}creases linearly for 6 h and linearly at a slightly slower rate for a further 18 h with a sharp decrease thereafter. No differences in fluid production were noted for rats aged between 90 - 310 days. Forty-eight hours after hypophysectomy {{there was a significant}} fall (26 %) in fluid production prior to any significant decrease in testis weight. Fluid production continued to decline with time after hypophysectomy eventually reaching a plateau 16 - 44 days later at levels approximately 15 % of those found in control rats. Treatment of rats hypophysectomized 4 days earlier with ovine FSH for 3 days did not restore fluid production, but treatment with ovine LH, testosterone propionate (TP) or FSH together with TP for a similar duration all restored fluid production to normal. On the other hand, treatment of intact <b>adult</b> rats with <b>ovine</b> LH significantly increased fluid production but the effect of treatment with testosterone alone did not reach significance.

40|$|Processes of {{development}} during fetal life profoundly transform tendons from a plastic tissue into a highly differentiated structure, characterised {{by a very}} low ability to regenerate after injury in adulthood. Sheep tendon is frequently used as a translational model to investigate cell-based regenerative approaches. However, in contrast to other species, analytical and comparative baseline studies on the normal developmental maturation of sheep tendons from fetal through to adult life are not currently available. Thus, a detailed morphological and biochemical {{study was designed to}} characterise tissue maturation during mid- (2  months of pregnancy: 14  cm of length) and late fetal (4  months: 40  cm of length) life, through to adulthood. The results confirm that ovine tendon morphology undergoes profound transformations during this period. Endotenon was more developed in fetal tendons than in adult tissues, and its cell phenotype changed through tendon maturation. Indeed, groups of large rounded cells laying on smaller and more compacted ones expressing osteocalcin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were identified exclusively in fetal mid-stage tissues, and not in late fetal or adult tendons. VEGF, NGF as well as blood vessels and nerve fibers showed decreased expression during tendon development. Moreover, the endotenon of mid- and late fetuses contained identifiable cells that expressed several pluripotent stem cell markers [Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT), SRY Determining Region Y Box- 2 (SOX 2), Nanog Homeobox (NANOG) and Octamer Binding Transcription Factor- 4 A (OCT- 4 A) ]. These cells were not identifiable in <b>adult</b> specimens. <b>Ovine</b> tendon development was also accompanied by morphological modifications to cell nuclei, and a progressive decrease in cellularity, proliferation index and expression of connexins 43 and 32. Tendon maturation was similarly characterised by modulation of several other gene expression profiles, including Collagen type I, Collagen type III, Scleraxis B, Tenomodulin, Trombospondin 4 and Osteocalcin. These gene profiles underwent a dramatic reduction in adult tissues. Transforming growth factor-β~ 1 expression (involved in collagen synthesis) underwent a similar decrease. In conclusion, these morphological studies carried out on sheep tendons at different stages {{of development}} and aging offer normal structural and molecular baseline data to allow accurate evaluation of data from subsequent interventional studies investigating tendon healing and regeneration in ovine experimental models...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{characterize}} the compact bone remodeling of the ovariectomized ewe and its effectiveness as an animal model for studies of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The use of animal models is a beneficial way to evaluate the effectiveness of medical devices and therapeutic agents for treating diseases. The ovine model is an attractive option because of its large size and similar bone remodeling to humans. However, this species, like most animals, does not undergo a natural menopause, making an ovariectomy necessary for studies of estrogen depletion. The OVX (ovariectomized) sheep has been widely accepted as a model for loss of BMD. However, even with its advantages seasonality has been shown to have an effect on the bone remodeling in the ovine model. Thus, this study focused on characterizing the seasonal and anatomical variation in the compact bone remodeling in the ovine model. In doing so, 28 skeletally mature Columbia-Rambouillet cross ewes underwent an ovariectomy. The animals were divided into groups of 7 based on each season: autumn, winter, spring, and summer. During its specified season each group of 7 underwent ovariectomy and then was sacrificed 12 months post-surgery. The radii and ulnae were harvested and then divided into 6 anatomical locations: craniolateral, cranial, craniomedial, craniolateral, caudal, and caudomedial. This allowed for analysis through the fabrication of microradiographs. Histomorphometric analysis involved measurements to quantify the bone volume to tissue volume ratio, the percent of tissue and material remodeling, the mean secondary osteonal radius, and number of tissue and material cement line interfaces. Densitometry analysis was then performed to determine the density of each sector relative to an aluminum step wedge, serving as the key. Using a 2 -way repeated measures ANOVA statistical analysis was performed to evaluate for seasonal and anatomical differences as well as a possible interaction between season and anatomical region. The OVX data showed significant seasonal and anatomical differences as well as seasonality within anatomical section in the remodeling parameters. When this data was combined with earlier data from a control, sham-cohort from the same experiment a 3 -way ANOVA was also performed to evaluate the effects of season, anatomical sector, and treatment on the remodeling parameters. Again, there was significant seasonal, anatomical, and treatment differences, as well as interactions of all three. The results of this study showed that varying levels of remodeling occurs in the <b>adult</b> OVX <b>ovine</b> model and differences between the control and OVX model can be attributed to seasonal and anatomical variations. Thus, it will be an important consideration when developing new test protocols for research incorporating the sheep model for studying osteoporosis...|$|R

For this, 40 <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> animals, aged between six and 18 months, were used for puncture of lumbosacral CSF. The aspect and color shower a clear and colorless pattern. The average density was 1. 006 ± 0. 0064, protein concentration was 25. 27 ± 6. 64 mg/dL and glucose concentration was 46. 89 ± 10. 99 mg/dL.

In this procedure, the replacement valve is mounted in a stent that is expanded at the aimed valve position and fixated by clamping. However, for this technique to be appropriate for pediatric patients, the material properties of the host tissue need to be determined to design stents that can be optimized for this particular application. In this study we performed equibiaxial tensile tests on four <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> pulmonary artery walls and compared the outcomes with one pediatric pulmonary artery. Results show that the pediatric pulmonary artery was significantly thinner (1. 06 ± 0. 36 mm (mean±SD)) than ovine tissue (2. 85 ± 0. 40 mm), considerably stiffer for strain values that exceed the physiological conditions (beyond 50 % strain in the circumferential and 60 % in the longitudinal direction), more anisotropic (with {{a significant difference in}} stiffness between the longitudinal and circumferential directions beyond 60 % strain) and presented stronger non-linear stress–strain behavior at equivalent strains (beyond 26 % strain) compared to ovine tissue. These discrepancies suggest that stents validated and optimized using the ovine pre-clinical model might not perform satisfactorily in pediatric patients. The material parameters derived from this study may be used to develop stent designs for both applications using computational models...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{stem and}} {{precursor}} cells persist postnatally throughout adulthood and {{are capable of}} responding to numerous endogenous and exogenous signals by modifying their proliferation and differentiation. While adult neurogenesis has been extensively studied in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation and in the subventricular zone adjacent {{to the wall of}} the lateral ventricles, we and others have recently reported constitutive adult neurogenesis in other brain structures, including the hypothalamus. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to study the expression of the neuroblast marker DCX, and compared its expression pattern in <b>adult</b> <b>ovine,</b> mouse and human hypothalamic tissues. Our results indicate that DCX-positive cells resembling immature and developing neurons occur in a wide-range of hypothalamic nuclei in all three species, although with different distribution patterns. In addition, the morphology of DCX-positive cells varied depending on their location. DCX-positive cells near the third ventricle had the morphology of very immature neuroblasts with a round shape with no processes, while those located deeper in the parenchyma such as in the ventromedial nucleus were fusiform and showed a bipolar morphology. Extending this observation, we showed that among the cohort of immature neurons entering the ventromedial nucleus, some appeared to undergo maturation, as revealed by the partial colocalization of DCX with markers of more mature neurons, e. g., Hu/C/D. This study provides further confirmation of the existence of an adult hypothalamic neurogenic niche and argues for the potential existence of a migratory path within the hypothalamus...|$|E
40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1 / 2) {{play a key role}} in regulating vascular tone. To test the hypotheses that ERK 1 / 2 modulate cerebral artery agonist-induced contraction, and that this changes with developmental age, we measured both total and phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 in <b>adult</b> and fetal <b>ovine</b> cerebral arteries. In middle cerebral arteries (MCA) we also examined tension and [Ca 2 +]i responses to phenylephrine (PHE), in the absence and presence of the ERK 1 / 2 inhibitor U- 0126 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK or MEK) inhibitor PD- 98059. In the fetus, but not adult, U- 0126 potentiated PHE-induced contraction. In both age groups, inhibition by U- 0126, but not PD- 98059, decreased the PHE-induced [Ca 2 +]i increase; in fact for adult, this eliminated any significant [Ca 2 +]i increase. In turn in the adult, but not fetus, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition by staurosporine (3 × 10 − 8 M) prior to ERK 1 / 2 inhibition by U- 0126 (10 − 5 M) prevented this elimination of [Ca 2 +]i increase. In adult and fetal cerebral arteries basal total ERK 1 / 2 levels were similar. However, in fetal arteries the basal phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 levels were significantly less than in adult. In fetal, but not adult, cerebral arteries, 10 − 6 – 10 − 4 m PHE increased ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The ERK 1 / 2 inhibitor U- 0126, but not the MEK inhibitor PD- 98059, lowered basal activated ERK 1 / 2 levels in vessels of both age groups. These results suggest that basal levels of phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 play an important role in suppressing Ca 2 + sensitivity, perhaps by PKC inhibition. The developmental increase in cerebral artery basal phosphorylated ERK levels from fetus to adult, suggests a transition in the regulation of contraction from Ca 2 + sensitivity in the fetal arteries to Ca 2 + concentration in the adult vessels...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Currently {{available}} synthetic void fillers {{are indicated}} for bony voids or gaps {{that are not}} intrinsic to {{the stability of the}} structure. Jax™ TCP (tricalcium phosphate) is an osteoconductive bioceramic fabricated into 4 mm granules with a unique interlocking form, promoting structural integrity while allowing bone ingrowth. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess bone ingrowth using a large, critically sized, femoral defect. Methods: A 5 cm segmental ostectomy was created in the mid-diaphysis of 16 <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> femora. A stainless steel intramedullary nail was introduced and locked with two proximal and two distal fully-threaded locking screws. Each defect was surrounded with a resorbable macroporous poly (L-lactide-co-D,L) lactide mesh acting as graft containment. Treatment groups (n= 4) were as follows: 1) Empty defect; 2) Morselized cortical bone; 3) Cortical strut; 4) Jax TCP. Serial radiographs were taken postoperatively and at two, four and six months. Femora retrieved at necropsy (six months) underwent computed tomography for volumetric analysis followed by histological assessment of the biological response. Results: Little bone was apparent in the empty defect group, whereas significant bone was evident in both autograft groups and the Jax TCP group. Three-dimensional CT reconstructions and volumetric analysis were in close agreement with the radiographic findings.

To unravel the role played by miRNA, we describe here 47 new ovine miRNA cloned from mammary gland in early pregnancy displaying strong similarities with those already identified in the cow, human, or mouse. A microarray study of miRNA variations in the <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation showed that 100 miRNA are regulated according to three principal patterns of expression: a decrease in early pregnancy, a peak at midpregnancy, or an increase throughout late pregnancy and lactation. One miRNA displaying each pattern (miR- 21, miR- 205, and miR- 200 b) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Variations in expression were confirmed for all three miRNA. Using in situ hybridization, we detected both miR- 21 and miR- 200 in luminal mammary epithelial cells when expressed, whereas miR- 205 was expressed in basal cells {{during the first half of}} pregnancy and then in luminal cells during the second half. We therefore conclude that miR- 21 is strongly expressed in the luminal cells of the normal mammary gland during early pregnancy when extensive cell proliferation occurs. In addition, we show that miR- 205 and miR- 200 are coexpressed in luminal cells, but only during the second half of pregnancy. These two miRNA may cooperate to maintain epithelial status by repressing an EMT-like program, to achieve and preserve the secretory phenotype of mammary epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} fetal {{development of}} protein C, a pregnant ovine model was used. Protein C was isolated from ovine plasma, and a polyclonal antibody was raised. Citrated plasma {{was obtained from}} undisturbed chronically catheterized fetal lambs. On Western blot, nonreduced <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> protein C had a molecular mass of 70 kD. Fetal ovine protein C was determined to have a molecular mass of 4 to 6 kD larger than the adult molecule. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated slightly increased anodal migration of the fetal form. Isoelectric focusing demonstrated a decreased pI of the fetal molecule (4. 45 versus 4. 6). The ovine protein C molecules were deglycosylated with N-glycanase. Deglycosylated fetal protein C migrated more similarly to the adult form, although {{a portion of the}} fetal form persisted. These experiments demonstrate the first example of a unique fetal form of a vitamin K-dependent protein and are compatible with increased glycosylation of fetal ovine protein C. It is speculated that altered posttranslational processing may exist as a general process by which certain coagulation proteins are modified during fetal development. mRNA was isolated from maternal and fetal hepatic tissue and analyzed by Northern hybridization. Fetal plasma concentration and hepatic mRNA for protein C were both 40 % of normal maternal values from midgestation onward. At term, protein C mRNA increased to adult range (p < 0. 025), although plasma protein C concentration decreased slightly (p < 0. 001). A transition from fetal to adult protein C form was found beginning 6 d before term birth, with a doubling time of 24 h. These data are compatible with a gestationally determined maturation of ovine protein C. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Tendon {{injuries}} are {{often associated with}} skeletal muscle lesions that can originate {{from a variety of}} events, including direct trauma, tendon and muscle lacerations and contusions, indirect insults and degenerative diseases as muscular dystrophies. Currently, a complete cure for musculoskeletal diseases is not present and the restitutio ad integrum is difficult to obtain. In the last decade, adult MSCs gained general attention in both human and veterinary medicine and the understanding of MSC function is improved promoting the application of cell therapy and the development of powerful cell-derived therapeutics for regenerative medicine. The first part of this research focused on the reprogramming of stromal cells derived from equine and sheep mesenchymal tissue towards tenogenic and myogenic fate in vitro using new non-viral transfection system. 1) 	Equine MSCs isolated from peripheral blood (PB-MSCs) can develop the tenogenic pathway using four specific growth factors such as TGFβ 3 (transforming growth factor β 3), EGF 2 (epidermal growth factor 2), bFGF 2 (fibroblast growth factor 2) and IGF 1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in presence or without Low Level Laser Technology (LLLT). 2) 	PB-MSCs were induced to differentiate towards myogenic fate using the complex TAT-MyoD in presence of a conditioned medium obtained from co-culturing PB-MSCs with C 2 C 12 without a direct contact. 3) 	A novel surface-active maghemite nanoparticles (SAMNs) were tested as vectors for eukaryotic cell transfection of coding gene in PB-MSCs without the application of external magnetic fields. The full characterization of these three techniques was achieved using molecular and immunohistochemistry analysis. Real-time PCR (rt-PCR) was performed to study the expression level of the typical tenogenic genes markers Early Growth Response Protein- 1 (EGR 1), Tenascin C (TNC) and Decorin (DCN) to discover the best combination of GFs in presence or without LLLT. To evaluate the myoblasts differentiation, rt-PCR analysis was executed to study Myf 5 and Myogenin gene expression while immunofluorescence experiments was performed to estimate MyoD, Myf 5 and Myogenin protein expression. The cytotoxicity effects of SAMNs nanoparticles was observed with XTT cell proliferation assay and to evaluate SAMNs efficacy as vector for pDNA coding GFP, an immunofluorescence analysis was performed. The second topic of this research project was on skin regeneration studied in vivo. Skin is a soft tissue and covers the entire surface area of body. It is a self-repairing, self-renewing organ that forms an important barrier from the outer environment to the inner environment. Therefore, damage to the skin leads to debilitating wounds that is an impairment of the anatomical structure and function of the skin. In the two papers of the second section, the capability of <b>adult</b> equine and <b>ovine</b> MSCs to regenerate skin injuries has been studied. 1) 	Wounds were induced in the gluteus region of six horses and treated with autologous epithelial stem cells (EpSCs), allogeneic EpSCs, vehicle treatment or untreated control. 2) 	Sheep allogeneic PB-MSCs were utilized to treat experimental lesions on the back of six sheep. This project is part of a large scheme where conventional treatments (Manuka Honey, Connettivina and Acemannane) were compared to innovative cures (MSCs and gas-ionized plasma). In this thesis, only the data about skin regeneration with PB-MSCs was reported. In the first work of the second section, rt-PCR was performed on tissue biopsies collected after one and five weeks of treatment and IFN-y, IL- 6, VEGF, EGF, IGF- 1 and epidermal keratin (eKER) were analyzed to study cellular immune response, neovascularization and the epidermal keratinization. In the second paper, clinical analysis have been performed to analyze the healing time, the presence, the color and the nature of exudate, the aspect of gauze, the hydration of the wound, the percentage of re-epithelization and contraction of the lesions. Tissue biopsies were collected after 15 and 42 days of treatments to conduct molecular analysis, histological and immunohistochemical staining. Molecular analysis were performed to study the expression level of genes such as Collagen 1 α 1 (Col 1 α 1) and Keratin of hair (hKER). Dermal and subcutaneous inflammation, granulation tissue and skin adnexa were evaluated using histological analysis while the expression of MHCII, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and a cellular proliferation marker (KI 67) were estimated with immunohistochemical staining. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT SEASONAL AND ANATOMICAL VARIATION IN COMPACT BONE REMODELING IN THE ADULT SHEEP Joseph Calcagno In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether ovine compact bone is suitable for study of osteoporosis, the remodeling parameters of the untreated animal must be fully characterized. Ovine compact bone is an attractive large animal model due to its similarities in size and bone remodeling to humans. However hormonal, exercise, and dietary changes due to seasonal changes can cause treatment effects to be hidden or superimposed on existing changes in the bone. In {{order to determine}} if any seasonal or anatomical variation occurred in the compact bone remodeling, 28 skeletally mature Columbia-Rambouillet cross ewes underwent a sham ovariectomy, OVX, {{as part of a}} larger study. The animals were divided into 4 seasonal groups (autumn, winter, spring, and summer) of 7 sheep. Each group underwent surgery and was sacrificed 12 months post-op in their respective seasons. The radii and ulnae were harvested and processed for analysis. Each radius/ulna was divided into 6 anatomical locations (craniolateral, cranial, craniomedial, caudolateral, caudal, and caudomedial). Histomorphometric analysis of the bone volume to tissue volume ratio, the percent of tissue and material remodeling, the mean secondary osteonal radius, and the number of cement line interfaces were quantified. Quantitative microdensitometry analysis was performed to determine the density of each region with respect to an aluminum standard. 2 -way repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to determine seasonal and anatomical differences as well as a possible interaction between season and anatomical sectors. Significant seasonal and anatomical differences as well as seasonality within sectors were observed in the remodeling parameters. With the seasonal and anatomical changes in the untreated animal, comparison to other models must ensure treatment and follow up times as well anatomical locations are similar. This research provides a baseline of seasonal and anatomical variations in compact bone remodeling for the untreated <b>adult</b> <b>ovine...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{adapt to}} {{seasonal}} {{variations in the}} environment, most mammalian species exhibit seasonal cycles in their physiology and behavior. Seasonal plasticity in the structure and function of {{the central nervous system}} contributes to the adaptation of this physiology in seasonal mammals. As part of these plasticity mechanisms, seasonal variations in proliferation rate and neuron production have been extensively studied in songbirds. In this report, we investigated whether this type of brain plasticity also occurs in sheep, a seasonal species, by assessing variations in cell proliferation in the sheep diencephalon. We administered the cell birth marker 5 ′-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to adult female sheep in July and December, during long and short photoperiod, respectively. The BrdU incorporation was analyzed and quantified in the hypothalamus, a key center for neuroendocrine regulations, as well as in other structures involved in relaying neuroendocrine and sensory information, including the median eminence, the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, and the thalamus. In December, 2 -fold and 6 -fold increases in the number of BrdU+ nuclei were observed in the hypothalamus and thalamus, respectively, when compared with July. This variation is independent of the influence of peripheral gonadal estradiol variations. An inverse seasonal regulation of cell proliferation was observed in the pars tuberalis. In contrast, no seasonal variation in cell proliferation was seen in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle. Many of the newborn cells in the <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> hypothalamus and thalamus differentiate into neurons and glial cells, as assessed by the expression of neuronal (DCX, NeuN) and glial (GFAP, S 100 B) fate markers. In summary, we show that the estimated cell proliferation rates in the sheep hypothalamus, thalamus, and pars tuberalis are different between seasons. These variations are independent of the seasonal fluctuations of peripheral estradiol levels, unlike the results described in the brain nuclei involved in song control of avian species...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. com 1. The intracellular pathways that modulate the opening of oxygen-sensitive ion channels during periods of hypoxia are poorly understood. Different tissues appear to use either NADPH oxidase or a rotenone-sensitive mechanism as an oxygen sensor. The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify the oxygen-sensing pathway in the oxygen-sensitive sheep adrenal medullary chromaffin cell (AMCC). 2. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to measure K+ currents in dissociated <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> chromaffin cells as well as SK channel currents expressed in the H 4 IIE cell line. 3. Diphenyliodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, had no effect on the hypoxia-evoked closure of K+ channels in primary AMCC, whereas the mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone abolished the hypoxia-evoked response. Both these compounds significantly reduced K+ current amplitude under normoxic conditions. 4. One possible mechanism through which the oxygen sensor may modulate K+ channel activity is by altering the redox state of the cell. In sheep AMCC, altering the redox state by the addition of H 2 O 2 to the extracellular solution increased K+ conductance. 5. The oxygen-sensitive K+ (Ko 2) channels in sheep chromaffin cells are from the SK family and the whole-cell conductance of cells expressing mouse SK 2 or SK 3, but not human SK 1, was increased by H 2 O 2 and decreased by the reducing agent dithiothreitol. 6. These studies show that, in sheep AMCC, Ko 2 channels are modulated via a rotenone-sensitive mechanism and that alteration of the cellular redox state mimics the change produced by alterations in Po 2. In a heterologous expression system, SK 2 and SK 3 channels, the channels that initiate hypoxia-evoked changes in AMCC function, are modulated appropriately by changes in cellular redox state.

40|$|SummaryIn {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the hypothesis that cartilage from defined regions of ovine stifle joints, which were subjected to differing mechanical stresses, contained phenotypically distinct chondrocyte populations. Chondrocyte phenotypes were identified by the relative biosynthesis of the proteoglycans (PGs) aggrecan, biglycan and decorin. Articular cartilage (AC) from adult and neonatal ovine stifle joints were examined. Cells were cultured as both full-depth AC explants and in alginate beads after their isolation from the AC matrix. When chondrocytes from the various topographical regions of <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> knee joints were cultured as explants they demonstrated a consistent difference {{with regard to the}} metabolism of aggrecan and decorin. Significantly, this topographically-dependent phenotypic expression of PGs was preserved when the chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads. In adult joints, chondrocytes from the central region of the tibial plateau not covered by the meniscus, which is subjected to high mechanical loads in-vivo, synthesized less aggrecan but more decorin than cells from regions covered by the meniscus. When chondrocytes from identical AC regions of neonatal ovine joints were cultured as explants, no topographical difference in aggrecan nor decorin metabolism could be detected. The results of this study, in association with the existing literature, lead us to propose that post-natal mechanical loading of AC could select for chondrocyte clones or induce a lasting modulation of chondrocyte phenotypic expression in different joint regions. Such cellular changes could result in the synthesis of PG populations that confer properties to AC most suited to resist the variable mechanical stresses in the different joint regions. This study serves to emphasize the importance of using cartilage from identical joint areas when examining PG metabolism by chondrocytes. Further investigation into the relationship between mechanical loading, regional chondrocyte phenotype selection and the response of these cells to anabolic and catabolic factors may provide important insights into the focal nature of AC degeneration in osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to further {{quantify}} <b>adult</b> <b>ovine</b> ovariectomized bone for new remodeling characteristics to obtain a better understanding of how remodeling is occurring and the effectiveness of this animal model for the study of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a major health concern and animal models to test new treatment options are needed. The ovine model is a good option because the ewes undergo Haversian remodeling, are a large sized animal, and have a similar hormone profile to humans. Ewes, however, do not undergo a natural menopause, so an ovariectomy surgery was conducted in the sheep to simulate the decreased levels in estrogen. Columbia-Rambouillet sheep were used in this study: some that have been ovariectomized as a model for postmenopausal osteoporosis and some that underwent a sham surgery to serve as a control. The sheep were sacrificed 12 months post operatively in the month of August, so the seasonal effects of remodeling were accounted for. The left radius was then processed into microradiographs of 6 regional cortical beams, where the cranial (tensile side) and caudal (compressive side) anatomical sections were analyzed in this study to determine regional differences in remodeling. Previous students’ theses have analyzed the similar samples for basic bone remodeling histology measurements, resulting in some significant seasonal, anatomical, and treatment differences. However, most of the results showed no particular increase in the amount of remodeled area for the ovariectomized sheep compared to the sham sheep, even though an ovariectomy is believed to cause a burst of remodeling in bone due to the decreased levels in estrogen. In this study, a new repeatable method was developed that further examines secondary bone by quantifying the extent to which secondary osteons encroach on previously-existing secondary osteons. Encroached and unencroached secondary osteons were quantified using two different methods: a point count method that measured the percentage of the area the encroached and unencroached secondary osteons inhabited and an osteon count method that measured the number of encroached and unencroached secondary osteons per area. These raw measurements were calculated into 18 parameters and 2 -way repeated measures ANOVAs were run to determine the effects of surgery and anatomical region on each of the bone remodeling parameters. The results found significant effects from estrogen deletion which were different depending on if the bone region was predominately in compression or tension. The ovariectomy surgery caused an increase in remodeling, which was mostly confined on the compressive side to areas that have been previously remodeled, but on the tensile side, bone remodeling expanded into areas that used to be primary bone. The new secondary osteons, as a result of the ovariectomy surgery, were larger than in the control animals. There however, was not an increase in porosity from the ovariectomy surgery, which is one of the main characteristics of osteoporosis. The model could be further studied to determine what sheep are doing that prevents them from losing bone and that knowledge could be greatly beneficial for human treatment plans of postmenopausal osteoporosis...|$|E
