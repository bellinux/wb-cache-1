40|$|Peak load periods put {{stress on}} {{distribution}} systems and often require more costly energy resources to meet demand. Load monitoring and energy management devices can help smooth these peaks by providing information to users about the quantity, end uses, or {{cost of the}} energy they use. They are designed to educate and to instigate behavioral changes that result in lower energy use, especially during peak demand periods. Some of these devices can control energy systems in the house automatically. Several technological innovations are facilitating the rise in residential load monitoring solutions. This paper is a snapshot of a technology in motion. It explains the logistics of getting energy use data into the home, analyzes the features of different low-cost load management devices, and reviews the devices currently available. Although largely focused on devices and services home occupants can purchase and use independently of their co-op, the paper also explores how co-ops might approach residential load monitoring and management devices {{as a solution to}} peak demand challenges. MEASURING AND MANAGING HOME ENERGY USE Today’s residential meters produce far more data points about home energy use than traditional meters, and many energy providers are making it easier for home occupants to download and share their energy use data with third-parties. In response to the growing body of energy data available and the increased need for load management, many third-party green technology firms are developing devices designed to produce both energy and load capacity savings. Co-ops have many options about how to approach load monitoring devices and the third-parties offering the devices. Some energy providers are partnering with third-party com-panies and promoting or subsidizing load monitoring products. Others are facilitating member access to energy data, but stop there—leaving the decision to purchase a load monitoring device or service up to members. And, many energy providers <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>this</b> market develop and waiting to take action.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 70 - 71). The {{purpose of}} this research is {{to examine the relationship between}} strategic planning and corporate results in volatile environments such as the Middle East and in particular the broadcasting industry. Broadcasting is known for being affected by many exogenous factors such as political and economical. We analyzed the major components of the strategic planning: Budget, Resources and Duration. We noticed a tight relationship between the strategic planning components and corporate results. The efficiency of the strategic planning would vary with the modification of these components. In addition to that we noticed a clear relationship between corporate results and channels typologies whereas major general entertainment channels are capturing the biggest share of the total advertising revenues. The budget allocated to the strategic plan represents a share of the total revenues dedicated to the expenditrrres of the planning team. We divided the budget into sections to identify the part that would be more sensitive to the channels output. Resources allocated represent the number of employee working in the strategy unit. The total number will vary from one company to another. The duration of the strategic plan represent the period covered by this plan. It could vary from one to five years according to the main objectives of the company. On the other hand, channels typologies represent the programming strategy of the channel. The focus was on channels with general entertainment as main programs versus channels with education as mam content. We analyzed the effect of each of these components on the channels results that would include: share of audience, share of advertising revenues and reach. Share of audience (SOA) would represent the number of Arabic Viewers that <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>this</b> channel. It is computed as a percentage from the total population. Share of advertising revenues represents the shares that the channel is capturing from the total advertising spend in the broadcast industry. Finally, reach represents the transmission coverage of the channel. 1 bound copy: ii, 78 leaves; ill. (some col.); 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} project {{indicated by the}} paper is discussed on some movies. These movies are from result of workshop CHITA 08 which is a researching and didactical collaboration in service design and design for social innovation between School of Design, Jiangnan University (JU) and INDACO department, Politecnico di Milano (Polimi). Six groups of 27 students created some produced movies in the workshop. They generated creative communication with context in China for their social initiative. In the stage of designer process, movie is a useful tool that is explicit from intangible creation of social initiative to be tangible media. In another stage of audience communication, movie also connects contents between sustainability and local background. These contents effect perception and understandability. 6 Movies, which were the product of CHITA 08, were shown to 20 design students in Milan. There are some discussions about these movies, are expressed diversely between two groups. The group of 10 Chinese designers can analysis the solutions, which respond the problematic background of China differently from the solution of 10 international designers. Some qualities of CHITA 08 video communicate the scenario building of sustainable initiative. It is the objective of design the structure of Scenario building movie. This project focuses to investigate how these movies with local context background respond audience. With different local experience, designers who have watched the movies provide their top-up creativities and visions. The same experience of Chinese hometown can translate many components in Video to Chinese designers, while the new experience from there can inspire international designers to increase initiative for their own local. The conclusion demonstrates that: 1) Local experience of audience is importance to perception. It affects wherever the media is shown. 2) Local context is proficient content to communicate the initiative idea in variety sensibilities. 3) Movie is designed with local context, is an alternative movie for consistent communication to diffuse the sustainable ideas and social creativities to people. 4) Local context in movie is a potential tool to support the vision of sustainable social {{in the background of}} local possibility. Movies with local context have been considered as the potential-supported scenario to explain relationship between problematic background, initiative solution and vision of sustainable society. Audience can generate the surrounding of course and result of local problematic while they <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>this</b> kind of movie. This {{research project}} is purpose to discover the methods of narration and creation to sustainable society for local context-based movie communication...|$|E
