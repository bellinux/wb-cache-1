The Manufacturing sector in the UK is of interest to me due to the declining number of output in this sector (CBI report 2006). A report by Julian <b>Smith</b> (<b>n.</b> <b>d)</b> indicates {{that the level of}} competitiveness in global markets has become increasingly hard for the UK manufacturing industry to maintain over the last decade. As a result, the level of profitability for shareholders and for capital reinvestment could be affected. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to empirically examine whether FDI affects the profitability of domestic firms, using data from the UK manufacturing sector. I have chosen to study on this topic because I would like to understand how foreign direct investments affect domestic firms especially with regards to profitability...|$|R
40|$|Valley of {{highland}} central Mexico (fig. 1), Calixtlahuaca is {{a particularly}} important site for studying Postclassic-period Mesoamerican urbanism. It {{is one of the}} very few Aztec-period urban sites where both monumental architecture and extensive residential districts are preserved today. Although the site’s public architecture and stone sculpture are closely related to cities in the Aztec urban tradition, its urban layout is radically different from those cities (<b>Smith</b> <b>n.</b> <b>d.).</b> Most of the settlement at Calixtlahuaca occurs on the slopes of Cerro Tenismo, a small relict volcano (fig. 2). The public architecture is scattered between the valley floor and the summit of the hill. The largest and best known building, Structure 3 (fig. 3), is a circular temple whose early excavation yielded a life-sized stone sculpture of Ehecatl, the Aztec god of wind. In addition to the site’s public architecture, most the slopes of Cerro Tenismo were (and still are) covered with stone terraces, many of which have very dense surface artifact concentrations. José García Payón excavated and restored Calixtlahuaca’s public architecture over severa...|$|R

Some economic historians have argued that <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|R

40|$|About the book: For {{several years}} now, <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith's</b> Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) has been {{attracting}} increasing attention. Smith is concerned {{not only with}} the question of rational grounds for moral action, but also and above all with moral feelings and a corresponding moral education. Thus his theory offers a promising alternative to the theories of David Hume and Immanuel Kant, which have often been cited in past debates. Working from the moral philosophy of <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith,</b> who is known principally as a political economist, it is possible to develop a many-facetted contribution to present-day debates (liberalism, business ethics). This volume, with papers by renowned moral philosophers and <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> scholars, documents the various perspectives from which <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith's</b> moral philosophy is of particular interest today...|$|R
