However, the independence <b>of</b> <b>verifiers</b> such as checkers, auditors, and Environmental Control Officers, may be influenced by various factors that may lead to a conflict of interest between role-players in EIA and EIA followup. Identifying these factors is, therefore, important. A total of 18 factors were identified by analysing literature from established verification professions and data derived within the South African context by means of interviews and workshops dedicated to clarifying independence <b>of</b> <b>verifiers.</b> The factors were divided into five categories: financial; commercial; professional; personal; and other.
