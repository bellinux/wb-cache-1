The Rado graph is uniquely defined, among countable graphs, by an extension property that guarantees the correctness of this algorithm: no matter which vertices have already been chosen to form part of the induced subgraph, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> what pattern of adjacencies is needed to extend the subgraph by one more vertex, there will always exist another vertex with that pattern of adjacencies that the greedy algorithm can choose.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} been more skeptical {{of the concept of}} {{identifying}} the dreamer of the book's narrative. Clive Hart argues that [...] "hatever our conclusions about the identity of the dreamer, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how many varied caricatures of him we may find projected into the dream, it is clear that he must always be considered as essentially external to the book, and should be left there. Speculation about the 'real person' behind the guises of the dream-surrogates or about the function of the dream in relation to the unresolved stresses of this hypothetical mind is fruitless, for the tensions and psychological problems in Finnegans Wake concern the dream-figures living within the book itself." ...|$|E

He lost the election and later said, [...] "People knew me only as a baseball player. They didn't think I qualified as a government official <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> what I did I couldn't change my image...What I learned, {{was that it was}} going to be hard for me to disengage myself from my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after my playing days were over."

Early this week he hit upon the successful plan, and now the many visitors who attend his classes are spectators of thrilling love scenes.

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how many times I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E

Clover Hope of The Village Voice described it as [...] "pure grown-man bidness" [...] and [...] "a little too sitting-on-the-dock-of-the-bay for Chris Breezy–trained earbuds". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine scored Here I Stand two-and-a-half stars out of five, and considered the music [...] "almost always just one notch above mediocrity." [...] The Observer Steve Yates panned the album as [...] "gloop [...] wades through". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau cited the songs [...] "Trading Places" [...] and [...] "Best Thing" [...] as [...] "choice cuts", indicating [...] "good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "tension, not bliss, creates the album's best songs", referring to [...] "Moving Mountains", [...] "His Mistakes", [...] "Appetite" [...] and [...] "What's a Man To Do".
