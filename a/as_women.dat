5|$|Big Girls Don't Cry: The Election that Changed Everything for American Women is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by American {{journalist}} Rebecca Traister {{and published by}} Free Press. The book discusses women's contributions to and experiences of the 2008 United States presidential election. Traister places particular focus on four main political figuresHillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, Michelle Obama and Elizabeth Edwardsas well <b>as</b> <b>women</b> in the media, including Katie Couric, Rachel Maddow, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. She also describes her personal experience of the electoral campaign and her shift from supporting John Edwards to Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such <b>as</b> <b>women,</b> children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. <b>As</b> <b>women</b> earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{the protests}} became an armed {{rebellion}}. The first {{shots were fired}} at the Oliver Miller Homestead in present-day South Park Township, Pennsylvania, about ten miles south of Pittsburgh. As word of the rebellion spread across the frontier, {{a whole series of}} loosely organized resistance measures were taken, including robbing the mail, stopping court proceedings, and the threat of an assault on Pittsburgh. One group disguised <b>as</b> <b>women</b> assaulted a tax collector, cropped his hair, coated him with tar and feathers, and stole his horse. Another group bombarded the estate of the tax collector John Neville, a friend of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such <b>as</b> <b>women</b> playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of December 13, 1977, a {{dormitory}} fire killed ten female residents of Aquinas Hall. Meanwhile, the demographics of the student body continued to change, <b>as</b> <b>women</b> outnumbered men in incoming classes and non-Rhode Island students soon outnumbered in-state students. In 1984, Peterson also opened St. Thomas Aquinas Priory at the entrance of campus to accommodate the growing number of Dominican brethren living on campus.|$|E

5|$|Lesbians in Western {{cultures}} in particular often classify themselves {{as having an}} identity that defines their individual sexuality, {{as well as their}} membership to a group that shares common traits. Women in many cultures throughout history have had sexual relations with other women, but they rarely were designated as {{part of a group of}} people based on who they had physical relations with. <b>As</b> <b>women</b> have generally been political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity.|$|E
5|$|Maternal age {{affects the}} chances of having a {{pregnancy}} with Down syndrome. At age 20, the chance is one in 1441; at age 30, it is one in 959; at age 40, it is one in 84; and at age 50 it is one in 44. Although the probability increases with maternal age, 70% of children with Down syndrome are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people have more children. The father's older age is also a risk factor in women older than 35, but not in women younger than 35, and may partly explain the increase in risk <b>as</b> <b>women</b> age.|$|E
5|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} {{society and the}} lives of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority. However, the position of women varied considerably according to various factors, including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, <b>as</b> <b>women</b> typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E

5|$|Portrayals of lesbians in {{the media}} suggest that society at large has been {{simultaneously}} intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles, and fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families, friends, and others {{as a result of}} homophobia. <b>As</b> <b>women,</b> they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, prejudice, and minority stress. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in open.|$|E
5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. <b>As</b> <b>women</b> found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E

5|$|The Bloomer {{became a}} fashion fad during the {{following}} months, <b>as</b> <b>women</b> from Toledo to New York City and Lowell, Massachusetts, held reform-dress social events and festivals. Supporters gathered signatures to a “Declaration of Independence from the Despotism of Parisian Fashion” and organized dress-reform societies. A few Garrisonian supporters of women’s rights took prominent part in these activities, and one offered silk to any of his friends who would {{make it into a}} short skirt and trousers for a public dress.

5|$|The first {{industrial}} canal in Wales {{was built}} in 1768 to convey coal from the Gwendraeth Valley to the coast, and the following year, the earliest tramroad bridge was on the tramroad built alongside the canal. During the Napoleonic Wars (1799–1815) there was increased demand for coal, iron and agricultural goods, and the county prospered. The landscape changed as much woodland was cleared {{to make way for}} more food production, and mills, power stations, mines and factories sprang up between Llanelli and Pembrey. Carmarthenshire was at the centre of the Rebecca Riots around 1840, when local farmers and agricultural workers dressed <b>as</b> <b>women</b> and rebelled against higher taxes and tolls.|$|E
5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. <b>As</b> <b>women</b> mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
