50|$|One more {{alternative}} to explosive deflection {{is to move}} the asteroid slowly over a time. Tiny constant thrust accumulates to deviate an object sufficiently from its predicted course. Edward T. Lu and Stanley G. Love have proposed using a large heavy unmanned spacecraft hovering over an asteroid to gravitationally pull the latter into a non-threatening orbit. The spacecraft and the asteroid mutually attract one another. If the spacecraft counters the force towards the asteroid by, e.g., an ion thruster, the net effect is that the asteroid is accelerated towards the spacecraft and thus slightly deflected from its orbit. While slow, this method {{has the advantage of}} working irrespective of the asteroid composition or spin rate - rubble pile asteroids would be difficult to deflect by means of nuclear detonations while <b>a</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>device</b> would be hard or inefficient to mount on a fast rotating asteroid. A gravity tractor would likely have to spend several years beside the asteroid to be effective.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of vision and lumbar posture on trunk neuromuscular control. Torso perturbations were applied with <b>a</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>device</b> while the subjects were restrained at the pelvis in a kneeling-seated position. Torso kinematics and the muscle activity of the lumbar part of the M. Longissimus were recorded for 14 healthy subjects. Four conditions were included: a flexion, extension and neutral lumbar posture with eyes closed and the neutral posture with eyes open. Frequency response functions of the admittance and reflexes showed that there was no significant difference between the eyes open and eyes closed conditions, thereby confirming that vision does not play a role in the stabilization of the trunk during small-amplitude trunk perturbations. In contrast, manipulating posture did lead to significant differences. In particular, the flexed condition led to a lower admittance and lower reflex contribution compared to the neutral condition. Furthermore, the muscle pre-activation (prior to the onset of the perturbation) was significantly lower in the flexed posture compared to neutral. This confirms that flexing the lumbar spine increases the passive tissue stiffness and decreases the contribution of reflex activity to trunk control...|$|R

50|$|Regardless of {{how long}} the {{traveler}} spends in his destination, for unexplained reasons once he returns to his own time stream (by use of <b>a</b> <b>push</b> button <b>device</b> commonly concealed in a belt buckle) exactly 11 minutes will have passed. Changes made {{at one point in}} time will affect all future events stemming from that timeline; however only the traveler himself will be aware that anything has changed, since his own past was not altered. The Nazis pursuing Stefan and Laura lose them at several points while they are on the run. Rather than continue their physical pursuit, they return to the past, then go farther ahead in the future to seek credit card receipts and motel information to determine where the pair will flee to, and go to that time to set an ambush. They could not do this if they had remained after pursuit due to the next aspect.|$|R

50|$|A {{ureteric}} {{balloon catheter}} is a balloon catheter intended for treating strictures of the ureter. In {{fact it is}} a double J stent on which a balloon is mounted. It is connected to <b>a</b> delivery <b>device</b> (<b>pusher)</b> to introduce it from the bladder into the ureter.The system comprises a non-return valve <b>device,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>pusher</b> with <b>a</b> stylet and two ports.The sideport is for injecting contrast agent to inflate the balloon, while the straight port is for the guidewire. The catheter has a relatively large-diameter central lumen and a shaft of 2 mm (6 Fr.). The balloon is in two sections: a long narrow section or shaft and a larger cranial bulb. The larger cranial bulb prevents distal migration, while the longer narrow section maintains the increased diameter of a predilated stricture in the ureter section.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} two novel travel aids for blind pedestrians. The two computerized devices {{are based on}} advanced mobile robotics obstacle avoidance technologies. The first aid – the NavBelt – is worn by the user like a belt and is equipped {{with an array of}} ultrasonic sensors. It provides, via a set of stereo earphones, acoustic signals that guide the user around obstacles, or “displays ” a virtual acoustic panoramic image of the traveler’s surroundings. One limitation of the NavBelt is that it is exceedingly difficult for the user to comprehend the guidance signals in time to allow fast walking. A newer device, called GuideCane effectively overcomes this problem. The GuideCane uses the same mobile robotics technology as the NavBelt but it is <b>a</b> wheeled <b>device</b> <b>pushed</b> ahead of the user via an attached cane. When the GuideCane detects an obstacle it steers around it. The user immediately feels this steering action and can follow the GuideCane’s new path easily and without any conscious effort. This article describes the two devices, including the mechanical, electronic, and software components, user-machine interface, and some experimental results. ...|$|R
