5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E

5|$|Despite having {{previously}} {{shown little}} inclination toward politics, Brown surprised political observers by declaring his candidacy {{for governor in}} 1979. With the state and nation facing difficult economic times, Brown promised to run the state government like a business. A strong media campaign funded by his personal fortune allowed him to win the Democratic primary <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> defeat former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the general election. Because he owed few favors to established political leaders, he appointed many successful businesspeople to state posts instead of making political appointments.

During his tenure, Brown exerted less influence over the legislature than previous governors and was frequently absent from the state, leaving lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor {{for more than one}} quarter of his term. He briefly considered a run for the U.S. Senate after his gubernatorial term, but withdrew from the race after only three weeks, citing health issues.
