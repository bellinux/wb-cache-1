Only 500 copies of the full Book of Mormon translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive {{and even the most}} devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, <b>advertisements</b> <b>for</b> the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E

5|$|As {{the summer}} of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 {{remained}} far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July.

Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90 {{but by the end of}} the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.|$|E
