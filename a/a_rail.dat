5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles.

5|$|After {{years of}} feuding, the Western Railroad {{joined with the}} Boston and Worcester Railroad in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B). The Housatonic Railroad was {{acquired}} by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH) as its Berkshire Division in 1892, with most service thus running from Danbury rather than Bridgeport. In 1900, the New York Central Railroad (NYC) leased the B, though the latter retained its independent identity for decades after. The B operated <b>a</b> <b>rail</b> yard and roundhouse just north of Union Station.|$|E

After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by <b>a</b> <b>rail</b> bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E
