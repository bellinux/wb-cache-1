Bootstrapping or a redesign of the circuit may alleviate this when it is caused by difficulties in driving emitter follower output stages.|$|E

The {{basis of the}} method {{is the use of}} an hybrid optical {{bistable}} device with nematic liquid-crystals, similar to the one previously reported by us. A sample of the input light constrols, by an asymmetrical electronic comparator, a 1 x 2 electro-optical total switch. The output pulses are reshaped and maintain the same polarization properties as the input light. From triangular input light signals, symmetriacl and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>output</b> pulses have been obtained. The minimum pulse width achieved was 0. 1 msec. A representation of the output versus input light signals gives an hysteresys cycle in the asymmetrical case...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} {{solution}} for modern adjustable speed drives (ASD) {{is the use}} of induction motors (IM) fed by voltage-source inverters (VSI). The inverter generates a pulsewidth modulated (PWM) voltage, with dv/dt values of about 6 kV/us or even more. In three-leg inverters for three-phase applications the occurrence of common-mode voltage is inherent due to <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>output</b> pulses. As a result, for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) reasons, in most applications shielded cables are used between the inverter and the motor, implying high installation costs. The present paper discusses the use of cheaper, unshielded cables from an EMC point-of-view. A new method for measuring electromagnetic interference (EMI) from unshielded cables is proposed and measurement results are presented. The level of EMI is evaluated in different situations: without an output filter, with a classical LC output filter and with an advanced output filter with dc link feedback. It is concluded that, from an EMC point of view, unshielded cables can give very good performance provided that a common-mode (CM) output filter is used...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a tightly}} {{regulated}} triple <b>output</b> <b>asymmetrical</b> half bridge flyback (ASHF) converter is proposed. In order to regulate all output voltages, {{pulse frequency modulation}} (PFM), pulse width modulation (PWM) and phase delay (PD) are used simultaneously. In comparison with the conventional PWM-PD method, the interactions among the control variables are minimized and the operating range is increased. By the utilization of a multi winding transformer, the auxiliary transformer and the blocking capacitor are eliminated and the size and cost of the proposed converter is reduced. The operation principle of the converter is explained and the modes of operation are investigated. Based on the results, the steady state characteristics of the converter are explored. A 24 V/ 10 A, 12 V/ 5 A, 5 V/ 10 A hardware prototype is built and tested to verify the analysis results and the voltage regulation of the triple outputs of the proposed converter. Key Words: Asymmetrical half bridge flyback, PFM-PWM-PD method, Triple outputs I...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{dissipation}} on the lateral {{surface of the}} cyclone chamber working volume with <b>asymmetrical</b> input and <b>output</b> of gases is considered in the present paper {{in contrast to the}} previously executed [1 – 10]. The relative values of input gas flow and the relative diameters of the outlet are different in each of the halves of the working volume. The {{heat dissipation}} by convection to the swirling airflow was studied by the method of variation of the aggregate state of the heating agent – water vapor slightly superheated (at 2 – 3 °С) condensation. Collecting the condensate produced from the work site through a water lock, providing maintaining of constant pressure in the calorimeter. The quantity of heat transmitted during the experiment was determined by the amount of collected condensate. In the experiments on the camera with two-sided asymmetric output relative gas outlet diameter {{on one side of the}} camera varied Relative diameter of the outlet on the other hand remained constant. In the experiences on the camera with the bilateral asymmetrical conditions for the introduction of gases the asymmetry of the introduction of flow was created due to a change in the relative entrance area whoo remained constant. Local heat transfer coefficient was determined for different values dimensionless longitudinal coordinate coinciding with the axis of the chamber, directed toward the outlet, measured from the middle section of the working volume.

40|$|SummaryAn {{efficient}} {{strategy to}} explore the environment for available resources involves the execution of random walks where straight line locomotion alternates with changes of direction. This strategy is highly conserved in the animal kingdom, from zooplankton to human hunter-gatherers [1 – 8]. Drosophila larvae execute a routine of this kind, performing straight line crawling interrupted at intervals by pause turns that halt crawling and redirect the trajectory of movement [9 – 11]. The execution of this routine depends solely on the activity of networks located in the thoracic and abdominal segments of the nervous system, while descending input from the brain serves to modify it in a context-dependent fashion [9]. I used a genetic method to investigate the location and function of the circuitry required for the different elements of exploratory crawling. By using the Slit-Robo axon guidance pathway to target neuronal midline crossing defects selectively to particular regions of the thoracic and abdominal networks, it has been possible to define at least three functions required {{for the performance of}} the exploratory routine: (1) symmetrical outputs in thoracic and abdominal segments that generate the crawls; (2) <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>output</b> that is uniquely initiated in the thoracic segments and generates the turns; and (3) an intermittent interruption to crawling that determines the time-dependent transition between crawls and turns...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{analysis}} of ATM switches {{has been an}} active research topic in these recent years. Numerous models have been proposed throughout the world. Most of these models are developed for analyzing specific ATM switches with specific kinds of incoming traffic. The resultant models are usually highly dependent {{on the structure of}} the switches. This restrict the usage of these models to other switches with different structures. In addition most of these models are built with two unrealistic assumptions: the incoming traffic has random destinations {{and the size of the}} switch tends to infinity. In this research an analytical model for the performance {{analysis of}} ATM switches is developed to overcome the above problems. This model can be applied to a large class of ATM switches called the input-output buffering ATM switches. We consider general incoming traffic with <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>output</b> loading and correlated destinations which is most common in ATM networks. Our model is constructed by studying the behavior of the switch, i. e., blocking in the switch fabric and the correlation of incoming traffic. The switch fabric is then modeled as a closed queueing network. By changing the characteristics of this closed queueing network, different types of switches can be studied. This model gives accurate results for the maximum throughput, the cell loss probability and the mean response time under different traffic conditions...|$|E
40|$|An {{emerging}} {{topic in}} behavioural biology and psychology is brain lateralization. E. g. the asymmetrical {{organization of the}} brain in the left right plain. At first, this phenomenon was described only in humans, and was {{regarded as one of}} the extraordinary features of our „superior‟ brain. Later, it was discovered that lateralization exists in many animal species. This asymmetrical organization of the brain results in <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>output</b> called behaviour. The most common example of this in humans is handedness. Asymmetry is described in more and more behaviours, but its origin remains debated. Are they simply „nature‟; hard-coded in our DNA? Or are they „nurture‟ and caused by environmental conditions or experience? The subject of this thesis is asymmetries in visual perception in humans. It is easy to think we perceive the world in an unbiased way. But with an asymmetric brain, it is more likely that we also have asymmetrical perception. This study tries to answer some important questions concerning visual perception. Which asymmetries in visual perception have been found in the literature, and what is the origin of these asymmetries? I hypothesized that, as in most nature vs. nurture debates, the truth lies in the middle. Both nature and nurture have an effect on asymmetries in visual perception. This thesis will first discuss the existing literature before presenting the results of a small study in comic books. Comic books provide a large quantity of pictures in which direction is displayed, making them a great subject of observational study. ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} modelling, analysis, design {{and control of}} 4 th -order LCLC {{resonant}} power converters. Both voltage-output and current-output variants, are considered. Key research outcomes are the derivation of new frequency- and time-domain models of the converters, based on normalised component ratios, and including the effects that parasitic elements have on circuit behaviour, and {{a detailed account of}} multi-resonant characteristics; extensions to the use of cyclicmode modelling methods for application to LCLC converters, to provide rapid steady-state analysis, thereby facilitating the use of the derived methodologies as part of an interactive design tool; the formulation of analytical methods to predict the electrical stresses on tank components-an important consideration when designing resonant converters, as they are often higher than for hard-switched converter counterparts; the characterisation of both continuous and discontinuous modes of operation and the boundary conditions that separate them; and a substantial treatment of the modelling, analysis and design of LCLC converters that can provide multiple regulated outputs by the integrated control of both excitation frequency and pulse-width-modulation. The proposed methodologies are employed, for validation purposes, in the realisation of two proof-of concept demonstrator converters. The first, to satisfy the requirements for delivering 65 V (rms) to an electrode-less, SW, fluorescent lamp, to improve energy efficiency and lifetime, and operating at a nominal frequency of 2. 65 MHz, is used to demonstrate capacitively-coupled operation through the lamp tube, thereby mitigating the normally detrimental effects of excitation via the electrodes. The second prototype considers the realization of an LCLC resonant power supply that can provide multiple regulated outputs without the need for post-regulation circuitry. The two outputs of the supply are independently, closed-loop regulated, to provide <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>output</b> voltage distributions, using a combination of frequency- and duty-control. Although, an analysis of the supply shows that the behaviour is extremely complex, due, in particular, to the highly non-linear interaction between the mUltiple outputs and parasitic inductances, and rectifier, an analysis to provide optimum performance characteristics, is proposed. Moreover, a PICIFPGA-based digital controller is developed that allows control of the transient performance of both outputs under start-up and steady-state conditions...|$|E
40|$|First, a {{frequency}} synthesizer for IEEE 802. 15. 4 / ZigBee transceiver applications that employs dynamic True Single Phase Clocking (TSPC) circuits in its frequency dividers is presented {{and through the}} analysis and measurement results of this synthesizer, the need for low power circuit techniques in frequency dividers is discussed. Next, Differential Cascode Voltage-Switch-Logic (DCVSL) based delay cells are explored for implementing radio-frequency (RF) frequency dividers of low power frequency synthesizers. DCVSL ip- ops offer small input and clock capacitance which makes the power consumption of these circuits and their driving stages, very low. We perform a delay analysis of DCVSL circuits and propose a closed-form delay model that predicts the speed of DCVSL circuits with 8 percent worst case accuracy. The proposed delay model also demonstrates that DCVSL circuits suffer from a large low-to-high propagation delay (PLH) which limits their speed and results in <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>output</b> waveforms. Our proposed enhanced DCVSL, which we call DCVSL-R, solves this delay bottleneck, reducing PLH and achieving faster operation. We implement two ring-oscillator-based voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) in 0. 13 mu m technology with DCVSL and DCVSL-R delay cells. In measurements, for the same oscillation frequency (2. 4 GHz) and same phase noise (- 113 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz), DCVSL-R VCO consumes 30 percent less power than the DCVSL VCO. We also use the proposed DCVSL-R circuit to implement the 2. 4 GHz dual-modulus prescaler of a low power frequency synthesizer in 0. 18 mu m technology. In measurements, the synthesizer exhibits - 135 dBc/Hz phase noise at 10 MHz offset and 58 mu m settling time with 8. 3 mW power consumption, only 1. 07 mWof which is consumed by the dual modulus prescaler and the buffer that drives it. When compared to other dual modulus prescalers with similar division ratios and operating frequencies in literature, DCVSL-R dual modulus prescaler demonstrates the lowest power consumption. An all digital phase locked loop (ADPLL) that operates {{for a wide range}} of frequencies to serve as a multi-protocol compatible PLL for microprocessor and serial link applications, is presented. The proposed ADPLL is truly digital and is implemented in a standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology without any analog/RF or non-scalable components. It addresses the challenges that come along with continuous wide range of operation such as stability and phase frequency detection for a large frequency error range. A proposed multi-bit bidirectional smart shifter serves as the digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) control and tunes the DCO frequency by turning on/off inverter units in a large row/column matrix that constitute the ring oscillator. The smart shifter block is completely digital, consisting of standard cell logic gates, and is capable of tracking the row/column unit availability of the DCO and shifting multiple bits per single update cycle. This enables fast frequency acquisition times without necessitating dual loop fi lter or gear shifting mechanisms. The proposed ADPLL loop architecture does not employ costly, cumbersome DACs or binary to thermometer converters and minimizes loop filter and DCO control complexity. The wide range ADPLL is implemented in 90 nm digital CMOS technology and has a 9 -bit TDC, the output of which is processed by a 10 -bit digital loop filter and a 5 -bit smart shifter. In measurements, the synthesizer achieves 2. 5 GHz- 7. 3 GHz operation while consuming 10 mW/GHz power, with an active area of 0. 23 mm 2...|$|E
