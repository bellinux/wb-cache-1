In the absence of external stimulation, the activity of the cochlear amplifier increases, leading to the production of sound. Several lines of evidence suggest that, in mammals, outer hair cells are the elements that enhance cochlear sensitivity and frequency selectivity and hence act as the energy sources for amplification. One theory is that they act to increase the discriminability of signal variations in continuous noise by lowering the masking effect of its cochlear ampliﬁcation.|$|E

40|$|Non-linear (NL) ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for fine grained and highly organic soils using ground response analysis for two profiles in the Kushiro area of Hokkaido, Japan. The NL ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> will support a broader research effort to develop fragility functions for levees resting on organic soils in Hokkaido. The ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> were developed using one-dimensional (1 D) NL ground response simulations in DEEPSOIL (Hashash et al. 2016) based on a suite of earthquake ground motions compiled by Baker (Baker et al. 2011). Corrections to the small-strain Darendeli (2001) modulus reduction curve for fine grained soil recommended by Yee et al. (2013) were used to realistically represent the large-strain portion of backbone curves by asymptotically approaching the shear strength at large strains. The GQ/H material model (Groholski, 2016) in DEEPSOIL was utilized to preserve the input undrained shear strength while still providing the ability to represent small-strain stiffness nonlinearity. The resulting ground motion amplification values, defined as the spectral acceleration of the surface motion divided by the spectral acceleration of the input outcrop motion, was regressed using the functional form for NL site ground motion amplification by Stewart et al. (2014). Ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> for organic soils in the Sacramento / San Joaquin Delta were previously developed by Kishida, et al. (2006 and 2009 a) using 1 D equivalent-linear (EL) ground response analysis (GRA) that were subsequently regressed to derive ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions.</b> These simulations utilized linear and nonlinear regression models for dynamic properties of highly organic soils through ongoing research on this topic that was ultimately concluded by Kishida et al. (2009 b). However, {{it is not clear whether}} these ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> are applicable to the Hokkaido system due to differences in the Peat layers in Hokkaido compared with the Delta, nor is it clear the extent to which the equivalent linear assumption influenced the ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions.</b> This thesis also presents a brief comparison between the NL ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> developed herein and the EL ground motion <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> for highly organic soils presented by Kishida et al.

The H=Z ratios determined from the GIT results compare well with H=V ratios computed directly from the S-wave window of the accelerograms (Lermo and Chávez-García, 1993). The basic assumption for the determination of site effects from H=V ratios is that the vertical component is not or only little affected by site effects. For Vrancea earthquakes, this assumption is incorrect; consequently, site effects should not be estimated from H=V ratios.

It is an example of LSR analysis applied to ancient and archaeological sites located in alluvial valleys with some methodological inferences for the design of infrastructure and urban planning. Since the ancient road does not cross the alluvial valley (namely the Fosso di Vallerano Valley) normal to its sides, {{it was not possible to}} directly perform 2 D numerical modelling to evaluate the LSR along the road route. Therefore, outputs of 2 D numerical models obtained along three cross sections that were normal oriented respect to the valley were projected along the route of the Via Laurentina within a reliable buffer attributed according to an available high-resolution geological model of the local subsoil. The modelled <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> consider physical effects due to both the 2 D shape of the valley and the heterogeneities of the alluvial deposits.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} for generating broadband (0 - 10 Hz) ground motion time histories for moderate and larger crustal earthquakes. Our hybrid technique combines a stochastic approach at high frequencies with a deterministic approach at low frequencies. The broadband response is obtained by summing the separate {{responses in the}} time domain using matched filters centered at 1 Hz. We use a kinematic description of fault rupture, incorporating spatial heterogeneity in slip, rupture velocity and rise time by discretizing an extended finite-fault {{into a number of}} smaller subfaults. The stochastic approach sums the response for each subfault assuming a random phase, an omega-squared source spectrum and generic ray-path Green's functions. Gross impedance effects are incorporated using quarter wavelength theory to bring the response to a reference baserock velocity level. The deterministic approach sums the response for many point sources distributed across each subfault. Wave propagation at frequencies below 1 Hz is modeled using a 3 D viscoelastic finite difference algorithm with the minimum shear wave velocity set between 600 and 1000 m/s, depending on the scope and complexity of the velocity structure. To account for site-specific geologic conditions, short- and mid-period empirical amplification factors provided by Borcherdt [1] are used to develop frequency-dependent non-linear site response <b>functions.</b> The <b>amplification</b> <b>functions</b> are applied to the stochastic and deterministic responses separately since these may have different (computational) reference site velocities.

We have found that canonical Wg signaling in Drosophila involves distinct initiation and amplification steps, both of which require Arrow/LRP. Expressing a chimeric Frizzled 2 -Arrow protein in flies that lack endogenous Wg or Arrow showed that this construct functions as an activated Wg receptor but is deficient in signal amplification. In contrast, a chimeric Arrow protein containing the dimerization domain of Torso acted as a potent amplifier of Wg signaling but could not initiate Wg signaling on its own. The two chimeric proteins synergized, so that their co-expression largely reconstituted the signaling levels achieved by expressing Wg itself.
