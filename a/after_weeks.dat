40|$|The {{hormonal}} {{response of}} 32 older men (70 – 80 years) to {{a bout of}} sub-maximum aerobic exercise was examined before, <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> of resistance or aerobic training and again <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> of detraining. Blood samples were obtained at rest and immediately post sub-maximum exercise (30 min @ 70 % VO 2 max) to determine the concentrations of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), testosterone (Test), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and the calculation of free testosterone (FT). Both training groups had significant increases in leg strength and VO 2 max <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> training but leg strength and VO 2 max returned to pre-training levels in the aerobic training and resistance training groups, respectively. During the 20 week study there was no change in resting concentrations of any hormones among the three groups. There was no increase in GH, IGF- 1 or SHBG immediately post sub-maximum exercise {{in any of the}} groups before training, <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> training or <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> detraining. Testosterone and FT increased immediately post sub-maximum exercise within all groups before training, <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> training and <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> detraining with the increase in Test and FT higher <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> of resistance training compared to before training and <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> detraining within the resistance training group.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare mothers' and teachers' perceptions of the intellectual developmental level of preschool special education students after children were in a program for six <b>weeks</b> and again <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Mothers' and teachers' perceptions were also compared to test scores both <b>after</b> six <b>weeks</b> and <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Demographic variables considered for each hypothesis were child's age, sex, and sibling position, and mother's education, employment, and marital status. Perceptions were considered interview scores from the Developmental Profile II and test scores were those obtained from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [...] Revised. The data were analyzed by correlated t tests with p <. 05 to reject the null hypotheses. Mothers rated their children significantly higher than teachers rated them and higher than test scores both <b>after</b> six <b>weeks</b> and <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Teachers' perceptions <b>after</b> six <b>weeks</b> did not differ from their perceptions <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> or from test scores except for children 55 months and older, who had higher test scores than teacher ratings <b>after</b> six <b>weeks.</b> Boys were rated significantly higher by their mothers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> six <b>weeks.</b> Children from two-parent families were rated significantly higher by mothers than by teachers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> six <b>weeks.</b> High school educated mothers rated children sigificantly higher except in the first comparison to the test scores. Oldest children were rated higher by mothers than by teachers, and in the second comparison between mothers' scores and test scores. Children 54 months and younger were rated higher by their mothers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> six <b>weeks,</b> and in both comparisons of mothers' scores to test scores. Unemployed mothers rated their children higher <b>after</b> six <b>weeks</b> than teachers rated them, and employed mothers rated children higher <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than they did <b>after</b> six <b>weeks.</b> The author believes that further research, focusing on the relationships between parents' and teachers' perceptions is needed to provide guidance for increased cooperation between home in meeting the needs of young special education students...|$|R
5|$|On May 5, 1974 {{author and}} {{journalist}} Arthur Koestler published {{a letter from}} reader Nigel Parker in The Sunday Times of a striking coincidence between a scene in Poe's novel and an actual event that happened decades later: In 1884, the yacht Mignonette sank, with four men cast adrift. <b>After</b> <b>weeks</b> without food, they decided {{that one of them}} should be sacrificed as food for the other three, just as in Poe's novel. The loser was a young cabin boy named Richard Parker, coincidentally the same name as Poe's fictional character. Parker's shipmates, Tom Dudley and Edwin Stephens, were later tried for murder in a precedent-setting common law trial, the renowned R v Dudley and Stephens.|$|E

5|$|Calling {{themselves}} T2 Productions, James and co-producers Stephanie Austin and B.J.

Adam Greenberg, who worked on The Terminator and Ghost (1990), became director of photography, while Joseph Nemec III, {{who had worked with}} Cameron on The Abyss, was tasked with production design. The team conducted a national search for a steel mill suitable for the film's climax, eventually selecting a dormant mill in Fontana, California, <b>after</b> <b>weeks</b> of negotiations. Locating a potential Cyberdyne building was more difficult, as the site was to host numerous stunts, shootouts, and explosions. An industrial park in Fremont, California, was eventually rented {{for the duration of the}} film's production. Cameron and William Wisher completed the 140-page screenplay draft on May 10, 1990, and by July 15, the first shooting draft had been distributed to the cast and crew; particulars of the technically detailed scripts were shrouded in secrecy. Both the six-week turnaround for the script and the film's accelerated production schedule were to enable a 1991 Fourth of July release.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1782 the Bourbon allies {{launched}} their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard {{ten of the}} newly engineered 'floating batteries' with 138 heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels {{with a total of}} 30,000 sailors and marines. They were supported by 86 land guns and 35,000 Spanish and French troops (7,000–8,000 French) on land intending to assault the fortifications once they had been demolished. The 138 guns opened fire from floating batteries in the Bay and the 86 guns on the land side, directed on the fortifications <b>after</b> <b>weeks</b> of preparatory artillery fire. But the garrison replied with red-hot shot to set fire to and sink the attacker's floating batteries and warships in the Bay. The British destroyed three of the floating batteries, which blew up as the 'red-hot shot' did its job. The other seven batteries were scuttled by the Spanish. In addition 719 men on board the ships (many of whom drowned) were casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Danish sloop Jordenxiold {{was intercepted}} off Isla Palominos on September 3, 1824, as she {{completed}} a voyage from Saint Thomas to Fajardo; the pirates stole goods and cash from the passengers. The incident {{attracted the attention}} of the Danish government, which commissioned the Santa Cruz (a 16-gun brigantine commanded by Michael Klariman) to monitor the areas off Vieques and Culebra. On September 8–9 a hurricane, Nuestra Señora de la Monserrate, struck southern Puerto Rico and passed directly over the Mona Passage. Cofresí and his crew were caught in the storm, which drove their ship towards Hispaniola. According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, an expedition weeks later by Fajardo commander Ramón Aboy to search Vieques, Culebra and the Windward Islands for pirates was actually after Cofresí. The operation used the schooner Aurora (owned by Nicolás Márquez) and Flor de Mayo, owned by José María Marujo. <b>After</b> <b>weeks</b> of searching, the team failed to locate anything of interest.|$|E
