40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sloshing}} impact induced strain exerted on {{the insulation}} panel of a {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) tank was measured in situ by using a fiber-optic Bragg reflector and a wavelength interrogator. To prevent the catastrophic failure of the LNG vessel caused by sloshing impact on the insulation panel, continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis of the induced strain are required. In this study, two different fiber-optic systems are developed based on (1) edge filter type and (2) <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> type. Bragg reflection sensors were embedded inside the reinforced polyurethane foam insulating panel, which was used to cover the inner surface of the LNG tank. Initially, an edge filter type fiber-optic system is attempted for measuring strain for high speed applications. Another type of fiber-optic system, <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating,</b> is developed. By incorporating an <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> device for the interrogation of the reflected wavelength from the Bragg reflector, a dynamic strain of 4000 me occurring within a duration of 10 ms {{was able to be}} measured in real time. The accuracy of the measured data was confirmed by comparing it to the data obtained by means of a high speed camera.

40|$|Abstract—We {{fabricated}} and packaged a {{very compact}} 4 x 4 wavelength router in Silicon-on-insulator. This device is {{for use in}} a 10 gigabit/s opti-cal backplane interconnect based on tuneable lasers and wavelength rout-ing. Fabrication was done using CMOS compatible processes, enabling vol-ume fabrication. The router consists of a very compact <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> using submicron <b>waveguides</b> and bend radii of just 3 µm. This is achieved by exploiting the very high refractive index contrast. By applying a double etch scheme, the insertion loss of the <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> has been reduced to 3. 5 dB for the best routing path. Vertical fibre couplers are used to interface to an standard eight-fibre array connector. The result-ing total fibre-to-fibre insertion loss of the router is 12. 5 dB. The crosstalk level is still- 12 to- 14 dB, which is within spec for the envisaged application. Keywords—Nanophotonics, <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>grating</b> I...|$|R

50|$|Wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) is {{the practice}} of multiplying the available capacity of optical fibers through use of parallel channels, each channel on a dedicated wavelength of light. This requires a wavelength division multiplexer in the transmitting equipment and a demultiplexer (essentially a spectrometer) in the receiving equipment. <b>Arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>gratings</b> are commonly used for multiplexing and demultiplexing in WDM.

50|$|Commercial EDWA {{development}} efforts intensified in 2000's when Inplane Photonics joined the race. In general, their approach {{was similar to}} that of Bell Labs, i.e. the silica-on-silicon technology. Inplane Photonics, however, was able to further improve and expand capabilities of this technology by integrating two to three different waveguide types on the same chip. This feature allowed them to monolithically integrate gain blocks (active waveguides providing amplification) with different passive elements, such as couplers, <b>arrayed</b> <b>waveguide</b> <b>gratings</b> (AWG), optical taps, turning mirrors and so on. Some of advanced Inplane Photonics' photonic circuits containing EDWAs were used by Lockheed Martin in their development of new high-speed on-board communication systems for the US Air Force.
