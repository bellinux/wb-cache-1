50|$|The {{perennial}} grass tree typically {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 5 m with the trunk reaching 5 m, scape of 0.6 to 0.8 m and the flower spike to 1 to 1.5 m. It blooms between August and December producing cream-white flowers.It has numerous long linear entire leaves radiating from the apex {{of one or more}} stout trunks. The white flowers are densely packed into long-stalked robust spikes.The plant is slow growing, long lived and fire-resistant with a crown of strongly reflexed leaves that are quadrate-rhomboid in cross section. It produces an <b>acaroid</b> resin that was used by Indigenous Australians to fix spear heads to shafts.|$|E

In his first seven races his best efforts {{came when he}} {{finished second in the}} W L McKnight Handicap at Calder Race Course in January and was placed third in a Belmont allowance in June. In August he moved to Saratoga where he finished fourth in an allowance before contesting the Seneca Handicap over one mile five furlongs. He recorded his first win for nine months as took the Grade III contest from Nice Pirate and James Boswell. He went on to finish third to <b>Acaroid</b> in the Manhattan Handicap, eighth in the Man o' War Stakes and fourth in the Louisiana Downs Handicap. On his final North American appearance he finished unplaced behind All Along in the Rothmans International Stakes on October 16.|$|E

40|$|Natural organic dyes {{suffer from}} {{degradation}} during the time. Therefore, {{the works of}} art need to be restored and the identification of dyes by analytical methods is important here. The possibilities of using three separation (thin-layer chromatography - TLC, capillary zone electrophoresis - CZE, and micellar electrokinetic chromatography - MEKC) and two spectroscopic (infrared microspectroscopy - IR and Raman microspectroscopy) methods for the identification of red dyes (<b>acaroid,</b> brazil, dragon blood, kamala, logwood, cochineal, madder, lac, and sandalwood) were studied and critically discussed. In TLC, under optimised conditions (silicagel with octadecyl, 80 / 20 (v/v) MeOH/ 1 % TEA in 0. 1 mol路dm- 3 acetate buffer, pH 5, and 80 / 20 (v/v) MeOH/ 1 % TEA in 0. 025 mol路dm- 3 tetraborate buffer, pH 7 and 9), the stain broadening of sandalwood, logwood, <b>acaroid,</b> dragon blood, and brazil was observed. Carminic acid, haematein and purpurin were not detected. A comparison of CZE and MEKC showed that MEKC was superior as it permits separation of all analytes, using 0. 015 mol路dm- 3 sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0. 01 mol路dm- 3 tetraborate buffer, pH 8. 5, at a voltage of 20 kV. The developed method was validated and applied to the identification of dyes in Rubia tinctorum, Rubia cordifolia, and in the mycelium of fungi [...] ...|$|E
30|$|It is {{suggested}} that separation of mites from stool samples, skin prick test and detection of total IgE and mite-specific IgE {{should be used in}} the diagnosis of <b>acaroid</b> mites. Intestinal acariasis may be easily misdiagnosed for allergic enteritis, chronic colitis, intestinal neurosis, amoebiasis, pelvic inflammation, or schistosomiasis. As a result, proper treatment might be thus delayed. Clinicians and technicians should always bear in mind the possibility of dust mite infestation while examining suspicious specimens. This is important in regions, like ours, where intestinal parasites are present so as to avoid unnecessary and ineffective treatment.|$|E
40|$|Acarological {{analyses}} of samples of various stored buckwheat products (cereals/groats, grain/seeds, hay/straw, post harvest sweepings, black pudding, honey) collected from farms (barns, granaries and other husbandry buildings), shops and storehouses, were conducted. The results obtained show {{that some of}} them were infested and contaminated with over 20 mite species. The species found belonged mainly to the synanthropic acarid and glycyphagid mites (families: Acaridae, Glycyphagidae), often occurring in storehouses, infesting stored food-stuffs and other materials. The most frequent and numerous of them were the following species: Acarus farris (Oud.), Acarus immobilis Griffiths, Acarus siro L. Tyrophagus longior (Gerv.), Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schr.), Glycyphagus domesticus (De Geer), Lepidoglyphus destructor (Schr.). They are commonly considered to be known pests of economic and sanitary impor-tance. Mites of other groups (Bdellidae, Macrochelida e, Tydeidae, Anoetoidea, Tarsonemoidea, Oribatida, Uropodida, Gamasida, Parasitida) were also observed. <b>Acaroid</b> and other phytophagous mites infesting buckwheat products were usually accompanied with predatory species, such as Cheyletus eruditus (Schr.), Acarops is sollers Rohdendorf, Melichares tarsalis (Berl.) and Bdella sp., which are natural enemies of other stored products mites, insects and other small arthropods, which usually occupy similar habitats and colonize the same products...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the study of {{lysozyme}} and lysozyme-like proteins, either of similar function (antibacterial) or molecular weight (14 - 17 kDa), of synanthropic <b>acaroid</b> mites. In general, animals utilize lysozymes for defensive (antimicrobial) or digestive purposes but also as a digestive enzyme. Some chitinases or other enzymes that act similarly to lysozyme can be utilized for similar purposes. Chitinases belong to house dust mite allergens. One of major mite are historically named lysozyme-like proteins which name relates to their size similar to lysozyme. Bacteriolytic activity has also 14. 5 kDa (UniprotKB Q 8 MWR 6) protein. The species selected for the study were domestic mites Dermatophagoides farinae, D. pteronyssinus and Lepidoglyphus destructor. Presence of lysozyme was detected by direct detection with polyclonal antibody using immunohistochemistry and dot blots. Immunohistochemistry proved presence of lysozyme epitopes in the feces of D. farinae, D pteronyssinus a L. destructor. Dot blot analysis demonstrated the presence of imunoreactivity of antibody in spent growth medium extracts (SGME) of all three species. This implies that lysozyme is synthesized in the midgut. The presence of lysozyme and lysozyme-like proteins was proved using 2 D electrophoresis and MALDI TOF/TOF [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcarus siro L., {{a common}} <b>acaroid</b> mite in China, {{is one of}} the main pest mites {{damaging}} the stored products, economic crops and edible fungi. The mite is widely studied due to its economic importance. In this paper, the genetic structure and genetic diversity of A. siro in four geographic populations were studied by using ISSR marker. 18 primers were selected for their ability to produce clear and reproducible patterns of polymorphic bands. Those primers were then used for analysing genetic diversity within and among populations of A. siro collected in Nanchang city, Jiujiang city in Jiangxi province and Hefei city, Caohu city in Anhui province (NC, JJ, HF, CH). A total of 136 DNA bands were yielded, 107 of which were polymorphic and PPB was 78. 68 %. The levels of genetic diversity of four population could be ordered in abundance as JJ> NC> HF> CH and the JJ population was the highest level. The value of Gst was 0. 6283, indicating high level of genetic differentiation among populations. Nei's genetic diversity analysis showed that the level of gene flow (Nm= 0. 3717) was lower than that among populations (Nm= 0. 29). Dendrogram constructed using the UPMGA method and Nei's unbias genetic distance showed the same location could be clustered together to form a specific clade. Geographic difference caused great differentiation. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between the genetic distance and geographic distance, indicating that geographic isolation was not the main factors inducing genetic difference...|$|E
