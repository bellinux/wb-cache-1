500|$|Stroheim favored [...] "Soviet-style" [...] montage editing. Greed often uses {{dramatic}} close-ups {{and cuts}} instead of long takes. One {{exception to this}} is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called Stroheim a montage director, stating that [...] "each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact." [...] In the 1950s film critic André Bazin praised Stroheim's use of mise en scène and noted his [...] "one simple rule for directing. Take <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> world, keep on doing so {{and in the end}} it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness." ...|$|E

500|$|At the USAID preview screening, actress Lucy Liu, who {{has worked}} with MTV EXIT and {{produced}} the documentary film Redlight, said that people who watch Not My Life [...] "will be shocked to find [...] is happening in America"; she said that there were 80,000 women being sexually assaulted daily and she called human trafficking the [...] "cannibalization of the planet's youth." [...] According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was [...] "no single communication tool that effectively depict the problem as a whole for a mass audience." [...] Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film [...] "takes <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [...] it will change the way we see our lives, in some very fundamental ways." [...] She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for [...] "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," [...] arguing that these activities [...] "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses." ...|$|E

2500|$|El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency is a non-fiction {{book of the}} Mexican Drug War {{written by}} Ioan Grillo. In El Narco, Grillo takes <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mexican drug trade, {{starting}} with the term [...] "El Narco", which has come to represent the vast, faceless criminal network of drug traffickers who cast a murderous shadow over Mexico. The book covers the frontline of the Mexican Drug War. It seeks to trace {{the origins of the}} illegal drug trade in Mexico, the recent escalation of violence, the human cost of the drug trade and organized crime in the country. The book takes a critical stance on the unsuccessful efforts made by the Mexican government and the United States to confront the violence and its causes.|$|E
2500|$|Ruiz de Burton's {{husband was}} {{assigned}} to San Diego where the couple moved for eight years and had two children. Henry Burton bought a Mexican land grant, Rancho Jamul. [...] In 1859 near {{the start of the}} civil war, Burton was ordered to serve in the Union army, and he, Ruiz, and the family moved to the East coast for a decade. She lived in [...] "the highest military, political, and social circles,” and became friends with First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Maria was not as happy adjusting to “Yankee life,” describing it in a letter to a friend as “’a humbug so methodical and well supported that they even almost believe it.'” [...] This gave her <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corruption in the government, which she would later use in her writings critiquing U.S. society and government. Though she was part of U.S. society, she remained loyal to her roots. She used her writing to counter portrayals of Mexicans and critique discrimination of Californios from individuals and the state.|$|E
2500|$|Barruel {{identified}} {{a number of}} individuals who he believed played direct roles in the Enlightenment and the conspiracy against Christianity and the state. He identified Voltaire as the [...] "chief", d’Alembert as the [...] "most subtle agent", Frederick II as the [...] "protector and adviser", and Diderot as its [...] "forlorn hope". Voltaire was {{at the head of the}} conspiracy because he spent his time with the highest levels of European society. His attention and efforts were directed at kings and high ranking ministers. DAlembert worked behind the scenes and inside the more common areas of French society. He employed his skill in the cafes and academies and attempted to bring more followers to the conspiracy. Barruel takes <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> correspondence between Voltaire and dAlembert and uses this as evidence of their plot to overthrow society. He is deeply concerned with the fact that those he identifies as the leaders of the plot had secret names for one another in their private correspondence. Voltaire was [...] "Raton", dAlembert was [...] "Protagoras", Frederick was [...] "Luc", and Diderot was known as [...] "Plato". Barruel also argued that the conspiracy extended far beyond this small group of philosophes. He believed that the court of Louis XV was a [...] "Voltairean ministry" [...] of powerful men. This group involved Marquis dArgenson who [...] "formed the plan for the destruction of all religious orders in France", the Duc de Choiseul who was [...] "the most impious and most despotic of ministers", the [...] "friend and confidant of dAlembert", Archbishop de Briennes, and Malesherbes, [...] "protector of the conspiracy".|$|E

Two dances and a long {{intermission}} ended before Lane saw the big auto return. He watched the couple get out, and hurry up, to disappear at the entrance.
