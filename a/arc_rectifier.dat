25|$|The Virginian EL-C, later {{known as}} the New Haven EF-4 and E33, was an {{electric}} locomotive built for the Virginian Railway by General Electric in August 1955. They were the first successful production locomotives to use Ignitron (mercury <b>arc)</b> <b>rectifier</b> technology. Although they {{proved to be a}} successful design, no more EL-Cs were built, due to the small number of railroads that had electrification and the advent of improved electric locomotive technology. They were among the last mainline electric freight locomotives in the United States.|$|E

50|$|The {{system used}} mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> at a voltage of 20,000 volts and a rated power of 5 MW. The {{facility}} was dismantled after World War II.|$|R
50|$|A {{valve hall}} is a {{building}} which contains the valves of the static inverters of a high-voltage direct current plant. The valves consist of thyristors, or at older plants, mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> are usually supported by insulators {{mounted on the}} floor, while thyristor valves may be either supported by insulators or hung {{from the roof of}} the valve hall. The latter required a stronger ceiling structure, however the hall and the static inverter can better survive earthquakes compared to valve structures standing on the floor.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In the 1920s, {{economical}} {{conversion to}} and from HVDC began to be possible with glass bulb mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> but this help came {{too late for the}} Thury system.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{locomotive}} had been stripped, the new electrical equipment was installed {{which included the}} transformer, the Stone-Faiveley Pantograph (for which {{a section of the}} roof had to be lowered), a Brown Boveri air blast circuit breaker and the Hackbridge-Hewittic mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier</b> units.|$|E
50|$|The New Haven EP-5 was a {{double-ended}} mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier</b> {{electric locomotive}} built in 1955 by General Electric, for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.

5000|$|The project {{replaces the}} aging mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier</b> Pole 1 {{converter}} stations {{with a new}} thyristor valve pole (to be known as Pole 3). Upgrades at the converter stations at Benmore and Haywards will allow the link to carry up to 1000 MW with future provision for 1400 MW ...|$|E
50|$|The Witton works {{remained}} {{one of the}} company's biggest sites, producing high-voltage switchgear and transformers, small motors, mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and traction components, {{until the}} plant was gradually sold off by Weinstock in 1969.|$|R
50|$|General Electric {{installed}} {{rotary converters}} in B&O's powerhouse near Mt. Royal Station, having a combined capacity of 5,000 kW to convert 13,200-volt, 3 phase, 25-cycle AC to 675 volts DC. In 1936, these rotary converters {{were replaced by}} mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since {{utilities}} supply high-voltage AC, DC railways use converter {{stations to}} produce relatively low-voltage DC (usually 3000 volts or less). Originally they used rotary converters, {{a few of}} which are even still in operation, but most were supplanted first by mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and then by semiconductor rectifiers.|$|R
50|$|The trams {{were run}} on a direct current power supply from Overhead lines, which {{replaced}} the original conduit {{after a series of}} monsoons. The power supply was obtained by a current collector called a trolley pole, mounted on top of the tram. The track rails served as the return path for the DC current. The DC power was supplied by mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier</b> (converter) stations located in various sections of cities.|$|E
50|$|By 1933 an {{additional}} substation was urgently required at Kedron {{in order to}} relieve a serious overload being carried every afternoon by the substation at Windsor, where the 500 kW mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier</b> plant was carrying 700 volts. Council minutes suggest that provision for this new substation should have been made {{two or three years}} prior to 1933, but that the expenditure was delayed for financial reasons until it became essential for safety.|$|E
50|$|Power {{electronics}} {{started with}} the development of the mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier.</b> Invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902, it was used to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). From the 1920s on, research continued on applying thyratrons and grid-controlled mercury arc valves to power transmission. Uno Lamm developed a mercury valve with grading electrodes making them suitable for high voltage direct current power transmission. In 1933 selenium rectifiers were invented.|$|E
50|$|A typical use for an AC/DC {{converter}} was for railway electrification, where {{utility power}} was supplied as alternating current but the trains {{were designed to}} work on direct current. Before the invention of mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and high-power semiconductor rectifiers, this conversion could only be accomplished using motor-generators or rotary converters.|$|R
50|$|The first VL80s were characterised {{by their}} mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Later, they were {{replaced}} with silicon ones, thus {{giving birth to}} the ВЛ80К (en: VL80K) series. The К stands for кремний, the Russian word for silicon. Between the years 1961 and 1973, a total of 695 VL80Ks had been produced.|$|R
50|$|In the interwar period ACEC {{began to}} produce vacuum-based electronics, {{including}} mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> - in 1929 mercury-arc retifiers were installed on Bruxelles tram system replacing rotary converters. The company also produced a high-power test installation, {{capable of producing}} 2.5GW in short circuit, with currents and voltages of up to 267kA and 250kV.|$|R
50|$|In 1902 Hewitt {{developed}} the mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier,</b> the first rectifier that could convert alternating current power to direct current without mechanical means. It was {{widely used in}} electric railways, industry, electroplating, and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. Although it was largely replaced by power semiconductor devices in the 1970s and 1980s, it is still used in some high power applications.In 1903, the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Science was conferred upon him by the Columbia University in recognition of his work.|$|E

50|$|Coffin joined General Electric {{shortly after}} graduation. He worked at GE for the {{duration}} of his career, first in the testing department and then in the Research Laboratory. For several years, he worked on the pioneer development of the iron mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier.</b> Later, he worked on methods of generating power from coal more efficiently, and co-authored a book on the subject, Pulverized coal systems in America. He also conducted experimental studies of the properties and limitations of various types of steel for use in mercury boilers and steam turbines at high pressures and temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s, DC {{was derived}} using {{electronic}} valves (mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers).</b> In modern systems, high-voltage DC (HVDC) [...] "back-to-back" [...] stations are {{used instead of}} mechanical equipment to convert between different frequencies and phases of AC power and solid-state thyristor rectifier systems are used for conversion from AC power to DC traction power.|$|R
5000|$|A {{valve hall}} is {{equipped}} with heating and cooling equipment to control {{the temperature of the}} mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> (which operate best over a narrow temperature range) or thyristors. The valve hall also protects the valves from weather and dust. Several valve assemblies, connected in series for the required terminal voltage, may be installed in the valve hall building.|$|R
50|$|There were various vacuum/gas devices, such as {{the mercury}} <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> thyratrons, ignitrons, and vacuum diodes. Solid-state {{technology}} was in its infancy, represented by copper oxide and selenium rectifiers. All of these gave excessive forward voltage drop at high currents. One answer was mechanically opening and closing contacts, if this could be done quickly and cleanly enough.|$|R
5000|$|In 1882 Jemin and Meneuvrier {{observed}} the rectifying properties of a mercury arc. The mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier</b> {{was invented by}} Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902 and further developed throughout the 1920s and 1930s by researchers in both Europe and North America. Before its invention, {{the only way to}} convert AC current provided by utilities to DC was by using expensive, inefficient, and high-maintenance rotary converters or motor-generator sets. Mercury-arc rectifiers or [...] "converters" [...] were used for charging storage batteries, arc lighting systems, the DC traction motors for trolleybuses, trams, and subways, and electroplating equipment. The mercury rectifier was used well into the 1970s, when it was finally replaced by semiconductor rectifiers.|$|E
5000|$|The Council {{initially}} set fares at 4d {{to go up}} and 2d to {{come down}} (3d and 1d for children). The 500 volts DC for the elevator came from the city tram system; in 1951 a mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier</b> was installed to convert electricity from the 230 volt AC national grid to 500V DC after the tram system was removed. Operation of the elevator was passed to the Wanganui City Council on 1 June 1942; the city still operates it today. The Council runs monthly checks of the elevator, and closes it for one day a year for a full inspection, as well as on Christmas Day. The current operator, Zena Mabbot, has been operating it since 1971.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was the experimental investigation of the influence of the gap width and speed of the welding wire on the changes of the geometry in the welded joint in the hybrid laser-arc welding of shipbuilding steel RS E 36. The research was divided into three parts. First, {{in order to understand the}} influence of the gap width on the welded joint geometry, experimental research was done using continuous wave fiber laser IPG YLS- 15000 with <b>arc</b> <b>rectifier</b> VDU- 1500 DC. The second part involved study of the geometry of the welded joint and hardness test results. Three macrosections from each welded joint were obtained. Influence of the gap width and welding wire speed on the welded joint geometry was researched in the three lines: in the right side of the plates, middle welded joint and in the root welded joint...|$|E
5000|$|Direct {{current power}} for the {{interurban}} trolleys on the Liberty Bell Line was produced (from AC power supplied by overhead lines from Allentown) by rotary converters at substations in Allentown, Summit Lawn,Coopersburg, Quakertown, Sellersville, Souderton (in the carbarn), Lansdale, and Washington Square. Unlike the notation in the [...] "See Also" [...] section below, LVT never used mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|AC to DC {{synchronous}} {{rotary converters}} were made obsolete by mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> in the 1930s {{and later on}} by semiconductor rectifiers in the 1960s. Some of the original New York City Subway substations using synchronous rotary converters operated until 1999. Compared to the rotary converter, the mercury <b>arc</b> and semiconductor <b>rectifiers</b> did not need daily maintenance, manual synchronizing for parallel operation, nor skilled personnel, and they provided clean DC power. This enabled the new substations to be unmanned, only requiring periodic visits from a technician for inspection and maintenance.|$|R
25|$|A mercury {{arc valve}} {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} rectifier which converts alternating current into direct current. Rectifiers of this type were used in electric motor power supplies for industry, in electric railways, streetcars, and diesel-electric locomotives. They also found use in static inverter stations and as rectifiers for high-voltage direct current power transmission. Mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> were invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, {{the power}} {{rating of the}} mercury <b>arc</b> valve <b>rectifiers</b> was raised by various {{improvements}} to 1,600 MW.|$|R
50|$|On 13 March 2008, Transpower {{announced}} that {{work had been}} completed to restore 50% of the capacity of Pole 1 to service at times when the demand for power on the North Island peaked. Several mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> were salvaged from the Konti-Skan link between Denmark and Sweden for this restoration. The energy transfer on Pole 1 was strictly limited to the northbound direction, to reduce the stress and strain on the aged converter system.|$|R
50|$|A rotary {{converter}} plant is a facility at which {{one form of}} electricity is converted into another form of electricity by {{using a combination of}} an electric motor and an electric generator. The installed combinations of motors and generators at a plant determine the possible type(s) of conversion. Such facilities also allow the setting of voltages and frequencies, if appropriate equipment is installed. Rotary converter plants were commonplace in railway electrification before the invention of mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> in the 1920s.|$|R

40|$|A new {{control method}} for the {{thyratron}} is described analytically and experimentally. According to this method, the discharge current {{is controlled by}} the signal wave component of the amplitude modulated wave fed into the grid circuit. Output discharge current v. s. input signal voltage characteristics are linear, being carrier and input signal frequency more than twenty times and less than one fourth of the plate power source frequency, respectively. This control method is available in the field of automatic control systems, frequency changers for the resistance welders, and many other devices. Applying this control method to mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> or magnetic amplifiers, it goes without difficulty to control heavy currents...|$|R
50|$|The only {{locomotives}} {{built for}} British Railways at the works, were the twenty BR Class 28 diesel electrics during 1958-59, and the experimental 25kV AC locomotive E1000 {{which was built}} by converting the gas turbine locomotive E18100. Work commenced in January 1958 when E18100 was brought to Bowesfield Works from storage at Dukinfield Works. The conversion of E18100 involved {{the removal of the}} gas turbine unit, generator and the middle traction motor from each bogie, which changed the locomotive from a Co-Co to an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement. The necessary electrical equipment such as the transformer, mercury <b>arc</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and pantograph etc. was installed, with the work completed by October 1958.|$|R
