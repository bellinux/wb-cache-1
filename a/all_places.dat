5|$|Detectives traced three {{distinct}} polonium trails {{in and out}} of London, at three different dates, which according to the investigation suggests Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun made two failed attempts to administer polonium to Litvinenko before the final and successful one. The first attempt took place on 16 October 2006, when radioactive traces were found in <b>all</b> <b>places</b> visited by the FSB operatives before and after their meeting with Litvinenko. They administered the poison to his tea, but he did not drink it.|$|E
5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from <b>all</b> <b>places</b> in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E
5|$|The British {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to force Baji Rao into a treaty. The treaty (The Treaty of Pune) was signed on 13 June 1817. Key terms imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle's guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British. These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and <b>all</b> <b>places</b> north of the Narmada and south of the Tungabhadra rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India. The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.|$|E

5|$|The {{commuter}} rail system serves 39 railway stations, {{most of which}} predate the {{commuter rail}} service. When the Røros, Meråker and Nordland Lines were built, stations buildings were built at <b>all</b> <b>places</b> with a passing loop, {{and most of these}} stations the buildings remain, although they are not necessarily open to travelers. However, only Trondheim, Stjørdal, Steinkjer and Røros are manned. Several of the station and operation buildings along the line have been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. These include the stations at Singsås, Hell, Skatval, Langstein, Skogn and Levanger. The system's depot is located at Marienborg, although trains also overnight at terminal stations.|$|E
5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of <b>all</b> <b>places.</b> A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked <b>all</b> <b>places</b> where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E

25|$|Even if the {{expression}} > always evaluates to true at run-time, most type checkers will reject {{the program as}} ill-typed, because it is difficult (if not impossible) for a static analyzer to determine that the else branch will not be taken.

Without static type checking, even code coverage tests with 100% coverage {{may be unable to}} find such type errors.
