Booker cites {{a scene from}} the episode where Milhouse asks Bart what religions have to gain by lying about concepts such as the existence of a soul– and then the scene cuts to Reverend Lovejoy counting his money; Booker believes that this implies that religions create mythologies so that they can gain money from followers. He juxtaposes this with Bart's realization later in the episode that [...] "life suddenly feels empty and incomplete" [...] without a soul, which suggests [...] "either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction". Mark I. Pinsky and Samuel F. Parvin discuss the episode in their book The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group Study, and use examples from it to stimulate discussion among youth {{about the nature of the}} soul. Pinsky and Parvin note Bart's statement to Milhouse from the beginning of the episode: [...] "Soul— come on, Milhouse, there's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogie Man or Michael Jackson", and then suggest questions to <b>ask</b> <b>students,</b> including whether they know individuals that agree with Bart, and their views on the existence of a soul.|$|E

He would frequently visit schools and <b>ask</b> <b>students</b> to explain the meaning of the Confucian texts, to ensure that their Western learning did not corrupt their sense of nationalism. So strong was Nariakira’s desire to raise well-educated youths that he set aside four koku annually to feed starving scholars, essentially a form of financial aid or scholarship. His goal in promoting education in Satsuma was to make sure the youths of Satsuma were “taught to master themselves, rule their homes wisely, preserve national peace, and trust the universal power.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The reading {{section is}} a 35-minute, 40-question test that {{consists}} of [...] four sections, three of which contain one long prose passage and one which contains two shorter prose passages. The passages {{are representative of the}} levels and kinds of text commonly encountered in first-year college curricula. This reading test assesses skills in three general categories: key ideas and details, craft and structure, and integration of knowledge and ideas. Test questions will usually <b>ask</b> <b>students</b> to derive meaning from texts referring to what is explicitly stated or by reasoning to determine implicit meanings. Specifically, questions will ask you to use referring and reasoning skills to determine main ideas; locate and interpret significant details; understand sequences of events; make comparisons; comprehend cause-effect relationships; determine the meaning of context-dependent words, phrases, and statements; draw generalizations; and analyze the author’s or narrator’s voice and method.|$|E

The fourth activity <b>asks</b> <b>students</b> to count remaining spent money in the film. The fifth activity invites students to play rubber seeds in the bag. The last activity <b>asks</b> <b>students</b> to answer the questions in the student worksheet. The media used along the learning activities are a ruler, rubber seed, student worksheet, money, gravel, and film.
