5|$|The General <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> {{arrive at}} the port of Mompox. Here they are stopped by police, who fail to {{recognize}} the General. They ask for his passport, but he is unable to produce one. Eventually, the police discover his identity and escort him into the port. The people still believe him to be the President of Gran Colombia and prepare banquets in his honor; but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack of strength and appetite. After several days, the General <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> set off for Turbaco.|$|E

50|$|The {{function}} of the emperor was styled like a secular papacy. Therefore, it was the overall goal to demonstrate the highest (allerhöchste) majesty and dignity of the monarch to <b>his</b> subjects <b>and</b> to other monarchs <b>and</b> countries. <b>His</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage's</b> life was governed by very strict rules all the time.|$|R
50|$|The Oirats did {{not trust}} him, as he had betrayed his own eldest brother. Soon {{after the death of}} the Emperor, Agbarjin was invited by Esen to a banquet. When the former <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourages</b> arrived, Esen <b>and</b> the Oirat leaders murdered all Borjigin males in <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> except Qara-qurtag, who fled and was later murdered, either in Moghulistan or Central Siberia. Agbarjin's death paved the way for Esen's enthronement in 1454.|$|R
2500|$|The King was {{surrounded}} by ministers, state officials, nobles, royalties, palace women, and servants, all protected by guards and troops. The capital city of Angkor and the Khmer royal court are famous for grand ceremonies, with many festivals and rituals held in the city.

5|$|The ship {{participated in}} Operation Demon, the {{evacuation}} of Allied troops from Greece in April, and assisted in {{the evacuation of}} troops from Crete to Egypt after the Germans invaded Crete on 22 May (Operation Merkur). That same day she was ordered along with HMS Hero, to steam for the south coast of the island. The next night, 22 May, she evacuated King George of the Hellenes <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> and sailed to Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|In 1320, {{following}} the death of Michael IX Palaiologos (eldest son of Andronikos II and co-emperor from 1295 on), his son Andronikos III was crowned as co-emperor by Andronikos II. Although initially popular with his grandfather, the younger Andronikos <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> of young nobles, to which Syrgiannes belonged, had by that time caused the elder emperor's displeasure by their extravagance. Their excesses culminated in the mistaken-identity murder of the young emperor's younger brother, Manuel; enraged, the elder Andronikos annulled his grandson's titles, and a deep personal rift was opened between the two.|$|E
5|$|Other {{influential}} 2nd century authors include Juvenal and Pliny the Younger, {{the latter}} of whom {{was a friend of}} Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous Panegyricus Traiani before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his Satires, depicting the Emperor <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established {{by the end of the}} 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the Acts of John.|$|E

5|$|Arkansas {{participated in}} the Yorktown Sesquicentennial {{celebrations}} in October 1931, marking the 150th anniversary of the Siege of Yorktown. She embarked President Herbert Hoover <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> on 17 October, and {{took them to the}} exposition, and returned them to Annapolis on 19–20 October. She then went into drydock for an extensive refit in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which lasted until January 1932. During this time, she was under the command of George Landenberger. Arkansas was transferred to the Pacific Fleet after completing the refit; while en route, she stopped in New Orleans to participate in the Mardi Gras celebration. She operated off the west coast through early 1934, at which point she was transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of the Training Squadron.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> {{flew into}} Munich. From the airport {{they drove to}} the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they {{assembled}} the leaders of an SA rampage {{that had taken place}} in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of Obergruppenführer August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city on the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.|$|E
50|$|Rama IV thus came {{to welcome}} western {{intrusion}} in Siam. Indeed, the king himself <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourages</b> were actively pro-British. This came in 1855 {{in the form}} of a mission led by the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir John Bowring, who arrived in Bangkok with demands for immediate changes, backed by the threat of force. The King readily agreed to his demand for a new treaty, called the Bowring Treaty, which restricted import duties to 3%, abolished royal trade monopolies, and granted extraterritoriality to British subjects. Other western powers soon demanded and got similar concessions.|$|R

5|$|By {{the reign}} of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was {{importing}} customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with the symposium that were typified by items such as the decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.|$|E
5|$|Following her commissioning, Arkansas {{participated in}} a fleet review on 14 October 1912, for President William Howard Taft. The ship took Taft aboard that day {{for a trip to}} Panama to inspect the Panama Canal, which was still under construction. Arkansas began her {{shakedown}} cruise after delivering Taft <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> to the Canal Zone. On 26 December, she returned to the Canal Zone to take Taft to Key West, Florida. After completing the voyage, Arkansas was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and participated in fleet maneuvers off the east coast of the United States. Arkansass first overseas cruise, to the Mediterranean Sea, began in late October 1913. While there, she stopped in several ports, including Naples, Italy on 11 November, where the ship celebrated the birthday of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, Livingstone welcomed Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez to London, hosting {{an event}} {{for him at}} City Hall. This was {{condemned}} by various Conservatives claiming that Chávez's democratic socialist government had undermined pluralistic democracy. Livingstone proceeded to accept {{the presidency of the}} pro-Chávez Venezuelan Information Centre. In November 2006, Livingstone travelled to Latin America to visit Chávez, during which he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> stayed in Cuba at a cost of £29,000; many British sources condemned the visit as a waste of tax-payer's money. In August 2007, it was announced that Livingstone had come to an agreement with oil-rich Venezuela; Chávez's government would supply £16 million a year worth of free oil to TfL, who would use it to subsidise half priced bus fares for 250,000 Londoners on benefits. In return, London would provide expertise in running transport, as well as other services such as CCTV and waste management.|$|E
50|$|Burntisland {{developed}} as a seaport, being second only to Leith in the Firth of Forth, and shipbuilding became an important industry in the town. In 1633 one of the barges, the Blessing of Burntisland, carrying Charles I <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage's</b> baggage from Burntisland to Leith sank {{with the loss of}} Charles' treasure. In 1601, King James VI chose the town as an alternative site for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. This was when a new translation of the Bible was first discussed, a project which James brought to fruition a decade later in the King James Bible.|$|R

5|$|Late in 1384 Carrouges entered {{society for}} the first time since his {{marriage}} four years earlier, attending a party to celebrate the birth of a neighbour's son. Carrouges and Le Gris met at the celebration and agreed to end their quarrel, Carrouges introducing Le Gris to his wife Marguerite {{for the first time}}. A few months after this meeting, in March 1385, Carrouges attempted to increase his family wealth through military means, by joining the army of Jean de Vienne for an expedition sailing to Edinburgh. This force of about 3,000 soldiers was intended to unite with the Scottish army and raid Northern England, distracting English forces from operations in France. Traveling with men-at-arms, horses, gold and equipment, Carrouges <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> rode to Sluys and took ship to Leith during the spring of 1385.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, Parker sent a {{chartered}} Greyhound bus {{to transport}} Presley <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> from Memphis, Tennessee to Nashville. The session personnel consisted of guitarist Scotty Moore, drummer D.J. Fontana, pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Hank Garland, bassist Bobby Moore, percussionist Buddy Harman and the backing group The Jordanaires. Presley's original bassist Bill Black declined {{to join the}} sessions as he was enjoying success with the Bill Black Combo. To prevent possible disruption by fans, the musicians were initially told {{they were going to}} play on a Jim Reeves session. RCA executives Sholes and Bill Bullock were joined in the control booth by Parker, his assistant Tom Diskin, A head Chet Atkins, engineer Bill Porter and Hill and Range's Bienstock.|$|E
5|$|Sargent worked {{first as}} an organist at St Mary's Church, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, from 1914 to 1924, except {{for eight months}} in 1918 when {{he served as a}} private in the Durham Light Infantry during the First World War. He was chosen for the organist post over more than 150 other applicants. At the same time, he worked on many musical {{projects}} in Leicester, Melton Mowbray and Stamford, where he not only conducted but also produced the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan and others for amateur societies. The Prince of Wales <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> often hunted in Leicestershire and watched the annual Gilbert and Sullivan productions there, together with the Duke of York {{and other members of the}} Royal Family. At the age of 24 Sargent became England's youngest Doctor of Music, with a degree from Durham.|$|E

5|$|The Jurchens {{tried to}} end the siege by {{negotiating}} a peace treaty. There was some progress towards an agreement {{in the summer of}} 1232, but the assassination of the Mongol diplomat Tang Qing <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> by the Jurchens made further talks impossible. The Jin grew desperate. They had enlisted most of the available men in the empire to either defend Kaifeng or fight against the Mongols on the front lines. While the negotiations were ongoing, a plague was devastating the population of the city. Starvation was rampant. The supplies stored in Kaifeng were running out, even with what had been forcibly seized from people. The city's political disintegration created unfounded fears that there was an internal threat. Several residents of the city were executed on the suspicion that they were traitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} Dutch attacks led Sudirman, {{perhaps at}} the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser– who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had not been present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, at dawn, the Dutch force {{crossed the}} Lippe across a pontoon bridge. Maurice awaited them with 5,000 {{infantry}} {{and the rest}} of his cavalry arranged for the battle in the hills near Wesel, along the opposite riverbank. Philip of Nassau divided his troops into four squadrons: the first one of 125 men under the drossaard of Sallandt, the second one of 125 men under the Count of Kinsky, the third one, those in which Nassau and his brothers marched, of 150 soldiers under Lieutenant Balen, and the last, closing the way, of 120 men under the English captain Nicholas Parker. Having arrived at Krudenburg, Nassau sent 40 chosen men from the companies led by Balen to surprise the foraging horses. On finding a force much larger than they expected, the Dutch officers thought that something was wrong and sent a report back to Philip of Nassau. The Dutch commander, nevertheless, believed that it was only the convoy's escort and moved on with his troops <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> to attack the Spanish cavalry, aiming to prevent its escape.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Yesün Temür Khan in Shangdu in 1328 gave Khayishan's line an {{opportunity}} to surface. But it was mainly due to El Temür's political ingenuity, whose Qipchaq family reached its zenith under Khayishan. He activated a conspiracy in the capital Khanbaliq (Dadu, modern Beijing) to overthrow the court at Shangdu. He <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourages</b> enjoyed enormous geographical and economic advantages over the loyalists of Yesun Temur. Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by El Temür since his more influential brother Kuśala stayed in far-away Central Asia. He was installed as the new ruler in Khanbaliq in September while Yesün Temür's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support from Yesün Temür's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah.|$|R
50|$|When the King {{bathed in}} the sea, thirty to forty male attendants would {{surround}} him for <b>his</b> security <b>and</b> keep watch for jellyfish. A cross - shape wooden pole is fixed {{on the roof of}} the front court’s bathing pavilion to hoist lanterns for communicating with royal family members, the King’s guests <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>entourages</b> who resided outside the royal residential complex. For example, when His Majesty was getting dressed for dinner, the pole would display a yellow lantern, which was the signal to those involved in the fete that evening to get ready. If the signal lantern was green, it meant that the king was performing any state duties, such as giving audiences , so no one was allowed into the palace’s main gates at that time.|$|R
