Hydroxychloroquine is an FDA-approved antimalarial used for constitutional, cutaneous, and articular manifestations. Hydroxychloroquine has relatively few side effects, and there is evidence that it improves survival among people who have SLE.|$|E
25|$|The {{goals of}} {{treatment}} are to minimize {{symptoms such as}} pain and swelling, to prevent bone deformity (for example, bone erosions visible in X-rays), and to maintain day-to-day functioning. This is primarily addressed with disease-modifying <b>antirheumatic</b> drugs (DMARDs); analgesics {{may be used to}} help manage pain. RA should generally be treated with at least one specific anti-rheumatic medication. The use of benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) to treat the pain is not recommended as it does not appear to help and is associated with risks.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Depression {{is one of}} {{the five}} most {{frequent}} disorders in primary care practice and often remains unrecognized. One of the reasons why depression often passes unnoticed is comorbidity – a number of different chronic diseases coexist with depression, especially in elderly patients. Aim: The aim of this research was to assess the difference between depressed and non-depressed patients regarding somatic and mental comorbidity. The differences in drug use were also examined. Subjects and Methods: Five hundred successive adult patients visiting family physicians in Rijeka, Croatia, were polled using the Beck Depression Inventory and a general questionnaire which was created for the purpose of the study. The existing medical records were also used. Results: Elevated depression level was determined in 48. 1 % of the examinees. These patients were suffering from larger number of chronic diseases (X= 1. 23) than non-depressed patients (X= 0. 70; t= 5. 07; p< 0. 001; z= 4. 93; p< 0. 001), especially cardiac, mental, renal and osteomuscular diseases. Depressed persons used significantly more drugs (X= 1. 28) than non-depressed patients (X= 0. 58; t= 6. 10; p< 0. 001; z= 5. 78; p< 0. 001), especially <b>antirheumatics,</b> analgesics, sedatives, antidepressants, antiallergics and diuretics.

40|$|Abstract: Supplementing {{a recent}} review ‘Health effects of high radon environments in Central Europe: another test for the HLNT {{hypothesis}} [1]’, this review of medical radon applications (in particular {{for the treatment of}} painful degenerative joint and spine diseases) covers mainly the first century of large-scale use and scientific studies on this subject since the discovery of radon. Most of the studies and experiences originated in Europe, in particular Germany, Austria, and the former USSR. They have in common that they are not well known in the anglophonic scientific literature, where radon therapy is still frequently considered a placebo-type ‘traditional medicine’, and not be compared with the drugs such as non-steroid <b>antirheumatics.</b> However, based on the substantial experiences as reflected in more than one thousand papers, mostly in peer-reviewed scientific journals, on this subject, radon therapy by inhalation or baths has been established as an evidence-based effective treatment not only by empirical experience in different times and cultures, but also in randomised clinical double-blind studies. It should be further explored as an effective alternative to the use of pharmaca. Unlike radon, drugs cause serious side effects, with more than ten thousand annual casualties. The benefits in the adequate use of low-dose radon exposures far exceed the hypothetical lung cancer risk attributed to the inhalation of low radon concentrations. Further research could provide better understanding of the mechanism of the stimulating radon effects on the body’s defence systems...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of the pharmacotherapeutic circle (PTC), a general practitioner (GP) prescribing-improvement programme to enhance prescribing quality and reduce drug costs. Design: Combined pre- and post-intervention time-series design using an internal comparison of subgroups and an external comparative control. Setting: Small discussion groups meeting 8 times over 18 months. Participants: 79 GPs exceeding the mean drug costs/patient of all Hessian physicians by >= 40 %; 10 moderators. Interventions: Peer-review feedback of prescription patterns based on guidelines targeting 3 suboptimal prescribing areas: drug prescriptions lacking evidence-based efficacy (target A); presumptive prescribing habits (target B); and underprescribing of new, effective therapies (target C). Main outcome measures and results: Significant decreases in prescription rates for target A drugs were recorded for varicose vein medications (p = 0. 006), peripheral vasodilators (p = 0. 0001) and topical <b>antirheumatics</b> (p = 0. 0145), but not for prokinetics/enzymes/digestives. Prescribing of target B drugs such as benzodiazepines and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs declined markedly (p = 0. 0019 and 0. 0014, respectively). Target C drug prescriptions such as for opioids and proton pump inhibitors were not significantly increased. Highly significant reductions in prescription costs were observed for target A and B drugs, irrespective of whether GPs were stratified into high, medium or low prescribers. When mean prescribing costs for PTC participants were compared with those of a control group comprising 8000 GPs over a 21 -month period, PTC GPs decreased their costs by 2 %, whereas drug costs for all Hessian physicians rose by 10 %. Conclusions: PTCs appear to be an effective method to optimise the quality of drug prescribing and reduce drug costs.

40|$|AIM Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{are a major}} burden {{in health}} care, regularly leading to hospital admission, morbidity or death. Women {{tend to have a}} higher risk of adverse drug reactions with a 1. 5 to 1. 7 -fold greater risk than men. Our primary aim was to study differences in ADR-related hospitalizations between the sexes. METHODS We conducted a nationwide study of all ADR-related hospitalizations in the period between 2000 and 2005 in the Netherlands, which were selected from all 9 287 162 hospital admissions in this period. ADR-drug group combinations with at least 50 admissions in one of the sexes were selected. Relative risks and confidence intervals were calculated with respect to total admissions and total prescriptions with men as reference. RESULTS In total, 0. 41 % of the 4 236 368 admissions in men (95 % CI 0. 40, 0. 42 %) and 0. 47 % of the 5 050 794 admissions in women (95 % CI 0. 46, 0. 48 %) were attributed to an ADR by medical specialists (57 % of all ADR-related admissions were in women). Differences between the sexes in risk for ADR-related hospitalization were found for antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, <b>antirheumatics,</b> anticoagulants and salicylates, cardiovascular and neurological drugs, steroids and antibiotics. In certain drug categories, risks for hospitalization changed after taking into account total drug prescriptions. CONCLUSION In all different drug classes, significant differences exist between the sexes in ADR-related hospital admissions. Cardiovascular drugs account for the most pronounced differences between men and women.

40|$|This 9 -month {{pragmatic study}} {{compared}} 2 therapeutic regimens {{in the management}} of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. Patients received either diacerein 100 mg/day plus standard osteoarthritic therapy for 6 months, followed by a 3 -month monitoring period without diacerein, or standard therapy alone for the entire 9 -month period. A total of 207 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip were enrolled. Improvements in Lequesne's functional index and quality-of-life scores (revised Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales Health Status Questionnaire and Nottingham Health Profile), and decreases in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic consumption were significantly greater with diacerein plus standard therapy than with standard therapy alone. The overall assessment of therapy by patients was good or excellent for 60 % of those who received diacerein plus standard therapy, compared with 26 % who received standard therapy alone. Medical and paramedical procedures carried out in addition to those stipulated in the protocol (medical consultations, physiotherapy, nursing, etc.), osteoarthritisrelated, were fewer and less costly in the diacerein plus standard therapy group than in the standard therapy group. The average outpatient cost (in 1995 French francs) of osteoarthritis treatment in the standard therapy group was FF 2272 compared with FF 2360 in the diacerein plus standard therapy group. The cost-effectiveness ratios per point scored on Lequesne's index were FF 1893 for the standard therapy group and FF 1072 for the diacerein plus standard therapy group, leading to a saving of 43 % with diacerein plus standard therapy. The marginal cost (additional cost corresponding to the clinical benefit obtained by adding diacerein to standard treatment) was FF 88 per point scored on Lequesne's index.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is a prevalent condition {{associated with}} pain, joint destruction and morbidity. Direct healthcare costs are 2 to 3 {{times higher than}} average costs for individuals of similar age and gender. Furthermore, utilisation and costs rise with age and disease duration. Managed care has become an increasingly popular way to organise and finance the delivery of healthcare. Studies comparing {{the quality of care}} in health maintenance organisations and fee-for-service settings have found few differences in outcomes, although reduced costs have been attributed to lower hospitalisation rates in patients with RA. We reviewed 10 studies of the direct costs of RA. In 1996 dollars, direct costs ranged from $US 2299 per person per year in Canada to $US 13 549 in a US study focusing on patients who have been hospitalised only. Surprisingly, the contributions to direct costs - hospital care, medications and physician visits - remained relatively stable over time and the setting of care. Hospitalisation costs were the highest component of direct costs accounting, generally, for 60 % or more of costs while only approximately 10 % of patients with RA were hospitalised. The only exception was a managed care setting where hospitalisation costs were 16 % of total direct costs. In managed care settings, costs of medications were proportionately higher than in fee-for-service settings. We conclude that in studies of the direct costs of RA the components of costs have remained relatively stable over time. This may change with the development and growing use of new RA medications including cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors, interleukins, cytokines, treatments that inhibit tumour necrosis factor, and combination therapies. The effectiveness of managed care in controlling direct costs needs to be evaluated in more targeted studies. <b>Antirheumatics,</b> Cost analysis, Managed care, Pharmacoeconomics, Resource use, Rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Acetaminophen {{overdose}} is a {{major concern}} among the pediatric population. Our objective was to assess the validity of International Classification of Disease (ICD- 9 -CM) codes for identification of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits resulting from acetaminophen exposure or overdose. Methods We conducted a retrospective medical record review of ED visits at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, Texas, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2010. Visits coded with 1 or more ICD- 9 codes for poisoning (965, 977, and their subcodes and supplemental E-codes E 850, E 858, E 935, E 947, and E 950 and their subcodes) were identified from an administrative database, and further review of the medical records was conducted to identify true cases of acetaminophen exposure or overdose. We then examined the sensitivity, positive predictive value, and percentage of false positives identified by various codes and code combinations to establish which codes most accurately identified acetaminophen exposure or overdose. Results Of 1, 215 ED visits documented with 1 or more of the selected codes, 316 (26. 0 %) were a result of acetaminophen exposure or overdose. Sensitivity was highest (87. 0 %) for the combination of codes 965. 4 (poisoning by aromatic analgesics, not elsewhere classified) and E 950. 0 (suicide and self-inflicted poisoning by analgesics, antipyretics, and <b>antirheumatics),</b> with a positive predictive value of 86. 2 %. Code 965. 4 alone yielded a sensitivity of 85. 1 %, with a positive predictive value of 92. 8 %. Code performance varied among age groups and {{depending on the type of}} exposure (intentional or unintentional). Conclusion ICD- 9 codes are useful for ascertaining which ED visits are a result of acetaminophen exposure or overdose within the pediatric population. However, because ICD- 9 coding differs by age group and depending on the type of exposure, hypothesis-driven strategies must be utilized for each pediatric age group to avoid misclassification. </p...|$|R

This study aims to explore the role of hospitalization on medication changes as patients are transferred from and back to ambulatory care. Methods: Secondary analysis of claims data from Swiss residents with basic health insurance at the Helsana Group was performed. We evaluated medication invoices of patients who were hospitalized in a Swiss private hospital group in the year 2013. Medication changes were defined as discontinuation, new prescription, or change in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System level 4, which is equivalent {{to a change in}} the chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup. Multiple Poisson regression analysis was applied to evaluate whether medication change was predicted by socioeconomic or clinical patient characteristics or by a system factor (physician dispensing of medication allowed in canton of residence). Results: We investigated a total of 10, 123 hospitalized patients, among whom a mean number of 3. 85 (median 3. 00) changes were identified. Change most frequently affected antihypertensives, analgesics, and <b>antirheumatics.</b> If patients were enrolled in a managed care plan, they were less likely to undergo changes. If a patient resided in a canton, in which physicians were allowed to dispense medication directly, the patient was more likely to experience change. Conclusion: There is considerable change in medication when patients shift between ambulatory and inpatient health care levels. This interruption of medication continuity is in part desirable as it responds to clinical needs. However, we hypothesize that there is also a significant proportion of change due to unwarranted factors such as financial incentives for change of products.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the total costs associated with the administration of two different tumour necrosis factor (TNF) strategies used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) : etanercept, a soluble TNF receptor that can be administered at home by subcutaneous injection, versus infliximab, an antibody that requires an intravenous infusion in a hospital outpatient setting. Design and setting: The main analytical framework of the study was a cost-cost analysis comparing the total annual costs associated with the administration of etanercept and infliximab in adult RA patients. The perspective of the study was that of the Dutch society. An economic model was constructed to determine the costs of both treatments. The cost evaluation included direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs and indirect costs. The base-case analysis compared monotherapy with etanercept versus a combination therapy with infliximab and methotrexate. Data for the economic model came from published literature, expert opinion and official price and tariff lists. All costs were in 1999 values. Patients and participants: The analysis was performed for the adult RA population eligible for treatment with etanercept or infliximab in The Netherlands. Main outcome measures and results: The analysis showed that the total annual drug costs per patient do not differ substantially between infliximab and etanercept, with costs of Netherland guilders (NLG) 31 526 ($US 12 610) and NLG 31 334 ($US 12 534), respectively. However, the other medical costs (i. e. excluding the costs of the two drugs themselves) are substantially higher for infliximab due to the additional costs associated with administration in an outpatient clinic and the use of methotrexate [NLG 12 621 ($US 5048) versus NLG 269 ($US 107) for etanercept]. The impact of direct nonmedical costs (transportation) and indirect costs were negligible. Overall treatment with infliximab is more expensive than treatment with etanercept with total costs of NLG 45 115 ($US 18 046) and NLG 31 621 ($US 12 648), respectively (42. 7 % increase). Conclusions: Based on the assumptions used in the model, we may conclude that the use of etanercept compares favourably with infliximab from a budgetary and health economic perspective: the total costs are substantially lower when the efficacy of etanercept is assumed to be at least equivalent to the efficacy of infliximab.

40|$|Introduction: The {{increased}} {{reporting of}} cases of drug-induced liver injuries, reflects {{the growing number of}} new agents introduced into clinical practice in the last decades. It should be added to the modernization of industries, and new chemicals which it applied. Drug-induced liver injuries make up a persisting and challenging problem for physicians, health agencies and pharmaceutical firms. Research objectives: The aim of the study is the determination of the most common causes of drug-induced liver injury in our surroundings. We compared the importance of hepatotoxic action of drugs in relation to other noxa in human environment. We determinated the importance of the body sensitivity on the acting agents. We also examined the importance of different drugs in the development of hepatotoxicity, regardless the dose. Materials and methods: We analyzed 52 patients with a diagnosis of hepa-totoxic liver injury (medical history, detailed clinical evaluation of patients, histopathological analysis of the liver, abdominal ultra sound, laboratory determination of standard liver function tests) and followed up for 12 months. In the period from 01. 04. 2005 to 01. 04. 2009, in these patients of the Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade, we monitored liver functional tests and morphological findings. We used biological markers relevant for the differential diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy. The results of the patients with hepatotoxic liver injury were compared with the values of the findings of the 52 patients in the control group, with the diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis, hospitalized in the same institution during the same time. Results: The causes of toxic liver damage in our study were following agents, classified into groups: Industrial toxins (8 patients), Food and beverages (9 pts), <b>Antirheumatics</b> and analgesics (6 pts), Antiarrhythmic drugs (4 pts) Antilipemic (4 pts), Antibiotics (4 pts), Vitamins (3 pts), Antihypertensive drugs (3 pts), Antiplatelet drugs (2 pts), Anticonvulsants (2 pts), Drugs for osteoporosis (2 pts), Antihipertireoidni drugs (1 pt), Oral antidiabetic agents (1 pt), Oral contraceptives (1 pt), Glucocorticoids (1 pt) and Antidepressants (1 pt). We got the results of HLA typing for 29 patients of the 52 patients with hepatotoxic liver injury and for 22 patients of 52 patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Conclusion: The paper points to hepatotoxicity, which is not rare in our population. Structure of xenobiotics causing liver toxicity in our environment is mainly industrial toxins, as well as food and beverages, more than drugs. It would be necessary to examine what are the ingredients of food causing hepatotoxicity.

40|$|Cilj ispitivanja bio je odrediti mjesto paracetamola u liječenju hipertoničara s artrozom, i utvrditi najpovoljniju kombinaciju antihipertenziva i antireumatika za te pacijente. U prospektivno ispitivanje provedeno u ordinaciji obiteljske {{medicine}} uključeno je 110 liječenih hipertoničara starijih od 55 godina; 50 u kontrolnu i 60 u interventnu skupinu (uzimali su i nesteroidne antireumatike zbog osteoartritisa). U tromjesečnom su razdoblju uspoređivana dva antihipertenziva, lizinopril/hidroklorotiazid i amlodipin s dva nesteroidna anrireumatika (NSAR) : ibuprofenom i piroksikamom, te s paracetamolom. Nakon svakog jednomjesečnog razdoblja mjeren je arterijski tlak, učinak ispitivanih lijekova na intenzitet boli i kvalitetu života ispitanika. Ibuprofen i piroksikam pokazali su značajno prohipertenzivno djelovanje, a u razdoblju uzimanja paracetamola ono je bilo neznatno i klinički zanemarivo. U podskupini amlodipin ± ibuprofen, prosječni rezultat na ljestvici boli statistički se značajno smanjivao tijekom pokusa. U podskupini lizinopril/hidroklorotiazid ± piroksikam prosječna procijenjena kvaliteta života značajno se mijenjala. Paracetamol je pokazao podjednaku analgetsku učinkovitost kao ibuprofen, a tek nešto slabiju od piroksikama. Kvaliteta života je u NSAR fazama bila lošija nego tijekom uzimanja paracetamola. Samo paracetamol nije utjecao na antihipertenzivno djelovanje lizinopril/ hidroklorotiazid kombinacije. U hipertoničara s artrozom paracetamol je analgetik prvog izbora, dok je antihipertenziv izbora jedan antagonist kalcija, navlastito amlodipin. Background: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) {{side effects}} can impair {{quality of life}} in patients with osteoarthritis. Due to its particular mechanism of action, paracetamol might bypass these negative effects. Objectives: To determine both the role of paracetamol in the treatment of osteoarthritis patients and optimal combination of antihypertensives and <b>antirheumatics</b> for these patients. Methods: A prospective clinical trial in a family practice included 110 treated hypertensives aged over 55 years: 50 controls and 60 also taking NSAIDs for osteoarthritis. This 3 -month study compared two antihypertensives, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide fixed combination and amlodipine, with two NSAIDs, ibuprofen and piroxicam, and with paracetamol. Following clinical work-up and NSAID discontinuation for at least 3 days (run-in period of only 3 - 7 days), osteoarthritis subjects were randomized to 1 -month periods of ibuprofen (400 - 600 mg t. i. d.) or piroxicam (10 - 20 mg o. d.) with one month of paracetamol (1000 mg t. i. d.) in the middle as a “wash-out” interval, continuing the prescribed amlodipine (5 - 10 mg o. d.) or lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide fixed drug combination (10 / 6. 25 - 20 / 12. 5 mg o. d.), while control subjects (hypertensives with no osteoarthritis) were just keeping their antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure was measured with standard mercury sphygmomanometer and with an automatic device, in standing, sitting and supine position. The intensity of arthritic pain (on a visual analogue scale from 1 to 10, where 0 means “no pain” and 10 “the worst pain you may imagine”) and the patient’s quality of life estimate (on a visual analogue scale from 1 to 10, where 0 means “general condition excellent” and 10 “the worst possible”) were recorded. Results: Blood pressure control was unchanged in the amlodipine group across the study periods and impaired in the lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide group during either ibuprofen or piroxicam, but not during paracetamol. In the amlodipine ± ibuprofen subgroup, the reduction of the average pain intensity score throughout the study was significant (2 = 8. 250; df 3; P= 0. 037). In the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide ± piroxicam subgroup, the assessed quality of life differed significantly (2 = 9. 716; df 3; P= 0. 018), while in the amlodipine ± ibuprofen and amlodipine ± piroxicam subgroups the changes were marginal (2 = 6. 936; df 3; P= 0. 072 and 2 = 7. 146; df 3; P= 0. 065, respectively). Discussion: In our trial, paracetamol had analgesic efficacy similar to ibuprofen and only marginally inferior to piroxicam. The analgesic effect of ibuprofen, piroxicam and paracetamol was more pronounced in amlodipine than in the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide subgroups. The quality of life was reported to be worse with NSAIDs than with paracetamol, presumably due to dyspeptic problems. Although during the paracetamol phases, the quality of life was slightly improved, the difference was statistically nonsignificant because of the small samples and insufficiently sensitive scale. Conclusion: Analgesic efficiency of paracetamol is comparable to that of ibuprofen and is marginally inferior to piroxicam. Only paracetamol did not interfere with the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide combination. Piroxicam and ibuprofen markedly blunt the effects of antihypertensive drugs while paracetamol is almost inert in this sense. Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination is much more affected by this interaction than amlodipine. Because of less side effects and better tolerability, paracetamol is the analgesic of choice for hypertensive patients with osteoarthritis, needed prolonged pain relief. The second choice drugs are narcotic analgesics (e. g., tramadol). Small doses of NSAIDs can eventually be added with concomitant prescription of gastroprotective agents...|$|R
