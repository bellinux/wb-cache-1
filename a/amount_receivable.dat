It was expected that credit-rating agencies will assist the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and investors by revealing the risk. However, given that they pursue their own objectives, of increasing business volume and revenue, credit-rating agencies may not pay attention to investor risks though they claim to do so. This study defines regulatory practices against this backdrop. It is obvious that regulatory measures can be directed to the originator, SPV, or the credit-rating agency. We attempt a comparative evaluation and arrive at an efficient design of regulatory mechanisms and derive the implied credit ratings.

In Brazil, securitization was developed mostly {{in the form of}} mutual funds - the FIDC, which raise money by issuing senior cotes for qualified investors, and subordinated cotes, usually bought by the company that originated the receivables. This paper evaluates the risk and return for both kinds of investors through a stochastic model with two main variables: interest rates and default rates. The model is still sensible to the characteristics of the fund, like the amount of subordinated cotes, the type of asset being securitized; and the <b>amount</b> of <b>receivables</b> in relation to the assets. Regarding the case of senior cotes, the risk of returns under the basic level of interest rates is highly improbable; {{and in the case of}} subordinated cotes, the risk of returns under the basic interest rate may be considered still low, due to the high spreads observed in the Brazilian financial market. The simulations indicated that under historically mean interest rate volatility the default rates are the main component of the total risk. Accordingly to the developed analysis of international standards of regulation, the Brazilian Central Bank imposes very strong capital requirements to banks that securitize their assets and purchase the corresponding subordinated cotes...|$|R

40|$|In China?s bank-based {{financial}} system, {{in parallel}} with formal banking institutions, there is a flourishing informal financial market. Informal financial institutions contribute to meeting the ever increasing credit demand of China?s private enterprises {{that seem to be}} neglected by the largely state-owned formal banking sector. Private firms would prefer to borrow at lower cost from the formal sector, but in lack of credit history or credit rating they may be rejected. Smaller firms in non-manufacturing sectors and with lower profitability have less chance to obtain formal credit. Formal and informal financial institutions co-exist in China and have different approaches to lending decisions to the private sector. This paper investigates the determinants of the size of formal and informal financing and the conditions of access to formal bank loans across private firms. The result of the empirical analysis suggests that loan officers at formal and informal financial institutions take into account different factors when extending loans. While formal banks focus on past performance of the firm, such as credit rating, previous tax payments and credit history, as well as the size of the firm and manufacturing activities, informal institutions put a relatively higher weight on current operations. The <b>amount</b> of <b>receivables</b> is a very important determinant {{of the size of the}} loan extended. Further, informal institutions exploit the information on earlier borrowing from the formal banking sector, suggesting that they may economise on the monitoring costs and that there may be a certain merit of co-existence of formal and informal finance. ...|$|R

25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. Accrual basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The accrual basis allows you to track <b>receivables</b> (<b>amounts</b> due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|R
30|$|China’s {{small and}} middle {{enterprises}} (SMEs) account for 99 % {{of the total}} number of enterprises, and provide more than 80 % jobs, which is an important part of the national economy. However, due to the lack of sufficient collateral and the opaque information, it is difficult to obtain financial support from financial institutions. The problem of financing difficulties is a huge obstacle to the development of small and micro enterprises (Jiang et al. 2014; Wang 2016). Moreover, SMEs are often in a weak position in the product supply chain. Accounts receivable and advance prepayments occupy most of the liquidity of these enterprises, which undoubtedly would exacerbate their financial strain, increase the risk of capital chain broken, affect their normal operations and greatly reduce their production efficiency (Yao and Liu 2018; Zhu et al. 2016). Supply chain finance service takes the real trade background as the premise and relies on a core enterprise which effectively integrate the capital flow into the supply chain management process (Gelsomino et al. 2016; Lekkakos and Serrano 2016). Supply chain finance as a new way to solve the financing problems of SMEs would revitalize massive “dead” assets such as accounts receivable, prepayments and inventory warehouse receipts.

5000|$|On February 28, 1845, {{the representatives}} {{sitting in the}} Legislative Assembly {{unanimously}} adopted the text of an address asking Governor Metcalfe to take measures to compensate the inhabitants of Lower Canada whose properties were damaged or destroyed during the armed conflict of 1837-8. Prior to that, {{in the course of}} the last session of the Parliament of Upper Canada on October 23, 1840, the representatives had passed an act (3 Vict. c. 76) to indemnify certain parties for losses incurred during the uprising in that province in 1837. A credit of £40,000 had been appropriated to address claims made by inhabitants, but no amount had been spent because the treasury of the province was empty. Amending an act passed in 1838, the act of 1840 provided for the indemnification of civilians whose property had been damaged without enquiring into the presumed loyalty of persons during the armed conflict. On its part, the Special Council of Lower Canada had also issued an ordinance, in 1838, to indemnify certain parties, but on the basis of their presumed loyalty to the crown.On March 29, 1845, the governor assented to a bill allocating the revenue from the tavern licences in Canada West to the payment of claims by habitants settled in the former Upper Canada who had still not received any compensation. [...] A sum of £38,658 was raised between April 5, 1845 and January 24, 1849 by the means of this law. Later, in 1846, the revenues from wedding licences were also allocated for the same purpose. Following the adoption of the address to the governor in 1845, the Draper-Viger government set up, on November 24, a commission enquire into the claims the inhabitants of Lower Canada had sent since 1838, to determine those that were justified and provide an estimate of the amount to be paid. The five commissioners, Joseph Dionne, P. H. Moore, Jacques Viger, John Simpson and Joseph-Ubalde Beaudry, submitted their first report in April 1846. They received instructions from the government to distinguish between claims made by persons participating in the rebellion and those who had given no support to the insurrectionist party. The total of the claims considered <b>receivable</b> <b>amounted</b> to £241,965, 10 s. and 5d., but the commissioners were of opinion that following a more thorough enquiry into the claims they were unable to make, the amount to be paid by the government would likely not go beyond £100,000. The Assembly passed a motion on June 9, 1846 authorizing a compensation of £9,986 for claims studied prior to the presentation of the report. Nothing further was accomplished on this question until the dissolution of parliament on December 6, 1847.|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. Due to {{uncertainties}} experienced {{while working}} for the South African Revenue Services {{and the fact that}} there are no specific sections in the Income Tax Act no. 58 of 1962 dealing with interest, foreign exchange and bad and doubtful debts of commercial banks there were a need to undertake a study. The study therefore undertakes an examination to determine if the existing sections of the Income Tax Act dealing with interest, foreign exchange and bad and doubtful debts are enough legislation to deal with the interest, foreign exchange and bad and doubtful debts of commercial banks. The study also try to clear all existing uncertainties experienced and mentioned in this study. The study can be divided into the following four parts: A literature study of the definition of "bank" and "banking operations", in terms of history and current legislation. A study of the definition of "interest" and "finance charges", in terms of sections of the Income Tax Act, Act no. 58 of 1962 and applicable court cases. The chapter also concentrates on the application of section 24 J of the Income Tax Act on the interest-transactions of commercial banks as well as the identification of any short falls of the section. Before interest can be treated in terms of section 24 J of the Income Tax Act, the source of the interest will have to be in South Africa. General sourse principles applicable to commercial banks as well as the deductability of interest expenses when expenced to generate exempt income will therefore also be covered in this chapter. A study of the application of section 241 of the Income Tax Act dealing with the foreign exchange of commercial banks. An examination of the way commercial banks should treat their bad and doubtful debts and the factors taken into account in court decisions relating thereto. The most important activities of a bank are identified in this study as the acceptance of deposits, the provision of credit, rendering of financial services and the trade in exchange and the utilisation of money and interest received. In terms of section 24 J of the Income Tax Act, interest include finance charges, premiums or disconto's, all interests and the difference between all <b>amounts</b> payable or <b>receivable</b> in terms of a sale and leaseback agreement. It was found that all the interest of a commercial bank are included in the definition of interest and all the transactions of a commercial bank are treated in terms of section 24 J of the Income Tax Act for income tax purposes. Section 241 of the Income Tax Act focuses on foreign exchange transactions and are found to be enough legislation for the foreign exchange transactions of commercial banks. Although bad and doubtful debts are not part of the activities of a commercial bank they are part of the uncertainties experienced {{while working for}} the South African Revenue Services. During the study it was found that doubtful debts can not be deducted in terms of section 11 (a) of the Income Tax Act but only in terms of section 11 (j) of the Income Tax Act. It is practice for the South African Revenue Services to only allows 25 % of the full amount of doubtful debts, but as this discretion is subject to objection and appeal, the bank is entitled to claim a higher percentage as a deduction if they can provide proveto justify a higher deduction. It was also found that commercial banks can claim their bad debts in term of section 11 (a) of the Income Tax Act...|$|R
