25|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with the United States, online banking {{arrived in the}} United Kingdom. The UK's first home online banking services known as Homelink {{was set up by}} Bank of Scotland for customers of the Nottingham Building Society (NBS) in 1983. The system used was based on the UK's Prestel viewlink system and used a computer, such as the BBC Micro, or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected to the telephone system and television set. The system allowed on-line viewing of statements, bank transfers and bill payments. In order to make bank transfers and bill payments, a written instruction giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the <b>account</b> <b>holder</b> via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to the payee and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the <b>account</b> <b>holder.</b> BACS was later used to transfer the payment directly.|$|E
25|$|The {{shift toward}} {{the use of}} these {{receipts}} as a means of payment took place in the mid-17th century, as the price revolution, when relatively rapid gold inflation, was causing a re-assessment of how money worked. The goldsmith-bankers of London began to give out the receipts as payable to the bearer of the document rather than the original depositor. This meant that the note could be used as currency based on the security of the goldsmith, not the <b>account</b> <b>holder</b> of the Goldsmith-banker.|$|E

GLBA encourages the organizations covered by GLBA to implement safeguards against pretexting. [...] For example, a well-written plan [...] designed to meet GLB's Safeguards Rule ("develop, monitor, and test a program to secure the information") would likely include a section on training employees to recognize and deflect inquiries made under pretext. [...] In fact, the evaluation of the effectiveness of such employee training probably should include a follow-up program of random spot checks, [...] "outside the classroom", after completion of the [...] employee training, in order to check on the resistance of a given (randomly chosen) student to various types of [...] "social engineering"—perhaps even designed to focus attention on any new wrinkle that might have arisen after the [...] effort to [...] "develop" [...] the curriculum for such employee training.
