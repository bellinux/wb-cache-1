5|$|When {{the boys}} regain consciousness, they are {{backstage}} at the Televised Jonas Brothers' 3D concert spectacular at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Mickey interrogates them and eventually threatens {{them with a}} chainsaw, refusing to believe they are not working for another company. As Mickey once again rants about his true intentions, this time insulting the Jonas Brothers' fans and Christians, Kyle stealthily turns {{on one of the}} microphones and Cartman raises the curtain, broadcasting Mickey's rant to both the concert-goers and the national television audience. When Mickey realizes that the curtains are raised, the crowd turns on Mickey and the Jonas Brothers leave the stage in <b>a</b> <b>huff.</b> An enraged Mickey grows to an enormous size and begins blowing fire and destroying most of Denver. Tammy and Kenny remove their purity rings, and Tammy suggests they go to T.G.I. Friday's, much to Kenny's excitement. The show immediately cuts to Kenny's funeral, where the audience learns that he contracted syphilis after receiving a blowjob from his girlfriend Tammy Warner and died as a result.|$|E

The argument ends with Abe's leaving in <b>a</b> <b>huff.</b> After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, {{has a couple of}} drinks, and goes to see the film Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons. Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially claims to be a Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her.|$|E

25|$|Ian McTeague (Charles Napier) - A corrupt greedy businessman. He {{started up}} an illegal mining {{operation}} near the mountain, {{where he and}} his men believe that there is gold for them to dig. As they do so, they use the water from the river to irrigate their operation, where they separate the dirt from ore with chemicals, which are then later spilled out into the rest of the river heading towards the jungle. Because of this, it has caused a plague among the animals drinking it (even Tantor almost fell victim to it). Even the Waziri tribe fell victim to the plague, as they used the river for their crops and drinking. Needless to say, McTeague doesn't care about the toxicity of the chemicals and continues dumping them into the river, as he still wants to be rich. Upon learning about the mine, Tarzan and his friends ally with the Waziri tribe to build a dam to block the river and then break it down to have the rushing water destroy the whole mine operation for good, leaving the river fresh and clean again. McTeague and his men then leave in <b>a</b> <b>huff,</b> but not after McTeague angrily swears revenge against Tarzan and the Waziri tribe for ruining his mining operation.|$|E

500|$|Wilde's {{friends had}} advised {{him against the}} {{prosecution}} at a Saturday Review meeting at the CafÃ© Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned him that [...] "they are going to prove sodomy against you" [...] and advised him to flee to France. Wilde and Douglas walked out in <b>a</b> <b>huff,</b> Wilde saying [...] "it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome {{a day or so}} before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} gave the episode mixed to {{negative}} reviews. Tom Ryan of WhatCulture rated the episode {{two and a}} half out of five stars, summing up the review with; [...] "Given the popularity of the original book and the success thus far of the current TV series, it is safe to assume that last nights episode was perhaps the most eagerly anticipated installment of the show since its inception. Too bad then that it was so underwhelming." [...] The Guardian writer Stuart Heritage stated; [...] "Last night's Hounds of Baskervilles wasn't quite as rapturously received as other adventures, perhaps because of {{the amount of time that}} Cumberbatch and Freeman spent apart. The whole middle section, where Watson stormed off in <b>a</b> <b>huff</b> after being subjected to another one of Sherlock's baroque [...] "that man is left-handed and also has dog hair on one of his socks" [...] monologues, felt slow and flat precisely because there was none of the chemistry between the two leads that we've come to expect from Sherlock." [...] Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror stated that the episode was [...] "a disappointment," [...] adding that the contrasting reveal of the hound from the original book was [...] "a tedious treatise against vivisection." [...] However, Shelley stated that he enjoyed the [...] "mind palace" [...] scene.|$|E

Tarquini passed Huff {{at the start of}} the second lap and the pair began to stretch the gap back to third-placed Priaulx. However, on the final lap, Tarquini {{suffered}} a front-left puncture on the run down to the Ascari chicane. <b>As</b> <b>Huff</b> moved out to pass him, he also suffered a front-left puncture. The pair limped down the following straight, with Priaulx and the following pack closing them down. However, the leading pair could not be passed initially, with yellow flags out at the beginning of the Parabolica after Leonel PernÃ­a had slid into the gravel on the previous lap. Once the green flags were shown, Priaulx and Farfus passed the slowing Tarquini and then <b>Huff,</b> to take <b>a</b> dramatic one-two finish for BMW.

However, Basil occasionally laments for the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost. Also, it appears he still does care for her, and actively resists the flirtations of a French guest in one episode. The penultimate episode, [...] "The Anniversary", is about his efforts to put together a surprise anniversary party [...] involving their closest friends. Things go wrong as Basil pretends the anniversary date doesn't remind him of anything though he pretends to have a stab at it by reeling off a list of random anniversaries, starting with the Battle of Agincourt, for which he receives a slap from Sybil, who becomes increasingly frustrated and angry. He continues guessing even after Sybil is out of earshot, and mentions other anniversaries (none of which happened on 17 April), including the Battle of Trafalgar and Yom Kippur, just to enhance the surprise. Sybil believes he really has forgotten, and leaves in <b>a</b> <b>huff.</b> In an interview in the DVD box set, Cleese claims this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple (as well as saying that, if a third series had been made, there would have been similar episodes).|$|E
2500|$|Act Two begins {{six months}} later, and still {{there is no}} sign of Drood. There is much {{speculation}} as to his fate.

It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator. They sing [...] "Settling Up The Score". The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, [...] "don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!", telling them to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever. [...] However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is not chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in <b>a</b> <b>huff.</b> [...] Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead" [...] to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.|$|E

[...] 800 segadors ("reapers;" [...] the term rebel farmers adopted) marched on PuigcerdÃ  and ordered that no one should work unless they received a minimum wage of 4 reales, inspiring similar incidents in other towns as the idea spread. [...] Clergy became involved in disputes with the citizenry over tithes, sparking a riot on June 13. [...] On June 14, rioters opened an armory and armed the citizenry. [...] The rioters relaxed the next day, the feast of Corpus Christi; this gave soldiers the opportunity to sneak into the armory and defeat the budding revolt. [...] Four popular leaders were hanged on July 5, and four more on August 9, but nevertheless a constellation of uprisings took place across Catalonia. [...] Riots even struck Barcelona itself. [...] Most uprisings were small in scale and targeted against upper class Catalans exempt from the military contribution, or against unpopular citizens who no longer had the protection of a working government such as bankers, tax collectors, and moneylenders.|$|E
