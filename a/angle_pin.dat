40|$|X-CorTM and K-CorTM are foam based {{lightweight}} structural cores {{reinforced with}} ZFiber ® rods oriented in a truss pattern. They can generate sandwich structures which possess strength- and stiffness-to-weight ratios such {{to compete with}} aerospace grade honeycomb constructions. The enhanced tailoring ability to specific design needs, the flexibility in reinforcement type and arrangement, the variety between closed cell foamfilled or hollow core configurations for ultimate weight savings or structural multifunctionality, while utilising manufacturing procedures similar to traditional honeycomb sandwich structures (low cost out-of-autoclave manufacturing techniques included) make these novel materials an attractive alternative. The process of their implementation into current engineering practice requires a parallel comparison with existing competitor cores and a critical evaluation of their performance, identifying advantages and disadvantages. This study {{represents one of the}} first attempts to create a rigorous methodology for the analysis and evaluation of their mechanical behaviour and manufacturing sensitivities. The balance of out-of-plane properties (shear and compression), fundamental for a sandwich core material, has been investigated. The material energy absorption capacity for the aforementioned loading cases, as well as for in-plane crushing was evaluated. For this purpose, a new quasi-static test for progressive crushing of flat sandwich laminates was designed successfully. The experimental data gathered validate proposed analytical models which allowed further deductions on core parameters influence to be made. Those parameters were the pin insertion <b>angle,</b> <b>pin</b> lay-out, pin density {{and the role of the}} foam. A local-global FE modelling approach for Z-pinned sandwich cores is also provided and validated for X-CorTM structures. Structural differences between XCorTM and K-CorTM are at the base of a diverse mechanical response; their performance is sensitive to the manufacturing process, as it determines the quality of the pin-skin and pin-adhesive film interfaces. An ‘improved’ manufacturing technique designed for XCorTM resulted in a sandwich panel able to offer the same mechanical performance of a Nomex® honeycomb structure for a 25 % of weight saving.

5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes the slides to move forward along the <b>angle</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R

40|$|For flows at {{the micro}} and nano scales {{the surface to}} volume {{fraction}} is increased and therefore the behavior of fluids in contact with solid structures is primarily dominated by surface tension effects. Modeling of surface tension effects at nano and micro scales using smoothed particle hydrodynamics requires an efficient description {{not only of the}} interface between liquid and gas, but also of the triple line defined by the three phase contact between the solid, liquid and gas. In this study, we propose an efficient and reliable implementation, which takes the liquid-gas surface tension and the equilibrium contact angle as input parameters and prescribes the normal direction of the liquid-gas interface at the triple line based on the desired equilibrium contact angle. This results in a robust algorithm capable of capturing the physics of equilibrium wetting and treating a large variety of cases including different wetting <b>angles,</b> <b>pinning</b> effects and wetting of structu red surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the show was between The Rock and Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship. At SummerSlam, The Rock {{defeated}} Kurt Angle and Triple H in a Triple threat match to retain the WWF Championship.

At Armageddon (2000), <b>Angle</b> <b>pinned</b> The Rock to retain the WWF title in a Hell in a Cell, also involving Steve Austin, Triple H, Rikishi and The Undertaker. On the January 1 episode of Raw Is War, The Rock lost a #1 contenders match to Kane by countout after Angle interfered. A few days later on SmackDown!, Rock lost a non-title match to Angle by disqualification after attacking Angle with a steel chair. On the February 8 episode of SmackDown!, The Rock defeated The Big Show to become the #1 contender to the WWF Championship at No Way Out..|$|R
500|$|This bout was {{followed}} by a WrestleMania 21 rematch that involved Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle. In a brawling match, Angle had an Ankle Lock [...] applied on Michaels. Moments later, however, Michaels recuperated and performed Sweet Chin Music on <b>Angle</b> before <b>pinning</b> <b>Angle</b> for the win. After the match, both men were given a standing ovation. An in-ring segment took place next between Raw's ring announcer, Lilian Garcia and Viscera. During the segment, Garcia proposed to Viscera. Before Viscera could have given an answer, he was interrupted by The Godfather. The Godfather gave Viscera advice about the life he would miss out on if he got married. This led to Viscera rejecting Garcia's marriage proposal and leaving the ring with the Godfather's hos and abandoning a crying Garcia in the ring.|$|R
5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle, with Daivari as the special guest referee. Early in the match, Angle {{was able to}} apply the Ankle lock on Cena. Cena reached the ropes but Daivari kicked his hand off. An angered Cena slapped Daivari, who tried to disqualify him as a result. Angle, however, stopped him, and both men were knocked {{out of the ring}} by Cena. As Daivari was knocked down outside, a Raw referee came out to officiate. After Cena gained the advantage, Angle knocked down the referee, and {{executed}} an illegal low blow. Angle called for another referee, but failed to get the win after executing an Angle Slam and a superplex. After Angle missed a moonsault, Cena went for an FU but Angle countered by holding onto the referee, which led to Angle knocking down the referee. As the other referee was knocked out, SmackDown referee Charles Robinson came out. Cena then delivered a DDT to Daivari and executed an FU on <b>Angle,</b> <b>pinning</b> him to retain the title.|$|R
50|$|In {{the seventh}} match, Stone Cold Steve Austin defended the WWF Championship against Kurt Angle. Austin {{performed}} a Stone Cold Stunner on Angle for a near-fall.

50|$|In early January 2006, Angle {{returned}} to the SmackDown! brand as a surprise entrant in a twenty-man battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Angle won by last eliminating Mark Henry, turning face in the process {{for the first time}} since 2004. He retained the title against Henry at the Royal Rumble. Shortly after the match, The Undertaker made his return and challenged Angle for the title. At No Way Out, Angle retained the title against Undertaker after a controversial finish where <b>Angle</b> <b>pinned</b> Taker while locked in a triangle choke. As a result, Undertaker challenged Angle to a rematch on the March 3 episode of SmackDown!, where Angle won by disqualification after Mark Henry interfered and attacked Undertaker. This ensured that Angle would go to WrestleMania 22 as champion. Angle then began a three way feud with 2006 Royal Rumble winner Rey Mysterio and Randy Orton (who defeated Mysterio at No Way Out to gain entrance to the SmackDown main event at WrestleMania). At WrestleMania, Angle indirectly dropped the title to Mysterio in the triple threat match after Mysterio pinned Orton.|$|R
