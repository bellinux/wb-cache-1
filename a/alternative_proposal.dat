5|$|According to Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, a {{subgroup}} of the IAU met on August 18, 2006 {{and held a}} straw poll on the draft proposal: only 18 were in favour of it, with over 50 against. The 50 in opposition preferred an <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> drawn up by Uruguayan astronomer Julio Ángel Fernández.|$|E
5|$|Microfossils {{dating from}} – just 3million {{years after the}} end of the Cryogenian glaciations– may {{represent}} embryonic 'resting stages' in the life cycle of the earliest known animals.

5|$|After the 2000 election, Fletcher {{crafted a}} {{compromise}} bill that allowed patients to sue their HMOs in federal court, capped {{pain and suffering}} awards at $500,000, and eliminated punitive damage awards. Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to state courts under certain circumstances and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher's bill by President George W. Bush, the House refused to pass it, favoring an <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> by Georgia's Charlie Norwood that was less restrictive on patient lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> {{would keep}} the {{existing}} station open but with many services calling only at a new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E
5|$|By March 1962, the trilateral {{talks in}} Geneva had shifted to 18-party talks at the UN Disarmament Conference. On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required on-site inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.|$|E
5|$|The {{suitability}} {{of the prison}} was finally brought to a head at the 1821 assizes in York, when an official complaint was made and an investigation begun. The decision was taken to purchase Clifford's Tower and the Waud house, {{with the aim of}} demolishing them both to make room for a new, more modern prison. Sydney Smith, the famous wit, writer and vicar of Foston-le-Clay, successfully led a campaign to save Clifford's Tower, emphasising the historic importance of the location for the surrounding city. An <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal,</b> put forward by architect Robert Wallace, would have seen the conversion of Clifford's Tower back into a habitable building to form the hub of a radial prison design, but this was turned down.|$|E

5|$|Widerøe {{came with}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> and {{suggested}} that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing (STOL) aircraft. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower costs than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, that it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population. The regional airports were built in groups, and the first four were built in Namsos and Helgeland.|$|E
5|$|A committee, led by Erik Himle {{and later}} Preben Munthe, was {{appointed}} in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle {{was about to}} the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including one airport in Florø. Widerøe came with an <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal.

5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E

5|$|In {{an initial}} attempt {{to settle the}} area, the {{government}} declared the land open for pastoral settlement by ordinary settlers, but little progress was made. By 1840, the population was just fifty-three, {{and most of those}} were in or near Bunbury (then known as Port Leschenault). The settlement of Australind by the Western Australian Land Company in 1840–41 prompted the first real need for a good quality road to Perth. Throughout much of 1842, there was much debate and discussion over providing a new route to Bunbury. A coastal route from Fremantle had been proposed, while an <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> published on 11 May was a new route from Pinjarra to Bunbury, via an upstream crossing of the Harvey River, where a bridge could easily be built. The coastal route would have required a ferry to cross the Murray River's estuary, and would not go through Pinjarra, a significant settlement in the area; however, it would be shorter, had more water along the route, and would go through the village of Mandurah, which had a population of twenty-nine people from six families.|$|E

25|$|Brazil {{proposed}} a military alliance to Rosas: Rosas would take Uruguay with Brazilian support, and Brazil {{would take the}} Riograndese Republic with Argentine support. Tomás Guido, Argentine representative in Brazil, supported the proposal, but Rosas rejected it. Rosas thought that such treaty would violate the Uruguayan sovereignty, {{and that it would}} be null if Oribe was not part of it. Honório Carneiro Leão, representative of Brazil, did not accept Rosas's <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal,</b> and Brazil distanced from Argentina.|$|E

25|$|The {{break-through}} for {{the ship}} registration {{came in the}} 1900–01 parliamentary session, when a private, <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> was launched.< The latter instead involved establishing a series of local registers. The Ship Registration Act was approved by Parliament on 4 May 1901. A government commission looked into the detailed aspects of registration and the Council of State approved these on 23 July 1902. This resulted in about fifty district courts being given the task of maintaining local ship registers covering their jurisdiction. They were known by names such as Bergen Ship Register.|$|E
25|$|After his {{election}} on 5 May 2005, Charles Kennedy appointed Williams as Liberal Democrat public health spokesperson, shadowing Minister for Public Health Caroline Flint. In this role {{he served on}} the standing committee which scrutinised the Health Bill. One aspect of this Bill was {{the introduction of a}} ban on smoking in public places. Williams strongly supported a ban on smoking in all public places, rather than the <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> to exempt private clubs and pubs which do not serve food from the ban. He won an award from Cancer Research UK for his advocacy of a full ban.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two years, work on a new {{constitution}} was done, with independent drafts prepared in 1990 and 1991. At the end of 1991, the Supreme Council established a commission tasked to prepare a draft constitution. The resulting proposal {{was approved by the}} Supreme Council on April 21, 1992, and presented to the public. An alternative draft constitution was prepared by a coalition led by Sąjūdis. The main difference between the two proposals was the balance between the various branches of government. The proposal approved by the Supreme Council envisioned a parliamentary system, while the <b>alternative</b> <b>proposal</b> suggested a presidential model. The final document represented a compromise between a purely parliamentary system and a presidential one.|$|E

At the request of the Mayor of Venice, Massimo Cacciari, approximately ten of these projects were examined in 2006 by round tables of experts appointed by individual responsible bodies, including the Higher Council of Public Works. In November 2006, negative assessments of the <b>alternative</b> <b>proposals</b> by these round tables led the government to give definitive approval for the MOSE project with the <b>alternative</b> <b>proposals</b> deemed ineffective or inappropriate to guarantee the defence of Venice.|$|R
