5|$|In 1997, the Manzanar At Dusk program {{became a}} part of the Pilgrimage. The program attracts local area residents, as well as {{descendants}} of Manzanar's ranch days and the town of Manzanar. Through small group discussions, the event gives participants the opportunity to hear directly about the experiences of former incarcerees first-hand, to share their experiences and feelings <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> learned, and talk about the relevance of what happened at Manzanar to their own lives.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could find. Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E
5|$|During dinner, {{the family}} is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an {{argument}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> should be doing with them. Aliens Kang and Kodos {{see this as an}} opportunity to strike Earth, and an alien invasion unfolds. Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E

Kenneth asks Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{to feed his}} bird, as he is busy with two jobs now. Kenneth asks Tracy not to enter his bedroom, a request that makes Tracy curious. Believing Kenneth might be a serial killer, he tells Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and they decide to investigate Kenneth's bedroom. At Kenneth's apartment, they discover a bug bomb in his room, and reaching the conclusion that Kenneth is trying to poison them and they run out of his apartment. They forget {{to close the door}} and the bug bomb ends up killing the bird. When they tell Kenneth about his bird, he is more upset by the fact that Tracy and Jenna did not trust him, than the death of his bird. Tracy and Jenna, feeling horrible <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have done, arrange a surprise for Kenneth at his apartment. When Kenneth goes home, he finds an entire collection of birds.|$|E

5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
