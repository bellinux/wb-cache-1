She sues for sex discrimination and Kenny's promotion is reversed. She tells Kenny that she would be proud to serve under him but tells Sheriff Brock that his blatant bigotry has made her less proud to serve under him.|$|E
25|$|Since parve food is {{reclassified}} if {{it takes}} on the flavour of meat or dairy produce, Ashkenazi Jews traditionally forbid eating parve contents of a pot {{that has been used}} within 24 hours to cook meat, if the parve contents would be eaten with dairy produce. Their tradition similarly forbids eating parve foods with meat if the cooking vessel was used to cook dairy produce within the previous 24 hours. According to Joseph Caro, the Sephardic tradition was more lenient <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things,</b> but Moses Isserles argued that such leniency was unreliable.|$|E
25|$|While many {{theories}} on motivation have a mentalistic perspective, behaviorists {{focus only on}} observable behavior and theories founded on experimental evidence. In the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored. Where others would speculate <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as values, drives, or needs, {{that may not be}} observed directly, behaviorists are interested in the observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency and duration of observable behavior. Through the basic research of such scientists as Pavlov, Watson and Skinner, several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified. The most important of these are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.|$|E

The hardships were already evident in 2015, when the country failed to send a team at the European Team Chess Championship due to {{monetary}} difficulties. Boris Gelfand, who played on board one for Israel at nine consecutive Olympiads (1998–2014), said {{the management of the}} Israel Chess Federation have [...] "absolutely forgotten <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as the prestige of the country".

500|$|In the 1930s Campbell became {{interested}} in Joseph Rhine's theories about ESP (Rhine had already founded Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University when Campbell was a student there), and over the following years his growing interest in parapsychology would {{be reflected in the}} stories he published when he encouraged the writers to include these topics in their tales, leading to the publication of numerous works about telepathy and other psionic abilities. His increasing tendencies would eventually start to isolate and alienate him from some of his own writers. He wrote favorably <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as the [...] "Dean drive", a device that supposedly produced thrust in violation of Newton's third law, and the [...] "Hieronymus machine", which could supposedly amplify psi powers.|$|E
500|$|In October 1955, Hans Stefan Santesson, an American writer, editor, and reviewer, began {{contributing}} [...] "Universe in Books", {{the regular}} book review column. A year later, with the September 1956 issue, Santesson took over from Margulies as editor. One immediate change {{was an increase}} in the number of articles about UFOs. Santesson ran several articles by Ivan T. Sanderson, among others, including articles on auras and on the abominable snowman. However, he also ran polemical articles opposed to the UFO mania, including strongly worded pieces by Lester del Rey and C.M. Kornbluth. Del Rey, at least, felt that Santesson was not a believer in UFOs: [...] "So far as I could determine, Santessen [...] was skeptical <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things,</b> but felt that all sides deserved a hearing and also that the controversies were good for circulation." ...|$|E

During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things,</b> all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June.

Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to not tell me <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things.</b> They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Putnam cited {{examples}} from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties. The answer to this puzzle had to be that mental states were realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, {{should not be considered}} incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack the same neurochemistry as humans. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an [...] "ambitious" [...] and [...] "highly implausible" [...] conjecture which could be disproven with one example of multiple realizability. This argument is sometimes referred to as the [...] "likelihood argument".|$|E

2500|$|Foot's first {{stint at}} Private Eye lasted until 1972 when, {{according}} to Patrick Marnham, Foot was effectively sacked by Richard Ingrams {{who had come}} to the conclusion that Foot's copy was being unduly influenced by his contacts in the International Socialists. Ingrams has denied this: [...] "It was said at the time that he and I had fallen out over political issues. In fact, we very seldom disagreed <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things,</b> the only tension arising from Paul's belief that whenever there was a strike he had to support the union regardless of any rights or wrongs." [...] In October 1972 he left to join the Socialist Worker, the weekly newspaper of the IS, [...] "confident that a revolution was coming", as he explained decades later.

2500|$|In East Asia, {{the idea}} of Buddha nature being {{inherent}} in all beings is taken to mean that, spiritually at least, the sexes are equal, and this is expressed by the Lion’s Roar of Queen Srimala sutra. Based on this ideal of Buddha nature, the Chinese Chan (Zen) school emphasized the equality of the sexes. Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163) of the Chinese Linji school said of women in Buddhism: [...] "For mastering the truth, {{it does not matter}} whether one is male or female, noble or base." [...] The Japanese founder of Soto Zen, Dogen wrote: [...] "If you wish to hear the Dharma {{and put an end to}} pain and turmoil, forget <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as male and female.

In accordance with Vietnamese tradition, they were married three years after being betrothed in 1940. In May 1943, aged 18, she married Nhu, and converted from Mahayana Buddhism to Roman Catholicism, her husband's religion. Madame Nhu later admitted she married Nhu as a way of getting away from her family, saying [...] "I never had a sweeping love. I read <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> in books, but I do not believe that they really existed. Or perhaps only for a very few people".

2500|$|The editing {{of the car}} chase by Frank P. Keller likely won Keller {{the editing}} Oscar for 1968, and has been {{included}} in lists of the [...] "Best Editing Sequences of All-Time". Paul Monaco has written, [...] "The most compelling street footage of 1968, however, appeared in an entirely contrived sequence, with nary a hint of documentary feel about it – the car chase {{through the streets of}} San Francisco in Bullitt, created from footage shot over nearly five weeks. Billy Fraker, the cinematographer for the film, attributed the success of the chase sequence primarily to the work of the editor, Frank P. Keller. At the time, Keller was credited with cutting the piece in such a superb manner that he made the city of San Francisco a [...] "character" [...] in the film." [...] The editing of the scene was not without difficulties; Ralph Rosenblum wrote in 1979 that [...] "those who care <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> may know that during the filming of the climactic chase scene in Bullitt, an out-of-control car filled with dummies tripped a wire which prematurely sent a costly set up in flames, and that editor Frank Keller salvaged the near-catastrophe with a clever and unusual juxtaposition of images that made the explosion appear to go off on time." [...] This chase scene has also been cited by critics as groundbreaking in its realism and originality. In the release print and the print shown for many years, a scene in which the Charger actually hits the camera causing a red flare on screen, which many feel added to the realism, was edited out on DVD prints to the disappointment of many fans.|$|E
2500|$|Professor {{of journalism}} at Elon University, Michael Skube, argued in the editorial, [...] "The No. 1 reason to rank colleges," [...] against {{arguments}} {{made in the}} 11 March Washington Post article, [...] "The Cost of Bucking College Rankings" [...] by the President of Sarah Lawrence College, Michele Tolela Myers. Skube states that, while having some merit, these arguments were [...] "partly beside the point [...] U.S. News survey, for all its imperfections, performs the useful service of comparing apples with academic apples.In some ways, one might even argue that its nuts-and-bolts consumer information {{is at least as}} practical as the bar charts and numbers a car buyer might find in Consumer Reports or Car and Driver. What factors go into the rankings? Student retention accounts for 25% at schools U.S. News calls master's level and those that provide primarily the bachelor's degree (called 'comprehensive' schools, oddly enough)." [...] Skube also notes objections made to the reputation survey portion of the U.S. News survey and responds by stating that, [...] "one can see why." [...] However, he argues, [...] "sometimes just the facts will do, and the U.S. News manual offers them in great heaps [...] Sarah Lawrence, for example, does not take into consideration SAT or ACT scores. Don't even send 'em, it tells high school students. That tells me all I need to know about Sarah Lawrence. It tells me that Sarah Lawrence doesn't take aptitude as seriously as I'd like. The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone who has taught at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade point averages of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another. But if one college attracted high school students whose SATs averaged 1100 to 1200, and another attracted students with SATs averaging 1300 to 1400, I know the latter is more selective. Sarah Lawrence might not care <b>about</b> <b>such</b> <b>things,</b> but I do." ...|$|E
