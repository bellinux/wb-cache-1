5|$|The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was {{published}} and widely reviewed in 1838. In {{the summer of}} 1839, Poe became assistant editor of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine.

Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque {{was published}} in twovolumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.

5|$|Development took <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> a half, {{with the}} team aiming for as much realism as possible. Certain features, {{including}} multiplayer, were dropped. Over 15 million copies were sold, and ports for various games consoles were released, most in 1995. Theme Park received generally positive reviews. Reviewers praised the gameplay and humour, but criticised console ports for reasons such as lack of save or mouse support. The game received a Japanese localisation (in addition to normal Japanese releases), Shin Theme Park, released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and remakes for the Nintendo DS and iOS, released in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Theme Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, and two direct sequels followed: Theme Park World (known as Sim Theme Park in some territories) and Theme Park Inc (also known as SimCoaster).|$|E

Desperate for a job, Hastings accepted the offer of an apprenticeship with an English engineer who claimed to have made a machine to extract gold in North Wales.

5|$|Whilst Valiant {{was under}} construction, Westwood, Baillie went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and their shipyard {{was taken over}} by the Thames Ironworks. This delayed her launching by <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> a shortage of muzzle-loading guns delayed her completion by nearly five years. Hector, in contrast, served with the Channel Fleet from commissioning until 1867, when she was paid off to be re-armed and to refit. She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886 much like Valiants service as the First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland after her commissioning, where she remained until 1885. Both ships did little of significance until they were assigned to the Particular Service Squadron, commanded by Admiral Geoffrey Hornby, from June to August 1878 during the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War.|$|E

25|$|Early in the Civil War, Halleck was {{a senior}} Union Army {{commander}} in the Western Theater. He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862, during which time, while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back, the troops under Halleck's command won many important victories. However, Halleck was not present at the battles, and his subordinates deserved most of the credit. The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth {{in the spring of}} 1862, a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution. Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals, such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell. In July 1862, following Major General George B.
