25|$|Relevant is {{the fact}} that {{certainty}} is never absolute in practice (<b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> of David Hume's problem of induction). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This {{is an example of the}} butterfly effect, which is one of the subjects of chaos theory. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to predict real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to predict or attain certainty as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.|$|E

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic found the singer to have distinguished herself through [...] "desperate vulgarity". Erlewine concluded: [...] "All this stylized provocation is exhausting, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> there's {{so much of it}} (none of it actually arousing).

Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, [...] "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult."

[...] Hardeep Phull from New York Post appreciated the stage setup and the homage to old New York industrial setting and gave positive feedback for Gaga's choice to be an entertainer with the performances of [...] "You and I", [...] "Just Dance", and [...] "Applause". Jordan Runtagh from VH1 applauded Gaga's camaraderie with her fans, also noting that [...] "the abundance of movie cameras reminded us that this was a special moment, one that will go down in history. <b>And</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> these are the last performances at this storied venue. It's something more." [...] Runtagh believed that the performances solidified Gaga as a respectable entertainer and would generate further interest for the upcoming [...] tour. Amanda Holpuch from The Guardian complimented Gaga's vocals and her outfits, but felt that the show lacked [...] "something outrageous" [...] from the singer. She added that the most surprising incident of the night was when Gaga climbed a ladder to reach the mezzanine floors and sing from there.|$|E
500|$|Barker {{began using}} the {{pseudonym}} Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces {{to be accepted}} on merit <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> he, as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career. Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barker's agent Peter Eade, {{and they were very}} well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett [...] "Well, Gerald Wiley let us down there", and on another occasion, when looking at a script, [...] "I don't understand this line. What's he getting at?" [...] One of the first sketches he wrote was called [...] "Doctor's Waiting Room", with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wiley's 'request' for £3,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free. Speculation began about Wiley's identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and Noël Coward all rumoured. After the second series of Frost on Sunday, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him.|$|E

2500|$|To {{counteract}} {{the large number}} of departures, Robinson introduced several new characters, among them Melanie Healy played by Tamzin Outhwaite. In an interview with website Walfordweb, Matthew Robinson has stated that Melanie was [...] "dreamt up to supplement the 'totty' contingent – running thin at the time". Robinson stated that Tamzin Outhwaite was [...] "a shoo-in – <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> of her beautiful blonde hair.

Mel was brought into the serial as a member of the already established Healy family, joining her brother Reverend Alex Healy (Richard Driscoll) and father Jeff Healy (Leslie Schofield) in October 1998. Initially Mel's relationship with Alex and Jeff was not disclosed to viewers, and it was several weeks after her introduction that Mel actually came face-to-face with her brother on-screen; it was revealed that she had been estranged to them for some time.|$|E

[...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down.
