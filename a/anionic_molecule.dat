As a corollary effort, we investigated the adsorption of H(2) O, NaOH and KOH on the (II-IV) (n), nanostructure with n = 12, 48, 60 under the vacuum and solvent conditions. Different solvent environments like water, methanol and ethanol were considered using a conductor-like screening model (COSMO) method. Results showed that the adsorption reaches a fairly strong due to electrostatic interactions. The strength of interaction is increased in the order of <b>anionic</b> <b>molecule</b> (strong base) > <b>anionic</b> <b>molecule</b> (weak base) > non-ionic molecule, which explains the experimental results clearly.

40|$|Thrombin-activatable {{fibrinolysis}} inhibitor (TAFI) is a proenzyme that, once activated, attenuates fibrinolysis {{by removing}} C-terminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin. TAFI can be activated by thrombin or plasmin via a cleavage at Arg 92 that removes the activation peptide from the enzyme, TAFIa. Thrombomodulin enhances thrombin-mediated TAFI activation and glycosaminoglycans enhance plasmin-mediated TAFI activation. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether there are other <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> that function as a cofactor for thrombin- or plasmin-mediated TAFI activation. TAFI activation by thrombin or plasmin was studied in the presence of physiological <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> (polyphosphate, heparin, hyaluronan, DNA and dermatan sulfate) and the non-physiological sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Additionally, the effect of these molecules on TAFIa stability and on thrombin-mediated protein C activation was determined. Unfractioned heparin, calcium-saturated polyphosphate with an average chain length of 100 monomers (Ca-PolyP 100) and SDS significantly enhanced TAFI activation by thrombin and plasmin. Dermatan sulfate and polyphosphates with sodium as counter ion (Na-PolyP 700, Na-PolyP 100 and Na-PolyP 70) enhanced plasmin-mediated but not thrombin-mediated TAFI activation. Additionally, unfractioned heparin, Ca-PolyP 100 and SDS enhanced thrombin-mediated protein C activation. The different nature of <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> capable of enhancing TAFI and protein C activation suggests a general mechanism.

The bile acid was modified by introducing a diamine or a dicarboxylic aromatic residue on the lateral chain. The pure cationic surfactant self-assembles in a network of fibers with a cross-section gyration radius of about 15. 1 Å, providing hydrogels with a pH-dependent compactness. On the other hand, the <b>anionic</b> <b>molecule</b> gives rise to prolate ellipsoid micelles. Homogeneous catanionic mixtures have also been obtained, with molar fraction of each surfactant ranging from 0. 125 to 0. 875. At total surfactant concentration of 0. 05 % (w/v), the mixtures form gels of fibrils partially arranged in secondary twisted superstructures. Comparison of this concentration with the minimum gelation concentration of the pure cationic derivative (0. 16 % w/v) suggests that, in the mixtures, {{the presence of the}} electrostatic component in self-assembly of the molecules allows the formation of gels starting from more dilute samples.

Material A, whose molecular weight was greater than 440, 000, is probably nonspecific binding of Cd to normal cell components. Materials B and C can be classified as types of metallothionein. The molecular weight of B was 33, 100. This material contains 12 mg Cd/g protein. The UV-absorption spectrum of B showed absorptions at 280 and 250 nm.

Bikunin is a chondroitin-sulphate containing serum protein with a Stokes-Einstein radius and a negative net charge close to those of serum albumin. The plasma half life of bikunin is about 10 minutes, and approximately half of its clearance occurs in the kidneys. The quantitative role of glomerular filtration in the renal clearance of this protein has not been determined. To assess the glomerular permeability of bikunin we used isolated rat kidneys that were perfused with an albumin solution. The metabolic activities of the tubuli were inhibited by low temperature (8 °C). The clearances of radiolabeled bikunin and albumin were repeatedly determined under identical conditions. The fractional clearance of bikunin {{was found to be}} 80 times higher than that of albumin: 15 % ± 1 % versus 0. 18 % ± 0. 02 %. This value for bikunin can fully account for its renal clearance in vivo. It has previously been shown that uncharged flexible solutes, such as dextrans, have higher renal clearances than globular molecules with similar radii. The high glomerular permeability of bikunin is therefore probably due to its elongated and flexible configuration. Moreover, the observed clearance value of the <b>anionic</b> <b>molecule</b> bikunin is close to that of a neutral flexible dextran of similar size, indicating that the charge of bikunin is of little importance for its glomerular permeability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{electrochemical}} {{theory of}} the glycocalyx surface layer on capillary endothelial cells is developed as a model to study the electrochemical dynamics of anionic molecular transport within capillaries. Combining a constitutive relationship for electrochemical transport, derived from Fick's and Ohm's laws, with the conservation of mass and Gauss's law from electrostatics, a system of three nonlinear, coupled, second-order, partial, integro-differential equations is obtained for the concentrations of the diffusing <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> and the cations and anions in the blood. With the exception of small departures from electroneutrality that arise locally near the apical region of the glycocalyx, the model assumes that cations in the blood counterbalance the fixed negative charges bound to the macromolecular matrix of the glycocalyx in equilibrium. In the presence of anionic molecular tracers injected into the capillary lumen, the model predicts the size- and charge-dependent electrophoretic mobility of ions and tracers within the layer. In particular, the model predicts that <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> are excluded from the glycocalyx at equilibrium and that the extent of this exclusion, which increases with increasing tracer and/or glycocalyx electronegativity, is a fundamental determinant of anionic molecular transport through the layer. The model equations were integrated numerically using a Crank-Nicolson finite-difference scheme and Newton-Raphson iteration. When the concentration of the anionic molecular tracer is small compared with the concentration of ions in the blood, a linearized version of the model can be obtained and solved as an eigenvalue problem.

Differences in susceptibility between strains and between growth phases observed with free ce 6 largely disappeared with the cationic compounds despite significant differences in uptake.

Cultured SMCs exposed briefly to cationized ferritin (CF) exhibit ultrastructural aggregations of surface anionic sites resulting in intervening areas essentially devoid of anionic charge. Preincubation of cultured aortic medial SMCs with 0. 2 mg/ml CF for 1 minute at 37 C resulted in a 4 -fold increase in binding and a 13 -fold increase in internalization of 125 I-human serum albumin (125 I-HSA) relative to cells pretreated with native ferritin. When both the CF preincubation and the endocytosis were performed at 4 C, the influence of CF was abolished. Studies at 4 C indicated that CF pretreatment of SMC at 37 C induced high affinity (Kd = 1. 5 nM) saturable 125 I-HSA binding, in addition to low-affinity nonsaturable binding. These results were further confirmed by binding competition studies using increasing concentrations of unlabeled HSA. In contrast, low-density lipoprotein, a large <b>anionic</b> <b>molecule,</b> failed to compete with 125 I-HSA for binding sites on CF-pretreated SMCs at either 4 or 37 C.

It has favorable radiation characteristics, {{such as the}} medium-energy beta particles emission (Emax = 810 keV) which is desirable for treatment, the medium-energy gamma photon (103 keV) which is suitable for imaging and dosimetry measurement and the short half-life (46. 3 h). Both emissions allow to use Sm(III) complexes as therapeutic radiopharmaceutical and to follow {{the distribution of the}} radionuclide in vivo. Maltol (3 -Hydroxy - 2 -methyl- 4 -pyron) is produced by some plants and is commonly formed when sugars are heated. Maltol loses its hydroxyl proton from neutral to basic pH levels, forming the Maltolate anion; this <b>anionic</b> <b>molecule</b> forms a strong bidentate chelate with gallium, as well as with iron, zinc, aluminum, vanadium, and many other metals. Methods: Production of 153 Sm was performed at the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) using 152 Sm (n, gamma) 153 Sm nuclear reaction. Radiochromatography was performed by counting of Whatman No. 2 using a thin layer chromatography scanner. Gama-Spectroscopy on the base of 103 keV peak was carried out by using the HPGe. 153 Sm-Maltolate was produced using 153 Sm-SmCl 3 and was purchased Maltol in 2 h at 60 &deg;C. The analytical data for the structure determination and purity of the compound was obtained. The Radiochemical purity of 153 Sm-Maltolate was checked by RTLC. Also the biodistribution of 153 Sm-Maltolate in normal rat was checked. Results: The radiolabeled Sm complex was prepared in high radiochemical purity (&gt; 90 %, RTLC).

Using explicitly correlated coupled-cluster methodology and core-valence basis set, the linear-bent path of the neutral and <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> have been computed, and the adiabatic electron affinity of HNCl has been deduced at 1. 29 eV. The three-dimensional potential energy surface of the neutral HNCl ((X) over tilde (2) A '') and of the HNCl(-) ((X) over tilde (1) A') anion have also been generated using the same computational approach, and their analytical representations {{have been used for}} the variational determination of their rovibrational energy levels. Our computations reveal the localization of the additional electron into an anti-bounding molecular orbital associated with the N-Cl bond. The modelling of the photoelectron spectrum of HNCl(-) and DNCl(-) is also presented, showing the vibrational progression associated with the N-Cl stretching mode...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAdsorption of the Glycine-Proline (Gly-Pro) {{dipeptide}} {{has been}} investigated using surface science complementary techniques on Au(110) and Ag(110), showing some interesting differences both in the chemical form and surface organization of the adsorbed peptide. On Au(110), Gly-Pro mainly adsorbs in neutral form (COOH/NH 2), at low coverage or for a short interaction time; the surface species become zwitterionic at a higher coverage or longer interaction time. These changes are accompanied by a complete reorganization of the molecules at the surface. On Ag(110), only <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> (COO-/NH 2) were detected {{on the surface and}} only one type of arrangement was observed. These results will be compared to some previously obtained on Cu(110), thus providing a unique comparison of the adsorption of the same di-peptide on three different metal surfaces; the great influence of the substrate on both the chemical form and the arrangement of adsorbed di-peptides was made clear...|$|R
40|$|To date, it {{is still}} a {{challenge}} to prepare high-flux and highselectivity microporous membranes thinner than 20  nm without introducing defects. In this work, we report {{for the first time the}} application of cellulose membranes for selective separation of small molecules. A freestanding cellulose membrane as thin as 10  nm has been prepared through regeneration of trimethylsilyl cellulose (TMSC). The freestanding membrane can be transferred to any desired substrate and shows a normalized flux as high as 700  L[*]m− 2 [*]h− 1 [*]bar− 1 when supported by a porous alumina disc. According to filtration experiments, the membrane exhibits precise size-sieving performances with an estimated pore size between 1. 5 – 3. 5  nm depending on the regeneration period and initial TMSC concentration. A perfect discrimination of <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> over neutral species is demonstrated. Moreover, the membrane demonstrates high reproducibility, high scale-up potential, and excellent stability over two months...|$|R

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{application of}} siRNA (short interfering RNA) shows promise {{as an alternative}} approach to small-molecule inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} human disease. However, the major obstacle to its use has been the difficulty in delivering these large <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> in vivo. A potential approach to solving this problem is the chemical conjugation of siRNA to the cationic CPPs (cell-penetrating peptides), Tat-(48 - 60) (transactivator of transcription) and penetratin, which have been shown previously to mediate protein and peptide delivery in a host of animal models. In this transaction, we review recent studies on the utility of siRNA for the investigation of protein function in the airways/lung. We show that, despite previous studies showing the utility of cationic CPPs in vitro, conjugation of siRNA to Tat-(48 - 60) and penetratin failed to increase residual siRNA-mediated knockdown of p 38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) (MAPK 14) mRNA in mouse lung in vivo. Significantly, we will also discuss potential non-specific actions and the induction of immunological responses by CPPs and their conjugates and how this might limit their application for siRNA-mediated delivery in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{amino acids}} for the {{synthesis}} of novel surfactants with vesicle-forming properties potentially enhances the biocompatibility levels needed for {{a viable alternative to}} conventional lipid vesicles. In this work, the formation and characterization of catanionic vesicles by newly synthesized lysine- and serine-derived surfactants have been investigated by means of phase behavior mapping and PFG-NMR diffusometry and cryo-TEM methods. The lysine-derived surfactants are double-chained <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules</b> bearing a pseudogemini configuration, whereas the serine-derived amphiphile is cationic and single-chained. Vesicles form in the cationic-rich side for narrow mixing ratios of the two amphiphiles. Two pairs of systems were studied: one symmetric with equal chain lengths, 2 C 12 /C 12, and the other highly asymmetric with 2 C 8 /C 16 chains, where the serine-based surfactant has the longest chain. Different mechanisms of the vesicle-to-micelle transition were found, depending on symmetry: the 2 C 12 /C 12 system entails limited micellar growth and intermediate phase separation, whereas the 2 C 8 /C 16 system shows a continuous transition involving large wormlike micelles. The results are interpreted on the basis of currently available models for the micelle-vesicle transitions and the stabilization of catanionic vesicles (energy of curvature vs mixing entropy) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} binding Tb(3 +) to sodium taurocholate {{aggregates}} containing polyaromatic hydrocarbon guests was examined using pyrene and 1 -ethylnaphthalene as guests that bind {{to the primary}} aggregate, and 1 -naphthyl- 1 -ethanol as a secondary aggregate guest. Time-resolved fluorescence quenching studies were used to study the binding site properties, while laser flash photolysis quenching studies provided information on {{the dynamics of the}} guest-aggregate system. Both the primary and secondary aggregate binding sites became more compact in the presence of bound Tb(3 +), while only the primary aggregate became more accessible to <b>anionic</b> <b>molecules.</b> The binding dynamics for the guest-primary aggregate system became faster when Tb(3 +) was bound to the aggregate. In contrast, for the guest-secondary aggregate the presence of Tb(3 +) resulted in a small decrease in the dissociation rate constant. The influence of bound Tb(3 +) on the primary and secondary bile salt aggregates is significantly different, which affects how these aggregates can be used as supramolecular host systems to modify guest reactivity.
