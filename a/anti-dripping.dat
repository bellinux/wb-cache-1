50|$|Zinc borate is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} flame retardant in plastics and cellulose fibers, paper, rubbers and textiles. It is also used in paints, adhesives, and pigments. As a flame retardant, it can replace antimony(III) oxide as a synergist in both halogen-based and halogen-free systems. It is an <b>anti-dripping</b> and char-promoting agent, and suppresses the afterglow. In electrical insulator plastics it suppresses arcing and tracking.|$|E
40|$|Acrylic acid was grafted onto nylon 66 fabric by the {{electron}} beam irradiation method. Effects of different grafting conditions on grafting reaction were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), thermo gravimetric analyzer(TGA), scanning electron microscope(SEM) and YG 065 type fabric strength tester {{were used to}} characterize the chemical structures, thermal properties, surface morphology and mechanical properties of these prepared nylon 66 fabric samples. And the <b>anti-dripping</b> performance was evaluated by the vertical burning. The results show that in FTIR spectrum new absorption peeks at 1720. 2 cm - 1 and other wave numbers are assigned to the carboxyl groups, which imply that acrylic acid is successfully grafted to the nylon 66 molecular. The <b>anti-dripping</b> performance of nylon 66 fabric is improved significantly after grafting. It {{can be attributed to}} the cross-linked char layer which subsequently provides a support for the melting fiber. However, the mechanical properties of grafted samples decrease to some extent. With the increase of grafting ratio, the onset temperatures of grafted samples decrease gradually, while the char-forming performance enhances significantly. Besides, the damage length and droplet velocity of grafted samples become shorter and lower, and the tensile strength at break increases slightly...|$|E
40|$|Synergistic {{effect was}} {{observed}} between {{two types of}} flame retardant and two types of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS). The polymer matrix was represented by low density polyethylene Bralen RB 2 - 62 (Slovnaft). The polyethylene was mixed with nanofillers OctaIsobutyl POSS and TriSilanolIsobutyl POSS. The flame retardants was represented by ADK STAB (R) FP 2200 and Exolite (R) APP 722. The flammability was investigated by UL- 94 test. The {{results showed that the}} APP/POSS system had important flame retardant and <b>anti-dripping</b> abilities for LDPE...|$|E
40|$|A novel hyperbranched {{polyamine}} charring agent (HPCA), {{a derivative}} of triazines, was synthesized and well characterized by H- 1 NMR and FTIR. HPCA and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) were added into polylactide (PLA) resin as an intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system to impart flame retardancy and dripping resistance to PLA. The flammability and thermal stability of IFR-PLA composites were investigated by {{limiting oxygen index}} (LOI), UL- 94 vertical burning, cone calorimetry and thermogravometric analysis (TGA) tests. The {{results showed that the}} IFR system had both excellent flame retardant and <b>anti-dripping</b> abilities for RA. The TGA curves suggested that HPCA has good ability of char formation and when combined with APP, would induce synergistic effect which could be clearly observed. This effect greatly promoted the char formation of IFR-PLA composites, hence improved the flame retardant property. Additionally, the structure and morphology of char residues were studied by XPS, FTIR and SEM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The rising {{number of}} elderly and {{disabled}} persons leads to the increasing demand for reha-bilitation robots for the support in daily life actions. The major factor limiting the application of robots in this domain is the programming of the robot since a detailed knowledge of the daily life activities {{as well as an}} effective mechanism to deal with the diverse environment is not available. The most promising way to alleviate this problem is {{to take advantage of the}} human experience and skills in performing daily activities and to transfer them to the robot. For this, the concept of Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is believed to be an intuitive and preferable solution. However, classic PbD methods will fail in the situations where the environment in which the task is to be performed differs from that in the demonstration, since important parts of the human skill are lost in that programming process. This work proposes a comprehensive solution for this problem, which is implemented and tested for the exemplary daily life action 'pouring a beverage from a bottle to a glass' (pour-in in short). This solution consists of three advanced methods: The parameter-based trajectory generation, the inclusion of the closed control loop into the PbD process and the implementa-tion of an <b>anti-dripping</b> movement into a pour-in. In the parameter-based trajectory genera-tion, human demonstration is used to obtain the characteristics of a pour-in trajectory repre-senting the human skills. This information is used to autonomously generate a general pour-in trajectory that is optimized to the current task conditions (e. g. the size of bottle and glass). This general pour-in trajectory is then processed by a closed control loop that manages other task restrictions like the target filling liquid. Based on the concept of cascade control loops two control systems reflecting different control strategies of human beings in a pour-in are designed in this work: The first is the three-point based cascade weight/flow rate control (TCC), which applies the human strategy to control the flow rate within minimum and maxi-mum limits. These limits depend on the filling ratio of the liquid. The second is the monitored cascade weight/flow rate control (MCC) based on the imitation of a particularity of the human demonstration, which is the unidirectivity of the movement. Experiments with the rehabilita-tion robot system FRIEND reveal that the lager delay time of the system influences the con-trol accuracy considerable due to the corresponding delays in the system response. Therefore, a number of strategies are developed and implemented into the control loops to dampen the impact of the time delay. Finally, the pour-in process is accomplished and optimized by the inclusion of an <b>anti-dripping</b> movement, whose implementation is based on human demon-strations. By the application of particular trajectory transformations it is possible to apply only one <b>anti-dripping</b> trajectory to any pour-in process. Experiments prove that a robust task execution under various task conditions is achieved to-gether with a high accuracy in reaching the target filling weight. This shows that the applica-tion of these advanced PbD methods for the implementation of pour-in processes into a reha-bilitation robot is successful and that this comprehensive solution is able to confer the abilities of human autonomous environment adaptation. The promising results qualify the developed methods to serve as a starting point for future implementations of additional daily life tasks...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum {{hypophosphite}} (AHP) {{was introduced}} into polylactide/intumescent flame retardant (PLA/IFR) systems by melt blending. The flame retardant and thermal {{properties of the}} PLA composites were investigated. The results suggest that a synergistic effect exists between IFR and AHP on the char formation and <b>anti-dripping</b> behavior of PLA composites. The PLA/IFR composites containing 10 wt% IFR can pass the UL- 94 V- 0 rating but the test is accompanied by heavy melt dripping. For the PLA/AHP a UL- 94 V- 2 rating is obtained for the same loading of IFR. However, the composites containing 7 wt% IFR and 3 wt% AHP pass the UL- 94 V- 0 rating with modified dripping behavior. Moreover, the char from combustion of PLA/IFR is flexible but of poor quality. That for PLA/AHP is brittle with many cracks. In contrast, that for PLA/IFR/AHP is strong and compact. Thus it can resist the erosion due to heat and gas formation and protect {{the inside of the}} matrix. In addition, AHP causes the crosslinking among APP, which promotes the char formation and prevents the melt dripping. This is the main reason for the good flame retardant properties of PLA composites. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{materials}} were used to fabricate nanocoatings using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly to reduce the flammability of cotton fabric. The most effective brominated flame retardants have raised concerns related to their toxicity and environmental impact, which has created a need for alternative flame retardant chemistries and approaches. Polymer nanocomposites typically exhibit reduced mass loss and heat release rates, along with <b>anti-dripping</b> behavior, {{all of which are}} believed to be due to the formation of a barrier surface layer. Despite these benefits, the viscosity and modulus of the final polymeric material is often altered, making industrial processing difficult. These challenges inspired the use of LbL assembly to create densely layered nanocomposites in an effort to produce more flame-retardant coatings. Laponite and montmorillonite (MMT) clay were paired with branched poly(ethylenimine) to create thin film assemblies that can be tailored by changing pH and concentration of aqueous deposition mixtures. Both films can be grown linearly as a function of layers deposited, and they contained at least 70 wt percent of clay. When applying these films to cotton fabric, the individual fibers are uniformly coated and the fabric has significant char left after burning. MMT-coated fabric exhibits reduced total heat release, suggesting a protective ceramic surface layer is created. Small molecule, POSS-based LbL thin films were also successfully deposited on cotton fabric. With less than 8 wt percent added to the total fabric weight, more than 12 wt percent char remained after microscale combustion calorimetry. Furthermore, afterglow time was reduced and the fabric weave structure and shape of the individual fibers were highly preserved following vertical flame testing. A silica-like sheath was formed after burning that protected the fibers. Finally, the first intumescent LbL assembly was deposited on cotton fabric. SEM images show significant bubble formation on fibers, coated with a 0. 5 wt percent PAAm/ 1 wt percent PSP coating after burning. In several instances, a direct flame on the fabric was extinguished. The peak HRR and THR of coated fabric has 30 percent and 65 percent reduction, respectively, compared to the uncoated control fabric. These anti-flammable nanocoatings provide a relatively environmentally-friendly alternative for protecting fabrics, such as cotton, and lay the groundwork for rendering many other complex substrates (e. g., foam) flame-retardant without altering their processing and desirable mechanical behavior...|$|E
