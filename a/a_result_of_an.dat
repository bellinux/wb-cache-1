5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion in his lab. McCluskey {{died at the age of}} 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E
5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began to move against {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation moved slowly to the northeast, and the wind shear conditions abated. As a result, Erica began to gain some signs of organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E

5|$|As General Manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the {{management}} positions {{with his own}} personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach. The team's roster was then filled as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expansion draft in 1995. Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong. Armstrong refused to report for training, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander. Thomas then selected {{a wide range of}} players in the expansion draft, including veterans Jerome Kersey, Willie Anderson and his former Pistons teammate John Salley.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{unforeseen}} {{surge in}} ridership, the NYCEDC and Hornblower announced in July 2017 {{that three of}} the twenty vessels would be reconfigured into 250-passenger boats. These boats would have bigger engines to accommodate the additional passengers. In September 2017, the NYCEDC ordered three new 350-passenger boats for NYC Ferry service to supplement the 20 original boats. Metal Shark would build the new boats for $7 million to $7.5 million each.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke {{is an old}} {{market town}} {{expanded}} in the mid 1960s as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> agreement between London County Council and Hampshire County Council. It was developed rapidly after World War II, along with various other towns in the United Kingdom, {{in order to accommodate}} part of the London 'overspill' as perceived under the Greater London Plan in 1944. Basingstoke market was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and it remained a small market town until the early 1960s. At the start of World War II the population was little more than 13,000. It still has a regular market, but is now larger than Hampshire County Council's definition of a market town.|$|E

5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing {{a system of}} tactile code that could allow blind people {{to read and write}} quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers {{for the first time in}} 1824.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} hours of March28, 2000, a {{powerful}} F3 tornado struck downtown Fort Worth, Texas, United States and adjacent areas, causing significant damage to numerous buildings and skyscrapers {{as well as}} two deaths. The tornado {{was part of a larger}} severe weather outbreak that caused widespread storms across Texas and Oklahoma in late-March, spurred primarily by the moist and unstable atmospheric environment over the South Central United States as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eastward-moving upper-level low and shortwave trough. The tornado outbreak was well-forecasted by both computer forecast models and the National Weather Service, though the eventual focal point for the severe weather—North Texas—only came into focus on March28 as the conditions favorable for tornadic development quickly took hold.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests that, {{despite the}} implications of a large budget as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance {{in the quality of}} the film stock. In comparison to the Technicolor/Techniscope presentation most Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in, The Great Silence was filmed in the standard European widescreen format and printed in Eastmancolor.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed {{at the beginning of the}} cluster.|$|E

5|$|Late in {{the evening}} of September 18, Karl {{attained}} Category3 status, becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004. On September 19, Karl continued to strengthen, maintaining a well-defined eye, and strengthening late that day into a Category4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a minimum pressure of 948mbar. Early on September 20, the storm weakened slightly as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eyewall replacement cycle, weakening back to a strong Category3 hurricane. At this time Karl began to turn sharply northward into a weakness in the subtropical ridge.|$|E
5|$|Many Turkish {{cities and}} towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Despite this however, western-style music styles like pop music and kanto lost popularity to arabesque in the late 70s and 80s. It became popular again {{by the beginning of}} the 1990s, as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> opening economy and society. With the support of Sezen Aksu, the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as Tarkan and Sertab Erener. The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative Turkish rock, electronica, hip-hop, rap and dance music in opposition to the mainstream corporate pop and arabesque genres, which many believe have become too commercial.|$|E
