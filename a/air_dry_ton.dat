[...] Today, Domtar, the largest integrated producer of uncoated paper in North America and the second-largest in the world in terms of production capacity, owns a pulp manufacturer in Dryden that produces one pulp product called Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK). The mill produces 319,000 <b>air</b> <b>dry</b> metric <b>tons</b> of NBSK annually, which is sold on the open market. However, the paper and pulp sector is facing economic deterioration.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, novel {{evaporation}} plant designs that use medium-pressure steam and deliver low-pressure (LP) steam to the steam network {{as well as}} conventionally designed plants are simulated and evaluated from a technical and economic point of view. Both evaporation of black liquor only and combined evaporation of black liquor and wastewater are analyzed. The {{results show that the}} novel designs suggested in this work all have large potential to save live steam and that an additional 8 m 3 of wastewater/ADMT (<b>air</b> <b>dry</b> metric <b>ton)</b> can be evaporated without increasing the mill´s total live steam demand. They also indicate that the demand for LP steam {{in the rest of the}} process is less important for the savings in live steam. The total cost for the novel designs and the relationship between that cost and the cost for conventional designs depend on the economic conditions assumed. If the investment in a more energy efficient {{evaporation plant}} is considered from a strategic point of view using an annuity factor of 0. 1 and if the cost of the saved fuel is rather high in comparison to the electricity price, the total cost for the novel designs will have a lower total cost than the traditional designs. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} a simple, cost-effective, reliable fixation method for fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) yielding a specimen suitable for mail transport. STUDY DESIGN: Smears prepared from 59 FNABs of surgical specimens were fixed by continuous fixation in 95 % ethanol, spray fixation, <b>air</b> <b>drying,</b> ethanol fixation for either 5 minutes or 4 hours followed by spray fixation, or fixation in 95 % ethanol for either 30 minutes or 4 hours followed by <b>air</b> <b>drying.</b> Fixation was graded as unsatisfactory, suboptimal, average, good or excellent. RESULTS: Of smears continuously fixed in ethanol, 96. 6 % were graded as excellent. Of smears fixed in ethanol followed by spray fixation, 93. 2 % were excellent irrespective of fixation time; 64. 4 % of spray-fixed smears were excellent and 27. 1 % good.

CONCLUSION: Fixation of smears in 95 % ethanol followed by spray fixation produces excellent results, {{comparable to those}} with continuous fixation in ethanol.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperature and different silane coupling agents on the bond strength between glass fiber posts and composite resin core. The post surface was cleaned with alcohol and treated with different silane coupling agents, being three prehydrolyzed silanes [Silano (Angelus), Prosil (FGM), RelyX Ceramic Primer (3 M ESPE) ] and one two-component silane [Silane Coupling Agent (Dentsply) ]. Two post-silanization <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperatures, 23 °C and 60 °C, were applied. A cylindrical plastic matrix was placed around the silanized post and filled with composite resin. Each bonded post provided 7 slices for push-out testing. Each slice was loaded to failure under compression at a cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Scott-Knott tests (α= 0. 05). Dunnett's {{test was used to}} compare the mean of the control group with that of each experimental group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the interface of the fractured slices. For the 23 °C <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperature, the use of RelyX Ceramic Primer resulted in significantly lower bond strength than the other silane coupling agents, while the bond strength with Silane Coupling Agent was the highest of all groups. Only with Silane Coupling Agent, the bond strength for the 23 °C <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperature was significantly higher than that for 60 °C <b>air</b> <b>drying.</b> In conclusion, the use of warm <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> after silane application produced no increase in the bond strength between the fiber-reinforced composite post and the composite core.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} thorough <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> on the static and dynamic bonding effectiveness of a HEMA-free all-in-one adhesive bonded to Class- 1 cavity-bottom dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: G-Bond (GC, Japan) was applied to standard occlusal Class I cavities following either a gentle (1 bar) or strong (4 bar) air-drying technique. After restoring the cavity using a composite resin (Gradia Anterior, GC), microspecimens were prepared that were loaded until failure or inserted in a microrotary fatigue testing device. RESULTS: Strong <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> had no effect on the static (39. 1 vs. 38. 4 MPa) or the dynamic (19. 0 vs. 18. 6 MPa) strength of the interface complex. CONCLUSION: Strong <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> did not improve the static or the dynamic bonding effectiveness, although a very thorough (4 bar) and long air-drying procedure was employed. SEM analysis revealed that even when the adhesive was strongly <b>air</b> <b>dried,</b> droplets originating from phase separations could still be observed, albeit to a reduced extent. Ineffective drying and pooling of the adhesive in a narrow cavity diminished the effect of strong <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> of the all-in-one adhesive. status: publishe...|$|R
