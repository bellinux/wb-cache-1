KASCADE-Grande is a ground based detector array to study extensive air showers generated by primary cosmic ray particles in the energy range from 10 ^ 14 eV to 10 ^ 18 eV. Approximately 290, 000 air showers measured between January 2005 and Febuary 2006 are used to generate <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> <b>distributions</b> of electrons and muons for 13 intervals of the distance R to the shower center.

This difference in <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> is used to determine a cut on the particle <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> {{as a function of the}} distance from the shower center.
