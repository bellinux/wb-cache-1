This is known as <b>aspiration</b> <b>search.</b> In the extreme case, the search is performed with alpha and beta equal; a technique known as zero-window search, null-window search, or scout search. This is particularly useful for win/loss searches {{near the end of}} a game where the extra depth gained from the narrow window and a simple win/loss evaluation function may lead to a conclusive result. If an <b>aspiration</b> <b>search</b> fails, it is straightforward to detect whether it failed high (high edge of window was too low) or low (lower edge of window was too high). This gives information about what window values might be useful in a re-search of the position.|$|E

Its success is largely attributable {{to a variety of}} enhancements to the basic algorithm that can dramatically improve the search efficiency. Although state-ofthe-art game-playing programs build trees that are close in size to the minimal Alpha-Beta search tree, this paper shows that there is still room for improvement.

Rather than relying on simulation or searches of specially constructed trees, a simple chess program was used to provide a uniform basis for comparisons. ...|$|E

They are also registers of social recognition {{and serve as}} spaces of collective capacity for their privileged clients. Elite schools have long been sites for the exercise of a form of affective agency by the wealthy and socially powerful. Many such people and groups have heavy emotional investments in the schools that their families have attended over several generations. Habitual use of such schools, over extended time, signifies their enduring social stature.

Our focus is on learning from failure; this kind of learning is essential to organizational learning and adaptation, and a necessary complement to studies of learning from success. Our analysis of U. S. Class 1 freight railroads' accident costs from 1975 to 2001 shows that when a railroad's accident rate deviates from aspiration levels, the railroad benefits less from its own operating and accident experience and more from other railroads' operating and accident experiences. These findings {{support the idea that}} performance near <b>aspirations</b> fosters local <b>search</b> and exploitive learning, while performance away from <b>aspirations</b> stimulates nonlocal <b>search</b> and exploration, providing a foundation for constructing more-integrated models of organizational learning and change...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} key factors {{stimulating}} initial export activity among Nigerian firms {{against the backdrop}} of previous findings from studies undertaken in more advanced economies. Based on a sample of seventy-eight SMEs and a factor analysis procedure, it finds support for the view that proactive stimuli, including growth <b>aspirations,</b> opportunity <b>search</b> and managerial interest, predominantly trigger initial export activity among Nigerian firms. This diverges from the pre-eminent position of external-reactive stimuli, notably the receipt of fortuitous foreign orders, in North American and other Western studies, and adds to earlier calls for caution in generalising empirical findings across different geo-economic contexts. The possible reasons for the identified divergence are discussed in this paper, along with the policy and managerial issues raised by the nature of initial export stimulation among the study firms...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} complex scheduling {{problems that}} can be captured as optimization under hard and soft constraints. The objective of such an optimization problem is to satisfy as many hard constraints as possible and meanwhile to minimize a penalty function determined by the unsatisfied soft constraints. We present an efficient local search algorithm for these problems which improves upon Wsat(oip), a Walksat-based local search algorithm for overconstrained problems represented in integer programs. We introduce three techniques to the Wsat(oip) algorithm to extend its capability and improve its performance: backbone guided biased moves to drive the search to the regions in search space where high-quality and optimal solutions reside; sampling-based <b>aspiration</b> <b>search</b> to reduce search cost and make anytime solutions available {{over the course of}} the search; and dynamic parameter tuning to dynamically adjust the key parameters of the algorithm to make it robust and flexible for various applications. Our experimental results on large-scale crew scheduling, basketball tournament scheduling and progressive party scheduling show that the new improved algorithm can find better solutions with less computation than Wsat(oip). ...|$|E
30|$|The opening image characterises {{a poignant}} and {{ethereal}} {{relationship between the}} lily and the moon — the moon being {{an expression of the}} divine animating quality of light, and the lily responding by blossoming with a satisfying smile. This intimacy between a simple flower and the divine is then contrasted with the seeker’s corresponding lack; a complicated fluctuating presence and absence in the human seeker where the surpassing beauty of the divine is withheld. It not only admits of the perception of the divine in the human, but also of the divine as the Perceptor; God and human as One, “Who is the Eye of my eye;/Who is the Heart of my heart?” The plaintive cry at the close places the lily back into unconscious nature by accentuating humanity’s conscious <b>aspiration</b> and <b>search</b> for divinity. However, we are left with an impression of helplessness, being at the mercy of capricious dreams.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} determinants {{of the magnitude of}} firm search investments, boundaries of search, and search decisions under uncertainty. It consists of three studies, each of which examines a different dimension of organizational search based on comparative theoretical perspectives. The first study investigates {{the determinants of}} technological search intensity based on a comparison and reconciliation of the arguments from the threat-rigidity hypothesis, attention-based theory, and the behavioral theory of the firm. Based on the results from an examination of the R 2 ̆ 6 D expenditures of U. S. manufacturing firms from 1980 to 2001, this study shows how past performance, aspirations, and slack resources affect the search investment decisions of firms. The findings suggest that search increases with the distance of firms 2 ̆ 7 past performance either below or above <b>aspirations.</b> <b>Search</b> is limited when firms perform in the vicinity of aspirations. ^ The second study investigates the determinants of technological search boundaries in manufacturing firms. It develops testable hypotheses based on the behavioral theory of the firm, threat-rigidity hypothesis, agency theory, and competency trap argument. By examining the patent citation data of U. S. manufacturing firms from 1975 to 1999, this research shows how past performance relative to aspirations, proximity to bankruptcy, and slack resources determine firms 2 ̆ 7 search across organizational boundaries and technological domains. ^ The third study investigates the determinants of firms 2 ̆ 7 technological search intensity under uncertainties. By examining the R 2 ̆ 6 D expenditures of U. S. manufacturing firms from 1980 to 2001, this study explores how past performance, aspirations, and uncertainty affect the search investments of funs. Our findings show both performance feedback and performance forecasts are important determinants of firm search. Uncertainty leads firms to rely more on performance feedback (backward-looking search) than on future prospects (forward-looking search) in making search decisions. ^ This dissertation reviews various theories on organizational search behavior in the literature and develops testable frameworks for these arguments. It is the first empirical study using organizational data to systematically examine Cyert and March 2 ̆ 7 s (1963) problemistic versus slack search, Rosenkopf and Nerkar 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) local versus boundary-spanning search, and Gavetti and Levinthal 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) backward-looking versus forward-looking search models. ...|$|R
40|$|In web searching, trustable {{and precise}} results are greatly {{affected}} by the inherent uncertainty in the input queries. Queries submitted to search engines are by nature ambiguous and constitute {{a significant proportion of}} the instances given to web search engines. Ambiguous queries pose real challenges for the web search engines due to versatility of information. Temporal based approaches whereas somehow reduce the uncertainty in queries but still lack to provide results according to users <b>aspirations.</b> Web <b>search</b> science has created an interest for the researchers to incorporate contextual information for resolving the uncertainty in search results. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Disambiguation Approach (ADA) of hybrid nature that makes use of both the temporal and contextual information to improve user experience. The proposed hybrid approach presents the search results to the users based on their location and temporal information. A Java based prototype of the systems is developed and evaluated using standard dataset to determine its efficacy in terms of precision, accuracy, recall, and F 1 -measure. Supported by experimental results, ADA demonstrates better results along all the axes as compared to temporal based approaches...|$|R
40|$|Summary This paper {{explains}} the internationalization process of small firms using {{the theory of}} performance relative to aspiration levels. The study complements prior theory by explaining why and how small firms are triggered to engage in internationalization despite not reaching maturity in their home market. We outline a model where firms' internationalization is triggered by problemistic search, following periods of below-aspiration performance. The model is tested on 860 Swedish firms followed during an economic downturn. Results indicate that internationalization activities follow a bounded rational process characterized by search behavior which is triggered by performance feedback. The study complements prior theories of internationalization and offers a first empirical demonstration of the viability of aspiration-level performance theory in international entrepreneurship research.

40|$|Bounded {{rationality}} and, more specifically, satisficing in game playing assumes choosing strategies by anticipating their likely consequences. Unlike orthodox game theory, {{one does}} not require optimality and rational expectations but views satisficing as a reasoning process with several possible feedback loops. The various stages of such reasoning ask players to• mentally represent the game, typically via simplifying (mental modeling),• generate scenarios, i. e., point expectations concerning others’ choices and chance events (scenario generation),• form payoff aspirations for all scenarios (aspiration formation),• try to satisfy them by successively testing choice alternatives (satisficing search). When repeating this process, players may revise their mental representation, adapt their scenario set and aspiration profile or drop the first, the two first, or {{all three of these}} stages before exploring further strategies. Such satisficing in game playing has been confirmed experimentally by directly observing scenario generation, <b>aspiration</b> formation, and <b>search</b> for satisficing alternatives...|$|R
40|$|From the introduction] Both {{beauty and}} Truth lie beneath many of mankind’s deepest desires and <b>aspirations.</b> The <b>search</b> for beauty drives {{many people to}} travel to {{pristine}} forests or untouched coastlines to experience awe, while the search for knowledge about the Truth of the universe {{in which we live}} compels many to study the tiniest particles or largest spaces we can conceive {{in order to get a}} slight hold on our place in a seemingly endless and impartial existence. Our rational proclivities lead us to search for Truth and solid facts; our intrinsic appreciation for natural beauty allows us to deeply appreciate the beauty of a sunrise after a lifetime of daylight. Beauty and Truth both cause people to experience life and their own world in different and unique ways. Though examining Truth and beauty are great adventures in their own rights, examining the relationship between the two is also very interesting. The behavior of the universe when examined on both infinitely large and infinitely small scales can have many elements of beauty. Likewise, many beautiful occurrences in nature can have intriguing scientific explanations. When considering the idea that a proposed theory uniting every phenomenological law of physics will be recognizable because of its intrinsic beauty, however, it seems strange and almost irrational to add an aesthetic criterion to a scientific theory. This invites the question, “Is beauty a valid criterion for scientific Truth?” This question will be examined through a comparison of philosophic and scientific ideas about beauty and Truth, as well as a comparison of the implications of both positive and negative responses.

40|$|This ethnographic {{field study}} {{examines}} {{the connection between}} micro-entrepreneurship in the informal sector and local perceptions of the Good Life by studying tuk tuk drivers in Guatemala, Panajachel. Flexibility and freedom characterise the profession of driving a tuk tuk, which makes this profession ideal for entrepreneurial side activities. Drivers move on the spectrum between wage labor-like livelihood and entrepreneurship in the partially regulated tuk tuk sector. They constantly seek opportunities {{inside and outside of}} the sector and put a lot of effort in the appearance of their vehicle and their own reputation. The extent to which tuk tuk drivers engage in entrepreneurial activities helps them increase their social capital, which in turn results in new opportunities and a higher sense of dignity. Tuk tuk drivers have to work many hours a day in the search to algo más (something more), as they hold different <b>aspirations</b> in the <b>search</b> towards wellbeing. We argue that tuk tuk drivers who are more entrepreneurially minded find it easier to achieve the Good Life...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} whether simple {{heuristics}} can arise as equilibrium strategies in mutual sequential mate search. To this aim, we extend the mate search model of Todd and Miller (1999), involving an adolescence (learning) phase {{followed by an}} actual mating phase, to a strategic game where the players, as the individuals in the mating population, choose before starting the adolescence phase, the best rule - among the four available <b>search</b> (<b>aspiration</b> adjustment) rules - to maximize their likelihood of mating, given the choice of other individuals. Conducting Monte Carlo simulations, we show {{that the use of}} the Take the Next Best Rule by the whole population never becomes a (Nash) equilibrium in the simulation range of adolescence lengths. While the unanimous use of the Adjust Relative Rule by the whole population arises as an equilibrium for a wide part of the simulation range, especially for medium to high adolescence lengths, the rules Adjust Up/Down and Adjust Relative/ 2 are unanimously chosen as equilibrium strategies for {{a small part of the}} simulation range and only when the adolescence is long and short, respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a quantitative model comparison contrasting the process predictions of two prominent views on risky choice. One view assumes a trade-off between probabilities and outcomes (or nonlinear functions thereof) and the separate evaluation of risky options (expectation models). Another view assumes that risky choice {{is based on}} comparative evaluation, limited <b>search,</b> <b>aspiration</b> levels, and the forgoing of trade-offs (heuristic models). We derived quantitative process predictions for a generic expectation model and for a specific heuristic model, namely the priority heuristic (Brandst&# 228;tter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006), and tested them in two experiments. The focus was on two key features of the cognitive process: acquisition frequencies (i. e., how frequently individual reasons are looked up) and direction of search (i. e., gamble-wise vs. reason-wise). In Experiment 1, the priority heuristic predicted direction of search better than the expectation model (although neither model predicted the acquisition process perfectly); acquisition frequencies, however, were inconsistent with both models. Additional analyses revealed that these frequencies were primarily a function of what Rubinstein (1988) called similarity. In Experiment 2, the quantitative model comparison approach showed that people seemed to rely more on the priority heuristic in difficult problems, but to make more trade-offs in easy problems. This finding suggests that risky choice may {{be based on a}} mental toolbox of strategies...|$|R
