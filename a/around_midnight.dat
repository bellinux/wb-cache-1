5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>midnight,</b> {{the steamer}} Cornell, while 50miles (80km) west of Whitefish Point in Lake Superior, {{ran into a}} sudden northerly gale and was badly damaged. This gale lasted until late November 10, almost forcing Cornell ashore.|$|E
5|$|From Trinitatis Church, {{the fire}} {{continued}} down Landemærket towards Gothersgade. Here, the fire {{met up with}} the other branch of the fire which ate its way down present day Nørre Voldgade. <b>Around</b> <b>midnight,</b> the church Reformert Kirke was ablaze. The {{only place in the}} city where there was some control over the fire was around Vandkunsten.|$|E

60|$|Nor will I not in {{some more}} gloomy hour Invoke with fearless awe thine holier power, Wandering beneath the sainted pile When the blast moans along the darksome aisle, And {{clattering}} patters all <b>around</b> The <b>midnight</b> shower with dreary sound.|$|R
6000|$|He {{pushed out}} through them. He sat blind through the first-hour quiz in physics, {{with the whole}} class {{watching}} him. The thought of the Turk's failure to rise kept unhappy vigil in his mind. The same sequence of reflections ran <b>around</b> like <b>midnight</b> mice in the wall: ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>midnight</b> 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs. Because the ship, already {{prepared for a}} fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion of}} the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were picked up in the morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was able to keep West Honaker in the convoy headed to Utah beach.|$|E
5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>midnight,</b> {{the men of}} the 72nd and the 52nd passed Bab al-Wad noiselessly {{and then}} {{separated}} towards their respective targets. One company took Deir Ayyub, which was empty, but then were discovered as they did so by enemies on a nearby hill. They suffered the joint fire of the Legion's artillery and machines guns. Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al-Wad. The 52nd Battalion was preparing to take the hill in front of Yalu, but received an order to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Bombing of Normandy began <b>around</b> <b>midnight</b> {{with more}} than 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely {{ineffective}} at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences. The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.|$|E

Since not only OSVM, but probably all main field models that are derived primarily from data <b>around</b> local <b>midnight</b> suffer from this effect, the presented scheme can also be applied to approximately correct these models.|$|R
5000|$|Helm's {{performance}} {{career in}} the 2000s revolved mainly <b>around</b> the <b>Midnight</b> Ramble at his home and studio, [...] "The Barn," [...] in Woodstock, New York. These concerts, featuring Helm and various musical guests, allowed him {{to raise money for}} his medical bills and to resume performing after a bout with cancer that nearly ended his career.|$|R
50|$|Digital {{television}} {{was first introduced}} at this site in 1998, and Digital Switchover happened in May 2009. Stockland Hill was the second transmitter in the south west of England to have its analogue television transmissions shut off. BBC Two was switched off on 6 May 2009 {{and the rest of}} the analogue services were switched off on 20 May 2009 <b>around</b> after <b>midnight.</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{his next}} major action, Gandhi {{decided on a}} raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 miles south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. <b>Around</b> <b>midnight</b> of 4 May, as Gandhi was {{sleeping}} on a cot in a mango grove, the District Magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables. He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona (now Pune).|$|E
5|$|In early May, {{part of the}} {{battalion}} was sent to reinforce the 3rd Battalion. At <b>around</b> <b>midnight</b> {{on the night of}} 3/4 May, the 2nd Battalion's commanding officer, Braund, who was partially deaf, was accidentally killed as he attempted to visit 1st Brigade headquarters after failing to hear a challenge from a sentry, who shot him believing that he was an enemy soldier. Following his burial, {{the battalion}} second-in-command, Robert Scobie, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and took over as commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, von Pahlen's Corps {{attacked}} forts 23 and 24, and the Polish {{position at}} the Evangelical Cemetery. Heavy fighting followed, and many Russian commanders, including Paskevich, proposed that further fighting be postponed until the following day. General von Toll insisted on reaching {{the last line of}} Polish defences before sunset. The surrounding forts changed hands many times, but in the end most of them remained in Russian hands by 22:00, when the Russians broke off. <b>Around</b> <b>midnight</b> General Berg arrived in Warsaw with a new ultimatum signed by Paskevich.|$|E
50|$|Other {{than the}} local {{outrigger}} boat operators, a shipping company provides services {{to cater to}} the town's need of reliable vessel to transfer commodities to and from Cawayan for trade. It departs daily from Cawayan usually at 12:00 noon for a six-hour trip and docks at Pulambato Port in Bogo City, Cebu. And at <b>around</b> 12:00 <b>midnight</b> it sails back to Cawayan Port.|$|R

40|$|It {{is desired}} that the Nimbus {{meteorological}} satellite always cross the equator around local noon and, half-an-orbit later, cross the equator {{in the other}} direction <b>around</b> local <b>midnight.</b> The application of the phenomenon of nodal regression toward this end is discussed, and an analysis of the parameters angles of inclination, periods, and heights of such "ideal" circular orbits is presented. Also, the relative motion of the apparent versus the fictitious mean sun is briefly discussed...|$|R
5|$|The anthem must be {{performed}} {{in accordance with the}} lyrics and sheet music established by law. Every day, state-owned Belarusian television and radio stations are required to play the national anthem upon signing on at 6 a.m. and again upon signing off (usually <b>around</b> <b>midnight).</b> The anthem can also {{be performed}} on certain occasions, such as at government meetings, before sporting events and presidential inaugurations. While the anthem is being performed, citizens are required to stand at attention and those in military or police uniform must salute.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur <b>around</b> <b>midnight.</b> Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{produced}} during the 2010 NRL season (corresponding to {{winter in the}} Southern Hemisphere). In New South Wales and Queensland, (in which NRL is the dominant football code), The Matty Johns Show was broadcast on Thursdays at 7.30pm, two hours before The Footy Show. In all other states (in which the Australian Football League predominates), The Matty Johns Show may have been broadcast Thursdays at 7.30pm, or broadcast <b>around</b> <b>midnight,</b> after The AFL Footy Show. When broadcast at 7.30pm, the show followed long-running soap opera Home and Away.|$|E
50|$|From <b>around</b> 23:00 to <b>midnight,</b> {{helicopters}} {{bombed the}} police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, {{just outside of}} Ankara. The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured. Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.|$|R
25|$|Every 31 December, 2.5million people {{gather at}} Copacabana Beach to {{celebrate}} New Year's in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all {{night at the}} hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second largest celebration only next to the Carnival. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck to shake the champagne bottle and spray <b>around</b> at <b>midnight.</b> Chilled champagne adds {{to the spirit of}} the festivities.|$|R
5000|$|The authorities, {{up until}} this point, had been largely {{sympathetic}} to {{the goals of the}} protesters (and many even participated), not in least because they were all ethnic Russians themselves. However, the capture of the train station by the Russians and Cossacks was the last straw. <b>Around</b> the <b>midnight</b> after August 27, they approached the protester-held train station, hoping to reestablish law and order without a fight. However, the Russian mob, already highly excited, began pelting them with stones and various hard objects.|$|R
5|$|Though quite agile on land (capable {{of running}} {{as fast as}} a horse), capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are {{excellent}} swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out of the water. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest <b>around</b> <b>midnight</b> and then continue to graze before dawn.|$|E
5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. <b>Around</b> <b>midnight,</b> the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked {{toward the open}} Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. <b>Around</b> <b>midnight</b> August30, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E
50|$|The {{show was}} {{popular due to}} it being {{designed}} to be aired <b>around</b> or past <b>midnight,</b> when their target audience was just coming home from being out or ending their studies for the evening. It developed a cult following of sorts among college students nationwide.|$|R
40|$|The Viking- 2 Mars Lander {{landed at}} 48 deg N 226 deg W, {{northern}} summer. During the summer period the wind vector exhibited a repetitive clockwise turning with {{a period of}} one Sol (Mars day). Occasionally, however, the rotation ceased and wind became principally northeasterly. These events were always multiples of a Sol in duration, and all began <b>around</b> local <b>midnight.</b> The exact reason for this behavior is not clear, but {{it is suggested that}} small variations in the strength of the global circulation may be responsible...|$|R
25|$|The play {{takes place}} on a single day in August 1912, from <b>around</b> 8:30a.m. to <b>midnight.</b> The setting is the seaside Connecticut home of the Tyrones' Monte Cristo Cottage. The four main {{characters}} are the semi-autobiographical representations of O'Neill himself, his older brother, and their parents.|$|R
5|$|On Nørregade, another {{fire started}} at a brewery Wednesday evening – {{possibly}} between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Just {{prior to that}} the original fire had reached Gammeltorv, where people fought to keep the fire back. For that reason, help was sent late {{to deal with the}} new fire. <b>Around</b> <b>midnight</b> the wind shifted to the west, and the situation on Nørregade turned critical as the fire was driven towards the street along a wide front. At first people sought to keep the fire on the western side of Nørregade, but nevertheless it spread to the eastern side during the night. Simultaneously, the fire moved from present day Nørre Voldgade towards Nørreport (North Gate).|$|E
5|$|On September17, a {{hurricane}} {{was observed in}} the mid-Atlantic by the bark Phantom. Later that day, the Phantom sank, though all of the crew survived. They described {{the system as a}} 'perfect hurricane' with a lull <b>around</b> <b>midnight</b> on September17 before the wind changed direction and blew with even greater force than before. The hurricane continued travelling on a northwest track and between September22 and the night of September23 it was encountered by the Hudson, the City of Washington and the bark Lanark. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on September24 and dissipated later that day about 610mi (980km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Until reanalysis, this storm was considered two separate systems, including in the 1995 study by Partagas and Diaz. However, they stated that further information could indicate a single storm.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the special}} began in Berlin on October 2, 2017, moved to Brussels on October 12, and then to Paris later within the day, where it {{remained}} up to October 24. <b>Around</b> <b>midnight</b> of October 22, production filmed a four-minute fireworks show near the Eiffel Tower. Due to insufficient notices posted by the Paris City Hall, reportedly some Parisians were taken by surprise and mistook {{the sound of the}} fireworks for a terrorist attack. On October 25 production moved to Naples where it remained up to November 4. They donated €7,000 to the local community to thank them for the hospitality, and to fund the construction of a pedestrian plaza. A picture of the clapperboard used by the production shows that they consider the special as the twelfth episode of season 2.|$|E

30|$|The ionospheric drift {{observations}} at Thumba showed for {{the first}} time the effect of IMF on EEJ (Rastogi and Chandra, 1974). An increasing zenithal component of IMF was shown to be associated with an increasing anti-Sq electric field during the day-time as well as the night-time hours, based on hourly data for the three hours around local midday and three hours <b>around</b> local <b>midnight</b> for a large number of days during the year 1967. This was interpreted as due to the decrease of the equatorial dawn-to-dusk electrostatic field with an increasing southward component of IMF.|$|R
