5|$|The {{price for}} pure bismuth metal has been {{relatively}} stable {{through most of the}} 20th century, except for <b>a</b> <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s. Bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.|$|E

In downtown Fairbanks, overcrowding, traffic problems, and drunken rambunctiousness caused by pipeline workers pushed businesses to move into malls built away from downtown. New commercial centers like Gavora Mall, Bentley Mall, and others {{away from the city}} center drove the construction of freeways that bypassed downtown Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured <b>a</b> <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused <b>a</b> <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show <b>a</b> <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if <b>a</b> <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008, US forces began {{accelerating}} their {{move out}} of cities across Iraq, turning over the task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces. The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher, who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country. There was <b>a</b> <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> the number of suicide attacks, and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 {{and appeared to be}} launching a concerted effort to cripple the government.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and <b>a</b> <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between December1992 and January1993. A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to {{the aftermath}} of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{conditions}} on the island also worsened under Rajoelina. The illegal exportation of endangered rosewood from protected national forests abruptly increased under the HAT, with several business leaders and politicians linked to the HAT having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects. A large, unexplained stash of rosewood logs was discovered at the presidential palace {{after the end of}} Rajoelina's term in office. Due to accelerating deforestation and <b>a</b> <b>spike</b> <b>in</b> bush meat consumption linked with deepening poverty, the island's lemurs moved closer toward extinction under Rajoelina's tenure. A July 2012 assessment found that 90percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, an increase from 38 percent in 2008. Lack of funds for pesticides and systematic spraying resulted in the March 2013 outbreak of a locust infestation that was anticipated to persist for five to ten years and require $41 million U.S. dollars to bring under control, deepening the risk of nationwide famine and destruction of habitat for endangered species.|$|E
