Cellulose supported nanoparticles can act as catalysts in many reactions.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of solid-state absorption features due to water ice, CO ice, and silicate {{dust in the}} spectrum of the bright infrared source (1 RS 1) associated with the Herbig-Haro nebula HH 100 in the R Coronae Australis dark cloud. These absorptions are shown to arise predominantly in the molecular cloud rather than in circumstellar matter associated with the infrared source itself, which we deduce to be a premain-sequence star obscured by ∼ 25 mag of visual extinction. In common with other lines of sight, the spectra indicate the presence of distinct hydrogen-rich (polar) and hydrogen-poor (nonpolar) phases in the ice toward HH 100 -IR. The nonpolar phase is dominated by CO. The strength of the solid CO feature at 4. 67 μm suggests {{that as much as}} ∼ 40 % of all CO in the line of sight may be in the solid phase. Our data show a lack of significant absorption at 4. 62 μm that might arise in CN-bearing molecules formed by energetic processing of the mantles. A previous report of structure in the profile of the 3 μm water-ice feature in HH 100 -IR that might be attributed to the N-H resonance in condensed ammonia at ∼ 2. 96 μm is not confirmed. The abundance ratio NH 3 :H 2 O in the ices is found to be no more than ∼ 8 %, which is probably insufficient to account for the 3. 3 - 3. 6 μm "ice-band wing" in terms of <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrate.</b> However, we propose that the wing might be explained by hydrates containing other bases in addition to ammonia.

40|$|Producing {{transportation}} fuels from bio sources was {{of prime}} importance {{due to the}} strict environmental legislations for producing clean fuels from conventional oil resources. However, the economical impacts of the biofuel production should be considered. In this study, the production of bio-naphtha and biodiesel from palm oil using homogeneous catalyst, i. e. an aqueous phase of ammonium molybdate, was studied. This catalyst was prepared by dissolving sodium molybdate in de-ionized water with hydrochloric acid, and then neutralizing the mixture with ammonium hydroxide. The solution was dried at 90 °C for 24 h to obtain ammonium molybdate. Then, characterization of the catalyst was done by informative techniques, such as XRD and FT-IR. The {{results showed that the}} main phase of the synthesized catalyst was molybdate <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrates</b> (4 MoO 3. 2 NH 3. H 2 O), and also bands of Mo–O, Mo–O–Mo, N–H and surface hydroxyl groups were observed in the sample. Moreover, activity test confirms that the bio-naphtha produced from the proposed method has a few aromatic components, and its sulfur content was negligible. Moreover, ash, nitrogen, sulfur and carbon residue were not detected in the produced biodiesel, and its Cetane index was 66. 3. Therefore, it was a suitable fuel for diesel engines vehicles.

Experimental techniques such as FT-ICR-MS and IRMPD were combined with ab initio calculations for the determination of structure and reactivity of the aforementioned types of systems. On the basis of high level electronic structure calculations of neutral water clusters (H 2 O) n with n = 17 - 21 a transitional size regime has been determined, where a structural stabilization between all-surface and interior configurations alternates with the addition or removal of a single water molecule. Electronic structure calculations suggested that for n = 17 and 19 the interior configuration would be energetically more stable than the all-surface one. The gas phase infrared spectrum of the singly <b>hydrated</b> <b>ammonium</b> ion, NH 4 +(H 2 O), had previously been recorded by photodissociation spectroscopy of mass selected ions and interpreted by means of ab initio calculations. The present work provides additional information on {{the shape of the}} potential energy curves of NH 4 +(H 2 O) along the N-H distance on MP 2 /aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory yielding an anharmonic potential shape. Calculation of potential energy curves of the O-H mode of the intramolecular hydrogen bond of various dicarboxylic acids (oxalic to adipic acid) revealed that the shapes of the potentials directly correlate {{to the size of the}} system and the resulting ring strain The shape of the potential is also influenced by the charge of the system. Calculation of anharmonic frequencies based on the VPT 2 approach lead to reasonable results in all systems with narrow potentials. IRMPD spectra of complexes in the gas phase have been recorded for a series of cationic vanadium oxide complexes when reacted with acetonitrile, methanol and ethanol. The experimental spectra are compared to calculated absorption spectra. The systematic DFT study identifies potential candidates for reductive nitrile coupling in cationic transition metal acetonitrile complexes. On the basis of the calculations, the formation of metallacyclic structures in group 3 through 7 complexes can be ruled out. Solvation of the transition metal cation by five acetonitrile ligands leads to a reductive nitrile coupling reaction in three types of complexes, namely those containing either niobium, tantalum or tungsten.
