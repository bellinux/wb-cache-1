40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} {{veterans}} {{have a higher}} prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection than nonveterans, possibly because of military exposures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the prevalence of <b>anti–hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>antibody</b> and evaluate factors associated with infection among users of Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. Using a two-staged cluster sample, 1, 288 of 3, 863 randomly selected veterans completed a survey and under-went home-based phlebotomy for serological testing. Administrative and clinical data were used to correct the prevalence estimate for nonparticipation. The prevalence of anti– hepatitis C antibody among serology participants was 4. 0 % (95 % CI, 2. 6 %- 5. 5 %). The estimated prevalence in the population of Veterans Affairs medical center users was 5. 4 % (95 % CI, 3. 3 %- 7. 5 %) after correction for sociodemographic and clinical differences be-tween participants and nonparticipants. Significant predictors of seropositivity included demographic factors, period of military service (e. g., Vietnam era), prior diagnoses, health care use, and lifestyle factors. At least one traditional risk factor (transfusion or intravenous drug use) was reported by 30. 2 % of all subjects. Among those testing positive for hepatitis C antibody, 78 % either had a transfusion or had used injection drugs. Adjusting for injectio...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveEarly {{studies on}} blood donors {{point to a}} {{seroprevalence}} of approximately 0. 25 % for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Iran. However, the true prevalence {{in the general population}} is unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of HCV infection in the general population of Iran. MethodsWe randomly selected 6583 subjects from three provinces in Iran for inclusion in the study. Subjects were aged between 18 and 65 years. <b>Anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>antibody</b> was tested by a third-generation ELISA test. A recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) test was used to confirm the results. Risk factors were recorded and a multivariate analysis was performed. ResultsA total of 5684 plasma samples were tested. After confirmatory tests, we found 50 cases of HCV. The overall weighted prevalence of anti-HCV was 0. 5 %. The rate was significantly higher in men (1. 0 %) than in women (0. 1 %). In multivariate analysis, male sex, history of intravenous drug abuse, and imprisonment were significantly associated with anti-HCV. ConclusionsWe found the prevalence of HCV infection in Iran to be higher than previous estimates. It appears that the rate is rising, and in the future, hepatitis C will replace hepatitis B as the most common cause of chronic viral liver disease in Iran...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that our inner city obstetric patients who have been infected with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) will have a higher prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection {{than the general population}} and to identify specific risk factors and high-risk groups. Methods: All patients in our prenatal clinic (July 1997 –April 1999) who tested positive for one or more STDs were asked to return for hepatitis C antibody testing. Medical charts of all patients who returned for hepatitis C testing were reviewed. Results: A total of 106 patients with STDs were tested for hepatitis C. Positive screening tests for <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>antibody</b> were found in 6. 6 % (7 / 106) of the patients (95 % CI = 2. 7 – 13. 1 %). This frequency is significantly higher than the hepatitis C prevalence (1. 8 %) in the general United States population (p = 0. 006). Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed only older age (p = 0. 016) and positive HIV status (p = 0. 023) to be significant predictors of hepatitis C infection. Conclusions: Inner city STD-infected obstetric patients are at high risk for hepatitis C infection compared with the general population. Increasing age and HIV-positive status are risk factors which are significantly associated with hepatitis C infection. Key words: HEPATITIS C; SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE; PREGNANC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Viral {{hepatitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the liver due to viral infections and there are groups of viruses that affects the liver of which hepatitis B and C viruses are the causative agents of sever form of liver disease with high rate of mortality. Medical waste handlers who undergo collection, transportation, and disposal of medical wastes in the health institutions {{are at risk of}} exposure to acquire those infections which transmit mainly as a result of contaminated blood and other body fluids including injury with sharp instruments, splash to the eye or mucous membrane. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B and/or C viruses and associated risk factors among medical waste handlers. Results A cross-sectional study was conducted from April, 2011 to June, 2011 in government health institutions at Gondar town. Socio-demographic and possible risk factors data from medical waste handlers were collected using pre-tested and well structured questionnaires. Venous bloods were collected and the serums were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen and <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>antibody</b> using rapid Immunochromatography assay. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS software package (version 16). Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to assess risk of association. A p-value of A total of 100 medical waste handlers and 100 non-clinical waste handlers were examined for HBV and HCV viruses. HBV was detected in 6 (6. 0 %) and 1 (1. 0 %) and HCV in 1 (1. 0 %) and 0 (0. 0 %) of medical waste handlers and non-clinical waste handlers, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the detection rates of HBV (OR = 6. 3; X 2 = 4. 1; P = 0. 04) and overall infection rate (HBV + HCV) (OR = 7. 5; X 2 = 5. 2; P: 0. 02) in medical waste handlers when compared with non-clinical waste handlers. It was found that none of the observed risk factors significantly associated with rate of hepatitis infection compared to others. Conclusions Prevalence of HBV and HCV were significantly higher in medical waste in relation to non-clinical waste handlers. There were poor waste management system which contributed for occurrence of higher degree of sharps injury and blood and body fluids splash. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{performances of}} five commercially available second-generation assays for <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibody,</b> two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, one enzyme immunoassay, and two particle agglutination assays (passive hemagglutination assay and particle agglutination assay), were evaluated. Among 104 samples from healthy subjects and 300 consecutive samples from patient ordered for routine determinations of <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibody</b> in serum, assay results showed variable degrees of discordance for 17 samples (4. 2 %). These 17 samples were further tested by an immunoblot assay, the polymerase chain reaction-RNA assay, and the hemagglutination inhibition assay. Four of the 17 samples {{were regarded as}} true positive, since all supplementary assays and clinical data indicated active hepatitis C virus infection.

Twenty one patients were treated with three million units of interferon alfa 2 a {{three times a week}} for 52 weeks, 24 patients were treated similarly for eight weeks, and 25 patients were given a placebo for eight weeks and served as control. Sixty six of 70 patients (94 %) were positive for both hepatitis C virus RNA and second generation <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibody.</b> Fourteen of 21 (67 %) receiving the longterm treatment had a normalised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, and in 12 of these hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid became undetectable by the end of treatment and remained so during the three year follow up after the treatment. <b>Anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibody</b> determined by first generation assay became negative in one case {{at the end of the}} 52 week treatment, and in four cases at the end of the one year follow up. In contrast, only one of 24 (4 %) who received the eight week treatment and only one of 25 (4 %) who received the placebo had normalised ALT activities. Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid became negative in two patients undergoing short-term treatment and in none receiving the placebo.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is elevated in alcoholic patients, but {{the risk factors}} are unclear. The role of parenteral risk factors are indeterminated in this population. AIMS: To determine the {{prevalence of}} hepatitis C virus infection in alcoholic patients admitted to a detoxification unit and to evaluate the presence of underlying parenteral risk factors. METHODS: A total of 114 consecutive unselected alcoholic patients admitted to a single chemical dependency unit during 14 month were included. Epidemiological data and history of parenteral risk factors for hepatitis C virus infection were obtained with a standardized questionnaire. Blood was collected for determination of aminotransferases and <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibodies</b> (ELISA- 3). Positive samples were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and tested for genotype. RESULTS: Among the 114 alcoholics, 17 (15 %) were <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus positive. Of these, 12 (71 %) had detectable serum HCV-RNA by PCR. Genotype 1 was found in six cases and genotype 3 in five (one patient was undetermined). Forty-nine (43 %) patients had elevated serum ALT and/or AST at baseline. The comparison between the 17 positive and the 97 negative patients showed significant differences in mean serum ALT levels (42 ± 41 IU/L vs. 22 ± 20 IU/L), rate of elevated ALT (65 % vs. 34 %), and presence of parenteral risk factors (94 % vs. 10 %). Comparison between alcoholic patients with and without elevated aminotransferases showed significant difference only {{in the rate of}} positive <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibodies</b> (24 % vs. 7 %). Furthermore, among the 17 <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus positive patients, the rate of detectable HCV-RNA was significantly higher in the 12 with elevated aminotransferases versus the 5 with normal aminotransferases (92 % vs. 20 %). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibodies</b> in alcoholics and the majority was confirmed by the presence of detectable HCV-RNA.

We have developed a new method that allows parallel analysis of multiple analytes in biological fluids and is suitable for biological and medical studies. METHODS: This technology for studying peptide-antibody interactions is based on polypyrrole-peptide chips and surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). We generated a chip bearing a large panel of peptide probes by successive electro-directed copolymerizations of pyrrole-peptide conjugates on a gold surface. RESULTS: We provide evidence that (a) the signal produced by antibody binding is highly specific; (b) the detected signal specifically reflects the antibody concentration of the tested solution in a dose-dependent manner; (c) this technique is appropriate for analyzing complex media such as undiluted sera, a novelty with respect to previous techniques; and (d) correlation between classic ELISA results and the SPRi signal is good (P = 0. 008). We also validated this system in a medical model by detecting <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>antibodies</b> in patient-derived sera. CONCLUSION: Because of its characteristics (easy preparation of the peptide chip; high-throughput, label-free, real-time detection; high specificity; and low background), this technology is suitable for screening biological samples and for large-scale studies...|$|R

40|$|The high {{frequency}} of liver involvement in cryoglobulinemia is well established.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus {{infection}} in infancy largely depends on vertical transmission. The transfer of hepatitis C virus from mother to child is almost invariably restricted to children whose mother is viremic, {{and the rate}} of transmission seems to be influenced by maternal virus load, although, in the single patient, the levels of viremia cannot be used as predictors of pediatric infection. In fact, the flow-chart for screening children at risk for vertically transmitted hepatitis C virus infection takes into account maternal viremia. In children born to <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibody</b> positive, hepatitis <b>C</b> virus-RNA negative mothers, alanine aminotransferase and <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus should be investigated at 18 - 24 months of life.

40|$|Background. Chronic {{liver disease}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} complications after renal transplantation. Hepatitis B and mainly hepatitis C are the more frequent causes of liver disease. Although there are controversial results, in some series, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are associated with lower graft and patient survival. Patients and methods. A total of 3365 adult patients who received a renal transplant in 1990 (N 824), 1994 (N 1075) and 1998 (N 1466) with a functioning graft after the first year were included. Fifty-one (2. 1 %) with positive HbsAg were diagnosed with hepatitis B at transplantation; 488 (16. 9 %) presented positive <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>antibodies</b> and were diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and 25 patients (0. 8 %) were diagnosed with concomitant hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HVC infection. Demographic, immunosuppression, survival figures and post-trans-plant and follow-up data of these patients and negative HBV and HVC patients were recorded. Results. The overall prevalence of HBV in the recipients was 2. 1 %. Patient survival was lower and liver disease was the main cause of death in HBV-positive patients. However, in the multivariate analysis the presence of positive HbsAg did not have an independent risk factor for graft loss and patient death. This finding was similar in patients with concomitant HBV and HVC infection. Graft and patient survival were lower in HCV-positive patients and liver disease was the main cause of death.

Hepatitis C viral RNA (HCV RNA) was identified in the serum using the polymerase chain reaction proving that the patient was a carrier. In Patient 2, polyarthritis occurred associated with chronic hepatitis C liver disease. Synovial biopsy showed infiltration of mononuclear cells. HCV RNA was demonstrated in both serum and SF. These cases suggest an aetiologic association between arthritis and hepatitis C antigenaemia. KEY WORDS: Polyarthritis, Hepatitis C virus carrier, Chronic antigenaemia. SINCE the advent of tests for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, extrahepatic manifestations, including urti-caria [1], erythema nodosum [2] and cryoglobulin-aemia [3] {{have been reported in}} association with hepatitis C. We report two patients with polyarthritis associated with HCV infection...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the pattern of hepatobiliary complications among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and to assess their correlation with age, gender and other risk factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed 106 patients with SCD who were admitted to Al Wahda Teaching Hospital in Aden, Yemen, between January and June 2009. A full history, thorough examination, essential laboratory investigations (including a complete blood count, liver function test and viral markers test) and an abdominal ultrasound were performed on all patients. The clinicopathological characteristics of the hepatobiliary complications were analysed for their correlation to different risk factors such as age and gender. Results: It was found that 46. 2 % of the patients with SCD had hepatobiliary complications. Of these, 36. 7 % had viral hepatitis, 26. 0 % had cholecystitis and 20 % had gallstones. A total of 60. 4 % of the affected patients were male. The mean levels of alanine aminotransferase (59. 4 and 56. 0 U/L) and aspartate transaminase (40. 1 and 38. 3 U/L) were significantly elevated in patients with viral hepatitis and cholecystitis, respectively. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen showed higher positivity (10. 4 %) than anti-hepatitis A and <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Hepatobiliary complications increased significantly with age and were notably higher among those who were often admitted to hospital and/or underwent frequent blood transfusions. Conclusion: This study suggests that hepatobiliary complications are common among SCD patients {{and the likelihood of}} developing such complications increases as patients age. Thus, regular clinical follow-ups, abdominal ultrasound studies and periodic liver function tests, as well as serological tests for viral hepatitis, are strongly recommended. These can help in the early detection of these complications and allow opportunities for their management and prevention...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} with prior reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was applied to hepatitis C virus RNA detection in human serum samples of different origin. In order to eliminate false negative results, the following steps were optimized: RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and oligonucleotide primer selection. We compared different RNA extraction methods using guanidinium salt/detergent and proteinase K digestion/ phenol extraction, and tested virus particle enrichment with polyethylene glycol precipitation and ultracen-trifugation. RNA extraction with guanidinium salt/detergent was the most efficient method. Ultracentrifugation of single samples did not improve hepatitis C virus RNA detection. Polyethylene glycol precipitation performed poorly. Recombinant thermostable reverse transcriptase produced cDNA from fewer samples than did Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase. Nested oligonucleotide primers from the 5 '-terminal non-coding region of the hepatitis C virus genome amplified cDNA from more samples than did primers from the coding regions. Thirty six <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibody</b> positive samples were tested; nested primers (nucleotides 6 to 327 and 15 to 288) yielded 21 amplificates, whereas primers from the coding region produced 16 amplificates (nucleotides 4684 — 5276) an...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Sixty-four cases of malignant lymphoma involving the liver were examined. Of these, 20 cases were histologically confirmed to be primary hepatic B-cell lymphoma. Twelve of these 20 cases were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and eight cases were mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Of the 12 cases of DLBCL, six were immunohistologically positive for CD 10 and/or Bcl 6 (indicating a germinal center phenotype), six were positive for Bcl 2, and five were positive for CD 25. Eight of the 12 DLBCL cases (66. 7 %) {{and two of}} the eight MALT lymphoma cases (25 %) had serum <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus (HCV) <b>antibodies</b> and HCV RNA.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of seroepidemiological survey of Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among the Karen, La-Wah and Lahu-Na, designated as the hill tribes, in northern Thailand. Some of these hill tribes {{are living in the}} remote and isolated mountain areas, settling their own communities. Anti-HIV seropositive cases were found only in the Lahu-Na (2. 6 %). The highest incidence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs-Ag) positive was found in the Karen (13. 2 %), followed by the Lahu-Na (2. 6 %) and the La-Wah (1. 7 %). The highest incidence of <b>anti-Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibody</b> (anti-HCV) positive was found in the La-Wah (3. 3 %), followed by the Karen and the Lahu-Na (2. 6 %, respectively). Two out of nine anti-HCV positive cases were from seven and 11 year-old Karenean girls, who had no previous history of surgery, blood transfusion, intravenous medication, vaccination and dental therapy. These results suggest that HIV infections have not yet reached to the hill tribes, except the Lahu-Na. One of the possible transmission routes of HCV infection is a vertical or intrahhousehold infection among the hill tribes in northern Thailand...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to find out the sero-prevalence of Hepatitis C {{infection}} among blood donors. Materials and Methods: All collected blood bags were screened for <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibodies</b> (HCV Ab; MicroELISA 3 rd generation, J. Mitra) during the study period of 4 years and data were analyzed. Results: A total of 28621 blood donors were screened for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) in which 80 donors were positive for Hepatitis C infection, constituted 11 % of total sero-reactive donors. In 2009, only 10 cases were sero-reactive while in 2012, 36 cases were sero-reactive for Hepatitis C infection. Conclusions: Hepatitis C infection among blood donors are in rising trends in this study area. Voluntary donors are safer than replacement donors as they have very low sero-prevalence. As these blood donors represent the highly selective community of a general population in most of the countries. So the actual sero-prevalence of hepatitis C infection may be more in the general population. Promoting HCV screening, voluntary blood donation, diagnosis and treatment among blood donors are very important measures to control the transmission of HCV infection, decrease sero-reactive cases and ensure safe blood collection...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{performances of}} three commercially available recombinant immunoblot assays (RIBAs) for <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibody</b> were evaluated on 50 ORTHO-HCV RIBA- 2 (RIBA- 2) -indeterminate serum samples. Concordant interpretations were obtained {{with the three}} tests in 60 % of the samples, with 56 % positive, 2 % indeterminate, and 2 % negative results. Considering test performance {{in regard to the}} number of remaining indeterminate results, analyzing sera by RIBA- 3, INNO-LIA HCV Ab III, and DECISCAN HCV reduced the number of samples reacting indeterminately to 40, 6, and 8 %, respectively. The three serum samples classified as indeterminate in the INNO-LIA HCV Ab III as well as three of four serum samples interpreted as indeterminate in the DECISCAN HCV and 16 of 20 samples classified as indeterminate in the RIBA- 3 were hepatitis C virus RNA positive by PCR. This study clearly shows the good performance of the three tests as confirmatory assays compared with that of the RIBA- 2. However, according to the manufacturers' criteria of positivity, the INNO-LIA HCV Ab III and DECISCAN HCV appeared to be more suitable than the RIBA- 3 for interpreting serum samples found indeterminate in the RIBA- 2...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} the liver function tests of 145 patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) (75 patients with primary SjS, 70 patients with secondary SjS), and characterized the SjS patients with abnormal liver function tests from several points of view: 1, {{the incidence of}} them in the primary SjS comparing with that in secondary SjS. 2, the staining pattern of anti-nuclear antibodies, and 3, the existence of <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus (HCV) <b>antibody,</b> hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen, and antibody against human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). Abnormal liver function tests were detected in 38 out of 145 patients (26. 2 %) with SjS. Fifteen of the 38 patients (20. 0 %) had primary SjS while the remaining patients (32. 9 %) had secondary SjS. Histopathological examination identified primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in 2 patients, autoimmune hepatitis in 4 patients, and auto...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHepatitis C {{virus infects}} over 15 million {{patients}} from India and 2. 86 million from Brazil. Detection of <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus <b>antibodies</b> has limited sensitivity during acute phase: the pre-seroconversion window period. Hepatitis C virus-RNA detection techniques {{are used to}} overcome this shortfall, but are costly and unavailable widely in developing countries. Estimation of hepatitis C virus core-antigen, a protein with highly conserved sequence, by enzyme-immunoassays is an economic and simpler alternative to RNA detection. This {{study was conducted in}} Delhi, involving 300 acute and chronic liver disease patients, tested for <b>anti-hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus 3 rd-generation ELISA, hepatitis C virus core-antigen-ELISA and hepatitis C virus-RNA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Among the acute patients, hepatitis C virus core-antigen assay could identify 13 out of 14 pre-seroconversion window period cases and 6 out of 8 seroconverted cases, with a pre-seroconversion window period sensitivity of 92. 9 % and specificity of 100 %. In hepatitis C virus core-antigen-positive cases, the viral load was in the range of 4900 to 1. 46 × 106 IU/mL, whereas in hepatitis C virus core-antigen-negative cases, the range of viral load was 100 – 4500 IU/mL. The cost of the hepatitis C virus core-antigen-ELISA was estimated around 3 – 4 times lesser than the in-house reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 9 – 10 times lesser than the United States Food and Drug Administration approved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. With a good sensitivity and specificity in the acute phase of infection, hepatitis C virus core-antigen-ELISA can thus be a useful alternative in the developing nations...|$|R
