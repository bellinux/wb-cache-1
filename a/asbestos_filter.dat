2500|$|Many scare {{stories have}} {{originated}} from various Russian gas masks and their filters {{that are now}} common in surplus stores; the GP-5 was often considered to have an <b>asbestos</b> <b>filter.</b> In October 2013, an asbestos lab in Salt Lake City {{found out that the}} particle filter is made of 7.5% asbestos. [...] The filter is made so that the asbestos fibres cannot be breathed in, if the filter layer is not damaged.. [...] Nearly all Russian Cold War period masks contain asbestos, however, only the ones produced before 1972 pose a threat, and even then, the construction of the mask makes it impossible to breathe the asbestos in if not damaged.|$|E
40|$|The mode of {{sterilization}} (filtration or heat) {{was found}} to significantly affect the activity of trypsin solutions. Trypsin activity was substantially reduced in the initial fractions of filtrate passed through <b>asbestos</b> <b>filter</b> pads; heat-sterilized trypsin was satisfactory for transfer of cell cultures grown on glass. Heat-sterilized trypsin may be useful when elimination of filterable organisms is required...|$|E
40|$|Our studies {{reveal that}} normal rabbit blood {{contains}} a potent bactericidin active against Listeria monocytogenes. The factor {{is present in}} greatest amounts in fresh undiluted serum but is absent in platelet extracts. A correlation was observed between the virulence of Listeria strains and their relative ability to survive in serum. The bactericidal titers obtained for plasma and plasma serum indicate that clotting must occur for optimum expression of antilisterial activity. The lethal action is not elevated after immunization with viable Listeria nor does it appear to depend on heat-labile components of complement. The active factor was removed from serum by filtration through a cellulose <b>asbestos</b> <b>filter</b> pad and further purified by carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography. Iron significantly diminishes serum lethality and completely abolishes {{the action of the}} purified component. The listericidal factor resembles β-lysin but may be a distinct part of a multiple system of similar bactericidins...|$|E

40|$|Enteroviruses {{added to}} 114 liters of dechlorinated tap water were {{recovered}} in a 16 -ml sample by a two-stage concentration procedure in which {{different types of}} membrane filters were used in each concentration stage. Viruses in tap water at pH 3. 5 were first adsorbed to 10 -in. (ca. 25. 4 -cm) epoxy-fiber glass filters (Filterite). Viruses adsorbed to these filters were eluted with a solution of 0. 2 M sodium trichloroacetate buffered at pH 9 with 0. 2 M lysine. Viruses in this solution were adsorbed to 47 -mm <b>asbestos</b> <b>filters</b> (Seitz) without pH adjustment or other modification of the solution. Viruses were recovered from the Seitz filters with 16 ml of either Casitone or fetal calf serum at pH 9. With these procedures ca. 45 % of several types of enteroviruses added to 114 liters of tap water could be recovered in the final 16 -ml sample...|$|R
40|$|Two {{temperate}} bacteriophages {{have been}} isolated from Bacillus larvae: PBL 1 and PBL 0. 5. Strains lysogenic {{for either of}} these phages are immune to lysis by the same phage but {{are sensitive to the}} other phage. PBL 1 has an oval head, a non-contractile tail, and a base plate with a pin structure but no apparent tail fibres. The genome of PBL 1 consists of double-stranded DNA with a molecular weight of 24. 1 (+ 0 - 6) x 106, a G + C content (derived from melting temperature) of 41. 5 ~, and cohesive nds. Restriction enzyme analysis permitted construction of a physical map of the genome. Bacillus larvae is a pathogen of the larvae of the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.), causing a fatal disease called American foulbrood. A bacteriophage of B. larvae was first isolated by Smirnova (1953) from decaying larvae of bees killed by American foulbrood. Gochnauer (1955) isolated a phage from a lysogenic ulture of B. larvae. Differences were found between Gochnauer's phage and that isolated by Smirnova (1954) in their ability to pass through <b>asbestos</b> <b>filters,</b> heat stability and plaque morphology (Gochnauer, 1970). In addition to describing some properties of the one phage isolated from the strain now known as B. larvae NRRL B- 3553 (Gochnauer & L'Arrivee, 1969), Gochnauer (1970) presented evidence suggesting that other phages wer...|$|R
40|$|A {{cationic}} protein of rabbit serum bactericidal for Staphylococcus aureus was purified. The {{specific activity}} {{per unit of}} protein of the purified staphylocidal preparation was approximately 37, 000 times {{greater than that of}} the serum from which it was isolated. Similar techniques were used to purify serum β-lysin active against Bacillus subtilis approximately 24, 000 times. The staphylocidal activity cannot be attributed to the same β-lysin active against B. subtilis, lysozyme, or antibody-complement systems. The concentrations of staphylocidal β-lysin in the sera of the five mammalian species studied did not correlate with their β-lysin activities against B. subtilis. The two β-lysins are similar in that both were heat-stable, sensitive to trypsin digestion, had molecular weights near 6, 000, and were found in higher concentrations in serum than in plasma. Furthermore, similar techniques can be used to absorb and elute both substances in highly purified forms using cellulose <b>asbestos</b> <b>filter</b> pads and ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose. In contrast to the β-lysin against B. subtilis, the staphylocidal β-lysin was not released from blood platelets, and it was inactive in the presence of heparin, sodium citrate, sodium oxalate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, acidic phospholipids, and acid pH values. A variety of proteins, including those of normal serum, preferentially inhibited the bactericidal activity of staphylocidal β-lysin but not the β-lysin against B. subtilis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1. 1. Yellow fever was {{successfully}} transmitted to Macacus rhesus. 2. 2. It was easily transmitted from man to monkey, {{as well as}} from monkey to monkey, by the injection of citrated blood taken early {{in the course of the}} disease. It was also transmitted from monkey to monkey by Aëdes (Stegomyia) aegypti. 3. 3. Mosquitoes, when once infected, were found to remain infective for the entire period of their lives, which in our experience exceeded three months in some instances, and the bite of a single infected mosquito was sufficient to produce a fatal infection in a monkey. 4. 4. The virus was not transmitted from one generation of mosquitoes to another through the eggs. 5. 5. When in the circulating blood of monkeys, the virus passed through Berkefeld filters of V and N grades, and also through Seitz <b>asbestos</b> <b>filters,</b> but it was not filterable through Berkefeld W filters. 6. 6. The virus was not filtrable when in the mosquitoes. 7. 7. The clinical course of the disease and the lesions produced by the virus in Macacus rhesus were similar to those found in human yellow fever. 8. 8. Attempts to cultivate the virus either from infectious blood or from filtered mosquito emulsions were negative. 9. 9. No spirochetes, leptospira, or other forms of microorganism were found in tissues of infected animals stained by Giemsa and Levaditi methods. 10. 10.

5000|$|Until the Second World War {{asbestos}} {{was mostly}} imported from South Africa and Canada. The Australian market for asbestos before the Second World War was worth $1 million a year, {{and there was}} export potential. Hancock had promising talks with the British, who were desperate to use <b>asbestos</b> as <b>filters</b> in gas masks, and his partners [...] Islwyn (Izzy) Walters and Walter (Len) Leonard had negotiations with Johns Manville in the United States. When the Second World War came asbestos was in high demand for use in tanks, planes, battleships, helmets and gasmasks. In 1943 the mine was sold to CSR Limited subsidiary, Australian Blue Asbestos Pty Ltd (ABA), where Hancock remained as manager until 1948.|$|R
40|$|The fibrous aerosol monitor (FAM) was {{designed}} to count fibrous particulates as accurately as the standard method, P & CAM 239, now NIOSH 7400. The Hi-Vol (HV) method, a modification of the standard method, was developed to collect fibers over a shorter time interval (i. e., 10 -minutes) with the same accuracy as the standard method. The current study sought to compare the HV method with the FAM to assess its validity in measuring airborne asbestos levels and to assess the importance of short-term variation in asbestos levels in determining appropriate respiratory protection. Correlation between the FAM and HV showed a poor linear relationship in all comparison studies. However, there was good correlation between the average of short-term HV samples and long-term time-weighted average (TWA) samples at reported low levels of airborne <b>asbestos.</b> All membrane <b>filter</b> techniques showed strong correlation with each other, but were weakly correlated with the FAM.

40|$|A {{large number}} of samples are {{required}} to characterize a site contaminated with asbestos from previous mine or other industrial operations. Current methods, such as EPA Region 10 ’s glovebox method, or the Berman Elutriator method are time consuming and costly primarily because the equipment is difficult to decontaminate between samples. EPA desires a shorter and less costly method for characterizing soil samples for asbestos. The objective of this was to design and test a qualitative asbestos sampler that operates as a fluidized bed. The proposed sampler employs a conical spouted bed to vigorously mix the soil and separate fine particulate including <b>asbestos</b> fibers on <b>filters.</b> The filters are then analyzed using transmission electron microscopy for presence of asbestos. During initial testing of a glass prototype using ASTM 20 / 30 sand and clay fines as asbestos surrogates, fine particulate adhered {{to the sides of}} the glass vessel and the tubing to the collection filter – presumably due to static charge on the fine particulate. This limited the fines recovery to ~ 5 % of the amount added to the sand surrogate. A second prototype was constructed of stainless steel, which improved fines recovery to about 10 %. Fines recovery was increased to 15 % by either humidifying the inlet air or introducing a voltage probe in the air space above the sample. Since this was not a substantial improvement, testing using the steel prototype proceeded without using these techniques. Final testing of the second prototype using asbestos suggests that the fluidized bed is considerably more sensitive than the Berman elutriator method. Using a sand/tremolite mixture with 0. 005 % tremolite, the Berman elutriator did not segregate any asbestos structures while the fluidized bed segregated an average of 11. 7. The fluidized bed was also able to segregate structures in samples containing asbestos at a 0. 0001 % concentration, while the Berman elutriator method did not detect any fibers at this concentration. Opportunities for improvement with the fluidized bed include improving reproducibility among replicates, increasing mass recovery, improving the lid gasket seal...|$|R
