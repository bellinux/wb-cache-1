5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds.

5|$|Although Katia passed well {{north of}} the Lesser Antilles, a yellow alert was hoisted for Guadeloupe to notify {{residents}} of dangerous seas. Strong rip currents along the East Coast of the United States led {{to the deaths of}} two swimmers. After losing its tropical characteristics, Katia prompted the issuance of numerous warnings across Europe. Hurricane-force winds impacted numerous locations, downing trees, toppling power poles, and leaving thousands without electricity. The storm was responsible for two deaths in the United Kingdom: one when a tree fell on a vehicle in County Durham, and another during a multi-car accident on the M54 motorway resulting from <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> The post-tropical cyclone caused approximately £100m ($157million, 2011 USD) in damage in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E

The attack was the third in a series of attacks on North Vietnamese oil storage depots dating back to June. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, Coker provided accurate guidance to the pilot on airspeed, altitude and dive angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and electronic countermeasures. Despite <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> Coker's actions contributed to an attack that destroyed {{all but one of the}} facility's storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to Italy the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade {{was sent to}} Rome on 3 September, and moved again on 8 September to a camp near Taranto {{to prepare for a}} {{possible}} mission in Greece, Operation Manna.

5|$|The Hunter F.1 entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour. A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} effect of Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) on the risk of {{cascading}} failure which resulted from <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> based on the risk-based security assessment (RBSA) method. An improved piecewise probability model is described to reflect the impact of <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> and overloads. Based on power-injection model of UPFC, an optimal power flow control strategy is integrated into the RBSA procedure to relieve the risk of cascading failure caused by initiating event. Furthermore, a sensitivity based approach is adopted to determine the optimal location of UPFC. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on IEEE RTS- 79 system...|$|R

5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was different to his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When it took off the crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to fly on instruments alone, in <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E
5|$|Having not {{featured}} for Cardiff {{during the}} opening months of the 2010–11 season, Comminges joined League One side Carlisle United on a short-term loan deal until 31 December 2010.

However, Comminges failed to make a league appearance during his three-month loan spell, playing just 45 minutes in a 3–2 win over Conference National side Tamworth in the FA Cup. The <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> during his loan agreement had resulted in a spate of postponements, and Comminges returned to his parent club earlier than agreed.

5|$|The {{incompletion}} on 3rd down {{stopped the}} clock with 2:11 {{left in the}} game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away, which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the Metrodome, there were no <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> that might have affected the kick. The ball was snapped on 4th down with punter Mitch Berger holding. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback Michael Booker {{on the left side}} of the line of scrimmage and cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Ray Buchanan on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked him to the ground after the kick. The ball sailed about a foot wide left of the upright with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson stood with arms akimbo on the field momentarily before heading to the sideline, as Falcons players celebrated around him.|$|E

Analysis of speed reduction shows precipitation, hour of day, snowy condition and seasons reduce speed. The predicted dispersion show NOx concentration was high in clear <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> compared to <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> due to higher traffic volumes and higher emissions. However, in snowy <b>weather</b> <b>condition,</b> wind speed had more influence on NOx concentration than emission rat...|$|R
50|$|Overconfidence is {{dangerous}} in aviation. When overconfidence {{occurred in the}} cockpit, the pilot may have underestimated several important things and maybe even critical things {{that had to be}} done while in-flight. Interviews conducted by the AIC revealed that Captain Lee had good flying skills, and further stated that he, Captain Lee, had successfully landed in an airport previously in <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> because of his proficiency where some pilots might have initiated a missed approach. The pilots stated that Captain Lee was quite confident of his flying skills. This might be one of the factors that explained why the captain intentionally flew below the Minimum Descent Altitude and tried to visually locate the runway while maintaining 200 ft.|$|R
5|$|In 1950, the club's home {{moved from}} the Antônio Carlos to the newer and larger Estádio Independência. The season saw another Campeonato Mineiro triumph and the club's first European tour, in which it played ten games in five countries. The {{excursion}} happened {{at a time when}} there were neither regular national competitions in Brazil nor continental ones in South America, and followed soon after the traumatic Maracanazo. The tour and Atlético's results, many of which achieved under <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> and snow, were seen by national sports media as a historic achievement for Brazilian football itself. The team, captained by Zé do Monte, was dubbed the Campeões do Gelo ("Ice Champions"), a title that is remembered in the club's official anthem. The club's success in the state competition continued in the 1950s, a decade that saw the rise of forward Ubaldo and five consecutive Campeonato Mineiro victories from 1952 to 1956. After another state league title in 1958, Atlético took part in the inaugural edition of the Taça Brasil in the following year, reaching the third round. The tournament, the country's first annual nationwide competition, was a cup contested between state league champions, originally created by the CBD to select Brazil's entrants in the newly formed Copa Libertadores.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1810, all the British {{troops and}} ships were {{assembled}} and Bertie ordered the squadron to rendezvous off Grand Baie, which was reached early on 29 November despite adverse winds. The vanguard landed unopposed, their landing craft supported by ship's boats carrying cannon, supplemented by the firepower {{of the larger}} ships offshore. Although there was some disruption {{in the early stages}} of the attack caused by <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> by 21:00 the entire vanguard and naval brigades were ashore. The landing had been effected with just two casualties, both men who died of natural causes. Keating took command of the vanguard and advanced on Fort Malartic, the garrison retreating before his troops and blowing up the fort as they left. During the morning of 30 November, Keating pushed southwards to the River Tombeau which overlooked Port Napoleon, his front units skirmishing with French defenders across the river, during which Decaen himself was lightly wounded by a musket ball. The bridge over the river had been held by a force of militia, but they fell back before the British advance and failed to properly demolish the bridge, allowing Keating to rapidly cross and threaten Port Napoleon. At Grand Baie, the remainder of the invasion force were coming ashore, so that the entire army had landed by midday, although Abercromby himself elected to stay with Beaver on HMS Nisus and follow the advance from offshore.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Operation Matterhorn was not successful. The nine raids {{conducted}} against Japan via {{bases in}} China succeeded only in destroying Ōmura's aircraft factory. XXBomber Command lost 125 B-29s {{during all of}} its operations from bases in India and China, though only 22 or 29 were destroyed by Japanese forces; {{the majority of the}} losses were due to flying accidents. The attacks had a limited impact on Japanese civilian morale but forced the Japanese military to reinforce the home islands' air defenses {{at the expense of other}} areas. These results did not justify the large allocation of Allied resources to the operation, however. Moreover, the diversion of some supply aircraft flown between India and China to support XXBomber Command's efforts may have prevented the Fourteenth Air Force from undertaking more effective operations against Japanese positions and shipping. The official history of the USAAF judged that the difficulty of transporting adequate supplies to India and China was the most important factor behind the failure of Operation Matterhorn, though technical problems with the B-29s and the inexperience of their crews also hindered the campaign. The <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> common over Japan also limited the effectiveness of the Superfortresses, as crews that managed to reach their target were often unable to bomb accurately due to high winds or cloud cover.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} an eyewitness of the crash. The eyewitness was a Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) security guard stationed about 1 km from the runway. He stated that the conditions at the airport were dark skies and light precipitation. He saw the aircraft coming and stated that the aircraft was not stable as it passed over him. He further stated that the approach lights were not on and everywhere was dark and raining. Seconds later, he heard a loud bang, with fire and thick smoke. Another eyewitness, a Sosoliso Airlines pilot departing to Enugu, also reported <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> in the airport. Firemen in the airport handling the crash also stated bad <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> were present, and {{they were forced to}} reposition their equipment due to high wind. This implies that the flight crew wasn't prepared to execute a missed approach at the decision altitude as the aircraft descended below the decision altitude. Apparently, the crew didn't follow the right procedure for a missed approach. Even if they conducted a recovery from <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> associated with windshear, the procedure adopted by the crew was improper.|$|R
50|$|The 2000 Marsa Brega Short 360 crash {{occurred}} on 13 January 2000 when a full-loaded Swiss-registered Short 360 leased by Avisto ditched {{into the sea}} near Marsa Brega in Libya. The aircraft was chartered by Sirte Oil Company to transport oil workers to the city. It was carrying 41 people consisted of 38 passengers and 3 crews. Most of the passengers were foreigners. As both engines failed in mid-flight, the crew chose to ditch the aircraft. The crash {{claimed the lives of}} 21 people. An official investigation concluded that the de-icing device on the aircraft was not activated. The aircraft flew into an <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> and an icing condition occurred in mid-flight. The ice melted and flooded the engine, causing both engines to fail. The Libyan Civil Aviation Authority also blamed the pilots for conducting conversation unrelated to the flight.|$|R

30|$|This type of crash is {{the most}} {{widespread}} crash at the vicinity of intersections. As it was previously mentioned, the probability {{of other types of}} crashes occurring at junctions or intersections has reduced, whereas it has increased for this type of crash. The very simple form of the utility function is because of where this type of crash happens; many variables have a very limited interval of changes and are negligibly useful to explain the crash. The positive sign of a coefficient related to the unfastening seatbelt variable shows that drivers who do not fasten the seatbelts have been more probable to experience an angular crash. These drivers are negligent about the laws and pay less attention to signs and traffic lights. Therefore, they are more probable to have an angular crash, which seems thoroughly plausible. <b>Adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> also increases the probability of this type of crash, while it shows a decrease on weekends. It is because during weekends, the passages are less crowded.|$|R
40|$|The road icing is an <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> lead to {{dangerous}} driving conditions with consequential effects on road transportation. A numerical road icing predication approach is employed for automatic prediction of road icing conditions in three cities of Hubei Province, viz., Wuhan, Shiyan and Xianning. The approach {{is derived from}} the support vector machine (SVM). To improve the classification accuracy for road icing prediction, a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to simultaneously optimize the SVM kernel function parameter and the penalty parameter. The modified PSO {{is derived from the}} genetic PSO, and employs the crossover operator and the mutation operator derived from the differential evolution to enhance searching performance. With the data from 1980 to 2006, using the proposed approach, the road icing models for the three cities in Hubei province are created, which have been used for the prediction from 2007 to 2008. The results have shown feasibility and effectiveness of the forecast approach...|$|R
