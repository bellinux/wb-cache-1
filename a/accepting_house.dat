5000|$|An <b>accepting</b> <b>house</b> was a {{primarily}} British institution which specialised in {{the acceptance}} and guarantee of {{bills of exchange}} thereby facilitating the lending of money. [...] They took on other functions {{as the use of}} bills declined, returning to their original wider function of merchant banking. The 'Accepting Houses' in the City of London had representation in Westminster by the Accepting Houses Committee which ensured policy coordination between them, the UK Treasury and the Bank of England. Bills endorsed by members of the Committee were originally eligible for rediscount at the Bank of England, although this right was eventually extended to other banks in the UK and abroad. The term <b>accepting</b> <b>house</b> was more of an indication of status rather than function.|$|E

5000|$|Brandt's {{was smaller}} than many leading {{merchant}} banks operating in London in these years. It had capital of 0.35 million pounds in 1880 rising to 0.75 million pounds by 1904 and one million by 1914. Brandt's belonged to the <b>Accepting</b> <b>House</b> Committee that was set up {{at the beginning of}} the First World War and acceptances accounted for a substantial part of its business. By 1914, acceptance liabilities in Russia accounted for less than 10 percent of Brandt's business and the largest portion of acceptance business was with the United States (almost 35 percent).|$|E
50|$|Ruffer {{started as}} a stockbroker, before {{becoming}} a barrister. He is now a Bencher of the Middle Temple. He worked in corporate finance for Schroders, an <b>accepting</b> <b>house</b> bank. He worked for Dunbar, a private bank, from 1980 to 1985. He also served on the Board of Directors {{of one of its}} subsidiaries, Dunbar Fund Management, from 1981 to 1985. He then served on the Board of Directors of CFS from 1985 to 1994 (renamed Rathbone Plc). He served on the Board of Directors of Odey Asset Management, founded by Crispin Odey, from 1992 to 2005; Fuel Tech from 1994 to 1998; and Electric & General Investment Trust from 2001 to 2011.|$|E
50|$|The second {{consisted}} in guaranteeing {{payment on}} {{bills of exchange}} from third parties. If the third party issuing the bill would default, the <b>accepting</b> <b>house</b> would pay the bill itself. This guarantee of course was provided for a fee. This service need not have any connection with Dutch traders, or even with the Dutch entrepôt. It served international trade in general. Though this divorce between credit provision and trade has been interpreted as undermining Dutch trade itself {{in the age of}} relative decline of Dutch commerce, it probably was just a defensive move in a time of increasing foreign competition, protecting a share for Dutch commerce, and providing another outlet for commercial capital that would otherwise have been idle. The size of this business was estimated to be about 200 million guilders around 1773.|$|E

50|$|Louis Huth {{was born}} at Finsbury in London, the son of Frederick Huth (1774-1864), a {{merchant}} and merchant banker born in Germany, who 'came of very humble origins, {{the son of a}} soldier rank, with only his intelligence and appetite for hard work to single him out from other poor boys {{at the bottom of the}} social heap in the small village of Harsefeld in the Electorate of Hanover.' After an apprenticeship to a Spanish merchant in Hamburg, Huth eventually established a business in Corunna, Spain, where he met his wife, an orphan believed to be the daughter of a prominent member of the Spanish Royal court. In 1809, following the invasion of Spain by France, Frederick and his wife and children emigrated to England from Spain and established the family merchant house in London, Frederick Huth & Co. By 1829 Huth had become the banker and financial adviser to the Spanish Queen, Maria Christiana, later Queen Regent, and in due course became financial agent for the Spanish government, for which Huth was rewarded with a knighthood by the Spanish crown. Gradually Huth and Co expanded its business in Europe, particularly Germany, and extended its operations to the Americas, becoming a major <b>accepting</b> <b>house</b> concerned with financing international trade and marketing securities; and by the end of the 1840s the Huths ranked 'immediately below such companies as Barings and Rothschilds.' It has been stated that Frederick 'Huth's reputation was second to none. Notwithstanding his small, slight stature, he had great presence and had been known as 'Napoleon of the City'’. The firm, which operated from various premises, latterly 12 Tokenhouse Yard in the City of London (which in due course became the office of the famous stockbroking firm Cazenove & Co), was eventually wound up in 1936, with the partnership of Frederick Huth and Co being dissolved and the business absorbed into the British Overseas Bank Limited (which in turn was itself merged into the Royal Bank of Scotland).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{collapse}} of Overend Gurney {{and the ensuing}} crisis of 1866 {{was a turning point}} in British financial history: this was the last time a serious disruption took place in the London money market until 2007 - 8. The achievement of relative stability was due to the Bank’s willingness to offer generous assistance to the market in a crisis, combined with an elaborate system for discouraging moral hazard. The Bank’s assistance was not anonymous because it monitored the names on its discounted bills. When Overend Gurney sought extraordinary assistance from the Bank, their request was refused {{on the grounds that the}} bills offered did not comply with standard eligibility rules. The Bank’s refusal forced Overend to suspend payments and there was a general panic in the market. The Bank responded by lending freely and raising Bank rate to very high levels. The new policy was crucial in allowing for the establishment of sterling as an international currency. When in 1890 Baring Bros got into trouble, however, the Bank reacted differently and set up a bailout of the failing institution. Such such a contrasting attitude was dictated by the dissimilar position occupied by Overends (a bill broker) and Barings (an <b>accepting</b> <b>house)</b> within the London money market...|$|E

50|$|Though this {{commercial}} credit was originally {{tied to the}} trading operation of merchant firms, the sheer scope of the entrepôt created the opportunity for the trading in bills apart from this direct business, thereby serving third parties, even those not doing direct business with the Netherlands. Two kinds of financial trading, divorced from commercial trading, began to emerge {{by the beginning of}} the 18th century: trading on commission, and <b>accepting</b> <b>houses.</b> The first consisted of trading of agents (called commissionairs) on behalf of other merchants for a commission. Their role was therefore intermediation between buyers and sellers, leaving the conclusion of the business to those parties themselves.|$|R
