5|$|In {{setting up}} {{protected}} reserves, efforts generally <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{focused on the}} surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.|$|E
5|$|While the tricking of a {{tortoise}} was {{the most}} popular method in Bulgarian mythology, in Dalmatia the legend refers to snakes, and among Serbs another version involves the locking of young hedgehogs in a box for their mother to unlock. In Serbia, one would <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quick to take the raskovnik, as the hedgehog would swallow it after use. In any case, turtles, snakes and hedgehogs are all animals with chthonic characteristics which were often variously associated with the underworld in South Slavic tradition.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers {{began to}} find {{objects in the}} same region of space as Pluto (now known as the Kuiper belt), and some even farther away. Many of these shared several of Pluto's key orbital characteristics, and Pluto started being seen as the largest member of {{a new class of}} objects, plutinos. This led some astronomers to stop {{referring}} to Pluto as a planet. Several terms, including subplanet and planetoid, started to be used for the bodies now known as dwarf planets. By 2005, three trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) had been reported. It became clear that either they would <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> classified as planets, or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers were also confident that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly if Pluto were to remain a planet.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of honeydew honey has some complications and dangers. This honey {{has a much}} larger proportion of indigestibles than light floral honeys, thus causing dysentery to the bees, resulting {{in the death of}} colonies in areas with cold winters. Good beekeeping management requires the removal of honeydew prior to winter in colder areas. Bees collecting this resource <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fed protein supplements, as honeydew lacks the protein-rich pollen accompaniment gathered from flowers.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis of the {{syndrome}} is clinical {{since there are}} no laboratory tests to confirm it.

A questionnaire on the typical symptoms of DDS has also been developed and can help in the diagnosis process.|$|E
