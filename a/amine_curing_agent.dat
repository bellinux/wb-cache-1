OSHA has regulated MDA because it is a suspect carcinogen. Typically the elimination of OSHA-regulated materials provides a rare opportunity to qualify new formulations in a range of demanding applications. It was important {{to take full advantage of}} that opportunity, although the associated materials qualification effort was costly. Small high voltage transformers are one of those demanding applications. The successful implementation of the new formulation for high reliability transformers will be described.

Nevertheless, new adhesion promoters have to be developed to face the miniaturization and sophistication of the electronic device. Self-assembled monolayers have met increasing interest in this field by using them as coupling agent between copper and the epoxy resin. This paper presents the deposition of an epoxy resin on copper modified by amine alkylthiol and dithiol monolayers and highlights the benefit brought by the monolayer in terms of adhesion.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of infrastructure}} imposes a significant monetary cost, {{and at times}} human cost, upon society. Methods to improve corrosion resistance of materials are described herein which utilize the reversibility of the Diels-Alder reaction to impart thermal responsiveness upon materials. Such stimuli responsiveness can potentially {{play a role in}} self healing properties which lead to reduced cracking and thus increased corrosion protection. Reversible Diels-Alder chemistry was utilized to manipulate the surface energy of glass substrates. Hydrophobic dieneophiles were prepared and attached to glass slides and capillaries to yield a nonwetting surface. Thermal treatment of the surfaces cleaved the Diels-Alder linkage, and resulted in the fabrication of a hydrophilic surface. Preliminary analysis utilized contact angle (CA) measurements to monitor the change in surface energy, and observed a hydrophilic state (CA - 70 ± 3 °) before attachment of the dieneophile to a hydrophobic state (CA - 101 ± 9 °) followed by regeneration of the hydrophilic state (CA - 70 ± 6 °) upon cleavage of the Diels-Alder linkage. The treatments were then applied to glass capillaries, with effective treatment confirmed by fluid column measurements. Patterned treatments were also demonstrated to provide effective fluid flow gating. Reversible Diels-Alder linkages were incorporated into polymer thermoset binding resins in order to provide a means by which a crosslinked thermoset could undergo stimuli responsive reversible crosslinking.

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} characterization techniques are developed to illuminate relationships between molecular architecture, processing strategies, and physical properties of several model epoxy-amine systems. Just beyond the gel point partially cured networks are internally antiplasticized by unreacted epoxy and amine {{which leads to}} enhanced local chain packing and strain localization during deformation processes. Additional curing causes the antiplasticization to be removed, resulting in lower modulus, density, yield stress, and less strain localization. Physical and mechanical probes of network formation are discussed with respect to several different partially cured model epoxy-amine chemistries. ^ The non-linear fracture energy release rate and the molecular architecture of virgin and healed epoxy networks are related through an effective crack length model. The inelastic component of the fracture energy release rate is attributed {{to the failure of}} network strands in a cohesive zone at the crack tip. Data from fracture and healing experiments are in good agreement with the model over more than three orders of magnitude. Changes {{in the shape of the}} process zone and deviation from planar crack growth cause deviations from the model for the toughest networks tested. ^ Double network epoxies are created from stoichiometric blends of an epoxy resin cured sequentially with aliphatic and aromatic <b>amine</b> <b>curing</b> <b>agents.</b> Unreacted epoxide and aromatic amine functionality antiplasticize the partially cured materials. The thermal and mechanical properties of the fully cured networks vary according to composition. No evidence of phase separation is observed across the entire composition and conversion range. However, the breadth of the glass transition in the double networks increases due to the difference in the molecular stiffness of the two <b>curing</b> <b>agents.</b> ^ Techniques are developed to monitor the evolution of residual stresses and strength in complex multicomponent epoxy-amine based coatings. The evolution of properties is attributed to loss of volatile small molecules from the coatings. The stresses that develop in biaxially constrained membranes are monitored through mechanical excitation. The strength of the membranes is determined by monitoring the size and shape of center cracks. This fracture analysis technique allows the evolution of stresses and toughness of the materials to be monitored simultaneously. ...|$|R

Method 2 {{was carried out by}} mixing the DGEBA with OMMT first, followed by addition of curing agent. In method 3, the DGEBA and curing agent were mixed first, followed by the addition of OMMT. The objective of the research is to study the effects of mixing sequences on the flexural properties and morphology of epoxy/OMMT nanocomposites. The flexural and morphological properties of epoxy/ OMMT nanocomposites were studied by flexural tests, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The flexural modulus of epoxy was improved significantly by the incorporation of OMMT. This is attributed to the reinforcement and exfoliation/intercalation of the OMMT. The flexural modulus and strength of epoxy/OMMT nanocomposites prepared by method 3 was relatively higher than that of the composites prepared by method 1 and 2. The XRD results showed the formation of exfoliated structure in the epoxy/OMMT nanocomposites. Sequence of mixing influenced the dispersion and intercalation/exfoliation of the OMMT in the epoxy matrix.

Intumescent coating is an insulating system designed to decrease heat transfer from a fire to substrate structure to maintain its integrity. The coating was based on Expandable Graphite (EG), Ammonium Poly Phosphate (APP), melamine, boric acid, kaolin clay (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4), bisphenol. A epoxy resin BE- 188 (BPA) and ACR hardener H- 2310 polyamide <b>amine</b> as <b>curing</b> <b>agent.</b> Different formulations were developed to study the heat shielding effect. The C 4 formulation showed better result on the heat shielding effect; it is further modified by adding kaolin clay 3 - 5 wt% {{in the next three}} formulations. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was done to study thermal analysis and char morphology of the formulations. The result showed that by adding the filler kaolin clay, the fire retardant time of coating was extended. The result showed that thermal behaviour of intumescent coating formulation was improved with 5 wt% of kaolin clay...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of epoxy prepolymers containing phosphorus {{was carried out}} in such a manner as to provide adhesives containing at least 5 percent of this element. The purpose of this was to impart fire retardant properties to the adhesive. The two epoxy derivatives, bis(4 -glycidyl-oxyphenyl) phenylphosphine oxide and bis(4 -glycidyl- 2 -methoxyphenyl) phenylphosphonate, and a curing agent, bis(3 -aminophenyl) methylphosphine oxide, were used in conjunction with one another and along with conventional epoxy resins and curing agents to bond Tedlar and Polyphenylethersulfone films to Kerimid-glass syntactic foam-filled honeycomb structures. Elevated temperatures are required to cure the epoxy resins with the phosphorus-contaning diamine; however, when Tedlar is being bonded, lower curing temperatures must be used to avoid shrinkage and the concomitant formation of surface defects. Thus, the phosphorus-containing aromatic <b>amine</b> <b>curing</b> <b>agent</b> cannot be used alone, although it is possible to use it in conjunction with an aliphatic amine which would allow lower cure temperatures to be used. The experimental epoxy resins have not provided adhesive bonds quite as strong as those provided by Epon 828 when compared in peel tests, but the differences are not very significant. It should be noted, if optimum properties are to be realized. In any case the fire retardant characteristics of the neat resin systems obtained are quite pronounced, since in most cases the self-extinguishing properties are evident almost instantly when specimens are removed from a flame...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Chemistry. The cure {{kinetics}} of an {{epoxy resin}} with surface modified silica filler (Nanopox F 400 resin) and without silica filler (DGEBA resin), cured with an <b>amine</b> <b>curing</b> <b>agent,</b> DDS at an N-H/epoxy molar ratio of 1. 1 : 1 was studied by Dynamic Scanning Calorimetry in two basic modes; Dynamic temperature scanning and Isothermal temperature scanning. Dynamic temperature scanning analysis {{suggests that the}} addition of surface modified silica nanoparticles in the epoxy resin increases the rate of reaction by acting as a catalyst. The hydroxyl groups in silica nanoparticles catalyze the cure reaction by shifting the exothermic peak towards the lower temperature. Under dynamic temperature scanning, the glass transition temperature (Tg) was lower for the Nanopox F 400 system than the unfilled control system. The glass transition temperature {{and changes in the}} Tg found in DSC analysis were in line with TMA analysis and DMA analysis. Isothermal scanning analysis shows that the control system follows the Kamal autocatalytic model whereas Nanopox F 400 system follows the modified Kamal autocatalytic model. The model parameters were determined by a nonlinear multiple regression method. The mechanical properties of Nanopox F 400 resin and control resin both cured with DDS at an N-H/epoxy molar ratio of 1. 1 : 1 were examined by tensile testing. The tensile results showed increase in modulus and decrease in tensile strength for 40 wt. % surface modified Nanopox F 400 system compared to the control system. The effect of processing technique and silica content on the tensile properties of silica reinforced epoxy resin was further analyzed. The structure of Nanopox F 400 resin was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and 1 H NMR spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|Acidic {{functionality}} on the oxidized carbon surface modifies {{the course}} {{process of the}} tetrafunctional epoxy resin MY 720 (largely tetra-gly-cidyldiaminodiphenylmethane, TGDDM) crosslinked with diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS). In {{the early stages of}} the cure, the rate of consumption of TGDDM and DDS and the rate of the 1 : 1 adduct are increased, together with an increase in the production of ether functionality. These chemical changes are associated with an increase in exotherm, and increase in gel fraction, and preferential adsorption of the <b>amine</b> <b>curing</b> <b>agent</b> on the carbon surface. During the middle stages of the cure, the acidic carbon surface has a slight retarding effect on the cure; but, on the completion of the later stages of the cure, the effect of the carbon surface functionality, such as the total cure exotherm and the final glass transition temperature, diminishes. The acidic carbon surface effect on the uncatalyzed cure is attributed to the acceleration of the primary amine-epoxide reaction, which, in turn, facilitates the etherification reaction of TGDDM. Basic functionality on the carbon surface has much less effect on the initial cure. ^ In the catalyzed MY 720 /DDS system by boron trifluride-ethylamine (BF 3 EA), the cure reactions is affected in a complex fashion by the presence of the oxidized carbon surface. The acidic nature of the carbon surface activates the latent catalyst, leading to an increase in the rate of epoxy consumption, and an acceleration of epoxide-epoxide reaction. However, at high humidities, or very low resin contents, the increased affinity of the oxidized carbon surface for water can lead to destruction of the catalyst and retardation of the cure. The changes in cure kinetics necessitate an increase in the conversion of low temperature cure. The main chemical effect during the cure is an increase in the number of the epoxy-epoxy sequences in the crosslinked network leading to a longer vitrification time. The chemical effects of the carbon surface are greatest in {{the early stages of the}} cure, and are most noticeable at relatively low loading of polymer. ...|$|E
40|$|Modified fumed silica-epoxy nanocomposites were {{obtained}} by refluxing epoxy molecule with fumed silica using imidazole as catalyst. The modified fumed silica was then used as filler in epoxy resin with <b>amine</b> as <b>curing</b> <b>agent.</b> The properties of the surface modified silica and their effect as fillers in bulk epoxy composite were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1 H-NMR), Thermogravimetri Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE), Tensile testing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). From FTIR, 1 H-NMR and TGA analysis, {{it was found that}} the epoxy resin was chemically bonded onto silica surface. From the DSC and CTE analysis, the addition of modified silica filler in the composite matrix highly influences thermal properties. This new synthesis filler shows higher glass transition temperature and more stable CTE data compared to unmodified filler when introduce into composite matrix. The tensile properties of composite matrix with and without the addition of filler show no significant difference in their tensile properties.
