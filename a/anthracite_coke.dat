5000|$|Anthracite, {{also known}} as stone coal or rock coal, is very {{difficult}} to ignite, mine, clean, and break into smaller chunks and requires correct conditions to build heat or hold temperature and sustain burning - which oft depend upon the size and uniformity of the coal particles. Yet American cities were cramped for fuels, woodlands were exhausted near bigger towns and Philadelphia, largest city in America needed fuels for mills and foundries as well to sustain manufacturing. Inventor and industrialist Josiah White (owner of a wire mill, foundry and nail factory), had determined how to burn anthracite in iron working processing furnaces during the War of 1812, but its use in smelting operations was hit or miss, dependent upon the material packing geometries of any particular charging load in a cold blast furnace. [...] The earlier development of coking of bituminous coal, as well <b>anthracite</b> <b>coke</b> enabled the smelting of iron using local coal sources with cold blast air in blast furnaces after the latter 1830s allowed the production of the vast quantities of iron that built the fundamental infrastructure of the early North American Industrial Revolution [...] - [...] which was built on iron products and only some steel. At the time, iron was used minimally with respect to wood. Even most railroad tracks were laid with wooden rails, sometimes covered by iron strapping. As more iron became available, more uses were found for iron, creating a cycle of increasing demand, experimentation and improvements - [...] part of the revolution in industrial revolution.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been {{to look at the}} thermal {{behaviour}} of <b>anthracite,</b> <b>coke</b> and charcoal regarding their expansion during heating and their release of off-gases. Furthermore, to look at how the porosity and expansion of the anthracite is affected by the different temperatures during the calcining process. Two anthracites (A 11 and A 19), two cokes (C 3 and C 7) and one charcoal (BIO) were investigated. The porosity and surface area of A 11 calcined at different temperatures were investigated by porosity calculations from envelope and absolute density measurements, and from BET surface area measurements with N 2 gas adsorption. The porosity of A 11 was found to decrease with increasing calcining temperature up to 1800 C and increase between 1800 and 2650 C. A significant difference in the surface area from 27. 4 to 0. 2 m^ 2 /g was found between the materials calcined at 600 and 1100 C, while an incremental increase was observed between 1100 and 2650 C. The high surface area of the non-calcined A 11 and A 11 calcined at 600 C can be explain the high porosity for these temperature samples. Single grains of A 11 calcined at 1100, 1800 and 2650 C were heated to 1550 C in a pushrod dilatometer in order to investigate the thermal expansion. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) was found to decrease with increasing calcining temperature. Both the material calcined at 1800 and 2650 C had a TEC close to the TEC of graphite of about 3 * 10 ^- 6 /C, indicating graphitization. The material calcined at 1100 C showed a higher TEC value of 15 * 10 ^- 6 /C. The thermal expansion was also investigated with an Exstar SS 6300 TMA, using pelletized material. Two heating cycles to 1400 C were carried out. A shrinkage was found during the first heating above 600 C due to volatiles leaving the carbon matrix. A linear relationship between the TEC from the first heating and the volatile content of the samples were found. The non-calcined A 11 and A 11 calcined at 600, 800 and 1000 C revealed a trend where the shrinkage decrease with increasing calcining temperature. A linear relationship between the shrinkage and the volatile content was found in the temperature range where volatiles are driven off. Similar shrinkage was observed for the non-calcined A 19, A 19 calcined at 600 C, C 7 and BIO. For the second heating all materials were found to contract the same amount during cooling as they expand during heating. The expansion at 1400 C was found to be between 0. 6 and 0. 9 % for all samples. For C 3 and the anthracites calcined at 1200 C or higher, no shrinkage occurred. The expansion was found to be similar for both temperature cycles, with only a small decrease in the average TEC values between the first and the second heating. The TEC values during the second heating were found to be very stable between 400 and 1100 C. For all samples the TEC values were found to lay between 5 and 8 * 10 ^- 6 /C, indicating graphitization. A high reproducibility was found for the thermal behaviour experiments carried out in the Exstar SS 6300 TMA. Mass loss and the derivative of mass during heating to 1500 C was investigated for all samples by using an STA 449 F 3 Jupiter and an Elite tube furnace. The STA was found to be more accurate and the results are reproducible. The mass loss of A 11 and A 19 during heating to 1500 C comply with the mass losses during the calcining process. The derivative of mass curves showed the highest increase around 600 - 700 C for all samples. The increase was found to be higher for A 19 than for A 11 samples due to the higher volatile content. The off-gases during heating of all samples were investigated by connecting a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) detector and a gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to the STA. The FTIR spectra showed CO 2, CO and H 2 O for all samples except C 3, where only CO 2 and CO were detected. From the GC-MS analysis, only CO 2 was detected and these results correlates with the FTIR analysis. The amount of CO 2 was found to increase with increasing temperature for all samples, and the highest amount of CO 2 was found for BIO. CO appears around 700 C and the amount was found to increase with increasing temperature. The FTIR spectra also indicated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons around 600 - 700 C for the non-calcined anthracites, A 19 calcined at 600 C and BIO. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to suggest correlations between different properties, how they affect each other and how they are affected by the thermal treatment. A root mean square error of zero was obtained for the total porosity of A 11 with an optimum equation containing the hydrogen content, the ash content and the BET surface area. Similar results were obtained for the dimensional behaviour of the anthracites during the first heating to 1400 C by including the sulfur, volatile and ash content in the equation...|$|E

The contribution of both energetic (natural gas, coke gas, fuel, <b>cokes,</b> <b>anthracite,</b> coal, powdered coal and electricity) and non-energetic resources (iron ore, iron scrap and lime(stone)) to the total abiotic depletion is calculated by the CML-, CExD-, EPS-, Eco-indicator 99 - and mass and energy-methods. The results obtained by the five methods are compared. In addition the methods are evaluated taking into account three ISO- 14042 -based criteria. Some reflections on the applicability are dealt with for the specific case of steel production. According to the applied assessment method, ArcelorMittal should, in order to reduce abiotic depletion, either mainly focus on further improving energy efficiency (CML), further improve material efficiency (EPS) or focus on both energy and material efficiency improvement (Eco-indicator 99, CExD). For the EPS- and Eco-indicator 99 -method the conclusion is based on events in the (far) future without consideration of technological improvements and therefore does not seem realistic for the actual steel production process.

"Product like" pilot plant with > 100 kg/h through-put capacity has been built and successfully tested in Hungary in 2005. The 3 R anthracite Clean Coal technology opens new technological and economical opportunities for solid fuel power generation with sustainable near zero emission performance and safe CCS operations. The 3 R technology provides revolutionary solution for climate impact prevention, protection and preservation by safety improvement of the optimized GHG storage conditions. Achievable goal: safe CCS with zero emission seepage. The input 3 R CO 2 for CCS geological structure injection is clean, low in volume and high in concentration, all in order to optimize the "once for all" stabilized chemical fixation of the CO 2, to the mineral matrix. ...|$|R
40|$|High-temperature H- 1 NMR and rheometry {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on 4 : 1 wt/wt blends of a medium volatile bituminous coal with two <b>anthracites,</b> two petroleum <b>cokes,</b> charcoal, wood, a low-temperature coke breeze, tyre crumb, and active carbon {{to determine the effects}} on fluidity development to identify the parameters responsible for these effects during pyrolysis and to study possible relationships among the parameters derived from these techniques. Positive, negative, and neutral effects were identified on the concentration of fluid material. Small positive effects (ca. 5 - 6 %) were caused by blending the coal with petroleum cokes. Charcoal, wood, and active carbon all exerted negative effects on concentration (18 - 27 % reduction) and mobility (12 - 25 % reduction in T- 2) of the fluid phase, which have been associated with the inert character and high surface areas of these additives that adsorb the fluid phase of the coal. One of the anthracites and the low-temperature coke breeze caused deleterious effects to a lesser extent on the concentration (7 - 12 %) and mobility (13 - 17 %) of the fluid material, possibly due to the high concentration of metals in these additives (ca. 11 % ash). Despite the high fluid character of tyre crumb at the temperature of maximum fluidity of the coal (73 %), the mobility of the fluid phase of the blend was lower than expected. The comparison of H- 1 NMR and rheometry results indicated that to account for the variations in minimum complex viscosity (eta(*)) for all the blends, both the maximum concentration of fluid phase and the maximum mobility of the fluid material (T- 2 L) had to be considered. For individual blends, two exponential relationships have been found between the complex viscosity and the concentration of solid phase in both the softening and resolidification stages but the parameters are different for each blend...|$|R
