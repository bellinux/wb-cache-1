5|$|In March 2012 a team {{of specialists}} financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that {{launched}} Apollo 11 into space.

In July 2013, a conservator discovered <b>a</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties would issue {{their own}} paper money as well. Even the Southern Song's contemporary of the Jin dynasty {{to the north}} caught on to this trend and issued their own paper money. At the archeological dig at Jehol there was a printing plate found that dated to the year 1214, which produced notes that measured 10cm by 19cm in size and were worth a hundred strings of 80 cash coins. This Jurchen-Jin issued paper money bore <b>a</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> {{the number of the}} series, and a warning label that counterfeiters would be decapitated, and the denouncer rewarded with three hundred strings of cash.|$|E

5|$|The Avro Museum , based out of CYBW west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is {{building}} a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations {{in order to become}} an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has <b>a</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b> Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it is hoped that ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{nomenclature}} of {{the great}} majority of regiments followed a standard configuration: unit type, followed by serial number, followed by name of the peregrini tribe (or nation) from whom the regiment was originally raised, in the genitive plural case e.g. cohors III Batavorum ("3rd Cohort of Batavi"); cohors I Brittonum ("1st Cohort of Britons"). Some regiments combine the names of two peregrini tribes, most likely after the merger of two previously separate regiments e.g. ala I Pannoniorum et Gallorum ("1st Wing of Pannonii and Gauls"). A minority of regiments are named after an individual, mostly after the first prefect of the regiment e.g. ala Sulpicia (presumably named after a prefect whose middle (gens) name was Sulpicius). The latter is also an example of regiments that did not have <b>a</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{creating}} an improvised firearm {{for personal use}} does not require licensure, registration, a background check, or the stamping of <b>a</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> but must be detectable by a metal detector per federal law.

However, such firearms are often illegal in other jurisdictions and are commonly associated with gangs, where they {{may be used to}} facilitate violent crime, such as homicide.
