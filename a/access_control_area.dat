40|$|In recent years, grid {{computing}} {{has become}} {{the focal point of}} science and enterprise computer environments. Access control in grid computing systems is an active research area given the challenges and complex applications. First, a number of concepts and terminology related to the area of grid access control are provided. Next, an analysis of the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Usage Control ABC (UCONABC) models is given, due to their adaption from the grid computing systems. Additionally, a presentation of well known grid access control architectures illustrates how the theoretical access control models are implemented into mechanisms. In a comparative review of the examined access control models and mechanisms, their pros and cons are exposed. Apart from the mapping of the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>area</b> in grid computer systems, the given comparison renders valuable information for further advancement of current approaches. © 2012, IGI Global...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRINA (Recursive InterNetwork Architecture) is a {{promising}} network architecture {{based on the}} concept of distributed Inter Process Communications (IPC). In RINA there is a single type of programmable layer (the DIF "Distributed IPC Facility"), that repeats as many times as needed by the network designer. Each layer is composed of only two programmable protocols: one performs data transfer and data transfer control functions, while the other carries out layer management functions. Multiple policies can be plugged to both protocols at each layer to adapt them to operational requirements. In this paper we explore the advantages of the RINA architecture on the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>area</b> with respect to the IP protocol suite, specially regarding layer management functions. By designing and implementing a capability-based access control policy we show that RINA allows finer granularity in access control decisions than current approaches. Moreover, the policy can be applied to any layer in the network, maximizing the re-use of specifications and implementation...|$|E
40|$|The Semantic Web, {{also known}} as the Web of meaning, is {{considered}} the new generation of the Web. Its objective is to enable computers and people to work in cooperation. A requisite for this is encoding data in forms that make web contents (meaning, semantics) more understandable by al-gorithmic means. In this paper, we present the application of Semantic Web concepts and technologies to the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>area.</b> The Semantic Access Control Model (SAC) uses different layers of metadata {{to take advantage of the}} semantics of the different components relevant for the ac-cess decision. We have developed a practical application of this access control model based on a specific language, denominated Semantic Policy Language (SPL), for the de-scription of access criteria. This work demonstrates how the semantic web concepts and its layers infrastructure may play an important role in many relevant fields, such as the case of access control and authorization fields. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Outsourced data {{publishing}} is {{a promising}} approach to achieve higher distribution efficiency, greater data survivability, and lower management cost. In outsourced data publishing (sometimes {{referred to as}} third-party publishing), a data owner gives the content of databases to multiple publishers which answer queries sent by clients. In many cases, the trustworthiness of the publishers cannot be guaranteed; therefore, {{it is important for}} a client to be able to verify the correctness of the query results. Meanwhile, due to privacy concerns, it is also required that such verification does not expose information that is outside a client’s <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>area.</b> Current approaches for verifying the correctness of query results in third-party publishing either do not consider the privacy preserving requirement, or are limited to one dimensional queries. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for verifying the correctness of query results while preserving data privacy. Our approach handles multi-dimensional range queries. We present both theoretical analysis and experimental results to demonstrate that our approach is time and space efficient. ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{of current}} Port Security {{analyses}} provide {{a clear view}} of the land-side security measures (fencing, <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> <b>area</b> monitoring¿) but the seaside security issues are not always that clearly defined (exact extent, Authority in charge, assessment of realistic threats etc.). In one hand, there is no doubt that proper seaside security measures are even more site-specific than terrestrial ones. In the other hand, providing some sort of systemic analysis can help for ¿setting the scene¿ and easing the alignment of all stakeholders for specifying the strictly compliant but most cost-effective solution lay-out. Water-side port security includes a range of activities, of preventive character, ultimately aiming at controlling who and what enters the port area from the water side. It includes crews, passengers and cargo entering on-board of large announced vessels, on-board of small un-announced surface crafts, swimmers, divers or even small submersibles. It also includes vessel under-keel appendices commonly used for smuggling and, potentially, for terrorism [...] . Response measures are very diverse. They can range from intelligence and information management, satellite imagery, radar and VTS down to sophisticated underwater and/or above-water sensors, manned or unmanned patrolling and inspection assets etc. A number of these measures are local, but others require wide area surveillance activities and some might require controls as far as the port of departure or the last ports of call.

40|$|The KEKB {{accelerator}} control system including a control computer system, a timing distribution system, and a safety control system are described. KEKB accelerators were {{installed in the}} same tunnel where the TRISTAN accelerator was. There were some constraints due to the reused equipment. The control system is based on Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS). In {{order to reduce the}} cost and labor for constructing the KEKB control system, as many CAMAC modules as possible are used again. The guiding principles of the KEKB control computer system are as follows: use EPICS as the controls environment, provide a two-language system for developing application programs, use VMEbus as frontend computers as a consequence of EPICS, use standard buses, such as CAMAC, GPIB, VXIbus, ARCNET, RS- 232 as field buses and use ergonomic equipment for operators and scientists. On the software side, interpretive Python and SAD languages are used for coding application programs. The purpose of the radiation safety system is to protect personnel from radiation hazards. It consists of an <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system and a beam interlock system. The <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system protects people from strong radiation inside the accelerator tunnel due to an intense beam, by <b>controlling</b> <b>access</b> to the beamline area. On the other hand, the beam interlock system prevents people from radiation exposure by interlocking the beam operation.

40|$|Abstract. The {{situation}} in engineering security for Web services that access databases is as follows: On the one hand, specifications like WS-Security {{are concerned with}} the security management for Web services, while on the other hand there exist well established mechanisms for <b>access</b> <b>control</b> in the <b>area</b> of commercial database systems. In handling security for services that rely on database systems, two extreme approaches can currently be observed: The more database-centric one, where the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> decisions are left to the DBMS, and the service-centric authorization approach. The service-centric approach requires a Web service to run under control of the database system provider as operations like queries and updates have to be executed with comprehensive privileges. Authorization has to be enforced by the service itself. In case <b>access</b> <b>control</b> policies of a service are defined independently with regard to the database policies, authorization mismatches are likely to be induced. In our new approach we bridge this gap between DBMS authorization and <b>access</b> <b>control</b> of Web services by supporting reliable and adaptable <b>access</b> <b>control</b> engineering. The policies of the DBMS constitute the basis for the authorization of Web services. These are therefore automatically extracted before they are refined by additional conditions. As a final step, it must be verified that service policies do not grant more permissions than database policies do, thus ensuring reliable service execution. ...|$|R
