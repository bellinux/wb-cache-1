40|$|AbstractThe {{museums and}} <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> market is {{heterogeneous}} with many and varied visitors, who are differently motivated and have different expectations. The {{purpose of the}} paper was {{to respond to the}} question “What museums and <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> really are in the opinion of tourists and how they sell art to the tourists”, such and “What museums and <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> should be and how they should sell art to the tourists?”. For {{the purpose of this paper}} we have explored the perception of 300 tourists who have visited Dubrovnik in September, October and November in 2012. According to the results of the research it is visible that museums and <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> often do not fit tourists needs and expectations applying object based approach instead selling art applying customers based approach The challenge for curators is to rewrite the agendas for museums and <b>art</b> <b>galleries,</b> so that collections can begin to serve the needs of tourists and to fulfil their expectations...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to alter public {{perceptions}} of <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> as elitist institutions, <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> are shifting their directions to become more visitor focused. With contemporary policies being adopted to explicitly pursue access that is more equal and participation, new programs and strategies are being developed to make <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> more appealing to people who would not normally visit them. One such visitor-focused strategy increasingly being utilized is the staging of special events. To document the impacts special events are having on <b>art</b> <b>galleries,</b> and to assess whether special events are enabling these institutions to achieve their aims of becoming more visitor focused and less “elitist,” {{it is important that}} these institutions develop an awareness of how their visitors understand and respond to such events. This study explores visitor perceptions of special events in <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> using a qualitative methodology and has developed a set of categories that reflect those visitor perceptions...|$|R
