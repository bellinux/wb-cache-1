40|$|A new {{infrared}} <b>absorption</b> <b>hygrometer</b> for {{the purpose}} of water vapor fluctuation measurement developed by the present authors is described. The 1. 90 u water absorption band and 1. 65 u non-absorption band light signals are used to detect the water vapor contents within the optical sensing path of 0. 8 m. The new instrument can respond to the fluctuations of about 1 cps at most. Field measurement using this new instrument was made at Shionomisaki, and the results are also discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|As {{the basic}} {{research}} in the near-infrared <b>absorption</b> <b>hygrometer,</b> {{the relation between the}} water vapor density and the absorption quantity of near-infrared, and also the relation between the deviated current and several factors that influence it are investigated. Experimentally it becomes evident that the absorption quantity of the near-infrared is approximately in directly proportion to the water vapor density at the lower humidity gas that the dew-point is less than about - 10 ℃. Also it becomes evident that both quantities follow approximately the 1 / 2 rule at the relatively higher humidity gas that the dew-point is more than about - 10 ℃...|$|E
40|$|The Rideal <b>Absorption</b> <b>Hygrometer</b> is {{described}} in detail. The errors involved in its use are discussed under the main groups, IDLE AIR, ADSORPTION, TEMPERATURE. These are developed analytically and their corrections given a theoretical basis. The sensitivity of the gauge used is considered. As a preliminary, measurements were made upon samples of air removed from large vessels containing solutions of sulphuric acid. When {{a long series of}} readings was taken upon one of these, the hygrometer being "rinsed" before each reading, they were found to vary greatly at the start and later settled down about a mean value above the "dry" mean. The difference is ascribed to an adsorption effect and in the region of 60 % relative humility it is of the orler of 1 % based upon the "rinsed" reading. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|A {{recording}} infrared <b>absorption</b> <b>hygrometer</b> {{which measures}} the absolute humidity in a 1 -meter light path is described. Record is obtained {{on a remote}} self-balancing potentiometer. Use is made of the 1. 37 p water vapor absorption band and a 1. 24 reference band. Isolation is by means of transmission type interference band-pass liglit ' filters. Infrared detection is {{by means of a}} lead sulfide photocell and amplifier. Isolation filters are contained on a sector wheel which is rotated to chop an infrared beam. A self-balancing null system is employed whereby the energy in the absorption band is kept equal to thenergy in the reference band at all times. Balance is maintained by automatically varying the temperature of the lamp supplying the infrared energy, and the temperature of the lamp {{is a measure of the}} water vapor in the sensing path. An index of the lamp temperature is obtained by means of a monito...|$|E
40|$|In 2011, the MOZAIC (Measurement of Ozone by AIRBUS In-Service Aircraft) {{successor}} programme IAGOS (In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System) {{started to}} equip their long-haul passenger aircraft with the modified capacitive hygrometer Vaisala HUMICAP® of type H. The assurance {{of the data}} quality and {{the consistency of the}} data set during the transition from MOZAIC Capacitive Hygrometers to IAGOS Capacitive Hygrometers were evaluated within the CIRRUS-III and AIRTOSS-ICE field studies. During these performance tests, the capacitive hygrometers were operated aboard a Learjet 35 A aircraft together with a closed-cell Lyman-α fluorescence hygrometer, an open-path tunable diode laser (TDL) system and a closed-cell, direct TDL <b>absorption</b> <b>hygrometer</b> for water vapour measurement. For MOZAIC-typical operation conditions, the comparison of relative humidity (RH) data from the capacitive hygrometers and reference instruments yielded remarkably good agreement with an uncertainty of 5 % RH. The temperature dependence of the sensor’s response time was derived from the cross-correlation of capacitive hygrometer data and smoothed data from the fast-responding reference instruments. The resulting exponential moving average function could explain the major part of the observed deviations between the capacitive hygrometers and the reference instruments...|$|E
