Second, the roof roadway allowed the construction of cross-measure boreholes to extract stress relief gas from the overlying 13 - 1 coal seam. Third, large-diameter horizontal boreholes could be drilled from the roadway to the gas-enrichment zone above the gob roof to drain gas from the gob area and control gas in the upper corner of the working face. The fourth feature is that, subsequent to panel 1112 (1) completion, the roof roadway {{could be used as}} a high-level drainage roadway for mining the next panel 11 - 2.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{random event}} {{generator}} (REG) experiments yielding anomalous results, any evolution of effect sizes over extended runs {{of data collection}} could, in principle, give {{some insight into the}} fundamental mechanism of the binary probability distortions. Retrospective examination of large individual and collective databases acquired over many years of previous study proves only marginally capable of distinguishing any such functional dependence on run length from a constant effect size model, which does little to narrow the phenomenological possibilities. However, an unanticipated <b>ancillary</b> <b>feature</b> of this data treatment is the emergence of a suggestively small blockwise variance in the anomalous effect sizes, possibly indicative of sequential correlations in the data streams that are not present in the baseline data. If real, such correlations would imply that the mechanism of the anomalous effect is more complicated than a simple change of elementary binary probabilities, although the set of possible models is so large that no specific inference can be drawn at this time...|$|R

50|$|However, {{because the}} {{appendix}} can {{be filled with}} fecal material, causing intraluminal distention, this criterion has shown limited utility in more recent meta analyses. This is as opposed to ultrasound, in which {{the wall of the}} appendix can be more easily distinguished from intraluminal feces. In such scenarios, <b>ancillary</b> <b>features</b> such as increased wall enhancement as compared to adjacent bowel and inflammation of the surrounding fat, or fat stranding, can be supportive of the diagnosis, although their absence does not preclude it. In severe cases with perforation, an adjacent phlegmon or abscess can be seen. Dense fluid layering in the pelvis can also result, related to either pus or enteric spillage. When patients are thin or younger, the relative absence of fat can make the appendix and surrounding fat stranding difficult to see.|$|E

50|$|The {{predominant}} type of BCD {{currently used}} in recreational diving is the jacket style BCD. The backplate and wing {{differs from the}} jacket style primarily {{in the way that}} the functions required of a BCD (attachment to diver, buoyancy control and attachment to cylinder(s)) are performed by distinct components, rather than a single unit. The most significant effects of this division are shifting the buoyancy bladder from the diver’s chest to his back and the modularity of the system, allowing buoyancy cells, harnesses, and plates to be interchanged as needed. The buoyancy of a backplate is often significantly negative, especially when the plate is made from stainless steel, and so can replace some of the weight that would otherwise be worn on a weightbelt. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>features</b> that would often be present in jacket BCDs, such as pockets or weight integration, are not found in the core system of a backplate and wing, but can be added as additional components if desired.|$|E

5000|$|The {{growth of}} the {{hobbyist}} graphing calculator community in the 1990s brought with it sharing and collaboration, including the need to share TI-BASIC code on mailing lists and discussion forums. At first, this was done by typing out the TI-BASIC code from a calculator screen into a computer by hand, or conversely, entering programs manually into calculators. TI-BASIC programs are stored in a tokenized format, they cannot be edited using standard computer text editors, so as the calculator programming community matured, a need for an automated converter arose. The format for computer-stored TI-BASIC programs generated by Texas Instruments' TI-GraphLink application was eventually decoded, and third-party tools were created to manipulate these files. TI created a BASIC editor that they included in certain releases of the TI-GraphLink linking program, {{but it has not}} gained widespread usage. In particular, it used a custom character set that did not display properly when copied and pasted to fora. In 2005, United-TI member Joe [...] "Brazucs" [...] Penna (now known as MysteryGuitarMan) created a translator in PHP that would convert text from the TI-GraphLink editor into standard Unicode, a project that soon expanded to include a regex-based TI-BASIC optimizer. Independently, Christopher [...] "Kerm Martian" [...] Mitchell of Cemetech began creating an online converter to extract plain-text (and later HTML and BBCode-formatted) contents from tokenized TI-BASIC programs, which expanded to include an online program editor, exporter, and TI-83 Plus emulator. The SourceCoder project absorbed OptiBASIC at the end of 2005. The only other major TI-BASIC editor currently in use is TokenIDE (or [...] "Tokens"), created by Shaun [...] "Merthsoft" [...] McFall. An offline editor, Tokens can import, edit, and export TI-BASIC programs, includes tools to track program size and correctness, and offers <b>ancillary</b> <b>features</b> such as a sprite/image editor.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Forests are {{important}} ecosystems {{that provide a}} broad range of goods and services, including social and economic benefits in the long term. To sustainably manage forest resources, remote sensing technologies are being employed as an accurate and cost-effective approach for mapping and monitoring forest conditions. In the Philippines, spaceborne remote sensing technology was similarly used in the past for forest resources assessment and management. The mapping efforts, however, were fraught with limitations in terms of temporal consistency and availability of optical data; inconsistent forest classification systems used; and replicability of approaches. This study evaluated the suitability of ALOS/PALSAR mosaic data for mapping and monitoring of forest cover types in the Philippines by assessing temporal consistency, forest classification hierarchy, and classification accuracy. Digital image processing approaches were used including object-based segmentation, extraction of texture features, hierarchical clustering, and decision tree classification. A combination of feature attributes including polarimetric, topographic, and texture information were assessed. Results showed that the ALOS/PALSAR mosaics were temporally consistent within a single acquisition year and across multiple acquisition years, making it a suitable data product for mapping and monitoring forests. Combining polarimetric, topographic, and texture attributes yielded better classification accuracies compared to using polarimetric SAR data alone, although the addition of <b>ancillary</b> <b>feature</b> attributes marginally decreased temporal consistency of the input data. Employing a decision tree classification approach identified the most relevant image layers and feature attributes for classifying different classes. Hierarchical multi-level classification provided a consistent approach for quantifying the degree of accuracy in discriminating different forest cover types. However, even with the best combination of feature attributes used in study, low classification accuracies were obtained in discriminating forest cover types. Although compared to heuristic methods, using a hierarchical clustering analysis to find natural groupings of forest types in the data yielded better classification accuracies. ALOS/PALSAR was not suitable for discriminating forest types based on the FAO Global Forest Resource Assessment classification scheme, and exploring other classification schemes is recommended...|$|R
