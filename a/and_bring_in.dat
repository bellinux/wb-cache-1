5|$|By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders {{suddenly}} {{were under}} pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army {{under the command of}} count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they had not received their pay. The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to go home <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany conquered Poland in September 1939, it {{was faced}} with the {{disposition}} of the large Jewish population. In view of the German populace's tepid response to the orchestrated violence of Kristallnacht, the Nazis perceived an urgent need for films that would move German popular sentiment {{in favor of the}} Nazi Final Solution to the 'Jewish question'. Frustrated with the delays on the Jud Süß project, Goebbels ordered Fritz Hippler, the head of his film department, to sack Brauer <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> Veit Harlan to take over as director.|$|E

5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> fresh air.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. They jumped from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Nicosia, the {{fortress}} of Kyrenia in the north surrendered without resistance, and on 15 September, the Turkish cavalry appeared before the last Venetian stronghold, Famagusta. At this point already, overall Venetian losses (including the local population) were estimated by contemporaries at 56,000 killed or taken prisoner. The Venetian defenders of Famagusta numbered about 8,500 men with 90 artillery pieces and were commanded by Marco Antonio Bragadin. They would hold out for 11 months against a force that would come to number 200,000 men, with 145 guns, providing the time needed by the Pope to cobble together an anti-Ottoman league from the reluctant Christian European states. The Ottomans set up their guns on 1 September. Over the following months, they proceeded to dig a huge network of criss-crossing trenches for a depth of three miles around the fortress, which provided shelter for the Ottoman troops. As the siege trenches neared the fortress and came within artillery range of the walls, ten forts of timber and packed earth and bales of cotton were erected. The Ottomans however lacked the naval strength to completely blockade the city from sea as well, and the Venetians were able to resupply it <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> reinforcements. After news of such a resupply in January reached the Sultan, he recalled Piyale Pasha and left Lala Mustafa alone {{in charge of the}} siege. At the same time, an initiative by Sokollu Mehmed Pasha to achieve a separate peace with Venice, foundered. The Grand Vizier offered to concede a trading station at Famagusta if the Republic would cede the island, but the Venetians, encouraged by their recent capture of Durazzo in Albania and the ongoing negotiations for the formation of a Christian league (see below), refused. Thus on 12 May 1571, the intensive bombardment of Famagusta's fortifications began, and on 1 August, with ammunition and supplies exhausted, the garrison surrendered the city. The Siege of Famagusta cost the Ottomans some 50,000 casualties. The Ottomans allowed the Christian residents and surviving Venetian soldiers to leave Famagusta peacefully but when Lala Mustafa learned that some Muslim prisoners had been killed during the siege he had Bragadin mutilated and flayed alive, while his companions were executed. Bragadin's skin was then paraded around the island, before being sent to Constantinople.|$|E

Under a Board led by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the Karpin-coached 2014-15 team struggled through to winter, and goalkeeper Dudu Aouate was dismissed. Then, after five consecutive victories, the Bermellone club catapulted up into the middle of the table, when Lorenzo Serra Ferrer sold his shares to German Utz Claassen, who then became the majority shareholder. As that shareholder, Claassen replaced Karpin with Miquel Soler, yet the team still struggled through the season and again had to salvage the season at the very end.|$|E

25|$|Prevention {{and control}} of {{potential}} accidents that may derail the peace process {{can be achieved by}} the peacekeeping force by deterring rogue groups. Belligerent forces are often undisciplined without a strong central source of command and control, therefore while a peace is being negotiated there is potential for a rogue group on one side to renege and spoil the peace process. UN forces can serve to prevent this. Additionally, the UN force can serve as a moderator and make communication easy between both parties <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> political moderates from either side. By providing law and order UN peacekeeping forces can temporarily replace a state’s security forces and prevent a bias overreaction to an alleged violation by one side which could in turn result in escalation and a renewal in the violence.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{this lack}} of large game, the Taíno people became very skilled fishermen. One {{technique}} was to hook a remora, {{also known as a}} suckerfish, to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle. Once this happened, men would jump into the water <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> their assisted catch. Another method used by the Taínos was to take shredded stems and roots of poisonous senna shrubs and throw them into nearby streams or rivers. Upon eating the bait, the fish were stunned just long enough to allow the fishermen to gather them in. This poison did not affect the edibility of the fish. Taíno youth, mostly young boys, also collected mussels and oysters in shallow waters and within the mangroves.|$|E
