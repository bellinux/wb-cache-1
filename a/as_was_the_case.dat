5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with almost}} all German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was {{somewhat}} limited. However, she did participate {{in most of}} the major fleet actions conducted by the High Seas Fleet. At the start of the war, the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with many}} of his contemporaries, Miller's {{sporting}} career was interrupted by World War II.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with most}} of his works, Etty did not give the {{painting}} a title. It was initially exhibited as A Composition, taken from the Eleventh Book of Milton's Paradise Lost, and was referred to by Etty himself as The Bevy of Fair Women and The Origin of Marriage. By 1862, when it was shown at the International Exhibition, it had acquired its present title.|$|E

25|$|Nations {{regulate}} arbitration {{through a}} variety of laws. The main body of law applicable to arbitration is normally contained either in the national Private International Law Act (<b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Switzerland) or in a separate law on arbitration (<b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in England and Jordan). In addition to this, a number of national procedural laws may also contain provisions relating to arbitration.|$|R

5|$|After Pather Panchali, Ray {{went on to}} make 36 more films, {{including}} feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{worked on}} scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for School Days and Summer Days, the {{original}} soundtrack of Cross Days was reproduced for distribution alongside the game, initially scheduled for February 27, 2009. As {{this was the}} first of the later six postponements, however, the album was republished and deferred to June 26. Following the second delay, the soundtrack was held indefinitely until 0verflow announced on April 16, 2010 that it would be released April 21. The album contains all of the game's background music, all of which was composed by HIKO of KIRIKO/HIKO Sound, and theme songs performed by Yozuca*, iyuna, Ceui, Kotaro Odaka and Riryka, totaling 25 tracks.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> under Justinian's predecessors, the Empire's {{economic}} health rested primarily on agriculture. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching {{as far north}} as Cornwall where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat. Within the Empire, convoys sailing from Alexandria provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large granary on the island of Tenedos for storage and further transport to Constantinople. Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with his}} grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset resulted in strained {{relations with the}} Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more so during his days as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, whereby a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with many}} of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections {{to the content of}} the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.|$|E

5|$|Composer Richard Strauss was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933. <b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable {{and for the most}} part disapproved of music that was too modern or atonal. Jazz was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled. Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Fey starred {{alongside}} Paul Rudd in {{the romantic}} comedy-drama film Admission, {{based on the}} Jean Hanff Korelitz novel by the same name. The film was directed by Paul Weitz. Fey later starred in the 2014 comedy-drama This Is Where I Leave You, helmed by Date Night director Shawn Levy. <b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Baby Mama, although both of these films received generally mixed reviews, Fey's performances were well received by film critics.|$|E
25|$|Fish do not {{actually}} produce {{omega-3 fatty acids}}, but instead accumulate them from either consuming microalgae that produce these fatty acids, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with forage fish like herring and sardines, or, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with fatty predatory fish, like salmon, by eating prey fish that have accumulated omega-3 fatty acids from microalgae.

5|$|In some {{countries}} the monarch had {{little control over}} lords, or required {{the construction of new}} castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission– <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in England {{in the aftermath of the}} Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when the buildings were connected by a courtyard and protected by a common fence.|$|E
5|$|Like Williams, Smith {{knew the}} Mad Dogs would face {{an uphill battle}} {{attracting}} fans once the traditional American football season started. <b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Birmingham, Smith persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sundays to avoid competing against high school and Tennessee/Ole Miss football. It was to no avail; {{late in the season}} the Mad Dogs struggled to attract more than 10,000 people. Like Williams, Smith publicly blamed community apathy and media hostility for the lackluster attendance. The team went 9–9 in their only year.|$|E
