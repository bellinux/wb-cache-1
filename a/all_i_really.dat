500|$|According to Moody, he {{was very}} {{impressed}} with Clarkson and the song itself, saying [...] "She had these ideas already in place for songs; <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> {{had to do was}} build music around them and develop them. It was quite easy." [...] Clarkson also admitted that [...] "Because of You" [...] is the most depressing song she has ever written. Despite the revelation, she told Entertainment Weekly in August 2011 that she wanted to be remembered for the song because she had to work hard to get it on Breakaway (2004) when everyone was against it. She added, [...] "I think I’m most proud of that song – just getting it on an album because no one liked it until it hit no. 1 worldwide and everybody was on board." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2010, Owumi's agent Goran Gramatikov was {{approached}} by another agent looking for players of African descent to play professional basketball in Libya. By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> cared about. I didn't really care about the team, I cared about the money and that it was going to be on time and that I was going to be able to further my career and get to feed my family." ...|$|E
500|$|Cher {{signed with}} Liberty Records' Imperial imprint {{in the end}} of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single [...] "Dream Baby", {{released}} under the name [...] "Cherilyn", received airplay in Los Angeles. Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of Bob Dylan's [...] "All I Really Want to Do", which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. Meanwhile, the Byrds had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the B-side of the Byrds' single. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds commented, [...] "We loved the Cher version... We didn't want the hassle. So we just turned our record over." [...] Cher's debut album, <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> Want to Do (1965), reached number 16 on the Billboard 200; it was later described by AllMusic's Tim Sendra as [...] "one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era".|$|E

500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now.

I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{praise from}} video game journalists {{at the time}} of its release and in retrospect. Andy Greenwald of Spin magazine praised it as a frightening but [...] "restrained" [...] game. Jon Thompson of AllGame stated: [...] "Silent Hill 2 feels a bit rushed, and although it might not live up to the dizzying horror of the first game, it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel." [...] IGN's Doug Perry wrote: [...] "It's frightening, deep, clever, and tries to improve the genre, if just a little, and in the end, that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> want in a survival horror game." [...] Joe Fielder of GameSpot concluded, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than the original." [...] In [...] (2010), Tristian Donovan described Silent Hill 2 as the [...] "high point" [...] of the series. In a retrospective article on the survival horror genre, IGN writer Jim Sterling praised the game's plot as [...] "one of the finest examples of narrative construction in gaming to this day". In another retrospective article on survival horror, fellow IGN writer Travis Fahs credited the game as a factor in the [...] "short-lived period of renewed interest in horror games". Online game critic for [...] The Escapist Magazine Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw lists this game as among his top five favourite games of all time, praising it for its thick and unsettling atmosphere creating tension and fear for players. In his review of the game he commented, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is the game I replay every now and again to remind myself that for all the shiny brown, quick-time event, RPG element space marines, gaming is still worth defending," [...] and that [...] "It's a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave it}} {{four out of five}} stars, wrote [...] "what gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off" [...] and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: [...] "a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream." [...] Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly gave it a [...] "4" [...] rating, remarking that [...] "Breakaway is not a Thriller to her Off The Wall by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Bad or Thriller, which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. Breakaway may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside Madonna's early material perhaps." [...] Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, noting it's rock direction and describing it as [...] "Avril-meets-Evanescence, with a splash of Pat Benatar." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Breakaway a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that [...] "though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent Thankful, Clarkson had always cited Mariah Carey as a primary influence and that she still owes a lot to that former powerhouse artist." [...] Furthering describing it as [...] "what Mariah might sound like if she ever decided to rock out." [...] Charles Merwin wrote for Stylus Magazine that the album's probable non-singles still maintain a quality [...] "high enough to quell worries about the [...] "I love the singles, but that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> need to hear" [...] arguments." [...] He described Clarkson as ranking some where {{at the top of her}} class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she [...] "has a long way to go before we'll ever feel comfortable calling her anything besides an American Idol, but for now she has a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops." [...] In a quick review, Billboard described Breakaway as a [...] "rare exhibition of substance over style".|$|E

2500|$|In news {{interview}}s, Richter {{talked about}} her love of cooking, sewing and raising children, but she also spoke to her yearning to create art. In an April 1960 interview with Jean Reeves in the Buffalo Evening News titled [...] "Amid Houseful of Distractions, Woman Artist Paints on," [...] Richter said, [...] "All my life I {{wanted to be an}} artist. But I fought against it. I'd stand in front of Dad's paintings and I'd think Why try? But they inspired me, too. But it was a lost cause, and I decided that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted to do was paint, so why fight it? Painting isn't something I took up as a means of escape from dishes and diapers. The urge to paint was there before any frustration with housework. A serious artist paints because he has to; it's an inborn drive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{currently}} teaches and directs. Asked if {{she might}} one day be lured back to mainstream stage, film or television, Harris said in the 2002 interview: Well, if someone handed me something fantastic for 10 million dollars, I'd work again. But I haven't worked {{in a long time}} as an actor. I don't miss it. I think the only thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having {{to go out and do}} a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night.

On 26 November, in an interview with Robin Oakley on Radio 4, he said [...] "To be honest I found it intellectually numbing, and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems and we did deal with them ... but I got no satisfaction from this at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> didn't.

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{opinions}} regarding an afterlife, Schuldiner responded [...] "I don't know", but elaborated that he believed [...] "this is hell", and that demons are in people, as they [...] "create evil". Although his parents are Jewish, Schuldiner did not go through any formal religious training. In the documentary, [...] "666 at Calling Death", he was asked whether Satanism {{was a part of}} his music. [...] He replied, [...] "Not at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't want to involve any type of religious theme in our music. I think that's more of a personal thing. [...] Yeah, I'm not a Satanist and I definitely don't put that into our music on purpose. I was really young when the band first started out. I was never really into writing Satanic lyrics at all, personally. [...] We did write gore lyrics, but it was more like kind of tongue-in-cheek, horror-movie type level. Nothing like encouraging people to go out and hurt themselves or anything stupid like that. It's pure fantasy-movie type, scary stuff. And then, I just really got into writing about reality, which is what we all have to deal with." ...|$|E
