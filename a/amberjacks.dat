25|$|<b>Amberjacks</b> are a {{group of}} nine species {{belonging}} to the genus Seriola within the family Carangidae. Mainly open water fish, they can follow small forage fish into estuaries and enclosed waters, where they will also hunt for crustaceans. <b>Amberjacks</b> are fast swimming and aggressive predators that often hunt in schools around offshore reefs. the yellowtail amberjack can reach 1.8 metres in length and weigh 60 kilograms.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary kayaks can be {{equipped}} with after-market fishing accessories such as anchor trolleys, rod holders, electronic fish-finders and live-bait containers. Kayak anglers target highly prized gamefish like snook, red drum, seatrout, tarpon, halibut and cod and also pelagics like <b>amberjacks,</b> tuna, sailfish, wahoo, king mackerel, and even marlin.|$|E
25|$|Predatory pelagic fishes {{found on}} {{continental}} shelves worldwide in both tropical and temperate waters include porgies, barracuda, <b>amberjacks</b> and cutlassfishes. They {{tend to be}} larger fish, and are carnivorous, feeding on the smaller, silvery forage fish that eat plankton (see section above). Some species also feed on crabs and other invertebrates, foraged from the sea floor.|$|E
50|$|Other species {{exist in}} other parts of the world, such as: {{yellowtail}} <b>amberjack</b> (including the Asian yellowtail, the California yellowtail, and yellowtail kingfish or southern yellowtail), Almaco jack, and Japanese <b>amberjack</b> (five-ray yellowtail).|$|R

25|$|Many of the {{techniques}} used in kayak fishing {{are the same as}} those used on other fishing boats. The difference is in the set-up, how each piece of equipment is fitted to the kayak, and how each activity is carried out on such a small craft. Contemporary kayaks can be equipped with fishing aids such as rod holders, electronic fish-finders and live-bait containers. Kayak anglers target highly prized bottom feeders like halibut and cod and also pelagics like <b>amberjacks,</b> tuna, sailfish, wahoo, and even marlin.|$|E
25|$|Jacks, <b>amberjacks,</b> pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|E
25|$|The {{rainbow runner}} (Elagatis bipinnulata), {{also known as}} the rainbow yellowtail, Spanish jack and Hawaiian salmon, is a common species of pelagic marine fish of the jack family, Carangidae. The species is {{widespread}} throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the world, inhabiting both coastal as well as far offshore areas. The species is {{the only member of the}} genus Elagatis, which was created 15 years after its initial description, and is closely related to the <b>amberjacks.</b> The rainbow runner is easily distinguished by its body shape, and the brilliant colouration which gives the fish its name. It is a fast swimming predator, taking small fish, cephalopods and a wide variety of planktonic crustaceans. The species reaches sexual maturity at around , and spawning takes place at different times, with some populations spawning year round, while others only spawn at certain times of the year. The species is a well known game fish, taken by a variety of fishing methods and is a well rated table fish. Large amounts of the species are taken as bycatch in tuna and shark fishing operations and marketed.|$|E

25|$|The {{rainbow runner}} {{is the only}} species in the {{monotypic}} genus Elagatis, {{which is one of}} thirty genera in the jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are Perciform fishes in the suborder Percoidei. The species was first scientifically described in 1825 by French zoologists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard based on the type specimen collected from the Indian Ocean, somewhere in the Malay Archipelago. They named the species Seriola bipinnulata, believing the species was related to the <b>amberjacks.</b> This was later revised to the genus Seriolichthys by Bleeker before it was concluded the species warranted a new genus. The genus Micropteryx was initially created, but was already in use in the Lepidoptera. In 1840, Frederick Debell Bennett created the genus Elagatis, taken from a name published in a whaling voyage memoir, which he used in combination with the species name of bipinnulatus, which was deemed to be incorrect as the genus name is feminine and the original spelling of bipinnulata was reinstated. Phylogenetically, the species is most closely related to the amberjack genus, Seriola, being the most basal member identified of the carangid subfamily Naucratini. This has been determined by the sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b genome, as well as older morphological studies.|$|E

50|$|Lesser <b>amberjacks,</b> Seriola fasciata, have proportionately larger {{eyes and}} deeper bodies than greater <b>amberjacks.</b> They are olive green or brownish-black with silver sides, and {{usually have a}} dark band {{extending}} upward from their eyes.
