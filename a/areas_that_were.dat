5|$|North Somerset {{constitutes}} part of {{the ceremonial}} county of Somerset. As a unitary authority, North Somerset is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county of Somerset. Its administrative headquarters {{are located in the}} town hall of Weston-super-Mare. North Somerset includes <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> once part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Banjo and Kazooie are {{occasionally}} {{aided by}} their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a walrus, and a crocodile. These transformations {{have their own}} special features and allow the player to access <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> previously inaccessible. For instance, the walrus can resist the effects of icy-cold water. Mumbo Tokens that are scattered throughout the game allow the transformation process. The game also includes cheats that the player can unlock by finding Gruntilda's spellbook, Cheato.|$|E
5|$|COMIGAL {{dispatched}} inspection teams throughout South Vietnam {{to identify}} <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> suitable for accommodating {{the new arrivals}} according to their professional skills. This required a search for arable land for farmers, favourable coastal areas for fishing and areas near large population centres for industrially oriented arrivals. Having identified the relevant areas, COMIGAL would set up plans for settlement subprojects, sending proposals to the USOM or the French Technical and Economic Cooperation Bureau to gain approval and funding. The bureaucracy was relatively low, with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval. Each subproject was given a nine-month deadline for completion.|$|E

5|$|In May 2006, the {{activities}} of the Bellerive Foundation were merged into the Geneva-based Aga Khan Foundation (founded in 1967 by Prince Sadruddin's nephew Karim Aga KhanIV) to form the Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan Fund for the Environment. The US$10 million fund is dedicated to finding practical solutions to environmental problems. The fund concentrates its activities in six <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> important to Prince Sadruddin: environmental education; natural resource management in fragile zones; nature parks and wildlife reserves; environmentally and culturally appropriate tourism infrastructure; environmental health; and research.|$|E
5|$|Large fruitings of {{the fungus}} are often {{associated}} with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies {{were more likely to}} be found in <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.|$|E

5|$|Many wars were fought {{during the}} 17th century between the slave trading {{companies}} for <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> economically dependent on slaves. The West India Company gained many slaves through these wars (specifically with Portugal) by captains who had captured enemy ships; between 1623 and 1637, 2,336 were captured {{and sold in}} the New World by the West India Company. The selling of slaves to the New World opened up trading posts in North America; the Dutch opened their first on Manhattan Island in 1613. The West India Company had also opened a trading post in the Caribbean and the company was also carrying slaves to a colony of New Netherland.|$|E
5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could {{spend most of their}} time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> already available in the previous title.|$|E
5|$|Six {{miles of}} prairie was a buffer zone between Houston and Bellaire. Originally {{the town was}} bounded by Palmetto, First, Jessamine, and Sixth (now Ferris) Streets. In 1910 Edward Teas, a horticulturist, moved his nursery to Bellaire from Missouri so Teas could {{implement}} Sid Hare's landscaping plans. Bellaire was incorporated as {{a city with a}} general charter in 1918, ten years after its founding. Bellaire had a population of 200 at the time. Because of the 1918 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Bellaire's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> unincorporated.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Association {{analysis}} is {{the method of}} choice for studying complex multifactorial diseases. The premise of this method <b>is</b> <b>that</b> affected persons contain some common genomic regions with similar SNP alleles and such areas will be found in this analysis. An important disadvantage of GWA studies <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it does not distinguish between genomic <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> inherited from a common ancestor [identical by descent (IBD) ] and <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> identical merely by state [identical by state (IBS) ]. Clearly, <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> marked with higher probability as IBD and have the same correlation with the disease status of identical <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more probably only IBS, are better candidates to be causative, and yet this distinction is not encoded in standard association analysis...|$|R

5|$|The Grade I listed {{buildings}} in Somerset, England, demonstrate {{the history and}} diversity of its architecture. The ceremonial county of Somerset consists of a non-metropolitan county, administered by Somerset County Council, which is divided into five districts, and two unitary authorities. The districts of Somerset are West Somerset, South Somerset, Taunton Deane, Mendip and Sedgemoor. The two administratively independent unitary authorities, which were established on 1 April 1996 following {{the breakup of the}} county of Avon, are North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset. These unitary authorities include <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> once part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Heterodontosauridae family persisted {{from the}} Late Triassic until the Early Cretaceous period, and existed {{for at least}} a 100 million years. Heterodontosaurids are known from Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas, but the {{majority}} have been found in southern Africa. Heterodontosaurids appear to have split into two main lineages by the Early Jurassic; one with low-crowned teeth, and one with high-crowned teeth (including Heterodontosaurus). The members of these groups are divided biogeographically, with the low-crowned group having been discovered in <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> once part of Laurasia (northern landmass), and the high-crowned group from <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> part of Gondwana (southern landmass). In 2012, Sereno labelled members of the latter grouping a distinct subfamily, Heterodontosaurinae. Heterodontosaurus appears to be the most derived heterodontosaurine, due to details in its teeth, such as very thin enamel, arranged in an asymmetrical pattern. The unique tooth and jaw features of heterodontosaurines appear to be specialisations for effectively processing plant material, and their level of sophistication is comparable to that of later ornithischians.|$|E

5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{county of}} Somerset, England {{is divided into}} 418 areas known as civil parishes, which are lowest unit of local government in England. Parishes arose from Church of England divisions, and were given their current powers and responsibilities by the Local Government Act 1894. The Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural areas. Many former urban districts and municipal boroughs were replaced by new successor parishes; urban <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> considered too large to be single parishes became unparished areas.|$|E

5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> still in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E
5|$|Civil parishes {{in their}} modern sense {{date from the}} Local Government Act 1894, which {{abolished}} vestries; established elected parish councils in all rural parishes with more than 300 electors; grouped rural parishes into Rural Districts; and aligned parish boundaries with county and borough boundaries. Urban civil parishes continued to exist, and were generally coterminous with the Urban District, Municipal Borough or County Borough {{in which they were}} situated; many large towns contained a number of parishes, and these were usually merged into one. Parish councils were not formed in urban areas, and the only function of the parish was to elect guardians to Poor Law Unions; with the abolition of the Poor Law system in 1930 the parishes had only a nominal existence. The Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural areas, and many former Urban Districts and Municipal Boroughs that were being abolished, were replaced by new successor parishes; urban <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> considered too large to be single parishes became unparished areas.|$|E
