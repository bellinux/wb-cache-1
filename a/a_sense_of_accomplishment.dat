Carter from Destructoid {{thought that the}} fortress and the outpost system provided players with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions {{one of the greatest}} parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.|$|E
25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points {{in relation to other}} racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E

Bramwell claimed that these modes felt [...] "like they've been attached {{with an old}} stick of glue that's about as adhesive as baby oil". Knutson agreed, though he praised the novelty of these diversions. He stated that [...] "the Tony Hawk series has always had exceptional controls" [...] and that Underground, overall, was no exception. Perry felt that the feature increased levels' replay value. Similarly, Famitsu reviewers noted that, although the game's fast pace makes it extremely challenging at times, the high difficulty provides <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> when jumps and tricks are performed correctly. Williams found the GameCube version's controls mediocre, albeit manageable. Damon Brown from GameSpot stated that the mobile version's restrictive controls—many tricks require three button inputs—were that version's only caveat.|$|E

500|$|Glass Joe's debut was in {{the first}} Punch-Out!! game for the arcades in 1984. His role was to give young players <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> which {{motivated}} them to spend more money to try and beat the more difficult opponents. Glass Joe later appeared in Punch-Out!! for the NES in 1987. While he did not appear in the SNES game's sequel, he opened a boxing school for potential fighters. Gabby Jay (the game's first opponent) attended this school and got his first and only win against Glass Joe. Glass Joe's most recent appearance was in Punch-Out!! for the Wii in 2009.

500|$|Other {{gameplay}} aspects received mixed reviews. Tyrrel {{praised the}} customization system for Max and the Magnum Opus, since the customization impacts the gameplay {{and makes the}} overall experience more rewarding; Kollar echoed this. Brown criticized the game for failing to offer much challenge or <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> to players. He called the health system a redundant addition in which resources, such as water and food, play an insignificant role and can be neglected by players. Brown also criticized the scrap-collecting system, writing that it frustrated most players and slowed the game's pace. However, Robinson wrote that those elements reflect the barbarian nature of the wasteland. He praised its world design (which he thought echoed the films), describing it as [...] "a world of twisted metal and sudden violence that's there to be survived rather than conquered". Bloodworth criticized the game's stronghold system, which he called repetitive. Brown criticized the game's lack of a climbing system, which hinders movement; this was echoed by Carter.|$|E

The game's levels were divided into several sub-sections due to technical limitations {{at the time and}} Argonaut's desire to not have to deal with creating convincing depth perception. The team designed the game's levels with the mindset of having each individual room feel like its own individual puzzle that would give the player <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> whenever they completed it. Cusworth came up with the names for many of the levels, several of which were references to other pieces of popular culture; the game's first level, named [...] "...And So The Adventure Begins", was a reference to the title card of the music video for the David Lee Roth song Yankee Rose, which Cusworth found in a video collection that he owned at the time. The level [...] "Shouting Lava Lava Lava" [...] was a play-on words with the lyric [...] "Shouting Lager Lager Lager" [...] from the song Born Slippy by Underworld, which appeared in the British comedy film Trainspotting.|$|E

Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. [...] "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [...] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," [...] said Lehto. [...] "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can do there so we can build an immense story with it.'" [...] No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the Halo trilogy, Bungie used Reach to introduce new characters and settings.
