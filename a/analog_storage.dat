40|$|We have {{examined}} the technique of persistent spectral holeburning as a method for <b>analog</b> optical data <b>storage.</b> Two types of materials were examined from a theoretical standpoint, ones which exhibit photochemical holeburning (PHB) and ones which exhibit nonphotochemical holeburning (NPHB). We have presented {{the conditions under which}} a PHB material shows a linear relation between hole depth and exposure intensity or exposure time. Also we show that a NPHB material has no such condition. We conclude that a PHB material may be useful for <b>analog</b> optical data <b>storage,</b> while a NPHB material would not. Experiments were conducted with a NPHB material, R' color centers in LiF, to support the NPHB analysis...|$|R
50|$|Digital video storage retains higher-quality video than <b>analog</b> <b>storage,</b> {{especially}} on the prosumer and strictly consumer levels. MiniDV storage allows full-resolution video (720x576 for PAL, 720x480 for NTSC), unlike analog consumer-video standards. Digital video does not experience colour bleeding, jitter, or fade.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{oscilloscopes}} usually analyze waveforms {{and provide}} numerical values {{as well as}} visual displays. These values typically include averages, maxima and minima, root mean square (RMS) and frequencies.

50|$|Nikon's first {{digital camera}} (still video camera, with <b>analog</b> <b>storage)</b> was the Nikon Still Video Camera (SVC) Model 1, a {{prototype}} which was first presented at photokina 1986. The follower Nikon QV-1000C Still Video Camera was produced since 1988 mainly for professional press use. Both cameras used QV mount lenses, {{a variant of}} Nikon F-mount lenses. Via an adapter (QM-100) other F-mount lenses can be fitted.|$|E
50|$|An {{audio tape}} recorder, tape deck or tape machine is an <b>analog</b> audio <b>storage</b> device that records and plays back sounds, {{including}} articulated voices, usually using magnetic tape, either wound on a reel or in a cassette, for storage. In its present-day form, it records a fluctuating signal {{by moving the}} tape across a tape head that polarizes the magnetic domains in the tape {{in proportion to the}} audio signal. Tape-recording devices include reel-to-reel tape deck and the cassette deck.|$|R
2500|$|A {{gramophone}} record, {{commonly known}} as a record, or a vinyl record, is an <b>analog</b> sound <b>storage</b> medium consisting of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends {{near the center of}} the disc. Ever since Thomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, it produced distorted sound because of gravity's pressure on the playing stylus. In response, Emile Berliner invented a new medium for recording and listening to sound in 1887 in the form of a horizontal disc, originally known as the [...] "platter".|$|R
50|$|A {{portable}} {{media player}} (PMP) or digital audio player (DAP) is a portable consumer electronics device capable of storing and playing digital media such as audio, images, and video files. The data is typically stored on a CD, DVD, flash memory, microdrive, or hard drive. Most portable media players {{are equipped with}} a 3.5 mm headphone jack, which users can plug headphones into, or connect to a boombox or hifi system. In contrast, analog portable audio players play music from non-digital media that use <b>analog</b> signal <b>storage,</b> such as cassette tapes or vinyl records.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} {{knowledge}} arks might include genetic material. With {{the potential for}} widespread personal DNA sequencing becoming a reality, an individual might agree to store their genetic code in a digital or <b>analog</b> <b>storage</b> format which would enable later retrieval of that code. If a species was sequenced before extinction, its genome would remain available for study even {{in the case of}} extinction.|$|E
50|$|Using the FGMOS as a {{programmable}} charge element, it {{is commonly}} used for non-volatile storage such as flash, EPROM and EEPROM memory. In this context, floating-gate MOSFETs are useful because of their ability to store an electrical charge for extended periods of time without a connection to a power supply. Other applications of the FGMOS are neuronal computational element in neural networks, <b>analog</b> <b>storage</b> element and e-pots.|$|E

5000|$|A Video Floppy is an <b>analog</b> {{recording}} <b>storage</b> {{medium in}} the form of a 2-inch magnetic floppy disk used to store still frames of composite analog video. A video floppy, also known as a VF disk, could store up to 25 frames either in the NTSC or PAL video standards, with each frame containing 2 fields of interlaced video. The video floppy also could store 50 frames of video, with each frame of video only containing one field of video information, recorded or played back in a [...] "skip-field" [...] fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The LP (from [...] "long playing" [...] or [...] "long play") is an <b>analog</b> sound <b>storage</b> medium, a vinyl {{record format}} {{characterized}} by a speed of [...] rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, {{and use of the}} [...] "microgroove" [...] groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage over}} <b>analog</b> <b>storage</b> {{is that the}} stored traces are as bright, as sharply defined, and written as quickly as non-stored traces. Traces can be stored indefinitely or written out to some external data storage device and reloaded. This allows, for example, comparison of an acquired trace from a system under test with a standard trace acquired from a known-good system. Many models can display the waveform prior to the trigger signal.|$|E
5000|$|Digital {{content is}} any content {{that exists in}} the form of digital data.

Forms of digital content include information that is digitally broadcast, streamed, or contained in computer files. Viewed narrowly, digital content includes popular media types, while a broader approach considers any type of digital information (e. g. digitally updated weather forecasts, GPS maps, and so on) as digital content.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to {{a popular}} hypothesis, {{short-term}} memories are stored as persistent neural activity maintained by synaptic feedback loops. This hypothesis has been formulated mathematically {{in a number of}} recurrent network models. Here we study an abstraction of these models, a single neuron with a synapse onto itself, or autapse. This abstraction cannot simulate the way in which persistent activity patterns are distributed over neural populations in the brain. However, with proper tuning of parameters, it does reproduce the continuously graded, or analog, nature of many examples of persistent activity. The conditions for tuning are derived for the dynamics of a conductance-based model neuron with a slow excitatory autapse. The derivation uses the method of averaging to approximate the spiking model with a nonspiking, reduced model. Short-term <b>analog</b> memory <b>storage</b> is possible if the reduced model is approximately linear and if its feedforward bias and autapse strength are precisely tuned...|$|R

5000|$|Like the transistor, the memistor is a 3-terminal element. The {{conductance}} {{between two}} of the terminals is controlled by the time integral of the current in the third, rather than its instantaneous value as in the transistor. Reproducible elements have been made which are continuously variable (thousands of possible <b>analog</b> <b>storage</b> levels), and which typically vary in resistance from 100 ohms to 1 ohm, and cover this range in about 10 seconds with several milliamperes of plating current. Adaptation is accomplished by direct current while sensing the neuron logical structure is accomplished nondestructively by passing alternating currents through the arrays of memistor cells.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, Tektronix {{sold its}} first (possibly the world's first practical) {{completely}} portable oscilloscope, the model 321. This oscilloscope could run on AC line (power mains) or on rechargeable batteries. It also brought the oscilloscope into the transistor age (only a Nuvistor ceramic tube {{was used for}} the vertical amp input). A {{year and a half later}} the model 321A came out and that was all transistors. [...] The 560 series introduced the rectangular CRT to oscilloscopes. In 1964 Tektronix made an oscilloscope breakthrough, the world's first mass-produced <b>analog</b> <b>storage</b> oscilloscope the model 564. Hughes Aircraft Company is credited with the first working storage oscilloscope (the model 104D) but it was made in very small numbers and is extremely rare today.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behavior}} of several grades of laboratory N-methylol- 3 -di-methoxyphosphorylpropionamide and samples of commercial durable flame retardants containing this substance: SPOLAPRET OS, PYROVATEX CP and their Russian-made <b>analog</b> in <b>storage</b> during several months was investigated, using HPLC. Due {{to the complexity}} of the composition of laboratory and com-mercial samples, in which along with N-methylol- 3 -dimethoxyphosphoryl-propionamide are N-methoxymethyl- 3 -dimethoxyphosphorylpropionamide, N N’-oxydimethylenebis(3 -dimethoxyphosphorylpropionamide) and 3 -dimeth-oxyphosphorylpropionamide, various chemical reactions proceed in the aging of these samples. The main path of conversion is transformations of the compo-nents to each other. From them, the formation of N,N’-oxydimethylenebis(3 -di-methoxyphosphorylpropionamide) and-methoxymethyl- 3 -dimethoxyphos-phorylpropionamide from-methylol- 3 -dimethoxyphosphorylpropionamide should be noted. However, it was also found that reactions resulting in the degradation of the components can occur, the overall concentration of the com-ponents in a sample being decreased.
