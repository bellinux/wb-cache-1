Although considerable gold was found <b>at</b> <b>Emory's</b> bar, the mother-lode was never found. Emory again came into prominence in the fall of 1879 when it became the Canadian Pacific Railway's western terminus. Emory City soon consisted of 13 streets, 32 blocks, and 400 lots of goodly dimensions. The Inland Sentinel Newspaper, the first on the mainland, erected a two story building on Front street and the Emory City Sawmill was producing [...] of lumber in a 24-hour shift. Two hotels, nine saloons, a brewery, blacksmiths shop, general store, residences and [...] "less reputable businesses" [...] rounded out Emory City's economy. But by late 1881, it became obvious that the CPR would make Yale, their center for railroad activities and Emory City was abandoned. By the late 1890s people traveling through the area said that not a trace of the city could be found as the forest had reclaimed the site.|$|R
