50|$|Nominal incorporation, most {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} instrumental part of an action, but sometimes used to describe patients instead. Instrumental incorporation doesn't affect the transitivity of the verb (though there are examples where this form of incorporation is used to describe <b>agentless</b> changes of state), while patient incorporation can make a transitive verb intransitive. Patient incorporation is usually used for patients that are wholly effected by an action (such as being brought into existence by it); more generally affected patients are typically incorporated only when significantly defocused or backgrounded.|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of these}} are the prefixes di- (patient focus, {{frequently}} but erroneously called [...] "passive voice", for OVA word order), meng- (agent focus, frequently but erroneously called [...] "active voice", for AVO word order), memper- and diper- (causative, agent and patient focus), ber- (stative or habitual; intransitive VS order), and ter- (<b>agentless</b> actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes -kan (causative or benefactive) and -i (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes ber-...-an (plural subject, diffuse action) and ke-...-an (unintentional or potential action or state).|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of these}} are the prefixes di- (patient focus, {{frequently}} but erroneously called [...] "passive voice", for OVA word order in the third person, and OAV in {{the first or second}} persons), meng- (agent focus, frequently but erroneously called [...] "active voice", for AVO word order), memper- and diper- (causative, agent and patient focus), ber- (stative or habitual; intransitive VS order), and ter- (<b>agentless</b> actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, stative or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes -kan (causative or benefactive) and -i (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes ber-...-an (plural subject, diffuse action) and ke-...-an (unintentional or potential action or state).|$|E
50|$|In some {{out-of-band}} systems, {{agents are}} distributed on end-stations and report {{information to a}} central console, which in turn can control switches to enforce policy. In contrast the inline solutions can be single-box solutions which act as internal firewalls for access-layer networks and enforce the policy. Out-of-band solutions {{have the advantage of}} reusing existing infrastructure; inline products can be easier to deploy on new networks, and may provide more advanced network enforcement capabilities, because they are directly in control of individual packets on the wire. However, there are products that are <b>agentless,</b> and have both the inherent advantages of easier, less risky out-of-band deployment, but use techniques to provide inline effectiveness for non-compliant devices, where enforcement is required.|$|E
50|$|Verbs can be finite or non-finite (non-finite endings: -n, -el, -etew, -lu, -am, etc.), are in{{transitive}} or transitive and are conjugated {{according to}} person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural), voice (active, <b>agentless</b> passive and reflexive-reciprocal, plus two applicatives) and mood (indicative, imperative and subjunctive). In the indicative, the present (zero) and future (-(y)a) tenses are distinguished. There {{are a number}} of aspects: the progressive, resultative and habitual are well established; some forms that seem to mark some subtype of perfect are also found. Other verb morphology includes an evidential marker (reportative-mirative), directionals (cislocative, translocative, andative and ambulative, plus an interruptive and continuous action marker) and modal markers (sudden action, faked action, immediate action, etc.). There is productive noun incorporation, and the case can be made for root compounding morphology.|$|E
5000|$|Measuring {{the transit}} of traffic from user request to data {{and back again}} is part of {{capturing}} the end-user-experience (EUE). The outcome of this measuring {{is referred to as}} Real-time Application monitoring (aka Top Down monitoring), which has two components, passive and active. Passive monitoring is usually an <b>agentless</b> appliance implemented using network port mirroring. A key feature to consider in this solution is the ability to support multiple protocol analytics (e.g., XML, SQL, PHP) since most companies have more than just web-based applications to support. Active monitoring, on the other hand, consists of synthetic probes and web robots predefined to report system availability and business transactions. Active monitoring is a good complement to passive monitoring; together, these two components help provide visibility into application health during off peak hours when transaction volume is low.|$|E
5000|$|In Neo-Mandaic, the {{relationship}} of the action or state described by the verb to its arguments can be described by one of three voices: active, middle voice, and passive. When the action described by the verb is initiated by its grammatical subject, the verb is described as being in the active voice, and the grammatical subject is described as its agent. The t-stems introduced above express the middle voice. The agents of verbs in these stems, which are syntactically active and intransitive, experience the results of these actions as if they were also the patient; in many cases, the action of the verb appears to occur on its own. As a result, verbs in these stems are often translated as if they were <b>agentless</b> passives, or reflexive actions that the subject takes on its own behalf, e.g. etwer minni wuṣle ‘a piece broke off / was broken from it.’ In the passive voice, the grammatical subject of the verb is the recipient of the action described by it, namely the patient. There are two ways of forming the passive voice in Neo-Mandaic: the analytic passive, in which the passive participle is combined with the copula, and the much more common impersonal passive, in which an impersonal third plural form is used, e.g. əmaryon ‘it is said,’ literally ‘they said.’ ...|$|E

40|$|The study {{entitled}} “Comprehending Agent and <b>Agentless</b> Types of English Active and Passive Voice by Indonesian Learners of English” aims {{to analyze}} and describe how Indonesians as English learners comprehend agent and <b>agentless</b> types of English active and passive sentences, and to uncover the factors affecting comprehension. The participants {{of the study were}} 26 university students from a grammar class of 2015. The two main instruments used were an individual test and a set of questionnaires for personal information. Participants’ performances in the test regarding the agent and <b>agentless</b> types of English active and passive voices were correlated with their personal data which contain aspects affecting their learning of second language. The mean score and percentage of individual result of the test were used to determine the sentences that received the highest and the lowest performances. Two major ways were discovered that help participants comprehend those types of active and passive voices, namely identifying the items in sentences and selecting explicit choices. L 1 interference is shown to have significant relations to the participants’ comprehension of agent and <b>agentless</b> types of English active and passive sentences, especially the interference in the structure of sentences and grammatical error. In addition to L 1 interference, the factors that were taken into account to contribute to the comprehension, were individual differences. The findings of this study were assessed by using appropriate and relevant linguistic theories.
