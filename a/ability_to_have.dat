The Searchwater 2000 radar was stated to have been capable over land as well as water; with the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> swept {{an area the size}} of the UK every 10 seconds. The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

5|$|Mary's {{animated}} and personable nature {{made her}} {{popular with the}} Dutch people, and her marriage to a Protestant prince was popular in Britain. She was devoted to her husband, but he was often away on campaigns, which led to Mary's family supposing him to be cold and neglectful. Within months of the marriage Mary was pregnant; however, {{on a visit to}} her husband at the fortified city of Breda, she suffered a miscarriage, which may have permanently impaired her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children. She suffered further bouts of illness that may have been miscarriages in mid-1678, early 1679, and early 1680. Her childlessness would be the greatest source of unhappiness in her life.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the nature of self-assessment and blind peer- and teacher-assessment in L 2 writing. The type of feedback students gave to themselves and peers, the type of feedback used in the revision process, {{and the source of}} the feedback used were all analyzed. Additionally, student perceptions of self- and peer-assessment, feedback, and their relationships to perceived writing improvement were also studied. Findings revealed that students in this study did not use teacher feedback significantly more than feedback from themselves or their peers, but they did give different types of feedback than the teacher and favored using feedback related to language use in the revision process. Students perceived their writing <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> increased due <b>to</b> self- and peer-assessment but responded more positively to peer-assessment than self-assessment. Surprisingly, students also perceived their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> increased in rubric areas in which the feedback they received was not used and not regarded as useful, and the highest perceived gains in writing ability were in areas which accounted for the lowest amounts of feedback given...|$|R

25|$|During the Middle Ages in Europe, castles, fortresses, and the basements {{of public}} {{buildings}} were {{often used as}} makeshift prisons. The possession of {{the right and the}} capability to imprison citizens, however, granted an air of legitimacy to officials at all levels of government, from kings to regional courts to city councils; and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> someone imprisoned or killed served as a signifier of who in society possessed power or authority over others. Another common punishment was sentencing people to galley slavery, which involved chaining prisoners together in the bottoms of ships and forcing them to row on naval or merchant vessels.|$|E
25|$|The ZBD patents {{included}} two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning {{the use of}} parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1400V to 2000V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. The other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source, voltage intensive' (VSVI) systems' by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885. Ottó Bláthy also invented the first AC electricity meter.|$|E
25|$|Minority {{populations have}} {{increased}} exposure to environmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood resources, structural and community factors {{as well as}} residential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and stress. The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes. Minority neighborhoods have been continuously noted to have more fast food chains and fewer grocery stores than predominantly white neighborhoods. These food deserts affect a family’s <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> easy access to nutritious food for their children. This lack of nutritious food extends beyond the household into the schools that {{have a variety of}} vending machines and deliver over processed foods. These environmental condition have social ramifications and in the first time in US history is it projected that the current generation will live shorter lives than their predecessors will.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} between angakkuq and lay person {{has not always}} been clearly demarcated. Non-angakkuq could experience hallucinations, and almost every Alaskan Native can report memories of ghosts, animals in human form, or little people living in remote places. Experiences such as hearing voices from ice or stones were discussed as readily as everyday hunting adventures. Neither were ecstatic experiences the monopoly of angakkuit (reverie, daydreaming, even trance were not unknown by non-angakkuit), and laypeople (non-angakkuit) experiencing them were welcome to report their experiences and interpretations. The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> and command helping spirits was characteristic of angakkuit, but laypeople could also profit from spirit powers through the use of amulets. In one extreme instance a Netsilingmiut child had 80 amulets for protection. Some laypeople had a greater capacity than others for close relationships with special beings of the belief system; these people were often apprentice angakkuit who failed to complete their learning process.|$|E
25|$|PlayStation Plus (commonly {{abbreviated}} PS+ {{and occasionally}} {{referred to as}} PSN Plus) is a premium PlayStation Network subscription service that was officially unveiled at E3 2010 by Jack Tretton, President and CEO of SCEA. Rumors of such service had been in speculation since Kaz Hirai's announcement at TGS 2009 of a possible paid service for PSN but with the current PSN service still available. Launched alongside PS3 firmware 3.40 and PSP firmware 6.30 on June 29, 2010, the paid-for subscription service provides users with enhanced services on the PlayStation Network, {{on top of the}} current PSN service which is still available with all of its features. These enhancements include the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> demos and game updates download automatically to PlayStation 3. Subscribers also get early or exclusive access to some betas, game demos, premium downloadable content and other PlayStation Store items. North American users also get a free subscription to Qore.

25|$|New {{digital signal}} {{processing}} functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Loudness Equalization and Speaker Fill have been introduced. Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers {{in a manner similar}} to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. Whether you have a multi-channel or stereo sound system in your home theater or living room, Windows Vista also includes the ability to calibrate your speakers for your room. By placing a microphone where you plan to sit and then running a wizard that measures the room response, Windows Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance for each channel accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function.|$|E
