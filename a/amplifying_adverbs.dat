This has appeared from comparisons between corpora of written learner English and corpora of spoken and written native English, which show that the written learner corpora often display features more typical of native speech than of native writing (for example first and second person pronouns or <b>amplifying</b> <b>adverbs).</b> Thanks to the recent availability of learner corpora of speech, it has now become possible to bring spoken interlanguage into the equation, and thus consider problems of register confusion in both writing and speech. In this presentation, I will investigate the use of phrasal verbs, a particularly difficult area of language for learners of English, in two learner corpora, namely the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE; Granger et al. 2009), representing written interlanguage, and the Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage (LINDSEI; Gilquin et al. 2010). Both corpora include data produced by learners from different mother tongue backgrounds, which makes it possible to investigate the influence of medium among several learner populations. Phrasal verbs being generally recognized as sensitive to register variation (they are said to occur more frequently in speech than in writing, cf. Cornell 1985 : 269), they constitute an interesting starting point to examine learners’ stylistic preferences. Here, the focus will be on phrasal verbs with the particles 'up' and 'down'. Relying on comparisons with similar data for native English (from the Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays and the Louvain Corpus of Native English Conversation), the corpus study reveals that learners have a tendency to underuse phrasal verbs with 'up' and 'down', but use them more frequently in writing (ICLE) than in speech (LINDSEI), which is to be contrasted with the situation for native English. The quantitative analysis will be supplemented by a qualitative analysis, which will investigate the types of phrasal verbs that are used by learners in speech and writing, and which will seek to determine whether register confusion is at play in the choice of phrasal verbs too. More generally, the study will try to explain learners’ distinctive “stylistic signatures” (Gilquin et al. 2007 : 322) by referring to the context in which English as a foreign language is usually learned...|$|E

Not only do they have to acquire a specialised vocabulary, but they also have to find an appropriate voice, one that will be accepted by the academic community as a whole. It has been suggested in the literature that one of the problems non-native speakers experience in this latter respect is their lack of register awareness (see e. g. Altenberg 1998, Granger & Rayson 1998). This issue will be investigated here through the study of language functions particularly prominent in academic writing, such as expressing one's own opinion, quoting other people's work or concluding a piece of writing. More precisely, non-native learner writing will be examined with respect to medium variation, comparing data from the International Corpus of Learner English (Granger et al. 2002) with native academic writing and spoken interaction from the British National Corpus. The analysis reveals a clear tendency among non-native learners to produce words and structures that are more typical of speech than of academic writing. To give but a couple of examples, they often use 'say' as a reporting verb and prefer <b>amplifying</b> to downtoning <b>adverbs,</b> thereby constructing an inappropriately informal voice. While this tendency can partly be explained by non-native learners' lack of intuition regarding the distinction between casual speech and formal writing (see Lorenz 1999), we argue on the basis of data from the LOCNESS (Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays) that it is also characteristic of novice writers, whether native or non-native, and that {{this is part of the}} process of acquiring an academic voice and becoming expert writers. We suggest that one way of helping learners to find their voice in academic writing is to show them how to lose it, that is how to turn their 'voice' (spoken word) into academic 'writing'. To this end, their attention should be drawn to medium variation and in particular to the differences that exist between academic writing and spoken interaction. Some consciousness-raising activities will be proposed that aim to achieve this purpose...|$|R
