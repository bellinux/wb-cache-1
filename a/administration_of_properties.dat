50|$|The <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> {{belonging}} to religious institutes {{under the jurisdiction}} of the ordinary rests naturally with their superiors, but the bishop may reserve to himself in the constitutions a large right of control and supervision.

5000|$|In the councils of {{the thirteenth}} century {{frequent}} mention is made of laymen, chosen by their fellow laymen {{to participate in the}} <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> temporal affairs; {{at the same time the}} rights of the parish priest and of ecclesiastical authority were maintained. A reaction is visible in the councils of the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries which undertake to check the tendency towards an exclusively lay <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> the parochial <b>property.</b> Eventually the Council of Trent (Sess. XXII de ref. c. ix) admitted participation in the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical <b>property,</b> but demanded that at all times and in all places the lay administrators render an annual account to the bishop or to his delegate. As no general law has determined either the competency or the composition of fabric committees (conseils de fabrique) there has been in this respect very great variations. In modern times secular power has frequently interfered in the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical <b>property</b> set apart for purposes of worship, and in the organization of church fabrics. In most European countries, the State regulates the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical <b>property,</b> and the proceedings of church fabrics.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the fate of the}} confiscated monuments nationalized by presidential decrees (no. 12 / 1945 and No. 108 / 1945) in 1945 within the Liberec region.

It focuses on the actual effect of the decrees issued by President Benes and also on the process of the establishment of state institutions for <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> confiscated <b>property.</b> The following part of the work is dedicated to the system <b>of</b> national <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> confiscated <b>property</b> <b>of</b> high artistic value (especially objects which belonged to displaced families).
