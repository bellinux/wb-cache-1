40|$|An {{experiment}} {{demonstrated that}} subtle advertising produces assimilation of the persuasive message, whereas blatant advertising produces contrast, both in explicit and implicit attitudes. This finding suggests a parallelism between the “Reversed Priming Effect” (Glaser & Banaji, 1999) and the Flexible Correction Theory (Wegener & Petty, 1995). Furthermore, changes disappeared 48 {{hours after the}} treatment, {{but only in the}} implicit measure. This finding suggests that implicit and explicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>change</b> according to the rules of different memory systems. Specifically, implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>change</b> according to the rules of a slow-learning (associative) system, whereas explicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>change</b> according to a fast-binding (rule-based) system (cf. McClelland, McNaughton and O’Reilly, 1995). These results also provide evidence that subtle advertising may be more effective than blatant advertising, which can sometimes be counterproductive...|$|R

At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent <b>attitude</b> <b>change</b> did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This study aims {{to examine}} how {{organizational}} <b>change</b> and <b>attitude</b> towards <b>change</b> affects the fulfillment of the psychological contract. The influence of type of change, impact of change, former change experiences and frequency of change on fulfillment of the psychological contract is assessed, {{as well as the}} influence on the employee's <b>attitude</b> towards <b>change.</b> Design/methodology/approach Regression analyses were carried out to test the effects of the change antecedents and the <b>attitude</b> towards <b>change</b> on the fulfillment of the psychological contract and to test the effects of the change determinants on the <b>attitude</b> towards <b>change.</b> The data used in this study are from 161 respondents working for different organizations who completed an online questionnaire. Findings The results show that type of change, impact and former experience with organizational <b>change</b> influence <b>attitude</b> towards <b>change.</b> With respect to the fulfillment of the psychological contract, only frequency, former experiences and the <b>attitude</b> towards <b>change</b> had an impact. Research limitations/implications A limitation is the cross-sectional design of the study. A recommendation for future research is to further explore the results by using case studies or longitudinal research. Practical implications This study contributes to managers', HR professionals' and change professionals' understanding of the change factors that have the highest impact for employees. Originality/value This study highlights the effects of organizational changes on the psychological contract and includes the role of <b>attitude</b> towards <b>change.</b> Empirical research in this area is scarce.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} extent to which <b>attitudes</b> <b>changed</b> following majority and minority influence are resistant to counter-persuasion. In both experiments participants' attitudes were measured after being exposed to two messages, delayed in time, which argued opposite positions (initial message and counter-message). In the first experiment, attitudes following minority endorsement of the initial message were more resistant to a second counter-message only when the initial message contained strong versus weak arguments. <b>Attitudes</b> <b>changed</b> following majority influence did not resist the second counter-message and returned to their pre-test level. Experiment 2 varied whether memory was warned (i. e., message recipients expected to recall the message) or not, to manipulate message processing. When memory was warned, which should increase message processing, <b>attitudes</b> <b>changed</b> following both majority and minority influence resisted the second counter-message. The results support the view that minority influence instigates systematic processing of its arguments, leading to attitudes that resist counter-persuasion. Attitudes formed following majority influence yield to counter-persuasion unless there is a secondary task that encourages message processing. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 40 - 48). Recent {{literature has}} focused on identifying factors that facilitate or impede implementation of innovation in organizations. <b>Attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> and transformational leadership are widely regarded as important determinants of implementation success, but little research has empirically validated {{the existence of these}} relationships. This thesis tested a multilevel model that places staff <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> as a mediator in the relationship between transformational leadership and implementation success. Further, the model explores the largely overlooked role of leaders' own attitudes toward a specific change being implemented in their work groups. The ability of transformational leaders to influence their followers is often considered a strength during organizational change. However, if these leaders do not agree with an organizational change being implemented in their work groups, {{they may be able to}} influence their followers toward not supporting the change. Thus, the model tested whether leaders' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> moderate the relationship between transformational leadership and the attitudes of followers, and subsequently affect the success of implementation. The data for this study were from a large-scale data collection investigating the role of implementation climate and leadership in the success of evidence-based practice implementation. Participants were 310 mental health service providers and their supervisors working in organizations in the state of California. Data were collected via both web surveys and paper-and-pencil surveys. Multilevel modeling was used to simultaneously estimate the hypothesized multilevel, moderated mediation model, with transformational leadership and leaders' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> treated as level- 2 variables to account for the nested data structure. Results indicated support for the path between transformational leadership and employees' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> as well as the path between employees' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> and implementation success. However, the direct effect of transformational leadership on implementation success was not supported. The hypothesized moderating role of leaders' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> on the relationship between transformational leadership and the followers' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> was also not supported. Three exploratory models were developed and tested to assess the nature of the mediated relationship as well as to examine the possible presence of a direct path between leaders' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> and implementation success. Subsequent model comparison revealed support for an indirect relationship between transformational leadership and implementation success through employees' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> and also provided some support for the presence of a direct effect of supervisors' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change</b> on employees' <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>change.</b> Overall, this thesis contributes to the literature on leadership and implementation by demonstrating the influence of transformational leadership and leader's <b>attitudes</b> towards <b>change</b> on both subordinates' <b>attitudes</b> towards <b>change</b> and implementation success. Practical implications are discussed, specifically with regard to the behaviors and initiatives that organizations may adopt to have more success with implementation efforts. Limitations and future directions for research are also discussed...|$|R
