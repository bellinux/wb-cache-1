5|$|After his {{baseball}} career ended, Paciorek {{returned to school}} and {{earned a degree in}} physical education from the University of Houston, a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and <b>All</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> Know About Hitting.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and {{approved}} of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon’s conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: “Well... they have to be paid. That’s <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> that. They have to be paid.” During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.|$|E

25|$|The {{so-called}} sympathetic Seattle {{strike was}} an attempted revolution. That {{there was no}} violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for {{the overthrow of the}} industrial system; here first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|E

[...] When Theroux asks him how he knows this, Phelps answers, [...] "I'm not going to keep on talking to you. I know what you are. [...] you're an evil. [...] I don't even wanna go there.

500|$|An {{exception}} among Junimea promoters was Eminescu, himself {{noted for}} expressing a dissenting social perspective which only partly mirrored Maiorescu's take on conservatism. According to historian Lucian Boia, the [...] "authentic Moldavian peasant" [...] that was Creangă also complemented Eminescu's own [...] "more metaphysical" [...] peasanthood. Similarly, Z. Ornea {{notes that the}} poet used Creangă's positions to illustrate his own ethnonationalist take on Romanian culture, and in particular his claim that rural authenticity lay hidden by a [...] "superimposed stratum" [...] of urbanized ethnic minorities. 20th century critics have described Creangă {{as one of his}} generation's most accomplished figures, and a leading exponent of Junimist literature. This verdict is found in several of Vianu's texts, which uphold Creangă as a great exponent of his generation's literature, comparable to fellow Junimea members Eminescu, Slavici and Ion Luca Caragiale. This view complements George Călinescu's definition, placing the Moldavian author in the company of Slavici and Caragiale as one of the [...] "great prose writers" [...] of the 1880s. Lucian Boia, who noted that [...] "the triad of Romanian classics" [...] includes Creangă alongside Eminescu and Caragiale, also cautioned that, compared to the other two (with whom [...] "the Romanians have said almost <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> say about themselves"), Creangă has [...] "a rather more limited register".|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the Pepsi {{commercial}} premiered, Madonna released the actual music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] on MTV. Religious groups worldwide including the Vatican immediately protested the clip, saying that it contained blasphemous use of Christian imagery. They called for the national boycott of Pepsi and PepsiCo's subsidiaries, including fast food chains Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Pepsi initially wanted to continue airing the commercial, although were {{taken aback by the}} protests. They explained the differences between their advertisement and Madonna's artistic opinions in the video. Ultimately Pepsi gave up to the protests and cancelled the campaign. According to Taraborrelli, the company was so eager to extricate themselves from the collaboration that they even allowed Madonna to keep the $5million advance. In the meantime, Pope John Paul II involved himself in the matter and encouraged fans to boycott the singer in Italy. Protests from a small Catholic organization in the country prompted Italian state television network RAI and Madonna's record company WEA to not air the video there. The video was also deemed offensive by the American Family Association (AFA). Madonna stated that [...] "art should be controversial, and that's <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> it", about the controversy.|$|E
500|$|It was Sarah, Duchess of York, who {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria. She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a great-great-great-grandson of Victoria and Albert, and had written two books about her {{with the help of an}} historian. The Victoria-Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen's history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both [...] "fought for their love" [...] in the midst of public scrutiny. A friend set up a meeting with producer Graham King, to whom she pitched the idea along with several others. At the time wrapping up his work on The Departed, King, a native of Britain, had been looking for a project set in his home country for years. The producer later remembered, [...] "she pitched me a bunch of things, and among them was a three-page synopsis of Victoria’s early life: the precise span covered in The Young Victoria. [...] just fell into place." [...] King brought frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese on board as a co-executive producer, as the Academy Award-winning director knew [...] "pretty much <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know about British history".|$|E

Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it does appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties.

I love The Threepenny Opera but, outside of The Threepenny Opera, the music of his I like is the stuff he wrote in America – when he was not writing with Brecht, when he was writing for Broadway."

2500|$|In the 2000–01 season, United {{retained}} the league title {{for a third}} season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so. The achievement was overshadowed by reports of a rift between the club's board and Ferguson. He told the club's television channel MUTV that {{he was prepared to}} sever all ties with the club, once his contract ended the following year: [...] "The decision has been taken. I'm going to leave the club. I'm disappointed with what has happened because I was hoping something would be sorted out. It hasn't happened as I thought it would and that's <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> it." [...] Both parties eventually reached a compromise which pleased Ferguson: [...] "I am delighted we've settled this. When you have been at the club as long as I have it gets in your blood." [...] Ferguson's decision to retire came about because he perceived his chances of winning a second European Cup as [...] "imponderable." [...] Age was another factor: reaching 60 acted as a [...] "psychological barrier ... It changed my sense of my own fitness, my health." ...|$|E
2500|$|New South Wales Police Commissioner Ken Moroney {{called the}} riots [...] "absolutely totally un-Australian", saying that [...] "I saw, in my 40 years of police service, {{some of the}} most disgraceful {{behaviour}} and conduct by adults that I'd ever seen." [...] New South Wales Opposition leader Peter Debnam called it [...] "a real disgrace" [...] and called for a tougher police response. Australian Prime Minister John Howard condemned the violence describing it as [...] "sickening and deplorable" [...] but denied any racial undertones, saying the events were primarily an issue of law and order — a view echoed by the Treasurer Peter Costello, who described the Sydney riots as [...] "an example of hoodlums who got out of control". However this was viewed by many people who live in Sydney as the government burying its head in the sand over racial tension so foreign ownership in Australia would not be affected. Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley described the attacks as [...] "simply criminal behaviour, that's <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> it".|$|E
2500|$|Discouraged, Miller {{returned}} to New York. He {{realized that he}} needed to develop a unique sound, and decided to make the clarinet play a melodic line with a tenor saxophone holding the same note, while three other saxophones harmonized within a single octave. George T. Simon discovered a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz for Glenn Miller. Miller hired Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. According to Simon, [...] "Willie's tone and way of playing provided a fullness and richness so distinctive that none of the later Miller imitators could ever accurately reproduce the Miller sound." [...] With this new sound combination, Glenn Miller found a way to differentiate his band's style from the many bands that existed in the late thirties. Miller talked about his style in the May 1939 issue of Metronome magazine. [...] "You'll notice today some bands use the same trick on every introduction; others repeat the same musical phrase as a modulation into a vocal ... We're fortunate in that our style doesn't limit us to stereotyped intros, modulations, first choruses, endings or even trick rhythms. The fifth sax, playing clarinet most of the time, lets you know whose band you're listening to. And that's about <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|E
