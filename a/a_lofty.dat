5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light <b>a</b> <b>lofty</b> domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|General Nansouty {{arrived in}} Paris {{and there he}} {{remained}} during the Bourbon Restoration that followed Napoleon's abdication. He {{was one of the}} first general officers to swear allegiance to the new King of France, Louis XVIII, who would bestow a number of honours upon the General. His gesture encouraged many other generals to also swear allegiance to the new regime. On 12 April 1814, Nansouty was named extraordinary commissioner of the King in the 2nd military division, then, on 20 April, became a member of the commission that was in charge of the dissolution of Napoleon's Imperial Guard. He was given the distinction of Knight of the Order of Saint Louis on 1 June and on 6 July he was called to a command in the Military Household of the King of France, as captain-lieutenant of the 1st company of musketeers (grey musketeers). Despite these positions, Nansouty's financial situation declined severely under the Restoration. The General had had a highly honourable behaviour during the Napoleonic Wars and, unlike some of his fellow Napoleonic Generals, had drawn no revenues from pillaging. He had also been living <b>a</b> <b>lofty</b> and very costly lifestyle, which he considered normal for a nobleman such as himself. Nansouty had been earning a high revenue from his various positions during the Empire and additionally Napoleon was constantly paying high endowments to his best generals. Napoleonic endowments aside, Nansouty's salaries during the first four months of 1814 had brought him no less than 104,000 Francs, but, under the Bourbons, his dignity as Colonel-General of dragoons had been suppressed and transformed into an honorific title of Inspector of dragoons, leaving him with only a 25,000 Francs salary as captain-lieutenant in the King's Military Household.|$|E

25|$|The {{magnificent}} five-domed Assumption Cathedral {{was designed}} as a sepulcher of grand princes and dedicated to the holy icon Theotokos of Vladimir, which had been brought to the city by Andrew the Pious. The cathedral was constructed in 1158–1160, expanded in 1185–1189, and painted by the great Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chyorny in 1408. In 1810, <b>a</b> <b>lofty</b> bell-tower was added in Neoclassical style.|$|E

The cathedral was opened and consecrated on 30 November 1868 by Broughton's successor, Bishop Frederic Barker.|$|E
25|$|The Dandenong Town Hall, Lonsdale Street, {{was built}} in Free Classical style in 1890 as the {{combined}} Shire Hall, Courthouse and Mechanics Institute, {{at a cost of}} about 12,000 pounds.

Turkey's highest peak, Mount Ararat (Ağrı Dağı) — 5,137 meters high — is situated near the point where the boundaries of the four countries meet.|$|E

25|$|Considerable {{importance}} {{seems to}} have been attached to music and gymnastics in the daily exercises of the disciples. Their whole discipline is represented as encouraging <b>a</b> <b>lofty</b> serenity and self-possession, of which, there were various anecdotes in antiquity. Iamblichus (apparently on the authority of Aristoxenus) gives a long description of the daily routine of the members, which suggests many similarities with Sparta. The members of the sect showed a devoted attachment to each other, to the exclusion of those who did not belong to their ranks. There were even stories of secret symbols, by which members of the sect could recognise each other, even if they had never met before.|$|E
25|$|The iconostasis of {{the central}} {{sanctuary}} is made of ebony inlaid with ivory, and is surmounted by thirteen icons of the Virgin Mary and the Twelve Apostles. Above the icons is a rod depicting on each side a dragon and an eagle in conflict. Each eagle has a panel showing John the Baptist {{on the right and}} the Virgin Mary on the left. The southern sanctuary is dedicated to the angel Gabriel and its door, which dates to the Fatimid Period, is inlaid with ivory panels and has sculpted relief of birds and animals. <b>A</b> <b>lofty</b> dome ornamented with gated pendentives rises above the sanctuary. The altar canopy itself is shaped like a dome on four marble columns.|$|E
25|$|Her {{greatest}} {{period of}} reform activity was after her retirement {{from the medical}} profession, from 1880–1895. Blackwell was interested in {{a great number of}} reform movements– mainly moral reform, sexual purity, hygiene and medical education, but also preventative medicine, sanitation, eugenics, family planning, women's rights, associationism, Christian socialism, medical ethics and antivivisection– none of which ever came to real fruition. She switched back and forth between many different reform organisations, trying to maintain a position of power in each. Blackwell had <b>a</b> <b>lofty,</b> elusive and ultimately unattainable goal: evangelical moral perfection. All of her reform work was along this thread. She even contributed heavily to the founding of two utopian communities: Starnthwaite and Hadleigh in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|Alesia was an oppidum (fortified settlement) on <b>a</b> <b>lofty</b> hill, {{with two}} rivers on two {{different}} sides. Due to such strong defensive features, Caesar decided on a siege to force surrender by starvation. Considering that about 80,000 men were garrisoned in Alesia, together with the local civilian population, this would not have taken long. To guarantee a perfect blockade, Caesar ordered {{the construction of an}} encircling set of fortifications, a circumvallation, around Alesia. It was eleven Roman miles long (16km, each mile equivalent to around 1,000 left-foot steps, meaning one stepped with their right, then left) and had 24 redoubts (towers). While work was in progress, the Gauls carried out cavalry sallies to disrupt the construction. Caesar placed the legions in front of the camp in case of a sally by the infantry and got his Germanic allies to pursue the Gallic cavalry.|$|E
25|$|On {{the flat}} ceiling he painted an allegory of the Apotheosis of S. Ignatius, in breathtaking perspective.

The painting celebrates the apostolic goals of Jesuit missionaries, eager to expand the reach of Roman Catholicism in other continents. The Counter-Reformation also encouraged a combative Catholicism. For example, rather than placing the usual evangelists or scholarly pillars of doctrine in the pendentives, Pozzo depicted the victorious warriors of the old testament: Judith and Holofernes; David and Goliath; Jael and Sisera; and Samson and the Philistines. It is said that when completed, some said (sic)Sant'Ignazio was a good place to buy meat, since four new butchers are now there.|$|E
25|$|While Petre {{designed}} many churches, schools, public buildings, {{and private}} houses, his largest and grandest project, the Roman Catholic cathedral at Dunedin, was never fully completed. The entrance facade and the nave are built {{to the original}} design, and reveal the cathedral as {{a prime example of}} the French Gothic Revival. St Joseph's Cathedral, standing next to St Dominic's Priory, is reminiscent of many of the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, with its twin towers and central rose window—Chartres and Notre Dame come to mind, although the original design if completed with its tower would have produced a building more like Rouen Cathedral. The architect's intention was for a mighty structure, with the twin towers dwarfed by <b>a</b> <b>lofty</b> spire some 60 metres (200ft) in height, which would have been a magnificent edifice. In the event, the project stalled when a prudent Roman Catholic diocese reluctant to incur unnecessary debt with the onset of the 1880s depression postponed further work.|$|E
