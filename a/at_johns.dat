5|$|While Stratton was <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins, the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 struck {{destroying}} large {{swaths of}} the city. He had specific {{suggestions on how}} to rebuild the city to resist earthquakes and fires even with the water supply cut off. He urged the city be split into districts with avenues or boulevauds as firebreaks between the divisions.|$|E
5|$|After the NSDAP came {{to power}} in Germany in 1933, Franck {{resigned}} his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted Frederick Lindemann in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark, he moved to the United States, where he worked <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University in Baltimore and then the University of Chicago. During this period he became interested in photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|Born in Walkerton, Indiana, Urey studied {{thermodynamics}} under Gilbert N. Lewis at the University of California. After {{he received}} his PhD in 1923, he was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. He was a research associate <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University before becoming {{an associate professor of}} Chemistry at Columbia University. In 1931, he began work with the separation of isotopes that resulted in the discovery of deuterium.|$|E
5|$|George Whipple, a {{physician}} and pathologist, was {{a teacher at the}} school for a year before he started work <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University. Notable students include Donn Barber, an architect, Nelson Doubleday, a publisher, Edward Avery McIlhenny, a businessman, explorer, and conservationist, John Avery McIlhenny, a businessman, soldier, politician, and public servant, Harold Medina, a lawyer, teacher and judge, and John W. Norton, a muralist and easel artist.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} on August 4, 1880 in Baltimore, Maryland and {{attended}} high school at Baltimore City College, from which he graduated in 1899. He received his undergraduate college education <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1902. While at Hopkins, Schmeisser played as a defenseman on the lacrosse team from 1900 to 1902. He was {{also a member of}} the Beta Mu chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Said joined Columbia University, as {{a member}} of the English and Comparative Literature faculties, where he taught and worked until 2003. In 1974, he was Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard; during the 1975–76 period, he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science, at Stanford University. In 1977, he became the Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and {{subsequently}} was the Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities; and in 1979 was Visiting Professor of Humanities <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University.|$|E
5|$|Lacks {{was treated}} with radium tube inserts as an {{inpatient}} and discharged {{a few days later}} with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks's cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous. These samples were given to George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, a commonly used cell line in contemporary biomedical research.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in China, MacMurray fell into disagreement with Washington over U.S. policy towards the ruling Kuomintang (Nationalist) government, which had been demanding immediate revisions to or a cessation of the treaty system in place between the two countries. Whereas Washington wished to make concessions to the Nationalist government, MacMurray favored the enforcement of existing treaties. These differences of opinion led him to resign in November 1929, whereupon he became a professor of International Relations <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Leak Warren {{was born}} in Maxwell, New Mexico on June 19, 1896. He {{attended}} the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918. He married Viola Lockhart on May 22, 1920. Their marriage produced two sons and a daughter. He went to medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, graduating with his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1922. He then did post-doctoral work <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins School of Medicine and Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made Wheeler an {{associate}} professor in 1937, but he wanted to be able work more closely with the experts in particle physics. He turned down an offer in 1938 of {{an associate}} professorship <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins University in favor of an assistant professorship at Princeton University. Although it was a lesser position, he felt that Princeton, which was building up its physics department, was a better career choice. He remained a member of the faculty there until 1976.|$|E

5|$|There {{was little}} {{interest}} in quantum mechanics <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins, but Goeppert Mayer worked with Karl Herzfeld, collaborating {{on a number of}} papers. She also returned to Göttingen in the summers of 1931, 1932 and 1933 to work with her former examiner Born, writing an article with him for the Handbuch der Physik. This ended when the NSDAP came to power in 1933, and many academics, including Born and Franck, lost their jobs. Goeppert Mayer and Herzfeld became involved in refugee relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|Urey and Murphy {{calculated}} from the Debye model that the heavy isotope would have a slightly higher boiling point than the light one. By carefully warming liquid hydrogen, 5 litres of liquid hydrogen could be distilled to 1 millilitre, which would be enriched in the heavy isotope by 100 to 200 times. To obtain five litres of liquid hydrogen, they traveled to the cryogenics laboratory at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., where they obtained the help of Ferdinand Brickwedde, whom Urey had known <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the strong}} win, bitter {{feelings}} <b>at</b> <b>Johns</b> Hopkins {{continued to grow}} into the next season. The school's attitude towards the series worsened {{to the point where}} the 1889 game was rescheduled away from the traditional Thanksgiving Day playing and was moved to a week earlier. That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the breaking point for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided to terminate the series following that game. However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E
