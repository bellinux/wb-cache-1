5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam <b>and</b> <b>Barrel</b> Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E
5|$|Jack assigns the {{citizens}} of Halloween Town Christmas-themed jobs, including singing carols, making presents, and building a sleigh to be pulled by skeletal reindeer. Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman that is secretly in love with Jack, feels that their efforts will end in disaster, but Jack dismisses her and assigns her the task of sewing him a red coat to wear. He also tasks Lock, Shock <b>and</b> <b>Barrel,</b> a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct Santa Claus and {{bring him back to}} Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be bringing Christmas to the world in his place this year. Jack orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but the children instead deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa so he can stop Jack, but Oogie captures her as well.|$|E

5|$|At {{some time}} between 1727 and 1757 the Tudor house was {{demolished}} {{and replaced by}} a new house in Georgian style. The house had an L-plan, the main wing facing west standing on the footprint of the Tudor house, with a south wing at right-angles to it. The ground floor of the west wing retained the former vaulted undercroft of the west range of the medieval abbey, and contained the kitchens and areas for the storage of wines and beers. The first floor was the piano nobile, containing the main reception rooms. The west front was symmetrical, in three storeys, with a double flight of stairs {{leading up to the}} main entrance. Clearance of the other surviving remnants of the monastic buildings had started but the moated enclosures were still in existence at that time. A drawing dated 1770 shows that by then all these buildings and the moats had been cleared away, and the former fishponds were being used for pleasure boating. Between 1757 and the early 1770s modifications were made to the house, the main one being the addition of a north wing. According to the authors of the Buildings of England series, the architect responsible for this was James Wyatt. Also between 1757 and 1770, the Brooke family built a walled garden at a distance from the house to provide fruit, vegetables and flowers. The family also developed the woodland around the house, creating pathways, a stream-glade and a rock garden. Brick-built wine bins were added to the undercroft, developing it into a wine cellar, <b>and</b> <b>barrel</b> vaulting was added to the former entrance hall to the abbey (which was known as the outer parlour), obscuring its arcade.|$|E
25|$|Browning's basic M1911 {{design has}} seen very little change {{throughout}} its production life. The basic {{principle of the}} pistol is recoil operation. As the expanding combustion gases force the bullet down the barrel, they give reverse momentum to the slide <b>and</b> <b>barrel</b> which are locked together during {{this portion of the}} firing cycle. After the bullet has left the barrel, the slide <b>and</b> <b>barrel</b> continue rearward a short distance.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a modern}} {{revolver}} of Russian design, the OTs-38, which uses ammunition that incorporates the silencing mechanism into the cartridge case, making the gap between cylinder <b>and</b> <b>barrel</b> irrelevant {{as far as the}} suppression issue is concerned. The OTs-38 does need an unusually close and precise fit between the cylinder <b>and</b> <b>barrel</b> due to the shape of bullet in the special ammunition (Soviet SP-4), which was originally designed for use in a semi-automatic.|$|E
