Z31 entered one of the town's docks to be {{repaired}} while Z34 and Z38 departed on the evening of 28January. The two ships were attacked from the air the next day, but did not suffer any damage and sheltered in a fjord south of Stavanger during daylight hours. They put to sea again on the evening of 29January and eventually reached Kiel in Germany on 1February.|$|E

5|$|The KJRM {{inherited}} four river monitors {{from the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, each {{from a different}} class. In April 1941, one was sunk, and the rest were scuttled. One of the scuttled ships was raised and scrapped.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was initially encountered near the Lesser Antilles on September9 by the ship Frank W.. Later that day, the ship Mary Ann was dismasted. It {{is estimated that}} the cyclone intensified into a Category1 hurricane around 12:00UTC on September9, with winds reaching 80mph (130km/h). The system moved north-northwestward or nort hward for several days and closely approached Bermuda late on September11. Around that time, some ships to the southeast of the island were damaged during the storm <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> Bermuda as a result. By early on September13, the hurricane was beginning to move in a more northeasterly direction. The bark Machae was dismasted on September14. The cyclone weakened to a {{tropical storm}} early the following day. On September16, the Glad Tiding last observed the storm about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Broad Ripple Park Carousel is {{an antique}} {{carousel}} in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It {{was installed in}} 1917 at an amusement park near the White River in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the animals were relatively unscathed <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> storage by the park's owners, the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation. The animals were carved by the Dentzel Carousel Company some time before 1900 but were assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Dubrovnik {{was captured by}} the Italians. After a refit, which included the replacement of some of her weapons and the shortening of her mainmast and funnels, she was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy as Premuda. In Italian service she was mainly used as an escort and troop transport. In June 1942, {{she was part of}} the Italian force that attacked the Allied Operation Harpoon convoy attempting to relieve the island of Malta. In July 1943, she broke down <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> Genoa for repair and a refit. Premuda was the most important and effective Italian war prize ship of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Eight German-built s were {{purchased}} from Nazi Germany in the mid-to-late 1930s. Two escaped during {{the invasion of}} Yugoslavia in April 1941, and {{became part of the}} KJRM-in-exile.

Two were scuttled by their crews {{at the time of the}} Italian capitulation in September 1943, and the remaining four were captured by the Germans and renamed. All four were scuttled at Salonika in October 1944. The boats that had escaped were transferred to the Yugoslav Navy at the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|From 1936, NSB took {{delivery}} of Class 65 multiple units, replacing El 1 {{as the primary}} hauler on the electrified commuter rail network. Class 65 were the first that were optimized for local traffic, with wide doors and turnable seats. NSB took {{delivery of}} 49 units until 1952, although they were also used outside the commuter rail network. The Østfold Line was upgraded to double track <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> service in four sections: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from OsloØ to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The Østfold Line was also the next line to be electrified, which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940. NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{under the}} terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Novara and the rest of the fleet was {{surrendered}} to the Allied powers as war prizes; Novara was awarded to France in the post-war distribution of ships. She sprang a leak in the Adriatic <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> Brindisi, Italy, where she sank on 29 January 1920. She was refloated in early April 1920. The ship was renamed Thionville and incorporated into the French fleet after repairs. Thionville was assigned to the torpedo school for use as a training ship, a role she filled until 1 May 1932. The ship was then disarmed and converted into a barracks ship based in Toulon. She remained there until 1941, when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Jones's {{recommendations}} were immediately accepted <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> practice. A series of new batteries aligned on a roughly north-south axis facing west towards the harbour was constructed, including Jones', Civil Hospital, Raglan's, Gardiner's, Queen Victoria's, Lady Augusta's, Prince of Wales and Cumberland batteries. Further batteries and fortifications were constructed around Rosia Bay near {{the south of}} the peninsula and Windmill Hill was strengthened around its entire perimeter, with Retrenched Barracks at its north end blocking access to the higher ground behind. The sea wall in the town was straightened and strengthened with the building of two new curtain walls, Prince Albert's Front and Wellington Front. Defensive breakwaters were constructed in front of both to prevent an armoured enemy ship ramming the walls.|$|E

The wholly owned subsidiary BFCC {{was set up in}} 1989 to provide in-flight meals. It is one of Biman's profitable operations, supplying food to Saudia, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, Dragon Air, China Southern Airlines and Regent Airways, along with casual orders from other airlines operating into Bangladesh. The BFCC consumes 90% of the eggs and chickens from the BPC, another profit-making subsidiary of Biman formed in 1976 <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> operation in November 1980 to rear poultry at farms in Dhaka. Bird flu was detected at one of the farms in March 2007, and many of the birds were culled. This was the first incident of bird flu in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Since Moore was grievously {{wounded in}} the battle, his second-in-command, Midshipman Richard Stillingfleet, {{surrendered}} the crew and the vessel. Moore was taken back to Machias <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> the care of Ichabod Jones's nephew, Stephen Jones. However, Moore's wounds were too severe and he died the following day. Three other members of Moore's crew were killed, including Robert Avery. The remaining crew members of the British schooner were held at Machias for a month, then {{handed over to the}} Massachusetts Provincial Congress. Reports circulated that as many as 100 British men died in the battle. Machias lost two men, John McNiell and James Coolbroth, and three others were badly wounded: John Berry, who had a musket ball enter his mouth and exit behind his ear, Isaac Taft, and James Cole.|$|E
5|$|The German naval {{contingent}} (numbering four, {{compared to}} the United Kingdom's eight) followed the British lead in operational terms. On 11 December 1902, the Gazelle boarded the old gunboat Restaurador in the port of Guanta. The gunboat was towed at anchor <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> service by the German Captain-Lieutenant Titus Türk with crew members of the Gazelle as SMS Restaurador. On 23 February 1903 was the return to Venezuela, where the ship was by the extent of repair work {{in a much better}} condition than the removal.|$|E

5|$|The attack tapered {{off with}} the coming of daylight, but that night it resumed. The North Koreans struck {{repeatedly}} at the defense line. This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September. The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops. Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning. All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> the fight at the most critical points. At one time, the regimental reserve was down to six men. When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12:00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent.|$|E
5|$|Eight former Austro-Hungarian s were {{transferred}} to the KJRM in 1921, and were the KJRM's only modern sea-going warships when it was formed. Two were lost or scrapped prior to World War II, and the rest were captured by the Italians during the 1941 Axis invasion <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> service by them. After the Italian capitulation, two were returned to the KJRM-in-exile. A further ship was sunk by German aircraft while still in Italian hands, and another was scuttled by her Italian crew. Of the remaining two, one {{was transferred to the}} Navy of the Independent State of Croatia and was sunk in 1944, and the other served in the German Navy as TA48 and was sunk in early 1945. The two boats that were returned to the KJRM-in-exile {{were transferred}} to the Yugoslav Navy {{at the end of the}} war and served as Golešnica and Cer.|$|E
5|$|Eventually NSB felt {{confident}} that they had found a technical solution that would be satisfactory, and ordered another six units to allow all trains on the Dovre, Bergen and Sørland Lines to be hauled with the class. Units 2227–2232 were delivered in 1987, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> regular service on the Sørland Line. Although better than the first series, the second series was also prone to technical problems, and never entered regular service on the Bergen Line. During the 1990s, they were also put into service on the regional rail services on the Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. The units were never well-liked by NSB, {{in part because of}} the bad name the first series had given, and partly because the number of available units was unpredictable. It also took a while for NSB to discover that asynchronous locomotives needed to be operated differently. The locomotives had been designed to haul a six-car train, but NSB regularly needed to haul eight-car trains, and therefore instead used the more powerful El 16.|$|E
