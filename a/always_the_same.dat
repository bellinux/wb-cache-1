5|$|Some insects {{display a}} {{rudimentary}} sense of numbers, {{such as the}} solitary wasps that prey upon a single species. The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg {{with a number of}} live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other {{different}} types of historic preservation associated with {{the properties of the}} National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of {{different types of}} properties. Although the criteria are <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries, and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last fifty years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} the use of this {{operator}} in Haskell would be getLine >>= putStrLn, which reads a single line of text from standard input and echoes it to standard output.

25|$|In {{any given}} country, rail traffic {{generally}} runs {{to one side}} of a double-track line, not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> side as road traffic. Thus in Belgium, China, France (apart from the former German Alsace and Lorraine), Sweden, Switzerland and Italy for example, the railways use left-hand running, while the roads use right-hand running. In countries such as Indonesia, it is the reverse (right-hand running for railways and left-hand running for roads).|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} {{suggests}} these are roughly {{the groups of}} Lie type over fields of characteristic 2, plus a handful of others that are alternating or sporadic or of odd characteristic. Their classification is divided into the small and large rank cases, where the rank is the largest rank of an odd abelian subgroup normalizing a nontrivial 2-subgroup, which is often (but not <b>always)</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the rank of a Cartan subalgebra when the group {{is a group of}} Lie type in characteristic 2.|$|E

25|$|Monozygotic {{twins are}} genetically nearly {{identical}} {{and they are}} <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sex unless {{there has been a}} mutation during development. The children of monozygotic twins test genetically as half-siblings (or full siblings, if a pair of monozygotic twins reproduces with another pair or with the same person), rather than first cousins. Identical twins {{do not have the same}} fingerprints, because even in the confines of the womb, the fetuses touch different parts of this environment, which gives small variations in the same fingerprint, making them unique.|$|E
25|$|C) Continuity of blue {{color is}} valid for the uniform {{uniform of the}} {{officers}} of the Air Force, Airborne Forces and the Russian Federation and the USSR. The blue color of the uniforms of officers of these types and types of service was not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> - in the USSR, the uniforms of the officers {{for a long time}} were khaki colors, like the uniforms and uniforms of soldiers; The blue uniform was only the form of the Air Force commander in the period of the 1920s and 1930s.

How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last – will Team 1's innings be re-started?).|$|E

25|$|After Wolsey's {{downfall}} in 1530, {{his former}} ally Thomas Cromwell ensured {{the survival of}} the School by securing for it a new endowment from King Henry VIII and the status of a royal foundation. This was confirmed by Queen Elizabeth I in the charter that she granted to the School in 1566. For part of the School's history it was known as Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Ipswich. The School's coat of arms and motto, Semper Eadem (<b>Always</b> <b>the</b> <b>Same),</b> are those of Elizabeth I. The Monarch of the United Kingdom, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the School's Visitor.|$|E
25|$|Many {{states have}} {{policies}} which protect {{the young and}} inexperienced by insulating them from liability {{even though they may}} have voluntarily committed themselves to unwise contracts. The age at which children achieve full contractual capacity varies from state to state but the principle is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Infants are not bound by many otherwise valid contracts, and their intention is irrelevant because of the legal incapacity imposed on them by the state of the domicile (the lex domicilii) or nationality (the lex patriae). This recognises a set of social values that requires exculpation even though there is relevant action and consent freely given.|$|E
25|$|Early amniotes {{had four}} opsins in the cones of their retinas {{to use for}} {{distinguishing}} colours: one sensitive to red, one to green, and two corresponding to different shades of blue. The green opsin was not inherited by any crown mammals, but all normal individuals did inherit the red one. Early crown mammals thus had three cone opsins, the red one and both of the blues. All their extant descendants have lost one of the blue-sensitive opsins but not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> one: marsupials and placentals (except for cetaceans) retain one blue-sensitive opsin while monotremes retain the other. Some placentals and marsupials, including humans, subsequently evolved green-sensitive opsins; like early crown mammals, therefore, their vision is trichromatic.|$|E

25|$|The {{primitive}} southern Negro, as he sang, {{was sure}} to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major..., and I carried this device into my melody as well... This was a distinct departure, but as it turned out, it touched the spot.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{other types of}} {{properties}} that do not fall neatly into the categories listed above. The National Park Service publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating properties for NRHP eligibility using the criteria for evaluation. Though the criteria for eligibility are <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> {{the way they are}} applied can differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. Special Register bulletins cover application of the criteria for evaluation of: aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last 50 years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{principles}} of focal ratio are <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> the application to which the principle is put can differ. In photography the focal ratio varies the focal-plane illuminance (or optical power per unit area in the image) and is used to control variables such as depth of field. When using an optical telescope in astronomy, there is no depth of field issue, and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power (not divided by area) {{is a function of}} absolute aperture area only, independent of focal length. The focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD.|$|E
