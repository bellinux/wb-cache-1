5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, <b>and</b> <b>exchanged</b> for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} integration and efficiency of Indian stock <b>and</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets. The study employed Time series ordinary least square regression, Unit Root test, Grangers causality test, Vector Auto Regression techniques on monthly data of stock return <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> rate return for the period spanning from February 1995 to March 2005. The major finding of this studyare asfollows. Both the stock indices return (Rsensex and Rnifty) are near normal whereas exchange rate return is not normal and more peak. The stock return <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> rate return are positively related. The policy implication of this above result of the positive relation between stock return <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> rate return for the foreign investors in India should be further studied. From the Granger's causality test, {{it is found that}} there is no causality for the return series of stock indices <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> rate except return Nifty <b>and</b> return <b>exchange</b> rate.
