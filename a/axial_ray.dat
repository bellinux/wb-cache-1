Fibre cells accounts for 54 % {{of the total}} wood micro cellular constituents of B. paradoxum while vessel, <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells make {{up the rest of}} the wood micro structural constituents accounting for 11. 3 %, 11. 98 % and 22. 27 % respectively. The number of fibres at 2452 per mm 2 coupled with the high proportion of fibre cells at 54 % indicates that the density of the wood species may likely be high. In A. zygia the volume fraction of fibres, vessels, <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma are 36. 1 %, 7. 83 %, 23. 2 % and 32. 87 % respectively. The number of fibres per mm 3 is also high at 3, 782. The result of the study on L. acida is slightly difference from the others. While the fibre constituent was 29. 3 %, the wood has no apparent <b>axial</b> parenchyma. The <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells make up 67 % of the total wood micro constituents elements. The number of vessels per mm 3 is 10. 01 while the number of fibre per mm 3 is 2370. 5. In P. felicioda the percentage proportion of fibre cells is 39. 1 % while the volume fractions of vessels, <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells are 4. 60 % 23. 4 % and 24. 0 % respectively.

40|$|The {{use of a}} line-focus {{ultrasonic}} transducer in a vertical scanning reflection acoustic microscope system {{is well known for}} quantitative materials characterization [1]. The technique relies on the measurement of the reflected radio frequency tone burst echo amplitude, V, as a fonction of amount of defocus, z, and analysis of the interference minima of the V(z) curve to obtain various interface wave speeds. The technique uses well developed theory [2, 3, 4] representing fixed frequency ultrasound generated and detected by a cylindrical lens in the frequency domain. We have developed a large aperture lensless line-focus transducer which is highly efficient and has a bandwidth wide enough to allow the generation and detection of narrow transient pulses [5]. From this transducer placed in water near a solid sample, the resulting echo waveforms have multiple features which can be interpreted as the arrival of a specularly reflected <b>axial</b> <b>ray</b> and leaky surface waves.

40|$|The General Optical Systems Evaluation Program, GENOPTICS, was {{developed}} {{as an aid}} for the analysis and evaluation of optical systems that employ lenses, mirrors, diffraction gratings, and other geometrical surfaces. The GENOPTICS evaluation is performed by means of geometrical ray tracing based upon Snell's law. The GENOPTICS program can provide for the exact ray tracing {{of as many as}} 800 rays through as many as 40 surfaces. These surfaces may be planar, conic, toric, or polynomial shaped lenses, mirrors, and diffraction gratings. Each surface may be tilted about as many as three axes and may be decentered. Surfaces having bilateral symmetry may also be analyzed. GENOPTICS provides for user-oriented input and {{for a wide range of}} output for the evaluation of the optical system being analyzed. GENOPTICS provides a wide range of features for the optical system analyst. GENOPTICS performs <b>axial</b> <b>ray</b> tracing and computation of the third order aberrations including aspheric contribution. The program includes a quasi-automatic ray-surface intersection selection option. Graphical output can be generated for spot diagrams, radial energy distributions, and modulation transfer functions, for each object point and each color. Sag tables may be generated for any rotationally symmetric surface, with options to obtain the sag differences from a reference sphere in units of lengths or wavelengths. Statistics and plots of ray intercepts with any surface in the system may be obtained for use in vignetting analysis and beam distribution analysis. Afocal systems can be examined with image statistics generated in terms of tangents of angles with respect to the optical axis. For exact ray tracing, a ray pattern at the entrance pupil can be specified as a rectangular or polar grid, where each ray samples an equal amount of area, or as a pattern where each ray samples an equal amount of solid angle for a finite object. This latter pattern is useful in radiometric work. Input to GENOPTICS includes program control statements, system definition data, surface data, and task data. Multiple cases may be examined in a single run. Output includes printed and graphical results. The user can specify which portions of an analysis are to be printed. Optional printout includes system data, surface-to-surface printout of each ray, modulation transfer function values, radial energy distribution values, and paraxial ray data including aberrations. GENOPTICS is coded to generate plotted output for a ZETA plotting system but should be readily adapted to other plotting systems. The GENOPTICS program is written in FORTRAN 77 and has been implemented on an IBM 370 series and DEC VAX series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 220 K of 8 bit bytes.

40|$|In Lemaître [...] Tolman (L [...] T) models, {{light rays}} emitted {{radially}} at the Big Bang (BB) at such radial coordinates r where the bang-time function t_B(r) has t_B r ≠ 0 reach every observer with infinite blueshift, z = - 1. Consequently, there exist rays, emitted {{soon after the}} BB, that will reach later observers with finite blueshift (- 1 < z < 0). But in spacetimes without symmetry there are no radial directions. The question thus arises whether blueshifts can exist {{at all in the}} Szekeres models that contain L [...] T as a limit, but in general have no symmetry. The aim of the present paper is to show that strong blueshifts can be generated in quasi-spherical Szekeres (QSS) models. It is shown that in an axially symmetric QSS model, infinite blueshift can appear only on <b>axial</b> <b>rays,</b> which intersect every space orthogonal to the dust flow on the symmetry axis. In an exemplary QSS model it is numerically shown that if such a ray is emitted from the Big Bang where t_B r ≠ 0, then indeed observers see it with z ≈ - 1. Rays emitted shortly after the BB and running close to the symmetry axis will reach the observers with a strong blueshift, too. Then, in a toy QSS model that has no symmetry, it was shown by numerical calculations that two null lines exist such that rays in their vicinity have redshift profiles similar to those in a vicinity of the <b>axial</b> <b>rays</b> in the axially symmetric case. This indicates that rays generating infinite blueshifts exist in general QSS spacetimes and are concentrated around two directions. Comment: 20 pages, 19 figures.

40|$|Stems of Ipomoea obscura Ker Gawl., {{increase}} in thickness by forming multiple rings of cambia. Stems 5 - 6 mm thick produce parenchymatous derivatives which divide repeatedly to form small arcs of cambium. Several such small arcs initiate simultaneously {{and form a}} ring of small cambial arcs. After {{the formation of a}} few xylem and phloem elements, all these arcs are interconnected by transdifferentiation of parenchyma cells present between the cambial arcs and constitute a complete cambial cylinder. This newly formed cambium is functionally bidirectional: earlier- formed arcs produce xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally, while later-formed segments exclusively produce thin-walled parenchyma cells on either side. Young stems are circular in cross section but as stem thickness increases they become oval to elliptic or lobed and dumbbell-shaped. Xylem rays are mostly uni- or biseriate and thin-walled, but multiseriate rays characteristic for a climbing habit are observed occasionally. In thick stems, the marginal ray parenchyma in most of the samples becomes meristematic and develops ray cambia which exclusively produce sieve elements. Similarly, parenchyma cells produced from later-formed cambial segments give rise to several irregularly oriented vascular bundles. The secondary xylem is diffuse porous, with indistinct growth rings and is composed of fibriform and wider vessels, fibres, and <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells, while phloem consists of sieve elements, companion cells, and <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells...|$|R

Detarieae is the largest of four tribes of Caesalpinioideae, with 84 genera, only eleven occur in Venezuela with species of timber importance. The speci-mens were collected in Venezuela and include wood samples {{from the collection of}} the Laboratorio de Anatomía de Maderas de la Facultad de Ciencias Forestales y Ambientales de la Universidad de Los Andes, Venezuela, and of the Forest Products Laboratory of the USDA Forest Service in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The terminol-ogy and methodology used followed the iAWA List of Microscopic Features for Hardwood identification of the iAWA Committee, 1989. Measurements from each specimen were averaged (vessel diameters, vessel element lengths, intervessels pit size, fibre lengths and ray height).

MTs and MFs were bundled and oriented axially (parallel to the cell's long axis) within all parenchyma cell types after they had fully differentiated. Additionally, actin and myosin were immunolocalised at the thin-walled membranes of the pits, which linked cells in neighbouring files of both <b>ray</b> and <b>axial</b> parenchyma, and at the pits between <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells themselves. Anti-callose antibody immunolocated the plasmodesmata at the pit membranes, {{and in the same}} pattern as that of anti-myosin. Ray cells are important symplasmic pathways between the xylem and the phloem throughout the life of trees.

Thus, the symplasmic coupling between <b>ray</b> cells, between <b>axial</b> parenchyma cells, and between <b>axial</b> parenchyma and <b>ray</b> cells represents an extensive three-dimensional communication pathway permeating the tree from the phloem through the cambium into the wood. We suggest that this cytoskeletal pathway has an important role in delivery of photosynthate, and mobilised reserves, to the actively dividing cambium, and in the movement of materials to sites of reserve deposition, principally within the wood. This pathway could also have an important role in co-ordinating developmental processes throughout the tree...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} derives {{and demonstrates}} {{a new approach}} to the design of wide-field interferometric telescopes. The first part of this dissertation is a tutorial on multiple aperture systems. Design basics such as PSF and OTF, fill factors, resolution, and temporal coherence are investigated. We show that the perfect image for a multiple aperture system is the sum of an image from each aperture and a set of fringes from each pair of apertures. Four example systems are designed by applying the derived design rules. The first system is a rotationally-symmetric Paul system that is then segmented to make a four-aperture system. The low-order design rules in this system are shown to be automatically satisfied. The second system is an array of four afocal telescopes that share a three-mirror combining telescope. Fold flats are used in the inner two arms to satisfy the requirement that the axial pathlengths should match. Linear piston errors are eliminated by forcing the beam configuration into the combiner to be a scaled version of the afocal array. The angles of the fold flats are chosen to eliminate any constant tilt errors. As a third example, the design of a beam combiner for the Large Binocular telescope is explored. By applying the design rules, coherent imaging with a 1 arcminute field of view is achieved with just three reflections. Linear defocus errors appear, but are minimized by bringing the beams to focus as closely together as possible. The sine condition is satisfied for the <b>axial</b> <b>rays</b> so that the linear piston errors are zero. As a fourth example, a space telescope design is presented that utilizes a flat gossamer mirror technology. The system would consist of a primary array of flats, a shared secondary mirror, and a tertiary array with one mirror corresponding to each of the primary flats. Each branch of the system consists of a primary flat, the shared secondary, and a tertiary that brings the beam to the correct image point. The position of the tertiary is chosen to eliminate axial pathlength errors. The RMS wavefront error is calculated {{as a function of the}} system parameters. This gives an efficient method for exploring design space for the gossamer systems. The performance of a system of five flats is explored in this way. A few specific five-flat systems are modeled with full interferometric raytraces, and the results show good agreement with the Strehl values predicted by calculation of the RMS wavefront errors.

40|$|Wood {{density is}} {{considered}} a key plant trait, affectingmechanical and physiological performance, yet its biological meaning is still rather unclear. Accordingly we investigated the anatomical underpinnings of wood density in trees and shrubs. We measured wood density and anatomical traits in distal stems 4 - 10 mm diameter under bark in 24 Australian species. Proportions of wood components that are functionally distinct were analysed, including fibre wall and lumen, vessel wall and lumen, and <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma. Wood density was mainly driven by the density of wood outside vessel lumens (densityNV) rather than by vessel lumen fraction. In turn, densityNV variation was chiefly affected by fibre wall and lumen fractions. Considerable anatomical variation was observed at a given densityNV, especially among medium-densityNV species (0. 60 - 0. 85 g cm⁻³); this range of medium densityNV roughly translates to 0. 50 - 0. 75 g cm⁻³ of overall density. The anatomy of these species formed a continuum from low fibre lumen and medium parenchyma fractions to medium fibre lumen and low parenchyma fractions. Our data suggest that wood density is an emergent property influenced by a complex anatomy rather than an unambiguous functional trait, particularly in medium-density species. Withmuch anatomical variation, they likely represent {{a wide range of}} ecological strategies. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the formation of successive rings of cambia in Rivea hypocriteriformis Choisy (Convolvulaceae). The mature stem is composed of four to five rings of xylem alternating with phloem. Successive cambia originate as smaller and larger segments; union and anastomosing of small cambial segments often leads {{to the formation of}} discontinuous rings. In the initial stage of growth, several vascular bundles interconnect to form the first ring of vascular cambium. The cambium remains functional for one complete season and becomes dormant during summer; a new ring of cambium is completed prior to the subsequent monsoon season and sprouting of new leaves. Successive cambia are initiated from the pericyclic parenchyma situated three to four cell layers outside of the protophloem. Functionally, all the successive cambia are bidirectional and produce secondary xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally. The secondary xylem is diffuse-porous, with indistinct growth rings and consisting of wide fibriform vessels, fibre tracheids, and <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells. The xylem rays are uni- to multiseriate and heterocellular. The multiseriate rays contain lignified marginal ray cells and thin-walled, unlignified central cells. The central ray cells also show accumulations of starch and druses. Discrete strands of intraxylary phloem occur at the periphery of the pith, and additional intraxylary phloem develops from adjacent cells as secondary growth progresses. Earlier-formed phloem shows heavy accumulation of callose, followed by its compaction.

Here, we document {{for the first time the}} bark anatomy of high-latitude glossopteridalean trees using peels and thin sections made from a Late Permian trunk from Skaar Ridge, Antarctica. The bark is 3 cm thick. The secondary phloem is composed of sieve cells, <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma, and fibers arranged in discontinuous unicellular tangential layers. The outer bark is a rhytidome, with numerous alternating layers of periderm and non-conducting secondary phloem showing some proliferation of the axial parenchyma.

A similar anatomy was observed in bark fragments found isolated in the matrix or closely associated with large glossopterid stems or roots. The anatomy of the Skaar Ridge specimens shows that Antarctic Glossopteridales had a relatively thick, probably stringy bark. The retention of a significant amount of insulating dead bark tissue on the trunklikely provided protection of the cambium, conducting secondary phloem, and potential latent buds against biotic and abiotic environmental hazards (fire, frost, scalding, insects, etc.) and may have contributed to the extensive paleolatitudinal distribution of the Glossopteridales during the Permia...|$|R

Woods of Acanthaceae {{are characterized by}} relatively narrow vessels with simple perforation plates and alternate lateral wall pitting, septate libriform fibers, scanty vasicentric <b>axial</b> parenchyma, <b>rays</b> both multiseriate and uniseriate, erect ray cells abundant in rays (some species rayless or near-rayless), numerous small crystals or cystoliths in ray cells in a few genera (first documented reports of both characters in woods of Acanthaceae), and nonstoried structure. This constellation of features is very closely matched by woods of Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myoporaceae (families listed in order ofdecreasing resemblance). Narrowness ofvessels in tropical Acanthaceae appears related to understory ecology. A few species in warm and seasonally dry areas have narrow, short vessel elements numerous per unit transection. Vasicentric tracheids occur in two nonscandent genera in dry areas. Vessel grouping is roughly proportional to dryness of habitat. Thunbergia alata, T. laurifolia, and all collections of Mendoncia have interxylary phloem (first report for Mendoncia). That feature, plus presence of occasional acicular crystals in <b>rays</b> and <b>axial</b> parenchyma and presence of large gelatinous fibers in phloem ally Mendoncia closely with Thunbergia, and Mendonciaceae is not justified for this and other reasons.

40|$|ABSTRACT Tension wood is an {{important}} anatomical structure for its participation in {{the orientation of the}} trunk and the architecture of the branches as a function of structural reinforcement. However, its presence in large amounts significantly affects the technological properties of wood, just as in the rubber tree. Nevertheless, there is still demand for information about the origin, distribution and structural features in this species. Thus, this study aims to characterize the cellular structures in tension and opposite wood in Hevea brasiliensis (rubber tree), as well as its radial and longitudinal distribution.

Several techniques were employed for the measurements: Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Light Microscope (LM), and the Frankling method (FM). The structure, size, and frequency of both types of the pits varied between compression and opposite wood. Fewer pits of a smaller size and a smaller aperture diameter were observed {{in compression}} wood. The uniseriate arrangement of bordered pit pairs, unpitted tracheid walls, circular- or often slit-like pit aperture, dominantly piceoid but sometimes cupressoid and occasionally taxodioid cross-field pitting, {{and a number of}} fissures on the tracheid walls and bordered pits were characteristics of compression wood...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the structure-from-motion {{problem for a}} highly general imaging model where cameras are modeled as possibly unconstrained sets of projection rays. This allows to describe most existing camera types, including pinhole cameras, sensors with radial or more general distortions, catadioptric cameras (central or non-central), etc. We introduce a hierarchy of general camera models: the most general model has unconstrained projection rays whereas the most constrained model dealt with here is the central model, where all rays pass through a single point. Intermediate models are what we call <b>axial</b> cameras (all <b>rays</b> touch a single line), and x-slit cameras (rays touch two lines). The foundations for a multi-view geometry of completely non-central cameras are given, leading to the formulation of multi-view matching tensors, analogous to the fundamental/essential matrices, trifocal and quadrifocal tensors of perspective cameras. This framework is then specialized explicitly for the two-view case, for the intermediate camera types mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} 16 of the 37 genera within the epacrids (Styphelioideae, Ericaceae s. l.) is {{investigated}} by light and scanning electron microscopy. Several {{features in the}} secondary xylem occur consistently at the tribal level: arrangement of vessel-ray pits, distribution of <b>axial</b> parenchyma, <b>ray</b> width, and the presence and location of crystals. The primitive nature of Prionoteae and Archerieae {{is supported by the}} presence of scalariform perforation plates with many bars and scalariform to opposite vessel pitting. The wood structure of Oligarrheneae {{is similar to that of}} Styphelieae, but the very narrow vessel elements, exclusively uniseriate rays and the lack of prismatic crystals in Oligarrheneae distinguish these two tribes. The secondary xylem of Monotoca tamariscina indicates that it does not fit in Styphelieae; a position within Oligarrheneae is possible. Like most Cosmelieae, all Richeeae are characterized by exclusively scalariform perforation plates with many bars, a very high vessel density and paratracheal parenchyma, although they clearly differ in ray width (exclusively uniseriate rays in Cosmelieae vs. uniseriate and wide multiseriate rays in Richeeae). Several wood anatomical features confirm the inclusion of epacrids in Ericaceae s. l. Furthermore, there are significant ecological implications. The small vessel diameter and high vessel frequency in many epacrids are indicative of a high conductive safety to avoid embolism caused by freeze-thaw cycles, while the replacement of scalariform by simple vessel perforation plates and an increase in vessel diameter would suggest an increased conductive efficiency, which is especially found in mesic temperate or tropical Styphelieae.

30|$|An image dataset of the {{cross-sectional}} optical micrographs of the Lauraceae {{species in}}cluding 39 species in 11 genera, capturing {{at least one}} full annual ring, was investigated by scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), a computer vision-based feature extraction algorithm. We found an image of 900 [*]×[*] 900 -pixel size at a pixel resolution of ca. 3  µm, corresponding to the actual size of 2.65 [*]×[*] 2.65 mm 2, as the minimum requirement for the image dataset {{in terms of the}} accuracy of the recognition at both the genus and species levels. Among the several classifiers investigated, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) presented the best performance reaching a maximum of 89.4 % in the genus with a species identification of approximately  96.3 %. Cluster analysis of all the SIFT descriptors for each image yielded practical information regarding the descriptors; they recognize selectively the cell lumina, cell corners, vessels, and <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells. Therefore, the difference between the genus or species levels was determined per the variation in the quantities of these computer-based properties. Another clustering approach, the hierarchal dendrogram, was applied to visualize the numerical distances between the genus and species. Interestingly, even Machilus and Phoebe, which are difficult to distinguish by conventional visual inspection, are quite distantly classified at the genus level. In contrast, some species in Cinnamomum, Machilus and Litsea were categorized into different subgroups rather than the original genus. Microscopic wood identification is found to be possible at the genus level; however, the numerical dataset of the morphological features has various overlapping clusters, causing the genus-level identification of the Lauraceae to be more difficult than species-level identification.|$|R
40|$|The wood {{products}} sector in Nigeria is currently performing below optimal capacity {{as a result}} of increasing scarcity of economic wood species. In order to adequately cater for products requirement of Nigerians locally, the sector has incorporated lesser used wood species into its stream of raw materials requirement. One of these species commonly found in sawmills and plank depots in the country is Detarium senegalense. As the properties of wood determine its utilization potentials, this study was carried out to determine the wood properties of D. senegalense. The basic density is 610 kg/m 3. This is within the range of the economic species currently used in the {{wood products}} sector. However, the heartwood constitutes only 9. 02 % of the total volume fraction. The sapwood constitutes 75. 98 %, and the bark 15 %. The low percentage of heartwood in contrast with the high volume of sapwood indicated that the wood may not be durable in service. The mean age is 47 years while the mean diameter is 21 cm indicating that it is a small diameter hardwood. The vessels elements, fibres, <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells constitute 9. 28, 31. 4, 30. 6 and 28. 72 % respectively. The number of vessel per mm 3 is 13. 62 while those of fibres are 3301 per mm 3. The relative high proportions of the fibres may have contributed to its high density. The wood and wood products sector of the national economy is currently facing wood shortage problems. According to RMRDC (2010) the total volume of useable wood down to 30 cm cutting diameter in the reserved forest areas is 239, 775, 500...|$|R
40|$|Wood of Caryophyllaceae is {{more diverse}} {{than has been}} appreciated. Imperforate tracheary {{elements}} may be tracheids, fiber-tracheids, or libriform fibers. Rays may be uniseriate only, multiseriate only, or absent. Roots of some species (and sterns of {{a few of those}} same genera) have vascular tissue produced by successive cambia. The diversity in wood anatomy character states shows a range from primitive to specialized so great that origin close to one of the more specialized families of Chenopodiales, such as Chenopodiaceae or Amaranthaceae, is unlikely. Caryophyllaceae probably branched from the ordinal clade near the clade 2 ̆ 7 s base, as cladistic evidence suggests. Raylessness and abrupt onset of multiseriate rays may indicate woodiness in the family is secondary. Successive cambia might also be a subsidiary indicator of secondary woodiness in Caryophyllaceae (although not necessarily dicotyledons at large). Although a small shrub, Gymnocarpos may be primitively woody, and because that genus appears primitive in many wood features the family as a whole may derive from woody ancestors, despite apparent secondary woodiness in many phylads. Systematic distribution of wood character states in the family corresponds closely to the Pax and Hoffmann system of three tribes and their progressive degrees of specialization (Paronychieae, Alsineae, Sileneae). Wood data support the idea that Caryophyllaceae represent a branch from near the base of the order Caryophyllales. Wood of Caryophyllaeeae is highly xeromorphic, comparable in quantitative vessel features to wood of desert shrubs; insular species have less xeromorphic wood. Instances of storying and druse presence in <b>axial</b> and <b>ray</b> parenchyma are newly reported for the family, as is the inverted orientation of xylem, phloem, and periderm produced by a cambium at the periphery of the pith in Dianthus caryophyllus...|$|R
40|$|An {{optical scanner}} for imaging lines in an object plane onto a linear array in a focal plane either {{continuously}} or discretely is described. The scanner {{consists of a}} set of four mutually perpendicularly oriented plane corner mirrors which provide a reflecting path that describes a parallelogram. In addition, there is a plane parallel scanning mirror with a front and back reflecting surface located midway between the first and fourth corner mirrors. It is oriented so that in the mid-scan position it is parallel to the first corner mirror, and therefore perpendicular to the fourth corner mirror. As the scan mirror rotates, rays incident from a plurality of lines in the object plane are selectively directed through the optical system arriving at a common intersection on the back surface of the scanning mirror where the rays are colinearly directed toward a lens and then imaged onto the linear array in the focal plane. A set of compensating mirrors may be introduced just before the imaging lens to compensate for a small and generally negligible path difference delta sub l between the <b>axial</b> and marginal <b>rays...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Just {{as people}} with the same weight can have {{different}} body builds, woods with the same wood density can have different anatomies. Here, {{our aim was to}} assess the magnitude of anatomical variation within a restricted range of wood density and explore its potential ecological implications. Methods: Twig wood of 69 angiosperm tree and shrub species was analyzed. Species were selected so that wood density varied within a relatively narrow range (0. 38 – 0. 62 g cm⁻³). Anatomical traits quantified included wood tissue fractions (fibres, <b>axial</b> parenchyma, <b>ray</b> parenchyma, vessels, and conduits with maximum lumen diameter below 15 μm), vessel properties, and pith area. To search for potential ecological correlates of anatomical variation the species were sampled across rainfall and temperature contrasts, and several other ecologically-relevant traits were measured (plant height, leaf area to sapwood area ratio, and modulus of elasticity). Results: Despite the limited range in wood density, substantial anatomical variation was observed. Total parenchyma fraction varied from 0. 12 to 0. 66 and fibre fraction from 0. 20 to 0. 74, and these two traits were strongly inversely correlated (r = - 0. 86, P < 0. 001). Parenchyma was weakly (0. 24 ≤|r|≤ 0. 35, P < 0. 05) or not associated with vessel properties nor with height, leaf area to sapwood area ratio, and modulus of elasticity (0. 24 ≤|r|≤ 0. 41, P < 0. 05). However, vessel traits were fairly well correlated with height and leaf area to sapwood area ratio (0. 47 ≤|r|≤ 0. 65, all P < 0. 001). Modulus of elasticity was mainly driven by fibre wall plus vessel wall fraction rather than by the parenchyma component. Conclusions: Overall, there seem to be at least three axes of variation in xylem, substantially independent of each other: a wood density spectrum, a fibre-parenchyma spectrum, and a vessel area spectrum. The fibre-parenchyma spectrum does not yet have any clear or convincing ecological interpretation. 25 page(s...|$|R
