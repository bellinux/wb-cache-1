500|$|In the Singapore High Court case of Pillay, the Public Prosecutor appealed {{against a}} magistrate's {{decision}} that rules requiring {{people to pay}} a fee for a permit before driving motor vehicles into {{an area of the}} city designated as the [...] "restricted zone" [...] were ultra vires section 90(1) of the Road Traffic Act, the relevant part of which stated: [...] "The Minister may make rules... generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect...". The respondent submitted that {{the primary purpose of the}} rules was to impose a fee on vehicles entering the restricted zone, and that section 90(1) did not empower the Minister to do so. The Court disagreed, holding that the Act empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic, and the purpose of the rules in question was not fee collection but to alleviate traffic congestion within the restricted zone. The fee imposed was [...] "the means adopted to achieve the desired purpose and is merely incidental thereto". Law professor Thio Li-ann has commented that the Court's judgment, which appears to accept that an <b>administrative</b> <b>measure</b> need not relate directly to the purpose of a statute but may be incidental to it, [...] "effectively gives the public body a great latitude to manoeuvre and formulate means which may have only a bare nexus with the statutory purpose".|$|E

2500|$|Speaking in the Legislative Council on 4 June, Stephen Lam {{defended the}} {{government}} stance. He {{said that the}} Basic Law {{made it clear that}} Principal Officials must be Chinese citizens and Hong Kong permanent residents with no right of abode in a foreign country. He pointed out that deputy directors of bureau were not principal officials, are not appointed by the Central People's Government, and as such are not prohibited from having right-of-abode in a foreign country. He added that even when deputising for Bureau Chiefs in their absence, the acting arrangement is [...] "an <b>administrative</b> <b>measure</b> only" [...] and does not contravene the Basic Law". Donald Tsang said that people returning from emigration have helped make Hong Kong a success; the recruitments were [...] "part of the Government's drive to attract talented people from different backgrounds to provide an efficient and stable civil service". He hoped that the public would accept that the five undersecretaries with foreign right-of-abode, who had renounced those rights were committed to the city, and would put the matter to rest.|$|E
60|$|The {{morning was}} wearing on; {{there were already}} signs of disruption, {{currents}} and eddies in the crowd. Some were seeking {{the shade of the}} walls and under the trees of the Alameda. Horsemen spurred through, shouting; groups of sombreros set level on heads against the vertical sun were drifting away into the streets, where the open doors of pulperias revealed an enticing gloom resounding with the gentle tinkling of guitars. The National Guards were thinking of siesta, and the eloquence of Gamacho, their chief, was exhausted. Later on, when, in the cooler hours of the afternoon, they tried to assemble again for further consideration of public affairs, detachments of Montero's cavalry camped on the Alameda charged them without parley, at speed, with long lances levelled at their flying backs as far as the ends of the streets. The National Guards of Sulaco were surprised by this proceeding. But they were not indignant. No Costaguanero had ever learned to question the eccentricities of a military force. They were part of the natural order of things. This must be, they concluded, some kind of <b>administrative</b> <b>measure,</b> no doubt. But the motive of it escaped their unaided intelligence, and their chief and orator, Gamacho, Commandante of the National Guard, was lying drunk and asleep in the bosom of his family. His bare feet were upturned in the shadows repulsively, {{in the manner of a}} corpse. His eloquent mouth had dropped open. His youngest daughter, scratching her head with one hand, with the other waved a green bough over his scorched and peeling face.|$|E

The improvement project is a financial project based on objective and solid data which contains precautionary measures envisaged to rescue the company.
