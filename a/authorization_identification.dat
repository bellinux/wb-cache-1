40|$|The {{implementation}} of face recognition techniques in an embedded {{system is a}} very important aspect of various security applications, such as <b>authorization</b> <b>identification</b> in cash machines and door access for employee attendance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to survey the existing hardware implementations of a face recognition system, particularly those who used for developing an embedded door access control system. This includes a brief discussion about face recognition algorithms and the hardware platforms outlining the importance of using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device, which can be used to design an embedded door access control system. It is found that the success of any door access control system depends on the type of face recognition algorithm in the feature extraction phase of the face recognition system and the selected hardware device. Based on a comparison between different feature extraction algorithms, the use of a hybrid feature extraction technique can improve the accuracy of face recognition system. An efficient door access control system can be obtained using a FPGA device, which is preferable because of its technical characteristics of parallelism, re-programmability and very high speed, in the {{implementation of}} a face recognition system...|$|E

40|$|Background: The European chemicals' {{legislation}} REACH aims {{to protect}} {{man and the}} environment from substances of very high concern (SVHC). Chemicals like endocrine disruptors (EDs) {{may be subject to}} <b>authorization.</b> <b>Identification</b> of (potential) EDs with regard to the environment is limited because specific experimental assessments are not standard requirements under REACH. Evidence is based on a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments (if available), expert judgement, and structural analogy with known EDs. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to review and refine structural alerts for the indication of potential estrogenic and androgenic endocrine activities based on in vitro studies; to analyze in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies with regard to estrogen- and androgen-sensitive endpoints in order to identify potential indicators for endocrine activity with regard to the environment; to assess the consistency of potential estrogenic and androgenic endocrine activities based on in vitro assays and in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies and fish life-cycle tests; and to evaluate structural alerts, in vitro assays, and in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies for the indication of potential estrogenic and androgenic endocrine disruptors in fish. Results: Screening for potential endocrine activities in fish via estrogenic and androgenic modes of action based on structural alerts provides similar information as in vitro receptor-mediated assays. Additional evidence can be obtained from in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies. Conclusive confirmation is possible with fish lifecycle tests. Application of structural alerts to the more than 33, 000 discrete organic compounds of the EINECS inventory indicated 3585 chemicals (approx. 11 %) as potential candidates for estrogenic and androgenic effects that should be further investigated. Endocrine activities of the remaining substances cannot be excluded; however, because the structural alerts perform much better for substances with (very) high estrogenic and androgenic activities, there is reasonable probability that the most hazardous candidates have been identified. Conclusions: The combination of structural alerts, in vitro receptor-based assays, and in vivo mammalian studies may support the priority setting for further assessments of chemicals with potential environmental hazards due to estrogenic and androgenic activities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Grid portals are an {{increasingly}} popular mechanism for creating customizable, Web-based interfaces to Grid services and resources. Due to the powerful, general-purpose nature of Grid technology, {{the security of}} any portal or entry point to such resources cannot be taken lightly, particularly if the portal is running inside of the trusted perimeter, such as a Science Gateway running on an SDSC machine {{for access to the}} TeraGrid. To assess potential vulnerabilities of the current state of Grid portal security, we undertake a comparative analysis of the three most popular Grid portal frameworks that are being pursued as frontends to the TeraGrid: GridSphere, OGCE and Clarens. We explore general challenges that Grid portals face in the areas of authentication (including user <b>identification),</b> <b>authorization,</b> auditing (logging) and session management then contrast how the different Grid portal implementations address these challenges. We find that although most Grid portals address these security concerns to a certain extent, there is still room for improvement, particularly in the areas of secure default configurations and comprehensive logging and auditing support. We conclude with specific recommendations for designing, implementing and configuring secure Grid portals. I...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{smart cards}} with {{integrated}} silicon dies have found wide application for personal <b>authorization,</b> security <b>identification</b> and payment systems. As a consequence, {{the complexity of}} electronics is increasing, thus, specifically adapted failure analysis methods and work flows are required taking the peculiarities of smart card constructions with embedded chips {{as well as the}} used polymer materials into account. The aim of the paper is to present results of developing novel methods for non-destructive defect detection as well as for selective, artifact-poor target preparation routines specifically adapted for smart card systems. These methods allow fault localization and exposing defect areas for subsequent high resolution failure analysis within reliability investigations. As for non-destructive diagnostics, specific focus was given to the evaluation and application development of Lock-in thermography (LIT) as a method to detect thermally active failures such as increased contact resistivity, shorts or leakage currents. It could be shown that Lock-in thermography can be successfully applied for fault isolation of defects within the card and on the semiconductor surface. The LIT investigations were complemented by Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) in order to find delamination and chip cracks. New signal processing methods of ultrasonic microscopy resulted in a reliable detection of these mechanical damages. Scanning Acoustic Microscopy in the GHz frequency (GHz-SAM) domain was applied for investigations on chip level. Contact-induced mechanical damage just below the only few micrometer thick optically non-transparent passivation of the IC could be detected with high lateral resolution. However, for a detailed root cause analysis of the failures localized either by Lock-in thermography or Scanning Acoustic Microscopy, further adequate preparation routines are necessary to get direct access to the failure site. Within the study, a selective exposure of the semiconductor chips from the composite laminate was achieved by laser ablation after optimizing laser frequencies and pulse widths as well as by adapted wet chemical procedures. Efficient cross section preparation was enabled by ion beam finish. A case study on how the methods can be applied for failure analysis of smart cards will be demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} mobile devices applications {{in daily life}} activities such as payments, <b>identification,</b> <b>authorization</b> and access control represents a new challenge from the security perspective, since private or sensitive data is being used in an untrusted environment (the mobile device). In this sense, one of the objectives of mobile computing for the near future is to make mobile devices suitable for security-sensitive applications. Since the past decades, secure microcontrollers have been successfully implemented to create smartcards, which {{have been used to}} secure banking, transport, access and identification cards. Today, the smartcards have evolved to Secure Elements to be integrated in smartphones, wearables, IoT nodes, and all kind of mobile devices. Secure Elements are computing units encapsulated in an integrated circuit that are capable of securely host and execute applications, store cryptographic material and perform cryptographic operations in a secure environment. The success of Secure Elements is based on their capability to act as physical root of trust for applications and services that require high degree of security in a resource constrained device. In the near future, the massive integration of secure element in mobile devices will enable new kind of security-critical applications to be performed by mobile devices ensuring privacy, authenticity and integrity of data. Identification and passports will be securely embedded in mobile devices, wallet applications will be extensively used, access control to multi-owner vehicles, ticketing, transportation, authentication of IoT nodes, authorization of vehicles in low-emission zones, and all kind of applications requiring secure storage and tamper protection will become feasible from the security point of view. Secure Elements are currently integrated in mobile devices through UICC cards, embedded chips soldered to the mother board or to some extent, smartSD cards. They can be accessed directly through the NFC interface or through the application processor. When the SE is accessed through the NFC interface the communications are routed through the NFC controller, without intervention of the mobile operating system. When the communication is performed from an application running in the application processor, the application require system level permissions that are not usually given to regular applications. Therefore, access to secure elements is currently controlled by a few players and not widely open to application developers, researchers or academics. Nevertheless, there is still a broad field of study around secure elements. This work address several sources of uncertainty around secure elements, including communication interfaces and protocols, development platforms and key capabilities of secure elements which are currently available in the market. The conclusions derived from this work reaffirm that secure elements are promising solutions to secure mobile devices, relying in software and hardware mechanisms to guarantee the desired security properties...|$|R
