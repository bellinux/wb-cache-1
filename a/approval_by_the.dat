50|$|Within the Courts, the EFS allows {{electronic}} {{documents to}} be automatically routed {{to the appropriate}} registry staff for processing. The system allows further routing within the courts e.g. for <b>approvals</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Duty Registrar and a reply is then sent out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Registry staff which is routed back to the originating LF. This has enabled realisations of improvements in efficiency by minimising paper flow to shorten case processing time. Fees payable <b>by</b> <b>the</b> LFs for filing documents to Court are deducted automatically <b>by</b> <b>the</b> EFS. The whole process is fast, convenient and efficient.|$|R

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941, when the Armored Force expanded, an urgent need for {{self-propelled}} artillery arose. Although a full-track chassis was preferred, the situation required the use of whatever vehicles were immediately available. The M3 Half-track was selected to carry a 105mm M2A1 howitzer. Although this design had originally been suggested in September 1941, {{it had not been}} taken up. However, the urgency of the requirement resulted in the <b>approval</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T19.|$|E

As a result, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Bulgaria that forced the Ministry to withdraw the positive environmental assessment of the Master Plan in 2010 but the decision was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court.

5|$|The {{original}} constitution made {{no provision}} for a vacancy {{in the office of}} the lieutenant governor; in the event of the lieutenant governor's death or resignation, the lieutenant governorship usually remained vacant until the end of the term.

This appointment was challenged in court, and ruled valid in the case State ex rel. Martin v. Ekern. In 1979 the constitution was amended to explicitly allow this: in the event of a vacancy {{in the office of the}} lieutenant governor, the governor nominates a candidate who becomes lieutenant governor for the remainder of the term upon his <b>approval</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Wisconsin Assembly and Wisconsin State Senate.|$|E
