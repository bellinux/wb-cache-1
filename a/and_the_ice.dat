5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> becomes more transparent.|$|E

After this, Takua is threatened by Makuta, and abandons Jaller {{in an attempt to}} shield him. Makuta then releases three more Rakhshi, who attack the Earth village of Onu-Koro as Takua arrives. Tahu, Kopaka, Lewa and Gali arrive to help the Earth Toa Onua and the Stone Toa Pohatu: during the battle, Tahu is further corrupted and goes insane, forcing the Toa to capture him and flee. Takua decides to rejoin Jaller, while Gali and the other Toa purge the Rakhshi poison from Tahu, resulting in his reconciliation with Gali.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that a panmictic (random mating) wolf population, with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America, existed until {{the closing of the}} ice sheets, after which the southern wolves became isolated, and only the Beringian wolf existed north of the sheets. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000YBP, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheets receded 12,000—6,000YBP. The Beringian wolf became extinct, and the southern wolves expanded through the shrinking ice sheets to recolonize the northern part of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century due to eradication.|$|E

5|$|The Rage {{began the}} 2011–12 {{season with the}} NAHL's Showcase Tournament in Michigan where they lost to the Corpus Christi Ice Rays and the Kalamazoo Jr. K-Wings but beat the Michigan Warriors, before ending with a loss to the Coulee Region Chill. They started with a 3–7 record, winning {{two out of three}} games against the Minot Minotauros but then losing two games against the Monsters in Fresno and two games against the Bismarck Bobcats in Dawson Creek. Trying to add scoring, they {{acquired}} Shawn Mueller from the Chilliwack Chiefs. They fell to 5-13-1 after splitting a series in Minot, losing in Bismarck, and splitting a series against the Alaska Avalanche back in Dawson Creek. Between mid-November and the mid-season break the team played a 12-game road trip, spending the first two weekends in Alaska and the next two in Wenatchee and Fresno, and entered the break last in their division with a 7-24-2 overall record. They acquired defenceman Zach Ovics from the Nanaimo Clippers and goalie Paul Bourbeau from the Kenai River Brown Bears. In a January–February 11 game homestand, the Rage only won 2 games, falling to 9-32-3, as they lost three to the Wild (all shut outs), two each to the Monsters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Dogs, and split their series against the Avalanche and Brown Bears. The team's struggles continued, losing two games each to the Monsters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Dogs. Against the Wild, they lost all three games in their homestand which ended with brawl. They ended the season going 1–2 in both Kenai River and Wenatchee and splitting the series against the Alaska Avalanche, 1-1-1. They played their last home game in mid-March losing to the Wenatchee Wild and ending the game with brawl. The Rage ended their season with a road trip, losing both three-game series 2–1 in Kenai River and then Wenatchee. Three players were sent to the NAHL's Top Prospects Showcase: Scott Fellnermayr, Luke Ripley and Josh Hartley.|$|E

5|$|The product {{claimed to}} be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It was preceded by The End of History, a 55% Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had {{previously}} made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.|$|E

5|$|General panic now {{seized the}} Allied army and it {{abandoned}} {{the field in}} all possible directions. A famous episode occurred during this retreat: Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. French artillery pounded towards the men, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> was broken due to the bombardment. The men drowned in the cold ponds, dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down with them. Estimates of how many guns were captured differ: {{there may have been}} as few as 38 or more than 100. Sources also differ about casualties, with figures ranging between 200 and 2,000 dead. Many drowning Russians were saved by their victorious foes. However, local evidence, only later made public, suggests that Napoleon's account of the catastrophe may have been totally invented; on his instructions the lakes were drained {{a few days after the}} battle and the corpses of only two or three men, with some 150 horses, were found.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 season saw {{a number}} of changes to the make-up of Asia League. In the off-season, the Golden Amur withdrew from the league due to {{financial}} trouble. At {{the same time it}} was announced that Kangwon Land was showing interest in entering a team in the league. However, only a few weeks later, they withdrew their application because it was felt their team wasn't strong enough to enter the league. The league also revised the limits on the number of imports some teams were allowed to have. Halla <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> Bucks were both allowed to carry an additional import player while the two Chinese teams were permitted two more import players. It was announced in July 2005 that Anyang Halla Winia would change their name to Anyang Halla. In late July, the league announced that Kangwon Land had acquired some imports and strengthened the team. They had applied again and were expected to enter the league that season. As well another new team, the Nordic Vikings, was expected to join the league. The Nordic Vikings were a Swedish-Chinese joint venture that saw the team based in Beijing. As part of the venture, Swedish players were also sent to the two existing Chinese teams. This brought the league to its high point of nine teams. Even though there were more teams than in the previous season the league reduced the number of games from 42 to 38, which resulted in an uneven schedule. For example, the Korean teams played nine games against each other, while playing four games against the teams from Japan and China except the Nordic Vikings, whom they played five times. At the end of the regular season, the Nippon Paper Cranes had captured first place for a {{second year in a row}} with 95 points. While the Cranes had a very strong showing in the point rankings, the top goal scorer was Song Dong-hwan from Anyang Halla with 31. Derek Plante led in assists with 47 and overall points with 75. The top six teams advanced to the playoffs with the top two teams, the Cranes and Halla, receiving a bye to the semi-finals. In the first round, Kokudo swept the Ice Bucks while Oji Paper defeated the Vikings three games to one. In the second round Kokudo faced Halla, who were making their playoff debut. Kokudo won that series three games to one. On the other side, the Cranes faced off against Oji Paper and swept them in three games. The final was again the Cranes vs Kokudo and once again Kokudo emerged victorious, claiming the title for the second year in a row. Kokudo had three players claiming the three top points spots for the playoffs. Joel Prpic was the top goal scorer with nine, Kiyoshi Fujita had the most assists with 12 and Takahito Suzuki had the most points with 18. Kikuchi Naoya won MVP of the year for the second time and Young Guy of the Year went to Masahito Nishiwaki of the Cranes.|$|E
