25|$|The largest {{monolith}} lifted by cranes was the 108t {{heavy corner}} cornice block of the Jupiter temple at Baalbek, {{followed by an}} <b>architrave</b> <b>block</b> weighing 63t, {{both of which were}} raised to a height of about 19m. The capital block of Trajan's Column, with a weight of 53.3t, was even lifted to c. 34m above the ground. As such enormous loads far exceeded the lifting capability of any single treadwheel crane, it is assumed that Roman engineers set up a four-masted lifting tower in the midst of which the stone blocks were vertically raised by the means of capstans placed on the ground around it.|$|E
2500|$|Roughly {{beginning}} with the erection of the older Artemision of Ephesos around 550 BC the quantity of archaeological remains of Ionic temples increases. The Artemision was planned as a dipteros, its architect Theodoros {{had been one of}} the builders of the Samian Heraion. With a substructure of 55 × 115 m, the Artemision outscaled all precedents. Its cella was executed as unroofed internal peristyle courtyard, the so-called sekos. The building was entirely of marble. The temple was considered as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, which may be justified, considering the efforts involved in its construction. [...] The columns stood on ephesian bases, 36 of them were decorated with life-sized friezes of human figures at the bottom of the shaft, the so-called columnae caelatae. The columns had between 40 and 48 flutings, some of them cut to alternate between a wider and a narrower fluting. The oldest marble architraves of Greek architecture, found at the Artemision, also spanned the widest distances ever achieved in pure stone. The middle <b>architrave</b> <b>block</b> was 8.74 m long and weighed 24 metric tons; it had to be lifted to its final position, 20 m above ground, with a system of pulleys. Like its precedents, the temple used differentiated column widths in the front, and had a higher number of columns at the back. According to ancient sources, Kroisos was one of the sponsors. An inscription referring to his sponsorship was indeed found on one of the columns. The temple was burnt down by Herostratos in 356 BC and reerected soon thereafter. For the replacement, a crepidoma of ten or more steps was erected. Older Ionic temples normally lacked a specific visible substructure. This emphasised basis had to be balanced out be a heightened entablature, producing not only a visual contrast to, but also a major weight upon the slender columns.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} {{stones were}} laid on 27 June 1852, {{on the occasion}} of which a celebratory Mass by Bishop Peter Josef Blum and Vicar-General Klein was said. A stone plaque with the yeardate 1852 over the sandstone <b>architrave</b> <b>block</b> facing Pfortenstraße still witnesses this event. After about two years, the church, albeit still without a steeple, could be consecrated by Bishop Blum on 19 November 1854.|$|E
5000|$|The {{buildings}} were constructed {{in a very}} plain style. The uniform design of the one and two storied buildings includes continuous cornices and <b>architrave</b> <b>blocks</b> and gabled roofs. Only the buildings of the Corps de logis have a mansard roof. [...] The buildings only impress by their size. The {{right side of the}} main complex of buildings has a length of 1,250 meters, thus creating the largest country palace of Europe.|$|R
50|$|However, {{numerous}} extant Roman buildings which feature much heavier stone blocks {{than those}} {{handled by the}} polyspastos indicate that the overall lifting capability of the Romans went far beyond that of any single crane. At the temple of Jupiter at Baalbek, for instance, the <b>architrave</b> <b>blocks</b> weigh up to 60 tons each, and one corner cornice block even over 100 tons, all of them raised to a height of about 19 m. In Rome, the capital block of Trajan's Column weighs 53.3 tons, {{which had to be}} lifted to a height of about 34 m (see construction of Trajan's Column).|$|R
5000|$|A gutta (Latin pl. guttae, [...] "drops") {{is a small}} water-repelling, {{cone-shaped}} projection used in the architrave of the Doric {{order in}} classical architecture. At {{the top of the}} <b>architrave</b> <b>blocks,</b> a row of six guttae below the narrow projection of the taenia (fillet) and cymatium formed an element called a regula. A regula was aligned under each triglyph of the Doric frieze. In addition, the underside of the projecting geison above the frieze had rectangular protrusions termed mutules that each had three rows of six guttae. These mutules were aligned above each triglyph and each metope.|$|R
50|$|A {{stretch of}} the city wall stands 6 m high (in fact, the terrace wall of the shrine); inside it are a few ruined and unidentifiable buildings, {{as well as a}} row of a dozen large vaulted {{underground}} chambers, apparently storerooms. There are also Byzantine structures. Outside the city a series of ruined terraces mark the site of the Doric temple of Artemis, which dates {{from the time of the}} Hecatomnids: an <b>architrave</b> <b>block</b> has been found bearing a dedication by Idrieus. Numerous other inscriptions abound.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{monolith}} lifted by {{a single}} crane can be determined from the characteristic lewis iron holes (each of which points at the use of one crane) in the lifted stone block. By dividing its weight by their number, one arrives at a maximum lifting capacity of 7.5 to 8t as exemplified by a cornice block at the Trajan's Forum and the <b>architrave</b> <b>blocks</b> of the Temple of Jupiter at Baalbek. Based on a detailed Roman relief of a construction crane, the engineer O'Connor calculates a slightly less lifting capability, 6.2t, for such a type of treadwheel crane, {{on the assumption that}} it was powered by five men and using a three-pulley block.|$|R
50|$|Access to {{the first}} floor is via an elegant timber {{staircase}} with walls and balustrades of paneled timber. A round handrail is fixed with brackets to the balustrade and follows the curve of the staircase. Treads and risers are lined with carpet. Natural light enters the stairwell through the large arched leadlight window which is framed by wall mounted Art Deco light fittings. The vaulted ceiling over the stair is simply detailed and forms an archway to the upper vestibule. The upper level vestibule has walls lined with hard plaster and timber-paneling. Plaster ceilings have moulded plaster cornices. Timber skirting boards, <b>architraves</b> <b>architrave</b> <b>blocks</b> are intact throughout the room and all interior timber work and joinery has a varnished finish. Internal openings are generous in height and doors feature tall glazed pivoting fanlights. The first floor offices have varnished joinery including doors, architraves and picture rails and unusual decorative pelmets. Skirtings in these rooms have been painted.|$|R
50|$|It {{is assumed}} that Roman {{engineers}} lifted these extraordinary weights by two measures (see picture below for comparable Renaissance technique): First, as suggested by Heron, a lifting tower was set up, whose four masts were arranged {{in the shape of}} a quadrangle with parallel sides, not unlike a siege tower, but with the column in the middle of the structure (Mechanica 3.5). Second, a multitude of capstans were placed on the ground around the tower, for, although having a lower leverage ratio than treadwheels, capstans could be set up in higher numbers and run by more men (and, moreover, by draught animals). This use of multiple capstans is also described by Ammianus Marcellinus (17.4.15) in connection with the lifting of the Lateranense obelisk in the Circus Maximus (ca. 357 AD). The maximum lifting capability of a single capstan can be established by the number of lewis iron holes bored into the monolith. In case of the Baalbek <b>architrave</b> <b>blocks,</b> which weigh between 55 and 60 tons, eight extant holes suggest an allowance of 7.5 ton per lewis iron, that is per capstan. Lifting such heavy weights in a concerted action required a great amount of coordination between the work groups applying the force to the capstans.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building is divided, into two stories. The first floor is a single large room, now used to display artifacts which illustrate {{the history of the}} town of Webster. The room is entered through a vestibule inside the front door, from which two flights of stairs rise to the second floor. Opposite the door is a raised desk of unpainted pine, with paneled ends which enclose a box pew that served as a moderator's podium for town meetings. Around the perimeter of the original gallery location, turned pine posts in the form of Tuscan columns with low pedestals and square <b>architrave</b> <b>blocks</b> rise to support the gallery flooring. The ceilings beneath the galleries reflect the pitched flooring of the latter, rising from the gallery columns to the outer walls of the building. These ceilings, like the walls of the first floor, are plastered; the heavy oak posts of the frame project forward beyond the planes of the walls. The central portion of the ceiling of the first floor is un-plastered. This was originally an open area within the perimeter of the gallery, and is framed with heavy bridging joists which support a series of closely spaced floor joists of square section. The first floor, originally the main floor of the meeting house auditorium and after 1844 the Webster town hall, is today filled with museum displays.|$|R
