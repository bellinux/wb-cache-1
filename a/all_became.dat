5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or <b>all</b> <b>became</b> extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1960s, the Supremes {{achieved}} mainstream {{success with}} Ross as lead singer and Holland-Dozier-Holland as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. Ross left {{to pursue a}} solo career in 1970 {{and was replaced by}} Jean Terrell, at which point the group's name reverted to The Supremes. After 1972, the lineup changed more frequently; Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene <b>all</b> <b>became</b> members of the group during the mid-1970s. The Supremes disbanded in 1977 after 18 years.|$|E
5|$|Hanson {{eventually}} dropped out, {{but with}} the financial success of My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), P. J. Hogan entered discussions with Warner Bros. to direct in January 1998. Mike Myers signed on to replace Sean Penn, who vacated the lead role. However, negotiations with Hogan fell through; Sam Mendes, David Fincher and Darren Aronofsky <b>all</b> <b>became</b> interested in taking over the director's position. Fincher and Myers were ing production for Confessions in April 2000 but Fincher dropped out and, by that October, Brian De Palma was attached to direct with Renaissance Pictures co-financing. Later that month, Warner Bros. put the project in turnaround, and Myers lost interest. Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Edward Norton had also been attached to the film in the early development stages.|$|E

5|$|Hypogeomys australis {{is one of}} {{only three}} extinct rodents known from Madagascar (the others are Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis and Nesomys narindaensis from northwestern Madagascar). In general, few small animals became extinct on Madagascar, except for these rodents, two species of Plesiorycteropus, and the shrew tenrec Microgale macpheei; in contrast, large animals such as subfossil lemurs, the {{carnivore}} Cryptoprocta spelea, Malagasy hippopotamuses, Dipsochelys tortoises, and Aepyornis and Mullerornis birds <b>all</b> <b>became</b> extinct around the time that humans arrived.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, amid rising {{political}} tension, the French Republic {{declared war}} on Great Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. At sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Western Approaches and the English Channel <b>all</b> <b>became</b> areas of significant naval activity as French privateers sailed on raiding cruises against British merchant shipping. To augment these attacks, the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes. To counter these operations, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea, sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others {{probably}} <b>all</b> <b>became</b> extinct {{due to a}} combination of excessive hunting and deforestation. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene parrot itself is uncertain. In 1834, the German zoologist and author Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene parrot in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The bird must have been very old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The IUCN Red List accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen.|$|E

5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 marks {{a departure}} from the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk sound. These elements were inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members <b>all</b> <b>became</b> fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the local {{elections}} were announced the following day; the remaining councils under Labour control <b>all</b> <b>became</b> Conservative-controlled. The projected national vote shares predicted that the Conservatives achieved 38% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats 28% and Labour 23%. In the aftermath of these results, Brown reshuffled his cabinet amidst some pressure on his leadership. Further pressure followed the {{results of the}} European parliamentary elections, which were announced on 7 June. These showed large declines in the Labour Party's vote. The far-right British National Party won seats in North West England and Yorkshire and the Humberits first ever seats won in a national election.|$|E

5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays <b>all</b> <b>became</b> prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names <b>all</b> <b>became</b> official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Lanier, Tomjanovich, Cowens and Issel <b>all</b> <b>became</b> {{head coaches}} after ending their playing career. Lanier was the interim {{head coach of}} the Golden State Warriors in the 1995. Tomjanovich coached two NBA teams, the Houston Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers. He coached the Rockets for 12 seasons, leading them to the NBA {{championship}} twice in 1994 and 1995. He also coached the United States national basketball team to a gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games. Cowens started his coaching career as a player-coach with the Celtics during the 1978–79 season, before returning to a full-time player in the next season. He later coached two more NBA teams, most recently with the Golden State Warriors. Issel coached the Denver Nuggets for six seasons in two separate three-year stints. Two other players drafted also went on to have coaching careers in the NBA: 40th pick Gar Heard and 125th pick George Irvine.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the operation, {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Dieppe had placed the German occupying forces on a high state of alert, and this {{ultimately}} contributed to Aquatint's failure. The commandos were also unable to identify their correct landing place due to the darkness. Within minutes of landing, the raiding party was ambushed by a German patrol and forced {{to try to reach}} their Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) transport. The MTB was located and engaged by the German shore batteries, which damaged one of its engines. It was forced to withdraw, leaving the commandos behind. At the end of the raid those commandos who had not been killed <b>all</b> <b>became</b> prisoners of war. Only five of the raiding force would survive the war; one was killed in captivity and the fate of the other two is uncertain.|$|E
