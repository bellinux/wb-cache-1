[...] "'It was the great divide of modern blues, {{the point at which the}} music was rescued from {{slipping}} into derivative obscurity'".

[...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Instead of pumping up the plot with recycled manufactured thrills, it's content to contemplate two reasonably sane adults who get themselves into an almost insoluble dilemma." [...] In the Los Angeles Times, the critic Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "The only performer who manages to get inside her character is Lane. Whether it's her initial half-distrustful tentativeness, her later sensual abandon or her never-ending ambivalence, Lane's Constance seems to be actually living the role in a way no one else matches, a way we can all connect to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The bonfires {{were also}} used in divination rituals. In 18th century Ochtertyre, a ring of stones—one for each person—was laid round the fire, perhaps on a layer of ashes. Everyone then ran round it with a torch, [...] "exulting". In the morning, the stones were {{examined}} and if any was mislaid {{it was said that}} the person it represented would not live out the year. A similar custom was observed in north Wales and in Brittany. James Frazer says that this may come from [...] "an older custom of actually burning them" [...] (i.e. human sacrifice) or may have always been symbolic. Divination has likely {{been a part of the}} festival since ancient times, and it has survived in some rural areas. At household festivities throughout the Gaelic regions and Wales, there were many rituals intended to divine the future of those gathered, especially with regard to death and marriage. Apples and hazelnuts were often used in these divination rituals or games. In Celtic mythology, apples were strongly associated with the Otherworld and immortality, while hazelnuts were associated with divine wisdom. One of the most common games was apple bobbing. Another involved hanging a small wooden rod from the ceiling at head height, with a lit candle on one end and an apple hanging from the other. The rod was spun round and everyone took turns to try to catch the apple with their teeth. Apples were peeled in one long strip, the peel tossed over the shoulder, and its shape was said to form the first letter of the future spouse's name. Two hazelnuts were roasted near a fire; one named for the person roasting them and the other for the person they desired. If the nuts jumped away from the heat, it was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>sign,</b> but if the nuts roasted quietly it foretold a good match. [...] Items were hidden in food—usually a cake, barmbrack, cranachan, champ or sowans—and portions of it served out at random. A person's future was foretold by the item they happened to find; for example a ring meant marriage and a coin meant wealth. A salty oatmeal bannock was baked; the person ate it in three bites and then went to bed in silence without anything to drink. This was said to result in a dream in which their future spouse offers them a drink to quench their thirst. Egg whites were dropped in water, and the shapes foretold the number of future children. Children would also chase crows and divine some of these things from the number of birds or the direction they flew.|$|E

Yet, he mentioned that his production house was happy that they lost only on giving an excellent film, not a poor one.

Extraurinary symptoms and signs were as follows: pyrexia, general malaise, anorexia, loss of weight, gastrointestinal disorder, varicocele, metastatic signs, anemia, polycythemia, increased sedimentation rate, hypercalcemia, dysproteinemia and impaired liver function. 2. Twenty-two patients out of 78 (28. 2 %) visited the hospital with initial symptoms outside the urinary tract. Six of them were due to metastasis. 3. Pyrexia was noted in 29 cases (37. 2 %). One of them came {{to the hospital with}} pyrexia as a sole symptom. Pyrexia was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> prognostic <b>sign.</b> 4. Thirty cases (10. 3 %) showed general malaise, anorexia or loss of weight. Varicocele was seen in 6 (7. 7 %) and matastatic symptoms werenoted in 9 (11. 5 %). Anemia was seen in 14 cases (17. 9 %), whereas polycythemia was noted in only one case (1. 3 %). Increased sedimentation rate was noted in 48 cases (61. 5 %) and it was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> prognostic <b>sign.</b> Hypercalcemia was seen in 8 cases (11. 9 %) without bone metastasisi n 3 of them. Serum protein was characterized by decreased albumin and increased α 2 -globulin andγ-globulin. As to their subfractions, there were marked increase of haptoglobin and decreased prealbumin, α 2 -HS-glycoprotein, transferrin and increasing tendency of α 1 -antitrypsin, α 1 -acid-glycoprotein and ceruloplasmin. Increased alkaline phosphatase level wasseen in 13, and 9 of which were free of bone metastasis suggesting impaired liver function. 5. Return to the normal state of fever, hypercalcemia and impaired liver function after operation meant the complete removal of neoplasm. Reappearance of these prognostic parameters strongly suggested recurrence or metastasis of tumor. As conclusion, in renal cell carcinoma, frequent appearance of extraurinary symptoms and signs must be kept in mind and correctly evaluated.
