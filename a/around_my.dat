It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled <b>around</b> <b>my</b> career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|Despite Kỳ and Đức's media event, it {{appeared}} that Phát and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in Mỹ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, and threatening {{to break away from}} the Saigon regime by overseeing the area <b>around</b> <b>Mỹ</b> Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton was reported to have threatened to cut the main highway from Saigon into Mỹ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was thought he had no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. Kỳ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Khánh had the plotters taken into custody. Đức, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Phát, who returned to Saigon to turn himself in. A trial was then scheduled. Khánh removed three of the four corps commanders and six of the nine division commanders for failing to move against Phát and Đức.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues <b>around</b> <b>my</b> own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and understanding. So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it and do what I thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E

But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

500|$|The {{themes of}} the album are {{reflected}} in the album cover designed by Alexander McQueen. Björk approached McQueen explaining to him the person who wrote Homogenics songs was someone who [...] "had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with love.

500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make my way down the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way <b>around</b> <b>my</b> face.

500|$|Perfectionist is {{a concept}} album which focusses on how perfectionism {{influences}} Kills. [...] "All the songs revolve <b>around</b> <b>my</b> ambition, celebrations, frustration and disappointments of being a perfectionist", she stated. [...] "I think we're all perfectionists – we're all looking for the best to fulfil our ideologies and dreams." [...] Kills was also inspired by [...] "women's obsession" [...] with fashion in general. She described the album's sound as [...] "dark pop" [...] due to its [...] "opinionated" [...] and [...] "confrontational" [...] lyrics which, according to her, differ from mainstream music. The lyrical content is occasionally comical and uses metaphors frequently.|$|E

As he strode off I threw over his head a little black shawl which was <b>around</b> <b>my</b> own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E
500|$|Barr became outraged {{when she}} watched the first episode of Roseanne and noticed that in the credits, Williams was listed as creator. [...] She told Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "We built the show <b>around</b> <b>my</b> actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing". [...] In the same interview, Werner said, [...] "I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is {{something}} legislated by the Writers Guild, and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters." [...] During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.|$|E

That summer of 1961 Shankly signed Ian St John from Motherwell and Ron Yeats from Dundee United. ‘Take a walk <b>around</b> <b>my</b> centre-half, gentlemen, he’s a colossus!’ Shankly said to the press conference when announcing Yeats’ arrival.

500|$|The {{songs of}} Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are {{intended}} to hang together conceptually, with {{the two halves of}} the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] than the band's previous records. However, Billy Corgan has also said that the album is based on [...] "the human condition of mortal sorrow". Corgan aimed the album's message at people aged 14 to 24 years, hoping [...] "to sum up all the things I felt as a youth but was never able to voice articulately." [...] He summed up by stating, [...] "I'm waving goodbye to me in the rear view mirror, tying a knot <b>around</b> <b>my</b> youth and putting it under the bed." ...|$|E
