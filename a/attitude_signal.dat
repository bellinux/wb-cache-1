50|$|Some {{partnerships}} {{agree in}} advance to play Upside Down Count and Attitude (UDCA). With this agreement, the standard count and <b>attitude</b> <b>signals</b> are inverted: when <b>signaling</b> <b>attitude,</b> a low card is encouraging and a high card is discouraging; when signaling count high-low shows odd count, low-high shows even count.|$|R
50|$|Caution: UDCA, as {{the name}} states, applies to count and <b>attitude</b> <b>signals</b> only. Suit {{preference}} signals are played standard. Also, your leads (as opposed to signals) are unchanged—you still lead high from a doubleton, for example, barring another special agreement to the contrary.|$|R
50|$|Suppose declarer {{is drawing}} trumps {{and you are}} out on the third round. Your discard should be an <b>attitude</b> <b>signal</b> for partner. If you play a high diamond, for example, you ask partner to lead {{diamonds}} if she should gain the lead. Normally, you would have an honor or honors in diamonds in this case. If you play a low diamond, you ask partner to not lead diamonds if she should gain the lead. Partner will usually {{be able to figure}} out which of the other suits you do like (if any).|$|E
50|$|When {{following}} suit on partner's lead (complement to {{the attitude}} signal): In situations where partner {{has made an}} opening lead and an <b>attitude</b> <b>signal</b> would not be meaningful, such as when dummy displays a singleton or void in the suit being led, a suit preference signal is used to indicate which {{of the other two}} suits to lead - excluding trumps and the suit originally led. The signal can also be useful when a switch to a side suit is not desired, since there are hands in which continuing the original suit or switching to a trump {{is the right thing to}} do. In this case, a middle card is often used to indicate this situation, but it can be hard to read.|$|E
40|$|When {{a rocket}} is launched, {{there is a}} short initial period of {{acceleration}} during which the rocket is unstable. As the flight velocity increases, the aerodynamic forces acting on the fins and stabilizers become large enough to give stability. Various methods have been employed to stabilize the rocket during this launching period. Guide rails, "zero length" launchers, booster rockets which produce high initial acceleration, and auto-pilot controlled nozzles are typical devices that have been used. This is {{an investigation of the}} requirements of a nozzle control which would stabilize the rocket during the launching period. The configuration investigated is unique in that the nozzle of the rocket is mounted as a compound pendulum, and the movement of the pendulum is utilized to furnish the signal for the nozzle control servo-mechanism, thereby eliminating the need for gyroscopic elements in the control system. The pendulum motion of the nozzle caused by a change in flight attitude of the rocket is introduced into a computer which produces an output signal proportional to the attitude of the rocket. This <b>attitude</b> <b>signal</b> is fed back to the nozzle control, which positions the nozzle. The results of the analysis showed that the rocket was unstable during the take-off period when the nozzle control acted on the rocket <b>attitude</b> <b>signal</b> alone. Stability over a narrow range of feedback gains was indicated for the system using a simple lead circuit as a nozzle control, or in other words, when the nozzle control acted on both the <b>attitude</b> <b>signal</b> and the rate of change of attitude of the rocket. The damping characteristics of this system were poor. By changing the nozzle control function to include a response to the acceleration of the rocket attitude, the damping characteristics were improved and the range of feedback gains was widened...|$|E
50|$|With {{standard}} <b>attitude</b> <b>signals</b> you generally {{play the}} highest card {{you can afford}} for that purpose.Typically <b>attitude</b> <b>signals</b> are made when partner leads an honor (either on the opening lead or later) and requests a continuation. The usual {{reason for this is}} that you possess an honor equal to the honor played or promised by the lead. Against a notrump contract (especially on the opening lead) partner will lead an honor from a solid or broken sequence, such as QJ10 or KQ10. With less solid holdings like QJxx(x) or KQxx(x) partner will lead his fourth best card. The reason to signal is, if partner leads from a broken sequence and there are small cards in dummy, partner may not know whether to continue the suit (should the trick hold or they gain the lead before you).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates two finite-time {{controllers}} for {{attitude control}} of spacecraft based on rotation matrix by an adaptive backstepping method.

With the use of adaptive control, the first robust finite-time controller is continuous without a chattering phenomenon.

A simplified configuration is proposed, including three parts: a pendulous force-feedback accelerometer, a ring laser gyroscope, and a single-axis rotating platform. The dynamic northfinding scheme of continuous rotation is adopted to eliminate the lock-in region of the laser gyroscope and to modulate the weak attitude signals; meanwhile the complex leveling process is avoided in this proposed configuration. To suppress the drift noises of the accelerometer and gyroscope, two digital lock-in amplifiers are used to extract the weak <b>attitude</b> <b>signals.</b> Simulation results show that the north finder can determine the heading angle in 72 [*]s, when the rotating rate is /s with the maximum heading error less than 1. 0 ′; meanwhile the horizontal attitude angles as well as the constant drift noises of the inertial components could also be obtained...|$|R

40|$|Reception of weak GNSS {{signals in}} {{challenging}} environments using {{techniques such as}} Assisted GNSS has become a reality and today such techniques are considered important enablers of GNSS receivers in mobile devices [1]. Furthermore, the use of GPS and Galileo signals for indoor navigation is also receiving increased attention in recent studies which push the limits of minimum signal to noise ratios [2]. Space users have also seen remarkable achievements, where GPS signal reception has been confirmed and reported in GEO orbits [3] and seen as enablers for increased spacecraft autonomy in GEO orbits [4]. The study of weak GNSS signal reception techniques for lunar missions appears as a logical sequential step which is further supported by the growing international efforts for lunar exploration, which typically involves radiometric range and Doppler measurements from the Earth to perform orbit determination. In the frame of an ongoing ESA study, the Lunar GNSS project is studying the main challenges of a GNSS receiver in different phases of a mission to the Moon including Moon Transfer Orbit, Low Lunar Orbit and Descent. The study analyses expected signal strengths, DOP and number of visible satellites for selected trajectories and space volumes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a noncontact acquisition system composed of several time synchronized laser height sensors, accelerometers, gyroscope, {{and so forth}} in order to collect the road profiles of vehicle riding on the unstructured roads. A method of correcting road profiles based on the accelerometer and gyroscope data is proposed to eliminate the adverse impacts of vehicle vibration and attitudes change. Because the power spectral density (PSD) of gyro attitudes concentrates in the low frequency band, a method called frequency division is presented to divide the road profiles into two parts: high frequency part and low frequency part. The vibration error of road profiles is corrected by displacement data obtained through two times integration of measured acceleration data. After building the mathematical model between gyro attitudes and road profiles, the gyro <b>attitudes</b> <b>signals</b> are separated from low frequency road profile by the method of sliding block overlap based on correlation analysis. The accuracy and limitations of the system have been analyzed, and its validity has been verified by implementing the system on wheeled equipment for road profiles’ measuring of vehicle testing ground.
