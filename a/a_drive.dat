5|$|The Battle of Tsimba Ridge was an {{engagement}} of the Second World War involving Australian and Japanese forces. Part {{of the wider}} Bougainville Campaign of the Pacific theatre, the battle occurred in the northern sector of Bougainville Island between 17 January and 9 February 1945, when the lead battalion of the Australian 11th Brigade—the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion—advanced towards the Genga River as part of <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> north to the Bonis Peninsula.|$|E

40|$|The {{resonance}} {{characteristics of}} <b>a</b> <b>driven</b> damped harmonic oscillator are well known. Unlike harmonic oscillators which are guided by parabolic potentials, a simple pendulum oscillates under sinusoidal potentials. The problem of an undamped pendulum {{has been investigated}} to a great extent. However, the resonance characteristics of <b>a</b> <b>driven</b> damped pendulum have not been re- ported so far due to the difficulty in solving the problem analytically. In the present work we report the resonance characteristics of <b>a</b> <b>driven</b> damped pendulum calculated numerically. The results are compared with the resonance characteristics of <b>a</b> damped <b>driven</b> harmonic oscillator. The work can be of pedagogic interest too as it reveals the richness of driven damped motion of a simple pendulum in comparison to and how strikingly it differs from the motion of <b>a</b> <b>driven</b> damped harmonic oscillator. We confine our work only to the nonchaotic regime of pendulum motion. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

5|$|Wake's post-score kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. With time running down, Georgia Tech had a chance for a game-winning score if it could sustain <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> into Wake Forest {{territory}} from its own 20-yard line. The drive began with a promising 14-yard completion to Calvin Johnson, but after Reggie Ball threw three incomplete passes, Georgia Tech was forced to punt the ball back to Wake Forest. The Deacons, after getting the ball at their own 20-yard line, began <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> of their own. Riley Skinner completed his first four passes of the drive, including a long 45-yard strike to Willie Idlette for the longest play of the game. With a first down inside the Georgia Tech red zone, the Deacons seemed to be in perfect position for a potentially game-winning touchdown. But as had every other drive previous, Wake Forest's offense failed to cross the goal line. Sam Swank kicked a 22-yard field goal to give the Deacons a 96 lead, but Georgia Tech still had time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|Webber {{spoke to}} Formula One team owner Eddie Jordan, who {{introduced}} him to fellow Australian Paul Stoddart.

As a result, Webber also got his first taste of a Formula One car, completing a two-day test at Barcelona in December 1999 for the Arrows F1 team.|$|E
5|$|A 65-yard screen {{pass from}} Vince Evans to Walter Payton gave the Bears a 13–10 lead. The Buccaneers {{answered}} that with <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> {{that ended with}} an eight-yard touchdown reception by Isaac Hagins. This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and left them as the only remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that point. A broken wrist suffered in this game would contribute to Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E
40|$|We explore quantum many-body {{physics of}} <b>a</b> <b>driven</b> Bose-Einstein {{condensate}} in optical lattices. The laser field induces {{a gap in}} the generalized Bogoliubov spectrum proportional to the effective Rabi frequency. The lowest lying modes in <b>a</b> <b>driven</b> condensate are characterized by zero group velocity and non-zero current. Thus, the laser field induces roton modes, which carry interaction in <b>a</b> <b>driven</b> condensate. We show that collective excitations below the energy of the laser-induced gap remain undamped, while above the gap they are characterized by a significantly suppressed Landau damping rate...|$|R

5|$|Alabama {{continued}} their scoring {{into the third}} quarter with touchdowns on their first two possessions of the half. The first came on a 38-yard McCarron pass to Amari Cooper on <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> that also saw McCarron complete a pass to his brother Corey McCarron. The second came on a 31-yard Chris Black run that made the score 42–0. With the Crimson Tide significantly up, mostly back-up players completed the fourth quarter. After a long drive stalled at the Mocs' 23-yard line, Eddie Jackson returned a C. J. Board fumble caused by Jonathan Allen to the Chattanooga six-yard line. On the next play, Dee Hart made the final score 49–0 with his six-yard touchdown run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 12–0.|$|E
5|$|An enthusiast of {{cars and}} fast driving from an early age, Villeneuve started his {{professional}} career in snowmobile racing in his native province of Quebec. He moved into single seaters, winning the US and Canadian Formula Atlantic championships in 1976, before being offered <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> in Formula One with the McLaren team at the 1977 British Grand Prix. He was taken on by reigning world champions Ferrari {{for the end of}} the season and from 1978 to his death in 1982 drove for the Italian team. He won six Grand Prix races in a short career at the highest level. In 1979, he finished second by four points in the championship to teammate Jody Scheckter.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> to beautify the coinage, five {{denominations}} of US coins {{had received}} new designs between 1907 and 1909. In 1911, Taft administration officials decided to replace Charles E. Barber's Liberty Head {{design for the}} nickel, and commissioned Fraser to do the work. They were impressed by Fraser's designs showing a Native American and an American bison. The designs were approved in 1912, but were delayed several months because of objections from the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, which made mechanisms to detect slugs in nickel-operated machines. The company was not satisfied by changes made in the coin by Fraser, and in February 1913, Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh decided to issue the coins despite the objections.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1975 season, Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> at Lotus, the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's {{progress}} throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and Swede Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims that it came very close to being completed.|$|E
5|$|Because NC State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech received NC State's kickoff and returned it to the 10-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Tech began working down the field, running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains. Tech picked up three first downs, then reached NC State territory on a pass to Donnelly. Once on the NC State side of the field, Tech picked up another first down, but Tech's quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. The ball landed at the NC State 12-yard line where the Wolfpack began <b>a</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
