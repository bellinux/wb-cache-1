50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>kerning</b> {{refers to}} the kerning applied {{automatically}} by a program, as opposed to no kerning at all, or the kerning applied manually by the user. There {{are two types of}} automatic kerning: metric and optical. With metric kerning, the program directly uses the values found in the kerning tables included in the font file. Most systems with typographic features today provide this type of kerning. Optical kerning, on the other hand, is available only in the more advanced systems. With optical kerning, the program uses an algorithm to calculate, from their outlines, the optimal spacing for each pair of consecutive characters. With both types of <b>automatic</b> <b>kerning,</b> the system usually permits the user to specify a minimum font size for applying kerning, if the user feels that kerning is unnecessary for smaller font sizes.|$|E
50|$|Manual kerning, {{available}} in some systems, permits {{the user to}} override the <b>automatic</b> <b>kerning</b> and to apply any kerning value directly {{to a pair of}} characters in a particular place in the text. When not available, this feature can be simulated by using, for those two characters, the function that modifies the space between characters in a block of text (usually called tracking).|$|E
5000|$|MacPublisher {{builds a}} page {{differently}} than PageMaker and ReadySetGo do; instead {{of creating an}} actual image of the page with all the text and graphics, MacPublisher created a page mockup that contains only rectangles that represent the location and size of text and graphic elements, and stored the elements as special text and picture files that you edit separately from the page layout. MacPublisher rebuilds a page whenever it changes. The company says it took this approach to allow creation of master pages, repeating elements, and predefined [...] "canned" [...] page layouts; to help prevent data loss on machines with limited memory (MacPublisher can run with as little as 128K RAM); and to facilitate the programming for the automatic table of contents and automatic page jump ("continued on page x") features. Since the page layout is independent {{of the text and}} graphic content, you can easily create publication formats you can reuse as you need them. This reusable formats feature can be especially useful for creating catalogs or other publications in which you want the format to remain the same but in which you need to update or replace information on a regular basis. MacPublisher features either <b>automatic</b> or manual <b>kerning</b> to correct printer spacing idiosyncrasies.|$|R
50|$|Calamus is a {{software}} RIP application which generates high-quality output in any resolution. It {{was one of}} the first DTP applications supporting an own vector font format, notable for its support for <b>automatic</b> <b>kerning</b> even where adjacent characters are set in different fonts or at different sizes. Its high modularity offers features for almost every purpose in desktop publishing. Calamus also {{was one of the}} first DTP apps to support real virtual objects and frames, nondestructive vector masks, and editable PS/PDF import. Its (adjustable) measurement base of 1/10,000mm allows accurate positioning of elements.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a new geometrical primitive - a curve of variable width (a fat curve). The fat curve is {{a trace of}} circle with variable radius moving along a smooth trajectory of the finite length called as an axis. For the mathematical description of such primitives cubic B-splines are used. By means of them {{it is possible to}} specify both an axis and a radius value (a thickness) of a fat curve. We solve a problem of representation of hand-written characters given as raster binary images in the form of association of fat curves. We demonstrate a possibility of modeling of "real" handwriting by entering small deformations into the form of fat curves. We consider a method of <b>automatic</b> <b>kerning</b> (visual alignment of letter spacing) of hand-written characters given as curves of variable width. We describe the way of output of arbitrary text presented by series of fat curves on raster-scan devices (printed output, displayed output). A prototype of a font editor of fat curves was developed by the authors of this paper. The presented approach can be used as embedded module (plug-in) in font editors of hand-written characters...|$|E
