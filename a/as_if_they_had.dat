This {{provides}} that anyone who attempts to commit an offence will be punished with {{the same period in}} prison <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.|$|E

5|$|Sora {{returns as}} the game's protagonist. Donald Duck and Goofy are less {{involved}} in the gameplay and story. Like the first game, Chain of Memories features numerous characters from both the Final Fantasy series and the Disney animated features canon. Being a direct sequel, many of the characters from the first Kingdom Hearts reappear in this game. As each world and the related characters are recreated from Sora's memories, they interact with Sora <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> never met before. The game also introduces a handful of new characters. Several {{are members of the}} enigmatic Organization. Other new characters include Namin√©, a young girl capable of manipulating memories, and DiZ, a mysterious man concealed by red robes and bandages. Riku appears as a playable character in the second story mode. After being sealed in the realm of darkness, Riku heads to the basement of Castle Oblivion. He is aided by King Mickey and DiZ.|$|E

5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from NYPD Blue, whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of the photographs were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked with not only creating the photographs that Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been taken from different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each photo was edited to give the photographs the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E

Three types of development cards include cards worth one victory point; knight cards (or soldier cards), which allow the player to move the robber <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> rolled a 7 (but without the remove-half rule); and a third set of cards which allow the player one of three abilities when played.|$|E
25|$|Artists such as Roland Penrose (author of the Home Guard Manual of Camouflage), Stanley William Hayter, Julian Trevelyan {{and many}} others were {{employed}} to conceal defences.

The opposite extreme occurs too, with some people experiencing everything in their environment <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> decided that it would happen.|$|E

In some musical styles, a sustained open string drone can be played during a passage mainly written on an adjacent string, to provide a basic accompaniment.
