5|$|Gulf {{also participated}} in a {{partnership}} with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke Catalytic Cracker refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by the explosion of a Total tanker, the Betelgeuse, in January 1979 (Whiddy Island Disaster) and it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held its strategic oil reserve there.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Maréchal, {{who was now}} Archbishop of Baltimore, {{was ordered}} to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he {{appointed}} a priest from his diocese, William Matthews, as apostolic administrator. Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828. Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> transpired. While forbidden {{to return to his}} diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe. He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia. Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the First Provincial Council of Baltimore was in session.|$|E
5|$|As a {{deception}} unit, {{the division}} {{was assigned to}} the bogus Operation Trolleycar. Trolleycar was initially envisioned as a fictitious amphibious assault upon the coast of the Netherlands, by the phantom British Fourth Army, to exploit the success of the authentic Operation Market Garden. When the Battle of Arnhem failed, the notional invasion plan was temporarily scrapped. Trolleycar was revived to convince the Germans that the Fourth Army would land near Emden, in support of an imaginary assault by the First Canadian Army, that would be launched west of Arnhem and through the Netherlands. The deception effort was kept up until 1945, being wound down in January. Despite the British ceasing their attempts to deceive the Germans about this possible landing and the Germans not believing <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been reported to them, the Germans remained anxious about a landing along the northern coast {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E

25|$|This {{book was}} {{conceived}} in March {{of the year}} 1929 , {{during the course of}} a stay in Damascus. The miserable sight of maimed and famished-looking refugee children, working in a carpet factory, gave me the final impulse to snatch the incomprehensible destiny of the Armenian people from the Hell of <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> taken place. The writing of the book followed between July 1932 and March 1933. Meanwhile, in November, on a lecture tour through German cities, the author selected Chapter 5 of Book One for public readings. It was read in its present form, based on the historic records of a conversation between Enver Pasha and Pastor Johannes Lepsius.|$|E
25|$|Nine of {{the sons}} {{returned}} to their father Israel from Egypt, stockpiled with grain on their donkeys. They relayed to their father <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> happened in Egypt. They spoke of being accused of as spies and that their brother Simeon, had been taken prisoner. When Reuben, the eldest, mentioned {{that they needed to}} bring Benjamin to Egypt to prove their word as honest men, their father became furious with them. He couldn't understand how they were put in a position to tell the Egyptians all about their family. When the sons of Israel opened their sacks, they saw their money that they used to pay for the grain. It was still in their possession, and so they all became afraid. Israel then became angry with the loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April Medici {{explained}} to Montalto <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been done, and advised him {{as to how}} affairs should be conducted. D'Este met with Farnese, who believed that Montalto had no voting strength, and managed to further misdirect him. During a meeting in the Pauline Chapel, d' Este recruited Guastavillani, the Cardinal Camerlengo; Giambattista Castagna, the Cardinal of San Marcello; and Francesco Sforza. When the cardinals finally assembled in the Sistine Chapel, d' Este declared {{that it was not}} necessary to proceed to a ballot, since it was obvious who the new pope was. Without opposition the cardinals proceeded to do hommage ('adoration') to Felice Cardinal Peretti though, immediately afterwards, a vote was conducted by asking each cardinal to cast his vote aloud. The vote was unanimous. Cardinal François de Joyeuse arrived in Rome too late to participate in the Conclave.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} the Athenians would not believe their loss, in a great degree because {{of the person who}} first brought them news of it. For a certain stranger, it seems, coming to Piraeus, and there sitting in a barber's shop, began to talk of what had happened, as if the Athenians already knew <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> passed; which the barber hearing, before he acquainted anybody else, ran {{as fast as he could}} up into the city, {{addressed}} himself to the Archons, and presently spread it about in the public Place. On which, there being everywhere, as may be imagined, terror and consternation, the Archons summoned a general assembly, and there brought in the man and questioned him how he came to know. And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, therefore, fastened to the wheel and racked a long time, till other messengers arrived that related the whole disaster particularly. So hardly was Nicias believed to have suffered the calamity which he had often predicted.|$|E
25|$|According to Polybius (bold {{emphasis}} added) Just at this time, Gaius Atilius, {{the other}} Consul, had reached Pisa from Sardinia with his legions {{and was on}} his way to Rome, marching in the opposite direction to the enemy. When the Celts were near Telamon in Etruria, their advanced foragers encountered the advance guard of Gaius and were made prisoners. On being examined by the Consul they narrated <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> recently occurred and told him of the presence of the two armies, stating that the Gauls were quite near and Lucius behind them. The news surprised him but at the same time made him very hopeful, as he thought he had caught the Gauls on the march between the two armies. He ordered his Tribunes to put the legions in fighting order and to advance thus at marching pace in so far as the nature of the ground allowed the attack in line. He himself had happily noticed a hill situated above the road by which the Celts must pass, and taking his cavalry with him, advanced at full speed, being anxious to occupy the crest of the hill before their arrival and be the first to begin the battle, feeling certain that thus he would get the largest share of credit for the result.|$|E
25|$|The main {{script and}} {{branching}} storylines {{were written by}} author and screenwriter Satoru Akahori. Hiroi revealed that the setting of Sakura Wars was based on his family history, so felt that it would lose its entertainment value if he wrote the game's script himself. Hiroi had previously worked with Akahori on other projects, so Akahori was brought on board. When Akahori first heard the concept before talking with Hiroi, he laughed {{and said it would}} be better to try blending the stories of Haikara-san ga Tōru and Teito Monogatari. He was later convinced to join the project after talking with Hiroi. When first pitched the project, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been finalized was that the story would involve young girls and mecha. Akahori was unsure how to approach the project as he had never written for a video game, but Hiroi told him to write the story like an anime television. When Akahori first joined the team, the story was still in an unfinished state: the only points finalized were its setting, overall theme of steampunk mecha combat, and a cast of five or six characters. Akahori's early work was focused on expanding the narrative and characters based on Hiroi's draft. Due to the deep connection to Hiroi's family history, Akahori could not work on the script by himself, needing frequent consultation with Hiroi. Hiroi also insisted on making frequent changes if Akahori's work did not fall in line with his vision. Akahori wrote a thirteen-episode storyline for the game, with the final battle taking place across three episodes. After talks with staff, the final battle was condensed into a single chapter, bringing the game to its current ten-episode length. Kaneko and Morita created the additional dialogue around Akahori's main scenario, along with other duties such as script editing and debugging.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II Treloar wrote {{to the members of}} the AWM's board to with proposals for how the Memorial should respond to another major war. This letter suggested that if hostilities occurred, the Memorial should suspend most of its activities and reorient its focus to become a memorial to all the wars in which Australia had taken part rather than just World War I. He further proposed that the Memorial building be used as a store and for government offices during the war, and that its staff establish a war records section similar to the AWRS. These proposals [...] "ran counter to <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been planned in the preceding years" [...] and were rejected by the AWM board in October 1939. The board did decide, however, to offer the Department of Defence assistance with collecting records and artefacts. Accordingly, work continued on the Memorial throughout World War II, though in February 1941 the board decided to extend its scope to include the new war.|$|E
