On stations with large paddocks there is <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> non-interference. On other properties the mobs are inspected by stockmen at varying intervals to stand cast ewes and deal with dystocia. Producers also sometimes quietly drift pregnant ewes away from ewes that have already lambed, {{in order to prevent}} mis-mothering.|$|E

5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> continued modernization {{with an eye}} to eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E
5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds.

The Conservative Party, while also following <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E

5|$|Belgium had pursued <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> {{neutrality}} {{since its}} independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71).

5|$|Following the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe {{started its}} attacks on Channel convoys {{as a prelude}} to the Battle of Britain. The primary task of JG 51 during this time was to provide fighter escort to these bomber missions. The {{commander}} of JG 51, Oberst Theo Osterkamp established <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> unrestricted combat air patrol (freie Jagd) of fighter Staffeln providing loose protection rather than close escort to the bombers, actively seeking out Royal Air Force fighters.

5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States pursued <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> {{trying to}} prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. This was not {{strictly}} for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare {{made it more difficult}} for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. On August 19, 1825, U.S. officials finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined the boundaries of the region's tribes.|$|E

However, the Tonkin Government was defeated in April 1974 and the incoming Liberal Premier, Sir Charles Court, was happy to make the necessary recommendation.|$|E
