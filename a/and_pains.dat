40|$|Itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> are two {{distinct}} sensory modalities elicited by noxious and pruritic stimuli, respectively. The cellular and electrophysiological characteristics of itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> are very similar; thus discerning the mechanical {{difference between these}} two sensory modalities has long been elusive. Recent advances in this field have revealed various neuronal receptors responsible for itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> signal transduction <b>and</b> transmission. These studies have identified a distinct sub-population of sensory neurons responsible for itch signal transduction. In addition, itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> information conveyed to the spinal cord are processed and regulated by distinct spinal cord neurons. Although both itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> senses are required for our daily lives, chronic and hyper-sensation of itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> results in a debilitating disease state. Studies have now begun to elucidate mechanisms for the sensitization of <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> itch and also to unravel counter-regulatory mechanisms between itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> at the spinal cord level. Interestingly, toll-like receptors (TLRs), an innate immune receptor, has been implicated in the central sensitization of both <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> itch. In this review, we will briefly provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms of itch <b>and</b> <b>pain.</b> Additionally, we will discuss the recently uncovered role of TLRs in itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> sensation...|$|R

40|$|Background Itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> {{are common}} {{symptoms}} in skin disease. It {{has been suggested}} that negative emotions {{may play a role in}} itch <b>and</b> <b>pain.</b> To date, however, the role of emotions has only been studied for pain in experimental studies, not yet for itch. Objectives To investigate the effects of negative and positive emotions on the sensitivity to itch <b>and</b> <b>pain.</b> Methods Film fragments were used to induce a negative or positive emotional state in healthy women. Itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> were induced using the following somatosensory stimuli: electrical stimulation, histamine iontophoresis and the cold pressor test. Results Results showed that the scores for itch <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> evoked by histamine and the cold pressor test, respectively, were significantly higher in the negative than in the positive emotion condition, whereas tolerance thresholds to electrical stimulation and the cold pressor test, and stimulus unpleasantness scores did not differ between the two conditions.

25|$|Stressful working {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood). Physical symptoms that may occur because of occupational stress include fatigue, headache, upset stomach, muscular aches <b>and</b> <b>pains,</b> weight gain or loss, chronic mild illness, and sleep disturbances. Psychological and behavioral problems that may develop include anxiety, irritability, alcohol and drug use, feeling powerless and low morale. The spectrum of effects caused by occupational stress includes absenteeism, poor decision making, lack of creativity, accidents, organizational breakdown or even sabotage. If exposure to stressors in the workplace is prolonged, then chronic health problems can occur including stroke. An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted {{with a sample of}} 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms. Studies among the Japanese population specifically showed a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke among men with job strain (combination of high job demand and low job control). Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs. Along with the risk of stroke, stress can raise the risk of high blood pressure, immune system dysfunction, coronary artery disease. Prolonged occupational stress can lead to occupational burnout. Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.|$|E

40|$|Bladder {{disorders}} {{associated with}} interstitial cystitis are frequently characterized by increased contractility <b>and</b> <b>pain.</b> The goals {{of this study}} were to examine 1) the effects of blocking proteinase-activated receptor- 2 (PAR 2) on the exaggerated bladder activity <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> evoked by cystitis and 2) the underlying mechanisms responsible for the role of PAR 2 in regulating cystic sensory activity. The protein expression of PAR 2 was amplified in rats with cystitis by inducing it with systemic administration of cyclophosphamide (CYP) as compared with control rats. Blocking PAR 2 by intrathecal infusion of PAR 2 antagonist FSLLRY-NH 2 attenuated bladder hyperactivity <b>and</b> <b>pain.</b> In addition, blocking PAR 2 attenuated the transient receptor potential A 1 (TRPA 1) signal pathway, whereas inhibition of the TRPA 1 decreased bladder hyperactivity <b>and</b> <b>pain.</b> The data revealed specific signaling pathways leading to CYP-induced bladder hyperactivity <b>and</b> <b>pain,</b> including the activation of PAR 2 and TRPA 1.

500|$|One longstanding {{suggestion}} of a social role for Sappho is that of [...] "Sappho as schoolmistress". At {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century, the German classicist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff posited that Sappho was a sort of schoolteacher, in order to [...] "explain away Sappho's passion for her 'girls'" [...] and defend her from accusations of homosexuality. [...] The view continues to be influential, both among scholars and the general public, though more recently the idea has been criticised by historians as anachronistic and has been rejected by several prominent classicists as unjustified by the evidence. In 1959, Denys Page, for example, stated that Sappho's extant fragments portray [...] "the loves and jealousies, the pleasures <b>and</b> <b>pains,</b> of Sappho and her companions;" [...] and he adds, [...] "We have found, and shall find, no trace of any formal or official or professional relationship between them, ... no trace of Sappho the principal of an academy." [...] David [...] A. Campbell in 1967 judged that Sappho may have [...] "presided over a literary coterie," [...] but that [...] "evidence for a formal appointment as priestess or teacher is hard to find." [...] None of Sappho's own poetry mentions her teaching, and the earliest testimonium to support the idea of Sappho as a teacher comes from Ovid, six centuries after Sappho's lifetime. Despite these problems, many newer interpretations of Sappho's social role are still based on this idea. [...] In these interpretations, Sappho was involved in the ritual education of girls, for instance as a trainer of choruses of girls.|$|E
