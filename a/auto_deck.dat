50|$|By 2007 {{only about}} 30% {{of the total}} deck {{reserved}} for automobile use had been removed. Most of the removed sections were on the East St. Louis side. The western ramp was relinquished to Ralston Purina {{and turned into a}} parking lot. In 2013 the TRRA began removing all of the <b>auto</b> <b>deck</b> over the river. By late 2014, the vehicle deck on the bridge proper had been removed, and work was progressing onto the western approach.|$|E
5000|$|Opened in 1917, {{the bridge}} {{replaced}} the original Hannibal Bridge which crossed the river about 200 feet downstream {{on the northern}} bank, but at virtually the same location on the southern bank. [...] There are two decks on the bridge: the lower deck carried the railroad and the upper was for vehicular traffic. After the Buck O'Neil Bridge then called the Broadway Bridge opened in 1956, vehicular traffic was switched over to the new span and the <b>auto</b> <b>deck</b> was removed later that year. It is owned and maintained by the BNSF Railway and carries two tracks. A bridge tender at the bridge can open and close the drawspan as well as operate the nearby ASB Bridge, which is also owned by BNSF.|$|E
40|$|The motor {{vehicles}} which dispose of two steering <b>auto</b> <b>decks,</b> at which back and front wheels are positioned backwards {{for reducing the}} veering radius, {{has the advantage of}} reducing the stability at high speeds in auto racing. In this paper is made an analysis of the steering boxes on back axle variant, which combine the advantage of reducing veering radius with keeping its whole stability...|$|R
5000|$|Around 1980, Nakamichi {{introduced}} {{the third generation}} of 1000 and 700 three-head decks. The 1000ZXL and 700ZXL had full metal capability as well as normal and high bias abilities and had built-in computers for calibrating the decks to a specific tape. These built-in computers were known as A.B.L.E. for Azimuth, Bias, Level, and Equalization. The user would use this function (activated by an [...] "Auto Cal" [...] button) to optimize the deck to a specific brand of tape to get best recording results from every cassette. [...] Hence the 1000ZXL and 700ZXL were known as computing cassette decks. Also offered was a third less costly <b>deck</b> the 700ZXE <b>auto</b> tuning cassette <b>deck.</b>|$|R
