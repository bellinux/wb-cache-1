50|$|Wire ropes were {{developed}} starting with mining hoist {{applications in the}} 1830s. Wire ropes are used dynamically for lifting and hoisting in cranes and elevators, and for transmission of mechanical power. Wire rope {{is also used to}} transmit force in mechanisms, such as a Bowden cable or the control surfaces of an airplane connected to levers and pedals in the cockpit. Only <b>aircraft</b> <b>cables</b> have WSC (wire strand core). Also, <b>aircraft</b> <b>cables</b> are available in smaller diameters than wire rope. For example, <b>aircraft</b> <b>cables</b> are available in 3/64 in. diameter while most wire ropes begin at a 1/4 in. diameter. Static wire ropes are used to support structures such as suspension bridges or as guy wires to support towers. An aerial tramway relies on wire rope to support and move cargo overhead.|$|R
