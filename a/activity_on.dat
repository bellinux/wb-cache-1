5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> the moon Io {{was probably the}} greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{research}} on the open learner model, more and more ILE offer to learners interactive <b>activities</b> <b>on</b> their profile. These <b>activities</b> are based <b>on</b> the visualization of learners profiles: in particular, {{it may be a}} simple observation of a profile, but also the negotiation of this profile content, or a comparison with another learner profile. However, the visualization of profiles proposed by existing ILE is few customizable. In this paper, we present models to personalize <b>activities</b> <b>on</b> profiles, depending on the user type (learner, teacher [...] .), on his knowledge, skills and capacities, but also on his preferences. We implemented these models to provide tools to teachers to prepare personalized <b>activities</b> <b>on</b> profiles; and to provide to each user type a unified environment proposing personalized <b>activities</b> <b>on</b> profiles...|$|R
5|$|First {{recorded}} and surveyed in 1840, North Island {{has been a}} seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishermen {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, and this remains the principal focus of human <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> the island. There is also a small amount of tourism, though for the most part it is reserved as conservation habitat for vegetation communities and rare birds.|$|E
5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, adaptive optics imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> Io, {{even without a}} spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E

5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, still {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> the part of the Railway and Port Company, Hesketh-Fleetwood organised the formation of the Preston and Wyre Railway Company to raise the funds required to bring the railway to Fleetwood. The estimated cost was £122,000. The company obtained Royal assent to start construction, with an underwritten guarantee from Hesketh-Fleetwood. The following year Hesketh-Fleetwood and Burton oversaw the marking out of Fleetwood's first street, and the first railway lines were laid.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E

In October 1958, Seaborg announced that the University had relaxed its prior prohibitions on political <b>activity</b> <b>on</b> a trial basis, and the ban on communists speaking on campus was lifted.

5|$|Strongly {{affected}} by the deindustrialization {{that took place in}} other Rust Belt cities, Utica suffered a major reduction in manufacturing activity {{during the second half of}} the 20thcentury.

During the 1980s and 1990s, major employers such as General Electric and Lockheed Martin began to close plants in Utica and Syracuse.|$|E

5|$|The Qing state's main shamanistic ritual was {{performed}} at the tangse by the emperor {{on the first day}} of the New Year.
