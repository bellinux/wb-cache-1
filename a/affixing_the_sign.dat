500|$|Georgia Tech's Class of 1922 {{installed}} <b>the</b> famous TECH <b>signs</b> on {{all four}} sides of Tech Tower in 1918, giving rise to the building's present nickname. Their purpose, {{as defined by the}} donors during their first year at Georgia Tech, was to [...] "light the spirit of Tech to the four points of the compass." [...] <b>The</b> <b>signs</b> were originally made of wood and painted white and gold – the Institute colors. In the 1930s, lightbulbs were <b>affixed</b> to <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> to illuminate them more effectively than the earlier ground-based spotlights. In 1949, <b>the</b> TECH <b>signs</b> were supplemented by neon lighting in metal frames.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> soft <b>sign</b> is {{normally}} written after a consonant and indicates its softening (palatalization). Less commonly, <b>the</b> soft <b>sign</b> just has a grammatically determined usage with no phonetic meaning (like туш 'flourish after a toast' and тушь 'India ink', both pronounced [...] but different in grammatical gender and declension). In East Slavic languages {{and some other}} Slavic languages (such as Bulgarian), there are some consonants {{that do not have}} phonetically different palatalized forms but corresponding letters still admit <b>the</b> <b>affixing</b> soft <b>sign.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During Ed Morgan's long {{tenure as}} pastor the theme verse for <b>the</b> congregation, <b>affixed</b> to <b>the</b> <b>sign,</b> was Colossians 1:18, [...] "That in All Things Christ Might Have the Preeminence."(KJV) Pastor Morgan {{said of the}} church on his {{retirement}} that, [...] "We believe in fundamentals, an adherence to what we believe the Word of God teaches about itself and the Lord."At {{the founding of the}} church it was the intention of the Harris siblings that the congregation have a strong commitment to missions. By the time that the Rev. Morgan retired in 1980, the congregation was giving 50% of all general fund contributions to mission work, including providing partial support for 28 missionary families. Most of those families were made up of those who had grown up in the church or entered it as students at the university.|$|R

40|$|In Turkish {{language}} history, lots of affixes {{had been}} used for the future tense. Today, <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> -acaú/-ecek is being used for this mood in Turkey Turkish. But in Anatolian accents, there is <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> –ıcı/-ici, -ucu/-ücü that seems like the phonetically mutated mode of <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> -acak/-ecek in some regions. In this study, it’s been exposed that except their vocal similarities there is no structural relation between <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> -ıcı/-ici,-ucu/-ücü and <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> -acak/-ecek which are being used in accent regions from Gaziantep to Çukurova then Kahramanmaraş and Kırşehir.

40|$|Knowledge of derivational {{morphology}} {{is considered}} {{an important aspect of}} vocabulary knowledge both in L 1 (mother tongue) and L 2 (second or foreign language) English language learning. However, it is still not clear whether different derivational affixes vary in their (learning) difficulty. The present study examines whether Bauer and Nation’s (1993) teaching order of L 2 English affixes can account for the difficulty learners have with recognising <b>the</b> <b>affixes.</b> <b>The</b> participants in the study were L 1 Estonian and Russian learners of English at uppersecondary schools in Estonia (n = 62). Their performance was measured on a word segmentation task. There were significant differences in <b>the</b> number of <b>affixes</b> <b>the</b> learners were able to successfully recognise at different levels, as classified by Bauer and Nation (1993). By and large, with the exception of no significant difference between Level 5 and Level 6 <b>affixes,</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> level was, <b>the</b> less likely the learners were to recognise <b>the</b> <b>affixes</b> at this level. I argue that these results can support the order proposed by Bauer and Nation. The implications of the finding for teaching and further research are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> and <b>the</b> clitic is sometimes {{not easy to}} make, as clitics also have some characteristics of affixes. This paper demonstrates that the clitic in Degema is distinct from <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> despite many features they have in common. Some of the criteria that are held to apply cross-linguistically do not absolutely distinguish the clitic from <b>the</b> <b>affix</b> in Degema. <b>The</b> paper provides background information as regards the elements that separate into clitics and affixes in Degema, features that are common to both clitics and affixes, {{and some of the}} features that are considered as distinguishing clitics from <b>affixes.</b> <b>The</b> definitions of the Degema clitic and affix, respectively, are proposed...|$|R
