This study examined 247 metaphoric expressions in Mandarin conversations. The data includes 110 (44. 5 %) metaphors being conveyed concurrently by speech <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> as well as 137 (55. 5 %) metaphors being conveyed in gesture exclusively. Results show that Entity metaphor is the most frequent one expressed in daily conversations. The cooperation of language <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> enables us to evaluate the various hypotheses of speech-gesture production. Results from this study tend to support the Interface Hypothesis, which suggests that gestures are generated from an interface representation between speaking and spatio-motoric thought. ...|$|R

5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures <b>and</b> <b>gestures</b> may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.|$|E
5|$|There are 20 {{characters}} in the game, {{all of whom are}} voiced by the same actors that provide their voices in the show, and each character executes his or her own exclusive moves <b>and</b> <b>gestures</b> and power moves in the wrestling ring. The matches take place in detailed 3D locations from Springfield. A round in the game ends when one wrestler pins his opponent for a three count. Two victorious rounds wins a match. Unlike in traditional wrestling rules, the opponent may be pinned belly-down.|$|E
5|$|Two {{artists that}} changed the comics {{industry}} dramatically in the late 1960s were Neal Adams, considered one of his country's greatest draftsmen, and Jim Steranko. Both artists expressed a cinematic approach at times that occasionally altered the more conventional panel-based format that had been commonplace for decades. Adams' breakthrough was based on layout and rendering. Best known for returning Batman to his somber roots after the campy success of the Batman television show, his naturalistic depictions of anatomy, faces, <b>and</b> <b>gestures</b> changed comics' style {{in a way that}} Strausbaugh sees reflected in modern graphic novels.|$|E

Our results indicate exciting opportunities for gaze-tracking interfaces that use existing technologies, but suggest that findings from studies of highly-accurate gaze systems may not apply in these real-world simulations where the gaze-tracking is inherently less accurate. We contribute a series of design recommendations for gaze <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> interfaces in this context, and based on these limitations...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} whether children's {{ability to}} integrate speech <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> follows {{the pattern of}} a broader developmental shift between 3 - and 5 -year-old children (Ramscar & Gitcho, 2007) regarding the ability to process two pieces of information simultaneously. In Experiment 1, 3 -year-olds, 5 -year-olds, and adults were presented with either an iconic gesture or a spoken sentence {{or a combination of}} the two on a computer screen, and they were instructed to select a photograph that best matched the message. The 3 -year-olds did not integrate information in speech <b>and</b> <b>gesture,</b> but 5 -year-olds and adults did. In Experiment 2, 3 -year-old children were presented with the same speech <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> as in Experiment 1 that were produced live by an experimenter. When presented live, 3 -year-olds could integrate speech <b>and</b> <b>gesture.</b> We concluded that development of the integration ability is a part of the broader developmental shift; however, live-presentation facilitates the nascent integration ability in 3 -year-olds...|$|R

5|$|Monteverdi was, {{at least}} initially, much {{taken with the}} {{potential}} of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability {{to play the role of}} Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions <b>and</b> <b>gestures.</b> Later he enthused about the chance to write a ballet for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but his attitude slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, in his analysis of the opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled the commission and the work is heard of no more. Monteverdi was told instead to work on the Armida setting.|$|E
5|$|Performers {{are first}} trained in acrobatics, {{followed}} by singing <b>and</b> <b>gestures.</b> Several performing schools, {{all based on}} the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school. Students previously trained exclusively {{in the art of}} performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians. They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe. In Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking-opera training school.|$|E
5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations <b>and</b> <b>gestures</b> such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E

5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, <b>and</b> <b>gestures,</b> settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E
5|$|The umpires {{reported}} Waddington to the cricket {{committee of}} the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals <b>and</b> <b>gestures</b> of displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him {{to write a letter}} of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned {{at the end of the}} season, and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses <b>and</b> <b>gestures,</b> and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundSpecific {{language}} impairment (SLI) {{is diagnosed}} when language is significantly below chronological age expectations {{in the absence}} of other developmental disorders, sensory impairments or global developmental delays. It has been suggested that gesture may enhance communication in children with SLI by providing an alternative means to convey words or extend utterances. However, gesture is a complex task that requires the integration of social, cognitive and motor skills, skills that some children with SLI may find challenging. In addition, {{there is reason to believe}} that language <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> form an integrated system leading to the prediction that children with a SLI may also have difficulties with gestural communication. AimsTo explore the link between language <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> in children with poor language skills. Methods & ProcedureFifteen children with SLI and 14 age-matched typically developing children (TD) participated in this study. The children completed measures of expressive and receptive vocabulary, non-verbal cognition, motor control, <b>gesture</b> comprehension <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> production. Outcomes & ResultsTD children achieved significantly higher scores on measures of <b>gesture</b> production <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> comprehension relative to children with SLI. Significant correlations between both measures of vocabulary and both measures of gesture suggest a tight link between language <b>and</b> <b>gesture.</b> Conclusions & ImplicationsThe findings support the idea that <b>gesture</b> <b>and</b> language form one integrated communication system, rather than two separate communication modalities. This implies that children with SLI may have underlying deficits that impact not only on language but also on <b>gesture</b> production <b>and</b> comprehension...|$|R
