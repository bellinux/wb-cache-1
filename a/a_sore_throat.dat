5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of streptococcal pharyngitis are <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> fever of greater than , tonsillar exudates (pus on the tonsils), and large cervical lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. <b>A</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E
5|$|Although an RST cannot {{distinguish}} GAS infection from asymptomatic carriage of the organism, most authorities recommend antibiotic {{treatment in}} the event of a positive RST result from a person with <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> US guidelines recommend following up a negative result with a microbial culture, whereas European guidelines suggest relying on the negative RST.|$|E

50|$|Diagnosis and {{the imaging}} (and laboratory) studies to be ordered largely {{depend on the}} patient history, signs and symptoms. If <b>a</b> {{persistent}} <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> with the symptoms are found, physicians are cautioned to screen for Lemierre's syndrome.|$|R

5|$|As he neared his {{eleventh}} birthday, Gloucester {{was assigned}} the rooms in Kensington Palace {{that had been}} used by his aunt, Queen Mary, who died in 1694. At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing. By nightfall, he was suffering from <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day. A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately bled, but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of diarrhoea. A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, Zürich {{newspaper}} Sport {{ranked the}} top 15 European players, and listed Cochet first (Borotra second, Brugnon ninth). At that time Cochet {{was struggling with}} a shoulder injury. For the 50th anniversary of the Wiener Park Club of Vienna a tournament was organized with an international line-up. The two biggest contenders Cochet and Roderich Menzel met in the final, Cochet made a comeback from one set down to lift the trophy. He then toured Europe to give exhibitions in Cluj-Napoca, Budapest and Prague. Because of fever and <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> Cochet missed the French Championships. He did not recover from his illness before the second Italian International Championships but this did not prevent Cochet from signing up for the competition. With titleholder Tilden having turned professional and Cochet's condition, the championships went easily to George Patrick Hughes. Cochet entered the finals of the doubles too, but his partner André Merlin couldn't make up for Cochet's bad shape and they lost to Alberto Del Bono and singles victor Hughes.|$|E
500|$|As the {{symptoms}} of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions, {{it can be difficult}} to make the diagnosis clinically. [...] Coughing, nasal discharge, diarrhea, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> are more indicative of <b>a</b> viral <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> than of strep throat. The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> fever, and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in infectious mononucleosis.|$|R
5|$|Some advise {{to avoid}} {{physical}} exercise {{if there are}} symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or <b>a</b> minor <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R

5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, {{and his hands}} trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion {{to move into a}} large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few drops of morphine as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1884, Grant complained of <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> but put off seeing a doctor until late October when he learned it was cancer, {{possibly}} caused by his frequent cigar smoking. Grant chose not to reveal the seriousness of his condition to his wife, who soon found out from Grant's doctor. Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; {{it would be his}} last public appearance. In March of the following year, the New York Times announced that Grant was dying of cancer and a nationwide public concern for the former president began. Knowing of Grant and Julia's financial difficulties, Congress sought to honor him and restored him to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay (Grant's assumption of the Presidency in 1869 had required that he resign his commission and forfeit his pension).|$|E

5000|$|The {{alternate}} name throatwort {{is derived}} from an old belief that C. trachelium is <b>a</b> cure for <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> and the species name trachelium refers to its use as treatment of the throat in folk medicine.|$|R
5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{emotional}} distractions, {{during the summer of}} 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, completing the Adagio and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> which persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 40°C (104°F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, including the world premiere of Busoni's Berceuse élégiaque. This was Mahler's last concert. After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, a disease to which sufferers from defective heart valves were particularly prone, and for which the survival rate in pre-antibiotic days was almost zero. Mahler did not give up hope; he talked of resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest when one of Alma's compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS Amerika bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 May he was taken by train to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where he died on 18 May.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{report that}} Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, {{with varying degrees}} of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created {{specifically}} for Ernest Thesiger. Because of Mae Clarke's ill health, Valerie Hobson replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story— and horror in general— springs from {{the dark side of the}} imagination. He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including The Private Life of Henry VIII (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale's own The Old Dark House. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride's hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself <b>a</b> <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.|$|E
