5|$|Fearing {{a future}} {{government}} may overturn the statute enforcing property tax rate caps, Daniels {{and other state}} Republican leaders pressed for an amendment to add the new tax limits to the state constitution. The proposed amendment {{was placed on the}} 2010 General election ballot and was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> Daniels' reelection campaign. In November 2010, voters elected to adopt the tax caps into the Indiana Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Scholarship of Early Netherlandish {{painting}} {{was one of}} the main activities of 19th and 20th-century art history, and was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> two of the most important art historians of the 20th century: Max J. Friedländer (From Van Eyck to Breugel and Early Netherlandish Painting) and Erwin Panofsky (Early Netherlandish Painting).|$|E
5|$|The {{area has}} been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> modern Egyptological {{exploration}} {{for the last two}} centuries. Prior to this time it was a site for tourism in antiquity (especially during Roman times). This area illustrates the changes in the study of ancient Egypt, starting as antiquity hunting, and ending as scientific excavation of the whole Theban Necropolis. Despite the exploration and investigation noted below, only eleven of the tombs have actually been completely recorded.|$|E

5|$|Hao Fengjun, another {{defector}} to Australia, {{had worked}} for the 610 Office of Tianjin city and claims that his job involved the collection and analysis of intelligence reports on Falun Gong from Europe, Australia, and North America. The implication was that local 610 offices are involved in the espionage efforts abroad. Another defector from China's Ministry of State Security—which conducts both domestic and international intelligence—claimed that the repression and monitoring of underground Christians and Falun Gong practitioners is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the ministry.|$|E
5|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the {{worldwide}} Anglican Communion {{owing to the}} importance of St Augustine, who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent {{around the turn of the}} 7th century. The city's cathedral became <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket, although it had already been a well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege by the men of King Canute in 1012. A journey of pilgrims to Becket's shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales.|$|E
5|$|The Roma form {{a sizable}} {{minority}} in contemporary Romania, {{and a small}} but visible presence in Cluj-Napoca: self-identifying Roma in the city comprise only 1 percent of the population; yet they are a familiar presence {{in and around the}} central market, selling flowers, used clothes and tinware. They are an important object of public discourse and media representation at the national level; however, Cluj-Napoca, with its small Roma population, has not been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> Roma ethno-political activity.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War II, the discipline of international relations became <b>a</b> <b>major</b> scholarly <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the University, and in response, the School of International and Public Affairs was founded in 1946, drawing upon {{the resources of the}} faculties of political science, economics, and history.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> second <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> Brookhart’s group {{concerns}} fundamental {{studies of}} C-H and C-C bond activations by transition metal complexes and {{the incorporation of}} these bond activation steps into catalytic cycles. They have successfully demonstrated catalysis of the ortho-alkylation of aromatic ketones, alkyl aldehyde isomerization, hydroacylation, and the dehydrogenation of alkoxy silanes to generate silyl enol ethers. [...] Recent work on alkane metathesis has received attention.|$|R
5|$|When Saladin {{restored}} Sunni orthodoxy in Egypt, 10 madrasas {{were established}} during his reign, {{and an additional}} 25 during the entire Ayyubid period of rule. Each of their locations had religious, political, and economic significance, in particular those in al-Fustat. Most of the schools were dedicated to the Shafi'i denomination, but others belonged to the Maliki and Hanafi madhabs. The madrasas built near the tomb of Imam al-Shafi'i were located adjacent to the important centers of pilgrimage and were <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> Sunni devotion. About 26 schools were built in Egypt, Jerusalem and Damascus by high-ranking government officials, and unusual for the time, commoners also founded in Egypt about 18 schools, including two medical institutions.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
5|$|Colbourn {{established}} the university's honors program, {{and started the}} university's first satellite branch campus. In addition, Colbourn was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park, located adjacent to the UCF campus and founded in 1978. The park serves as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> simulation for space and defense-related research. The park was one part of Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led the push to found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989. However, Colbourn's most notable accomplishments as president were supporting the young university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's football program in 1979, which began an era of growth for the university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> third <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> New Jersey Audubon's efforts lies in {{sponsoring}} {{research on}} New Jersey's environment and wildlife. Such research includes hawk watches at Montclair, Sandy Hook, and Cape May to monitor long-term trends in raptor populations, using radar and other tools to identify crucial habitat for migrating songbirds under the [...] "Oases Along the Flyway" [...] program, and monitoring populations of breeding bird {{species in the}} Hackensack Meadowlands.|$|R
50|$|As {{the central}} {{axis of the}} Latin Quarter, {{it has long been}} a hotbed of student life and activism, but tourism is also <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{commercial}} <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the street and designer shops have gradually replaced many small bookshops.

5|$|The series {{focuses on}} a high school show choir, {{also known as a}} glee club, in the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio. Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) takes over the glee club after the former teacher Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) is fired for {{inappropriate}} contact with a male student. With a rag-tag group of misfit teenagers, Will attempts to restore the glee club to its former glory while tending to his developing feelings for his co-worker, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), as well as defending the glee club's existence from the conniving cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the series is the students in the glee club: their relationships as couples, their love of singing and desire for popularity coming into conflict due to their membership in the low-status club, and the many vicissitudes of life in high school and as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> current research in neurophysiology.|$|E

40|$|The {{mitigation}} of {{co-channel interference}} (CCI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) has been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> area <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> researchers in wireless communications. An approach of interest separates CCI cancellation and ISI equalization {{in a slow}} frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel into two stages. A space-time filter reduces the CCI, followed by a Viterbi equalizer for ISI equalization. The complexity of the Viterbi equalizer can be reduced by using a filter for channel shortening. I am investigating various ways to design a space-time finite-impulse response (FIR) filter which would perform joint CCI cancellation and channel shortening, while maximizing a signal-to-interference-plus-noise-like objective function. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{early years}} saw major {{participation}} from amateur designers including Rodney March, {{who went on}} to design the Tornado which was adopted as an Olympic class for competition. His most radical contribution at that time was a wing mast/soft sail combination una-rig which was untouchable particularly in light airs. The superior wing-sails subsequently became <b>a</b> <b>major</b> design <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the class, and the C Class {{has been one of the}} only proving grounds for wing-sail development and racing.|$|R

50|$|The Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) program {{developed}} and promoted {{the application of}} new electronic tagging technology to study the marine life history of Pacific salmon. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> area <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the POST project involved {{the development of a}} permanent continental-scale marine telemetry system. POST's array sits on the seabed of the continental shelf and upstream in several major rivers and is used to monitor the movements of not only salmon but many other types of marine animals along the shelf. Tracking data generated from the array can be applied toward the development of fishery management policies aimed at the sustainable harvest of resources, and to the understanding and conservation of other marine and diadromous species.|$|R
40|$|The {{search space}} of rooted phylogenetic trees is vast and <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{research}} <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> recent decades {{has been the}} development of algorithms to effectively navigate this space. However this space is tiny {{when compared with the}} space of rooted phylogenetic networks, and navigating this enlarged space remains a poorly understood problem. This, and the difficulty of biologically interpreting such networks, obstructs adoption of networks as tools for modelling reticulation. Here, we argue that the superimposition of biologically motivated constraints, via an SQL-style language, can both stimulate use of network software by biologists and potentially significantly prune the search space.

The student movement correctly noted that one major characteristic of advanced capitalist society was its burgeoning ideological institutions - particularly in edu cation and mass media. Consequently, <b>a</b> <b>major</b> tactical <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the new Left involved “demystifying” and “exposing” liberal insti tutions.
