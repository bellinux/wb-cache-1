What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as I think most of my colleagues around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves. Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics. One CEO said to me <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>ago,</b> 'Being a board member is starting to be fun again,' and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago." ...|$|E

25|$|With {{the death}} of Bart Bass, Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford) who is running the {{newspaper}} The Spectator, is no longer indebted to him (Bart paid his debts to control him) and he decides {{to find out for}} good who Gossip Girl is. Jack and Georgina Sparks (Michelle Trachtenberg) deal with the arrangements of Chuck and Blair's wedding. Before the ceremony, Serena and Blair have a conversation over why she is still talking to Dan after he published <b>a</b> negative chapter <b>about</b> her <b>a</b> few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b> Overhearing their conversation, Dan leaves and gives to Nate his final chapter, which is about Gossip Girl. Blair and Chuck are married by Cyrus (Wallace Shawn) and right after, the police arrive to question them. At the same time, everyone's phones ring: Dan's chapter has been published in The Spectator, in which he reveals that he is Gossip Girl. Various characters react over the Gossip Girl reveal, including Vanessa (Jessica Szohr), Juliet (Katie Cassidy), Agnes (Willa Holland) and Lola (Ella Rae Peck), as well as Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Rachel Bilson, preparing to audition for a role in the adaptation of Dan's book, is told of Gossip Girl's identity by Kristen Bell, who shares a conspiratorial wink with the audience. Dan finally explains why he created Gossip Girl and says Jenny (Taylor Momsen) knew it all along.|$|R
