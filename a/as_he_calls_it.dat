25|$|The Black Death ravaged Ireland 1348–49. One of {{the most}} vivid {{accounts}} of the plague was written by Friar John Clyn at Kilkenny, who thought that all mankind might die. He reports that particularly in the months of September and October, 1348, people came from all over Ireland to St. Mullins, County Carlow, including many no doubt from County Wexford, out of fear, to seek divine protection from the 'pestilence' <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> – {{as it was then}} very prevalent. He comments on how it was rare for only one member of a family to die, but that usually the entire family was wiped out. John Clyn himself is believed to have died in 1349 from the plague.|$|E
25|$|That 1975 map, {{the first}} Cahill-Keyes projection, {{launched}} a decades long quest to perfect it. One of his goals is a map with a 1:1 million scale, {{about half the}} size of a football field. Each one degree geocell would be large enough to stand in. While the physical Master Map <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> remains a dream, in 2010, his partner Mary Jo Graça, using Keyes's extensive calculations, plotted the entire projection and in 2011 digitized the entire map. Absent the physical version, a 9,000 square foot pdf of that full size map can be easily navigated on a home computer. It is the first contiguous world map at a resolution showing all one-degree geocells (except five degrees at the poles). Keyes likewise commissioned the first-ever one-degree globe from Joe Roubal in 2013.|$|E

Near the end of the game, he stands by Fujin's plea to the party to help save Seifer from himself. In the ending FMV, he celebrates catching a large fish until Fujin kicks him into the water.

500|$|Russell's view {{of human}} nature, like that of Thomas Hobbes, is {{somewhat}} pessimistic. By Russell's account, the desire to empower oneself is unique to human nature. No other animals besides Homo sapiens, he argues, are capable of being so unsatisfied with their lot, that they should try to accumulate more goods than meet their needs. The [...] "impulse to power", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> does not arise unless one's basic desires have been sated. (Russell 1938:3) Then the imagination stirs, motivating the actor to gain more power. In Russell's view, the love of power is nearly universal among people, although it takes on different guises from person to person. A person with great ambitions may become the next Caesar, but others may be content to merely dominate the home. (Russell 1938:9) ...|$|E

They note that Edward Bagnall Poulton had written approvingly of Thayer, and that Thayer had {{asserted}} that almost all animals were countershaded. They agree that countershading exists, but to his suggestion that it is universal [...] "we feel sorely tempted to poke fun at him", and promptly ask any reader who agrees with Thayer that every animal is countershaded {{to look at a}} flock of rooks at sunset. They admit that camouflage is in general advantageous, but point out that the different plumages of seasonally and sexually dimorphic birds cannot all be explained as camouflage, considering the conspicuous colours of the male birds: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} section of the Enquiry, Hume {{provides}} a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole. For Hume, philosophy can be split into two general parts: natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature (or, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "moral philosophy"). The latter investigates both actions and thoughts. He emphasizes in this section, by way of warning, that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion. However, he insists, precision helps art and craft of all kinds, including the craft of philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|Adam and Tender, then, steal a {{car that}} Fertility foretold would be {{unlocked}} in a particular parking lot. Attached to the dashboard is a little commercial figurine of Tender. The brothers, heading north to Canada, come to the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill on the way. As they drive through it, Adam begins recounting the way the Church leaders terrorized the children into fearing sex by forcing them to watch every time a woman went into labor. Tender denies this, but {{it is unclear whether}} he simply doesn't want to remember, or whether he actually can't remember because the trauma is buried so deep in his memory. Adam believes the only way to cure Tender is for Tender to have sex - to reject the Church doctrine at its core. Tender resists, and as Adam recounts the details of the [...] "mental castration" [...] (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it),</b> Tender loses control and crashes the car into a giant concrete pylon {{in the middle of the}} landfill.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{fragments}} of the work may not have survived. Bowring believes the work is difficult to define, that piecing it together is puzzling. He sees four discrete sections, beginning with the dated descriptions of the birth, followed by two undated sections of introspective vignettes, and a final dated section in chronological order. This [...] "strange arrangement", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> might {{be the result of}} stitching together a series of incomplete sources or fragments. The diary's text was used as a source for the Eiga Monogatari – a laudatory work about Michinaga and the Fujiwara clan, written or compiled in the 11th century – with entire sections copied verbatim from Murasaki's work. Yet the textual differences between the two suggests the Eiga Monogatori author had access to a different, perhaps more complete text of the diary than has survived. Bowring questions whether the current structure is original to Murasaki, {{and the degree to which}} it has been rearranged or rewritten since she authored it.|$|E

2500|$|On April 6, 1865, the 19th halted its {{march on}} a hill {{overlooking}} what William Wood would later assume to be Sayler's Creek (or [...] "Tayler's" [...] Creek, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> in the original manuscript). The men took this opportunity to cook some of their corn, but a fire had hardly been lit when Wood received orders to take his company and deploy them as skirmishers and drive a small body of Federals from some pines {{at the base of}} the hill. For the final time, the 19th Virginia formed a line of battle and, following Wood's Company A, marched down the hill into the thicket. After recapturing several pieces of artillery, the 19th continued on until they reached a road in a clearing. In front of them, thousands of Federal cavalrymen, probably from George A. Custer's Division, were forming for an attack. Rapidly preparing for the onslaught, the men of the 19th threw up a breastwork of fence rails in their front and prepared for the assault. Lieutenant Wood's account describes what happened next: ...|$|E
2500|$|Don Johnson as Detective James [...] "Sonny" [...] Crockett: An {{undercover}} detective of the Metro-Dade Police Department. A former University of Florida Gators football star, he {{sustained a}} knee fracture which {{put an end}} to his sports career. He was subsequently drafted by the US Army, and served in the 1st Cavalry Division and in the Special Forces. He served two tours in Vietnam – or <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> the [...] "Southeast Asia Conference". In 1975 he became a Metro-Dade uniformed patrol officer and later an undercover detective of the vice unit. Crockett's alias is Sonny Burnett, a drug runner and middleman. His vehicles include a Ferrari Daytona Spyder (later a Ferrari Testarossa), a [...] "Scarab" [...] offshore power-boat, and a sailboat on which he lives with his pet alligator Elvis (also a veteran of the Florida Gators). The name [...] "Sonny Crockett" [...] had previously been used for a criminal played by actor Dennis Burkley on Hill Street Blues in 1983, where creator Anthony Yerkovich was a writer. Coincidentally, Gregory Sierra who later played Crockett's boss on [...] "Vice" [...] appeared in the same episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{design for}} the film was handled by Martín Hernández, {{who has worked on}} all the director's feature films. The {{production}} sound his team was given was [...] "surprisingly perfect and clean", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it. The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. [...] "Normally Alejandro likes, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> 'the clashing of the sounds.' The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on Birdman because here, everything is flowing." [...] Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task since the camera was nearly always moving. Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film. When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order [...] "to have distance, and closeness and resonance" [...] the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as [...] "crazy". A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers. Hernández said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound [...] "provokes more 'explosions'" [...] than that created by images, and that in Birdman [...] "Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film." ...|$|E
