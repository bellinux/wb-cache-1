25|$|Royal Navy {{officers}} {{assigned to}} the Fishery Protection Squadron have a secondary role as British Sea Fisheries officers. There is a formal contract between the Ministry of Defence, the Marine and Fisheries Agency and DEFRA that allows the squadron to conduct inspections of all fishing vessels in all UK (excepting Scottish) waters. Fishery Protection Squadron vessels can also stop British fishing vessels in international waters. In the 2008/09 contract year, the squadron spent 700 days at sea on patrol, conducting 1,102 inspections. From the inspections, 231 ships broke UK or EU law. As a result, 144 verbal warnings, 33 written warnings and 10 financial <b>administrative</b> <b>penalties</b> were handed out. The most serious breaches resulted in eight vessels being detained at UK ports. When a vessel is detained, {{the captain of the}} squadron ship contacts the DEFRA operation centre in London, which formulates a decision based on information provided to it by ships, aircraft, district fishery inspectors and fishermen, and then relays this decision back to the fishery protection ship.|$|E

It specifically identified [...] "the therapeutic and business relationships" [...] as constituting McGraw's sole issue with the board. McGraw fulfilled all terms of the board's requirements, and the board closed its complaint file in June 1990.|$|E

Other methods for coping with the new workload will include increased reliance on criminal penalties, citizen enforcement efforts, field citations, strategic planning, and <b>administrative</b> <b>penalty</b> orders...|$|R
