5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> vampire {{sightings}} in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings {{to identify and}} kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, {{the first to be}} officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} in the 18th century, there was <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> vampire {{sightings}} in Transylvania, with frequent stakings and grave diggings taking place to identify and kill the potential revenants; even government officials were compelled into the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in what could only be called a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities.

Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich soon supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood. In the second case, Arnold Paole, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while haying. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Paole had returned to prey on the neighbours.|$|E

25|$|On June 22, 1941, Germany {{attacked}} the Soviet Union. In spite of non-aggression pacts or trade connections, Hitler's assault threw {{the world into}} <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> re-aligning political outlooks and strategic prospects.|$|E
25|$|Taylor's {{murder on}} 1 February 1922, {{along with other}} Hollywood scandals, such as the Roscoe Arbuckle trial, led to <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> sensationalist and often {{fabricated}} newspaper reports. The murder remains an official cold case.|$|E

25|$|Several {{railways}} obtained their Acts of Parliament on {{the same}} day as the Caledonian, on 31 July 1845. There was <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> railway promotion in that year, and it seemed as if every locality must have its own line. The Scottish Central Railway had been described above; the Scottish Midland Junction Railway (SMJR), the Aberdeen Railway and the Dundee and Perth Railway also got their Acts {{on the same}} day.|$|E
25|$|The {{re-establishment}} of the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy in England in 1850 by Pope Pius IX, {{was followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> anti-Catholic feeling, often stoked by newspapers. Examples include an effigy of Cardinal Wiseman, {{the new head of}} the restored hierarchy, being paraded through the streets and burned on Bethnal Green, and graffiti proclaiming 'No popery!' being chalked on walls. Charles Kingsley wrote a vigorously anti-Catholic book Hypatia (1853). The novel was mainly aimed at the embattled Catholic minority in England, who had recently emerged from a half-illegal status.|$|E
50|$|On September 14, 1993, Djerf went on <b>a</b> seven-hour <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> violence, {{experimenting with}} various methods of killing before he resorted to {{shooting}} and stabbing to death {{four members of}} a former friend's family.|$|R

25|$|The ship's {{arrival in}} New York led to <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> press interest, with {{newspapers}} competing {{to be the}} first to report the survivors' stories. Some reporters bribed their way aboard the pilot boat New York, which guided Carpathia into harbour, and one even managed to get onto Carpathia before she docked. Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards. It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard Titanic.|$|E
25|$|MGR {{never fully}} {{recovered}} from his illness and died on 24 December 1987 at 3:30am in his Ramavaram Gardens residence in Manapakkam after his prolonged illness. He was almost 71. His death sparked off <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> looting and rioting {{all over the}} state. Shops, cinemas, buses and other public and private property became the target of violence let loose. The police had to resort issuing shoot-at-sight orders. Schools and colleges immediately announced the holidays till the situation came in control. The violence during the funeral alone left 29 people dead and 47 police personnel badly wounded.|$|E
25|$|Not all bands {{took part}} in Traoré's roots revival. Les Ambassadeurs du Motel formed in 1971, playing popular songs {{imported}} from Senegal, Cuba and France. Les Ambassadeurs and Rail Band were the two biggest bands in the country, and a fierce rivalry developed. Salif Keita, perhaps the most popular singer of the time, defected to Les Ambassadeurs in 1972. This {{was followed by a}} major concert at which both bands performed as part of the Kibaru (literacy) program. The audience fell into <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> excitement and unity, and the concert is still remembered as one of the defining moments in 1970s Malian music.|$|E

25|$|In 1831, Nat Turner, a literate slave {{who claimed}} to have spiritual visions, {{organized}} a slave rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia; it was sometimes called the Southampton Insurrection. Turner and his followers killed nearly 60 white inhabitants, mostly women and children. Many {{of the men in the}} area were attending a religious event in North Carolina. Eventually Turner was captured with 17 other rebels, who were subdued by the militia. Turner and his followers were hanged, and Turner's body was flayed. In <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> fear and retaliation, the militia killed more than 100 slaves who had not been involved in the rebellion. Planters whipped hundreds of innocent slaves to ensure resistance was quelled.|$|E

25|$|King Marke leads {{a hunting}} party {{out into the}} night, leaving Isolde and Brangäne alone in the castle, who both stand beside a burning brazier. Isolde, {{listening}} to the hunting horns, believes several times that the hunting party is far enough away to warrant the extinguishing of the brazier – the prearranged signal for Tristan to join her ("Nicht Hörnerschall tönt so hold"). Brangäne warns Isolde that Melot, one of King Marke's knights, has seen the amorous looks exchanged between Tristan and Isolde and suspects their passion ("Ein Einz'ger war's, ich achtet' es wohl"). Isolde, however, believes Melot to be Tristan's most loyal friend, and, in <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> desire, extinguishes the flames. Brangäne retires to the ramparts to keep watch as Tristan arrives.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps Susan was unjust in {{connecting}} Mr. Pryor's {{smile with}} {{the sinking of}} the Lusitania, news of which circulated an hour later when the mail was distributed.

25|$|The Glasgow and Edinburgh lines {{combined}} at Carstairs in Clydesdale, and {{the route}} then crossed over Beattock summit {{and continued on}} through Annandale. The promoters had engaged in <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> provisional acquisitions of other lines being put forward or already being constructed, as they considered it was vital to secure territory to their own control and to exclude competing concerns as far as possible. However, if they hoped to operate the only Anglo-Scottish route, they were disappointed. The North British Railway opened between Edinburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed on 22 June 1846, forming part of what has become the East Coast Main Line. The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway had opened in 1841 with the declared intention of reaching Carlisle by way of Dumfries; it did so in 1850, changing its name then to the Glasgow and South Western Railway.|$|E
25|$|Cave {{diving in}} the Philippines is {{happening}} in earnest following discovery of Pawod Underwater Cave in Mactan Island, off the big island of Cebu in the Central Philippines. Pawod was discovered in 2001 by Dr. Alfonso Amores, a cave diver certified in the underwater cave systems of North Central Florida. The discovery opened cave diving for the locals who erstwhile could not afford the expensive course in Florida. In 2012, Jake Miranda, Dr. Alfonso Amores and Bernil H. Gastardo founded the Filipino Cave Divers (FCD). <b>A</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> explorations opened the freshwater caves of Casili, Balamban in Cebu Island and Enchanted River Underwater Cave in Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur in the big southern island of Mindanao. Several more caves in Mindanao have since been discovered and explored - Bababu Lake (Dinagat Island), Pamutuanan Cave (Lianga, Surigao del Sur) and Campomento Cave (Lanuza, Surigao del Sur).|$|E
25|$|The Boer {{government}} handed their raid prisoners {{over to the}} British for trial. Dr. Jameson {{was tried}} in England for leading the raid. However, the British press and London society inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and in <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> jingoism, lionised Dr. Jameson and treated him as a hero. Although sentenced to 15 months imprisonment (which he served in Holloway), Jameson was later rewarded by being named Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904–08) and ultimately anointed {{as one of the}} founders of the Union of South Africa. For conspiring with Jameson, the uitlander members of the Reform Committee (Transvaal) were tried in the Transvaal courts and found guilty of high treason. The four leaders were sentenced to death by hanging, but this sentence was next day commuted to 15 years' imprisonment; and in June 1896, the other members of the Committee were released on payment of £2,000 each in fines, all of which were paid by Cecil Rhodes. One Reform Committee member, Frederick Gray, had committed suicide while in Pretoria gaol, on 16 May, and his death was a factor in softening the Transvaal government's attitude to the remaining prisoners.|$|E
50|$|In a later issue, set {{after the}} events of the film, Ironhide aids the human {{military}} in hunting Scorponok. The Decepticon attacks Ironhide and uses his tongue to drill into the Autobot's neck, sending him into <b>a</b> <b>frenzy.</b> One <b>of</b> the humans manages to fire at Scorponok's tongue. Ironhide regains control and smashes Scorponok to death.|$|R
50|$|This {{resulted}} in <b>a</b> real <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> badge engineering, as {{one could see}} Avia-badged Jeeps, Ebro-badged Alfa-Romeos, and so on. Meanwhile, Ebro introduced tilt-cab Ford 'D'-Series derived models for loads of between l'/2 and 7 tons and gradually added new models until the range covered 2- and 3-axle rigids and articulated types from 3 to 27 tons capacity.|$|R
