5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> government write off the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E

By February 1999, Siemens had given up trying to fix the locomotives, although they had established that the main fault lay in the generators. The issue never reached the courts. On 5 May 1999, the companies announcement that they had reached an agreement for the trains to be returned to Siemens, and NOK485 million be compensated to NSB. This was in addition to NOK80 million which had already been given as discount. In addition to the purchase price, the compensation included interest and coverage for NSB's extra expenses. The locomotives were immediately dismounted of NSB-owned equipment and on 20May sent by ship to Hamburg.|$|E

Since 1947, Indiana had been under a law that preventing it from accepting any money from the federal government except in cases specifically allowed by the General Assembly. This law had been enacted following the Great Depression and the government's fear at that time of the domination it had come under after accepting major amounts of money from the federal government, and the strings that came attached to it.

25|$|Once work on {{the actual}} Chrono Cross started, the initial vision beyond {{character}} recruitment was even more expansive. The game initially {{was intended to be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> player recruit any person they encountered, through either interacting or battling them. However, eventually the development team found this to be too ambitious, and narrowed it down to 64 playable characters, and then again down to 45 characters for the final game, which were then drawn by character designer Nobuteru Yūki. The backgrounds of some minor characters were left to members of the staff. The development team also considered the idea of having each character have their own ending, each with three variant scenarios based on events occurred in the game, leading to over 120 endings, but the idea was scrapped as being not feasible.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of property reflected {{the circumstances of}} the abbey's foundation by a powerful territorial dynasty that maintained its interest in the Marches for at least two centuries. As William FitzAlan was always recognised as founder, a Henry II's charter of about 1176 gave his successors custody of the abbey whenever the position of abbot was vacant. The first William FitzAlan was buried in Shrewsbury Abbey, but subsequent heads of the family were buried at Haughmond for over 150 years. Even after the FitzAlans acquired the prestigious earldom of Arundel in 1243, they continued to regard the abbey as theirs and to call the canons canonici mei. When Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel was executed at Hereford in 1326, his body was buried there, despite his wish to be buried at Haughmond. Abbot Nicholas of Longnor protested and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> body transferred to Haughmond.|$|E

25|$|Peter Herdic {{used his}} wealth to gain {{political}} power in Williamsport and Lycoming County, and led the drive to have Williamsport chartered as a city in 1866. He spent $20,000 to get elected mayor of Williamsport in 1869. Local saloon keepers reported that Herdic would leave $10 and $20 bills among the bottles of their taverns for anybody that would vote {{for him in the}} election. Prior to Herdic's arrival, the Newberry section of Williamsport was known as Jaysburg and had vied with Williamsport to be the county seat of Lycoming County. Herdic saw to it that the rival community on the west bank of Lycoming Creek would no longer compete with Williamsport by leading the cause to annex the community to Williamsport. Herdic had such influence that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia and Erie Railroad move their passenger station from the Pine Street area to his Herdic Hotel on West Fourth Street. Herdic was able to profit from this since the trains would now deposit their passengers at the door of his opulent hotel.|$|E
25|$|Psyonix had {{previously}} developed Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars in 2008 for the PlayStation 3. That title itself bore out from previous modifications that Psyonix' founder, Dave Hagewood, {{had done for}} Unreal Tournament 2003 by expanding out vehicle-based gameplay that Epic Games had already set {{in place in the}} engine into a new game mode called Onslaught. For this, Hagewood was hired as a contractor by Epic for Unreal Tournament 2004 specifically for incorporating the Onslaught mode as an official part of the game. Hagewood used his experience at Epic to found Psyonix. Among other contract projects, Psyonix worked {{to try to find a}} way to make racing the Unreal vehicles in a physics-based engine enjoyable. They had toyed with several options such as race modes or mazes, but found that when they added a ball to the arena to be pushed by the vehicles, they had hit upon the right formula, which would become Battle-Cars. Further to the success was the addition of the rocket-powered cars; this originally was to be a simple speed boost, but with the physics engine, they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> vehicles fly off and around the arena, furthering the possibilities for gameplay.|$|E

Restaurants, theaters, and street musicians were paid to play the song, while handbills with the lyrics were distributed when the song was performed publicly to help listeners to quickly learn the song. Using the nationwide network of music distribution controlled by Tin Pan Alley, Dresser's publishing company was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> song well advertised, which pushed sales on a large scale.

500|$|At Corfu {{the prisoners}} were {{confined}} but the wounded were still not provided with treatment: Thompson was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> musket ball removed from his arm when Mulberry was smuggled aboard Généreux in Corfu harbour without Lejoille's knowledge or permission. The British officers were eventually paroled and returned to Britain, although the carpenter Thomas Jarrat was detained because he refused to supply Lejoille with the specifications of Leanders masts. Most of the ship's regular seamen were held prisoner at Corfu. They were subsequently encouraged to join the French Navy, Lejoille attempting to enlist them on Généreux when a Russian squadron blockaded the port. Lejoille's demands were met with a response from a maintopman named George Bannister, who called out [...] "No, you damned French rascal, give us back our little ship, and we'll fight you again until we sink". Généreux subsequently escaped from Corfu and anchored off Brindisi, where Lejoille was killed by artillery fire from the Neapolitan castle overlooking the town. The ship was captured in a battle in February 1800 by a squadron under Nelson, off Malta. Leander was captured by a Russian force that seized Corfu in March 1799 and was returned to the Royal Navy by Tsar Paul, along with the sailors held on the island.|$|E
