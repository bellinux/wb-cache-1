5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities <b>are</b> <b>individuals</b> that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups <b>are</b> <b>individuals</b> that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E
5|$|Typically, most {{forensic}} anthropologists perform forensic casework on {{a part-time}} basis, however there <b>are</b> <b>individuals</b> {{who work in}} the field full-time usually with federal or international agencies.

5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there <b>are</b> <b>individuals</b> who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the established monasteries, some parishes also have among their members Benedictine oblates. Some are associated with Christminster Monastery, while others are not associated with any particular monastery and thus are not oblates in the traditional Roman Catholic sense.

25|$|In Batesian mimicry, an aposematic {{inedible}} {{model has}} an edible mimic.

An example {{can be found in}} the Plain Tiger (Danaus chrysippus), a non-edible butterfly, which is mimicked by multiple species, the most similar being the female Danaid Eggfly (Hypolimnas misippus).|$|E
