5|$|Snake {{enters the}} {{facility}} via an air vent and locates the first hostage, DARPA Chief Donald Anderson. Anderson reveals that Metal Gear REX can be deactivated {{with a secret}} detonation override code, but dies of a heart attack. Colonel Campbell's niece Meryl Silverburgh, held hostage in an adjoining cell, helps Snake escape. Snake locates another hostage, ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker, but is confronted by FOXHOUND member Revolver Ocelot. Their gunfight is interrupted by a mysterious cyborg ninja who cuts off Ocelot's right hand. Baker briefs Snake on the Metal Gear project and advises him to contact Meryl, whom he gave <b>a</b> <b>PAL</b> card that might prevent the launch, but he too dies of a sudden heart attack.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 {{video game}} console has {{a library of}} games, which were {{primarily}} released in plastic ROM cartridges. Two small indentations {{on the back of}} each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, while Europe has <b>a</b> <b>PAL</b> lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.|$|E

25|$|In 2000 when Manga and Madman Entertainment {{released}} Ninja Scroll on DVD, Madman mistakenly {{used the}} UK {{cut of the}} film instead of using the uncut Australian version. This was rectified in 2004 when Manga Entertainment released the 10th Anniversary Special Edition of Ninja Scroll into western countries, and both Australia and the UK received Ninja Scroll uncut and remastered from <b>a</b> <b>PAL</b> VHS source. In Canada the film was given an 18A rating, while it was released Unrated in the United States. The film was released on Blu-ray in Japan on May 23, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Danny Goldberg from Gold Village Entertainment {{opined that}} the Parental Advisory label offered minimal value other than [...] "being {{a way for}} certain {{retailers}} like Wal-Mart to brand themselves as 'family friendly'"; he felt that children were successful in getting content they desired [...] "even before the Internet", and believed that the label had little impact on sales figures. In contrast, the RIAA maintains that [...] "it's not <b>a</b> <b>PAL</b> Notice that kids look for, it's the music". They stated that research they had gathered revealed that [...] "kids put limited weight on lyrics in deciding which music they like, caring more about rhythm and melody" [...] and implied that the label is not a deciding factor for a given purchase. Tom Cole from NPR commented that the Parental Advisory label has become [...] "a fact of music-buying life", which {{made it difficult for}} current consumers to understand the widespread controversy that came about from its introduction.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost, but a {{surviving}} synopsis {{of the film}} {{was published in the}} The Moving Picture World on June 11, 1910. It states: [...] "Turner, a man of bad character, conducts an inn in the country. His stepdaughter Grace is his trudge. When on an errand to the village she meets Jack, wealthy young man. He is much attracted by her. Jack goes to the bank and draws a large sum of money. Hank, <b>a</b> <b>pal</b> of Turner, sees him and tries to ambush him on the road, but fails. Then he goes ahead to tell Turner. Jack, on his trip, meets Grace. Nearly exhausted, he takes her home, and thus seems to play directly {{into the hands of the}} villains. They steal his revolver, and would drug him, were it not for the fact that Grace writes a warning on the wall with wine. Jack, aided by Grace, escapes but the girl is wounded. Jack marries Grace." ...|$|E

500|$|The VR Disc {{was also}} {{released}} in the PAL region as a [...] "data disc" [...] titled Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions on October 29, 1999. Unlike the Japanese and American versions, Special Missions requires <b>a</b> <b>PAL</b> copy of the original Metal Gear Solid {{in order to be}} played. This change was done since the original Metal Gear Solid was released in multiple languages in Europe and Special Missions determines the language it uses based on which version of the original game the player owns. When the Special Missions disc is loaded into the PlayStation console, the game will ask the player to switch the disc with the first disc from Metal Gear Solid in order to load voice and language data before asking the player to switch back to the Special Missions disc to start the game. This requirement renders Special Missions incompatible with PlayStation 2 consoles made prior to the SCPH-70000 model.|$|E
500|$|Chrono Cross shipped 850,000 {{units in}} Japan and 650,000 abroad. It was re-{{released}} {{once in the}} United States as a Sony Greatest Hits title and again {{as part of the}} Japanese Ultimate Hits series. Chrono Cross was also released on the PlayStation Network in Japan on July 6, 2011, and in North America on November 8, 2011, but <b>a</b> <b>PAL</b> region release has not been announced. Critics praised the game's complex plot, innovative battle system, varied characters, moving score, vibrant graphics, and success in breaking convention with its predecessor. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Chrono Cross a Gold Award, scoring it 10/10/9.5 in their three reviewer format; the first review declared the game to be [...] "a masterpiece, plain and simple". GameSpot awarded the game a perfect 10, one of only fourteen games in the 40,000 games listed on Gamespot to have been given the score, and its Console Game of the Year Award for 2000. IGN gave the game a score of 9.7, and Cross appeared 89th in its 2008 Top 100 games list. Famitsu rated the game 36 out of 40 from four reviewers.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1984, Timex of Portugal {{developed}} and produced several Timex branded computers, including the Timex Computer 2048, highly {{compatible with the}} Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K, which was very successful in both Portugal and Poland. An NTSC version was also made, initially intended for a United States release, but it was sold only in Chile and Argentina. Timex of Portugal also made <b>a</b> <b>PAL</b> version of the TS2068, called the Timex Computer 2068 (or TC2068 for short) which had different buffers for both the ULA and the CPU, which significantly increased the compatibility with ZX Spectrum software {{when compared to the}} North American model (the TS2068). The expansion port was also modified and made to be 100% compatible with the ZX Spectrum's, which bypassed the need for a [...] "Twister Board" [...] expansion that the TS2068 needed {{in order to make it}} compatibile with ZX Spectrum expansion hardware. It also had the AY sound output routed to the monitor/TV speakers instead of the internal twitter. The software developed for the TC2068 is completely compatible with the TS2068, since the ROMs weren't altered. Timex of Portugal also developed a ZX Spectrum [...] "emulator" [...] on cartridge form that mapped the first 16kB exactly like the earlier TC2048 computer did. Several other upgrades were made available, including a BASIC64 cartridge that enabled the TC2068 to use high resolution (512x192) modes. Despite having an AY-3-8912 sound chip, it's not connected in the same ports as in the ZX Spectrum 128K, rendering the TC2084 incompatible with the AY sound that the Spectrum 128K games produced. Due to all its advantages compared to the usual TS2068, a North American company, Zebra Systems, licensed the Timex TC2068 and sold it in the United States as the Zebra Silver Avenger. They also sold the FDD 3000 as the Zebra FDD 3000 in a silver case (as opposed to the European black cases) to match their colour scheme. Timex of Portugal was working on a successor to the TC2068 called the TC3256, using a Z80A CPU and featuring 256kB of RAM, which would feature a ZX Spectrum BASIC operating mode and a CP/M operating mode, but the company pulled the plug on its development since that by the end of 1989, the 8bit market was no longer profitable. Only one complete and fully working prototype of the TC3256 was made.|$|E

2500|$|The current [...] "Eurowhite" [...] livery, {{first used}} with the Short 360, was adopted in 1986 {{following}} PAL's corporate rebranding.

[...] The PAL logo is also painted on the winglets of aircraft that have them. The name [...] "Philippines", instead of [...] "Philippine Airlines", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that <b>a</b> <b>PAL</b> plane, especially when chartered by the President for official or state visits, is in fact the official air transport of the Philippine head of state. Any PAL aircraft with the callsign PR 001 is a special plane operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President of the Philippines.|$|E
