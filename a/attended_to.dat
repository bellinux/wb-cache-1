40|$|D ow nloaded from 2 This study {{investigated}} the neural basis of individual variation in emotion regulation, specifically the ability to reappraise negative stimuli so as to down-regulate negative affect. Brain functions in young adults were measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging during three conditions: (1) <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> neutral pictures; (2) <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative pictures; and (3) reappraising negative pictures. Resting-state functional connectivity was measured with amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) seed regions frequently associated with emotion regulation. Participants reported more negative affect after <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative than neutral pictures, and less negative affect following reappraisal. Both <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative versus neutral pictures and reappraising versus <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative pictures yielded widespread activations that were significantly right-lateralized for <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative pictures and left...|$|R
40|$|Social phobics exhibit an attentional bias for {{threat in}} probe {{detection}} and probe discrimination paradigms. Attention training programs, in which probes always replace nonthreatening cues, reduce attentional bias for threat and self-reported social anxiety. However, researchers have seldom included behavioral measures of anxiety reduction, {{and have never}} taken physiological measures of anxiety reduction. In the present study, we trained individuals with generalized social phobia (n = 57) <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> threat cues (<b>attend</b> <b>to</b> threat), <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> positive cues (<b>attend</b> <b>to</b> positive), or <b>to</b> alternately <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> both (control condition). We assessed not only self-reported social anxiety, but also behavioral and physiological measures of social anxiety.

40|$|There are few {{empirical}} studies that explore how managers at senior executive levels of international nongovernmental development organizations (INGDOs) conciliate multiple identities with purposeful strategic change. This article offers rich excerpts from high-level strategy meetings in two Member Organizations {{of a major}} INGDO and explores deeply embedded tensions in its organizational identity. In the case study, there were several identities in play simultaneously—“we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> donors, ” “we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> beneficiaries, ” “we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> the confederation, ” and finally “we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> ourselves. ” Strategic planning meetings were therefore fraught with tension over the balance between generalist versus specialist activities, organizational survival, autonomy, and image. Managers reconciled these tensions by creating a meta-identity of a “strategic organization”: “We may <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> different things but we <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> {{all of these things}} in a purposeful and directed way. ” As aid organizations become ever larger and more complex, there i...|$|R

5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears a {{pregnant}} woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a doctor, Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be <b>attended</b> <b>to</b> by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be <b>attended</b> <b>to,</b> and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
