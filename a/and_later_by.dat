5|$|From 10 July 1925, {{until his}} death in 1969, Meher Baba was silent. He communicated first by using an {{alphabet}} board <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> unique hand gestures which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his mandali, usually by his disciple Eruch Jessawala. Meher Baba said that his silence was not undertaken as a spiritual exercise but solely in connection with his universal work.|$|E

5|$|A {{scheme for}} an {{extension}} of the Avon Navigation was proposed in 1766, but canals did not reach the coalfield for almost another 50 years. In 1794 coal proprietors formed a committee to construct the Somerset Coal Canal with two branches into the Cam Brook and Wellow Brook Valleys, and from a junction at Midford, to join the proposed Kennet and Avon Canal at the Dundas Aqueduct near Bath. Coal was transported by the Somerset Coal Canal <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> the Bristol and North Somerset Railway and Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which were accessed from the pits by a series of tramways. After 1854, when the first railway line was opened, the tonnage carried by the coal canal declined rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} an apprenticeship, Evans {{went into}} business for himself. By the early 1850s, he {{had established a}} reputation as a printer of covers for a type of cheap novels known as yellow-backs. In the early 1860s, he began to print children's toy books and picture books in association with the printing house Routledge and Warne. His intention was to produce books for children that were beautiful and inexpensive. For three decades he produced multiple volumes each year, first illustrated by Crane, <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> Caldecott and Greenaway.|$|E

5|$|An {{energetic}} and ambitious ruler, Michael Shishman led an aggressive but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, {{which ended in}} the disastrous battle of Velbazhd which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political hegemony of the Bulgarian Empire over the Balkans {{and the last one}} who attempted to seize Constantinople. He was succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> his nephew Ivan Alexander, who reversed his policy by forming an alliance with Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> Lai {{suggest that}} Planet Nine could {{be responsible for}} inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E

5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E
5|$|Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial {{writers have}} {{reported}} in their chronicles {{the use of}} tunjos for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the New Kingdom of Granada have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies. Caciques of Tuta, Toca, Duitama, Iguaque, Ramiriquí, Chitagoto, Onzaga, Tunja and Cucunubá participated in these rituals. The religious leader of Sogamoso was still the most important in these days.|$|E
5|$|Between 1979 and 1982, Merrick's {{life story}} {{became the basis}} of several works of {{dramatic}} art; these {{were based on the}} accounts of Treves and Montagu. In 1979, a Tony Award-winning play, The Elephant Man, by American playwright Bernard Pomerance was staged. The character based on Merrick was played by Philip Anglim, <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> David Bowie and Mark Hamill. In 1980, a film The Elephant Man, directed by David Lynch, was released; it received eight Academy Award nominations. Merrick was played by John Hurt and Frederick Treves by Anthony Hopkins. In 1982, US television network ABC broadcast an adaptation of Pomerance's play, starring Anglim.|$|E

5|$|Bute's father, John, Lord Mount Stuart, died a {{few months}} after he was born and as a young child he was brought up first by his mother, the former Lady Elizabeth McDougall-Crichton, <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>by</b> his {{paternal}} grandfather, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute. He travelled widely across Europe before attending Cambridge University. He contracted an eye condition and remained partially sighted {{for the rest of his}} life. Having inherited large estates across Britain, he married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818, and together they lived a relatively secluded life in Mount Stuart House in Scotland, one of Bute's four seats. Bute was dour but industrious, with a flair for land management. He focused his daily routine around extensive correspondence with his estate managers, making biennial tours of his lands around the country. The couple did not conceive any children, and Maria died in 1841. Bute remarried four years later, to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, and she gave birth to Bute's only child, John, in 1847.|$|E

5|$|Denmark Street is {{a street}} {{on the edge}} of London's West End running from Charing Cross Road to St Giles High Street.
