5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of <b>air-delivered</b> nuclear weapons. However the inability to field an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an <b>air-delivered</b> weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E

25|$|The M125 bomblet was a U.S. {{chemical}} sub-munition {{designed to}} deliver the nerve agent sarin. It was brought into service in 1954 with the M34 cluster bomb {{as part of the}} first U.S. <b>air-delivered</b> nerve agent weapon.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{as part of}} the Air Forces' {{strategic}} plan to guide the service into the 21st century, the Air Force Development Test Center became the Air Force Materiel Command's Air Armament Center (AAC), responsible for development, acquisition, testing, and fielding all <b>air-delivered</b> weapons.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} recorded use {{of explosive}} ordnance {{of any type}} from an aircraft occurred on November 1, 1911, when Italian pilot Giulio Gavotti dropped several, grapefruit-sized cipelli grenades on Ottoman positions in Libya - Gavotti's raid caused no casualties, functionally only resulting in the earliest known case of <b>air-delivered</b> harassing fire — but marked the first known use of an aircraft for military combat purposes.|$|E
25|$|AFRL/RW develops, demonstrates, and {{transitions}} {{science and}} technology for air-launched munitions for defeating ground fixed, mobile/relocatable, air and space targets to assure pre-eminence of U.S. air and space forces. The directorate conducts basic research, exploratory development, and advanced development and demonstrations. It also participates in programs focused on technology transfer, dual-use technology and small business development. The directorate is dedicated to providing the Air Force with a strong revolutionary and evolutionary technology base upon which future <b>air-delivered</b> munitions can be developed to neutralize potential threats to the United States.|$|E
25|$|The M125 bomblet was a sub-munition of the M34 cluster bomb, {{which was}} first brought into regular service by the United States Army in 1954. In {{development}} the M125 {{was known as}} the E54R6 bomblet (shortened to E54). The M34 and its payload of M125s was the first <b>air-delivered</b> nerve agent weapon in the U.S. chemical arsenal. Later, the Chemical Corps developed chemical-biological warheads for multiple missile systems including, Matador, Rascal, Snark, and Navaho missiles. These warheads incorporated the M125 bomblet and the M114 bomblet. Over 21,000 of the M125 containing M34 bombs were destroyed at Rocky Mountain Arsenal in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Bombsights {{on older}} {{aircraft}}, like the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the later B-50, {{were left in}} their wartime state. When the Korean War opened, these aircraft were pressed into service and the Norden once again became the USAF's primary bombsight. This occurred again when the Vietnam War started; in this case retired World War II technicians had to be called up {{in order to make}} the bombsights operational again. Its last use in combat was by the Naval Air Observation Squadron Sixty-Seven (VO-67), during the Vietnam War. The bombsights were used in Operation Igloo White for implanting <b>Air-Delivered</b> Seismic Intrusion Detectors (ADSID) along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
25|$|The heavy {{footprint}} of US operations {{can also}} be seen in its bombing campaign. More than twice the tonnage of bombs dropped during the entire World War II Pacific War was deposited on the South by the US. Over 7,000,000 tons of bombs were delivered in total by the Americans. Some 60% of this fell within the territory of its ally, South Vietnam. Another 1.5 million tons of bombs were unloaded on Laos and Cambodia. America's main enemy North Vietnam received approximately one million tons of bombs- between 10–15% of the total. The bombs left over 25 million craters on {{an area the size of}} New Mexico (121,666 square miles), and heavily damaged over half the forests of South Vietnam and 60% of its hamlets. Overall, approximately three times the amount of bombs dropped in World War II were dropped on Vietnam as a whole, making it the most bombed country in history. Along with bombs some 400,000 tons of napalm were dropped and some 19.1 million gallons of herbicides were applied. Most of this amount, like that of <b>air-delivered</b> bombs, also fell on the territory of South Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|The first sensors {{utilized}} {{by the program}} were <b>Air-Delivered</b> Seismic Intrusion Detector (ADSID), which had been developed from devices then in use in underground mapping for the oil industry. The device could sense vertical earth motion {{by the use of}} an internal geophone and could determine whether a man or a vehicle was in motion at a range of [...] and [...] respectively. The first acoustic sensors were developed from the U.S. Navy's Project Jezebel anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys, which recorded and processed sound by the utilization of an audio spectrum analyzer. The first model of seismic detectors (Phase I) outshone their contemporary acoustic types in {{the quality and quantity of}} the information they reported. The Phase I models of both the acoustic and seismic sensors were only available for operation in a continuous mode, which meant that under normal conditions, their lithium batteries would function for approximately 30 days.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson was {{promoted}} to General on July 1, 1975, when he assumed the office of Commandant of the Marine Corps. As Commandant, General Wilson repeatedly stressed modernization of the post-Vietnam Marine Corps. He insisted on force readiness, responsiveness, and mobility by maintaining fast-moving, hard-hitting expeditionary units, each consisting of a single integrated system of modern ground- and <b>air-delivered</b> firepower, tactical mobility, and electronic countermeasures.

The 96 TW reports to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB.|$|E
2500|$|Officially, the Weteye {{was known}} as the Mark 116, or Mk-116 bomb. While this was the {{official}} military nomenclature for the weapon, early in its production it acquired the nickname [...] "Weteye". Weteye was derived {{from the fact that the}} weapon was filled with a liquid nerve agent, sarin, thus the [...] "wet" [...] portion of the name. The [...] "eye" [...] portion of the name was associated with it being developed by the US Navy at China Lake as part of its eye-series weapon program (bombs guided by the [...] "Mark 1 eyeball"), a program intended to improve <b>air-delivered</b> munitions.|$|E

50|$|Concealed {{obstacles}} {{are used}} {{with the intention of}} not only preventing movement of enemy troops, but also causing casualties during attempted movement.

50|$|The Allies {{deployed}} acoustic mines, {{against which}} even wooden-hulled ships (in particular minesweepers) remained vulnerable.

This was profligate and ineffectual; used against acoustic mines at Penang, 200 bombs were needed to detonate just 13 mines.|$|E
