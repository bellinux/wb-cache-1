In a fire, the structure behind a sheet of drywall will remain relatively cool as water is lost from the gypsum, thus preventing (or substantially retarding) damage to the framing (through combustion of wood members or loss of strength of steel at high temperatures) and consequent structural collapse.

50|$|<b>Aluminothermy</b> {{started from}} the {{experiments}} of Russian scientist Nikolay Beketov at the University of Kharkiv in Ukraine, who proved that aluminium restored metals from their oxides under high temperatures. The reaction {{was first used}} for the carbon-free reduction of metal oxides. The reaction is highly exothermic, {{but it has a}} high activation energy since strong interatomic bonds in the solids must be broken first. The oxide was heated with aluminium in a crucible in a furnace. The runaway reaction made it possible to produce only small quantities of material. Hans Goldschmidt improved the aluminothermic process between 1893 and 1898, by igniting the mixture of fine metal oxide and aluminium powder by a starter reaction without heating the mixture externally. The process was patented in 1898 and used extensively in the later years for rail track welding.|$|E

5000|$|In 1849, Beketov {{graduated}} from Kazan University {{and worked with}} Nikolay Zinin. In 1855, he became a junior scientific assistant in the Department of Chemistry at Kharkov University. In 1859-1887, Beketov was {{a professor at the}} same university. In 1865, he defended his PhD thesis on [...] "Research into the phenomenon of displacement of one element by another" [...] ("Исследования над явлениями вытеснения одних металлов другими"). In 1886, Beketov moved to Saint Petersburg, where he worked at the academic chemical laboratory and taught at the University for Women. In 1890, Beketov delivered lectures on the [...] "Basics of Thermochemistry" [...] at Moscow State University. Beketov discovered displacement of metals from solutions of their salts by hydrogen under pressure. He also established that magnesium and zinc displaced other metals from their salts under high temperatures. In 1859-1865, Beketov proved that aluminum restored metals from their oxides under high temperatures. Later on, Beketov's experiments served {{as a starting point for}} <b>aluminothermy.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the {{vanadium}} recuperation {{found in the}} vanadium catalytic residues from the production of sulfuric acid, by <b>aluminothermy</b> processing method. From the stoichiometry of chemical reactions that must occur, mixtures were prepared and processed in a graphite reactor, conformed by mill scale, spent catalysts and aluminum. They were obtained alloys containing vanadium (0, 6 to 1, 76 %) and silicon (8, 90 to 17, 7 %). The technical feasibility of <b>aluminothermy</b> processing of the catalytic residues {{at the same time}} of mill scale and aluminum chip allows the recovery of their metal components and reduces the levels of the environmental pollution...|$|E

This waste is a complex material which is considered hazardous because of its behaviour {{in the presence of}} water or moisture. In these conditions, the dust can generate gases such as H 2, NH 3, CH 4, H 2 S, along with heat and potential <b>aluminothermy.</b> Only silica sand and calcium carbonate were added as external raw materials to complete the glasses formula.

40|$|Aluminium {{dust from}} {{aluminium}} remelting {{industry is a}} hazardous residue because of its high reactivity {{in the presence of}} water (production of ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulphide …), potential <b>aluminothermy</b> and its content in leaching heavy metals. In order to apply the new European Directive about landfill of waste, a Stabilization/Solidification (S/S) process was developed in the CENIM with the aim of decreasing its reactivity and to assure an easy transport and storage of the residue. Gypsum was used as a binder material. This work summarizes the study of the mechanical properties of the stabilized residue en comparison with the gypsum ones. The reactivity of the dust, before and after the S/S process was investigated by analysing the ammonia and metallic aluminium. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion is {{the cause}} of irretrievable loss of huge amounts of metals and alloys. The harmful effects of {{corrosion}} can be reduced significantly by applying appropriate methods of corrosion protection. One method to protect metals against corrosion is the formation of diffusion coatings on them. High corrosion resistance is typical for the boride diffusion layers. <b>Aluminothermy</b> {{is one of the main}} methods for diffusion saturation of the surface of metal products with various elements, including boron, and under certain conditions with aluminum, too. Samples of steel 45 were put to aluminothermic diffusion saturation with boron in a pressurized steel container at a temperature of 1100 K, for 6 hours in powdered aluminothermic mixtures. The content of В 2 О 3 in the starting mixtures decreased from the optimum - 20 % to 0 %, and the content of Al and the activator - (NH 4) 2. 4 BF 3 is constant, respectively 7 % and 0. 5 %. Al 2 O 3 was used as filler. The borided samples were tested for corrosion resistance in 10 % HCl for 72 hours. The results show that their corrosion resistance depends on the composition of the starting saturating mixture (mainly on the content of В 2 О 3), and respectively on the composition, structure, thickness and degree of adhesion of the layer to the metal base...|$|E
40|$|The aluminothermic process {{provides}} a cost-reduced production method for titanium and titanium alloys {{by reduction of}} TiO 2 with subsequent refining by electroslag remelting The <b>aluminothermy</b> involves high heating rates, high temperatures and short reactions times combined with a self-propagating behaviour of the reaction. By co-reduction of TiO 2 and oxides of alloying elements such as vanadium pentoxide, direct synthesis of a titanium alloy is possible. The use of rutile ore concentrates causes a further reduction of process steps. In order to charge rutile ore complex thermodynamic calculations are required taking enthalpy input of various bycomponents into account. The aluminothermic reduction is conventionally enhanced by a highly heatproviding reaction based on the reduction of KClO 4. In order to minimize the use of chlorine-based products extensive studies are made to investigate the feasibility of using mechanically activated rutile as input material for the aluminothermic process. Due to the mechanical activation the intrinsic enthalpy of the reaction is increased thus facilitates a process with reduced amount of KClO 4. A major challenge represents the determination of a compromise between low activation duration and reduced KClO 4 amount. In order to define the process window parameters like intrinsic chemical energy (enthalpy of the reaction mixture), equilibrium temperature and physical properties (particle size and mixing degree) were optimized. After adjusting the process parameters {{it is possible to}} save up to 42 % KClO 4 for the ATR reaction with 2 h activated input material. This reduction of KClO 4 material affects a decrease of the produced gaseous compounds and the subsequent off-gas cleaning system...|$|E
