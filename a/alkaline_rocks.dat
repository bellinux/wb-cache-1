2500|$|In {{the journal}} Science from September 2013, {{researchers}} described {{a different type}} of rock called [...] "Jake M" [...] or [...] "Jake Matijevic (rock),” It was the first rock analyzed by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer instrument on the Curiosity rover, and it was different from other known martian igneous rocks as it is alkaline (>15% normative nepheline) and relatively fractionated. Jake M is similar to terrestrial mugearites, a rock type typically found at ocean islands and continental rifts. Jake M discovery may mean that alkaline magmas may be more common on Mars than on Earth and that Curiosity could encounter even more fractionated <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks</b> (for example, phonolites and trachytes).|$|E
2500|$|It {{is found}} on {{or at the}} base of cliffs or sinkholes, on {{limestone}} or other <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks,</b> although specimens have also been reported from crevices in granite and sandstone. Growth on soil is rare. It may be found in forests or on boulders, ledges, and in crevices of cliffs. Plants grow at altitudes ranging from [...] (in North America) to [...] (in Guatemala). Plants at the higher altitudes ( [...] and above) are stunted and more compact than usual, with leaves [...] long and overlapping pinnae a few millimeters in length. These differences (observed in Guatemalan and Peruvian material) are believed to be due to environmental factors rather than any taxonomic distinction.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 112 Au-nuggets, {{collected}} from alluvial placer deposits of the Ingarinda River from the Guli massif, located in northem Siberia, Russia, were investigated. The Guli massif {{consists of a}} huge dunite-clinopyroxenite complex (the largest complex in the world), an alkaline to highly <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock</b> suite (melilite, nephelinite, ijolite) enveloping the dunite and carbonatite intrusions, associated with disseminated schlieren type chromitite and Au-Ag, Pt placer deposits. The nuggets are characterized by various sizes and shapes and show chemical compositions Au, Au-Ag and AuCu, typical for a derivate of carbon-atites and/or ultramafic complexes. A great variety of oxide, silicate, REE-minerals, carbonate and sulphide inclusions have been detected in the nuggets, which are identical in mineralogy and chemical composition to mineral constituents of the alkaline to highly <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock</b> suite surrounding the Guli dunite core complex thus, considered as the source for Au-nuggets...|$|R
40|$|The Genesis of the Benom Complex is {{important}} to reveal because of their history will give the whole view about {{the evolution of the}} Central Belt of the Peninsular Malaysia. In our study, we focused on the <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock</b> series of the Benom Complex. It is allocate as elongated body by the trend north-south at the western hill of Mount Benom. This series consists of gabbro, pyroxenite, diorite, syenite, and monzonite with the lesser amount of dolerite dykes and mafic microgranular enclaves. It was predominantly high-K, shoshonitic series with I-type characteristics. It was metaluminous and classified as the magnesium pluton. They have very high total alkaline and LIL elements, i. e. Ba and Sr. Based on geochemical studied, we postulated that the genesis of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock</b> series in the Benom Complex {{can be explained by the}} model of the slab breakoff...|$|R
50|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} the BHH and BM fields {{are classified as}} kimberlites. The ML rocks are {{not considered to be}} archetypal kimberilte and have been variously classified as <b>alkaline</b> ultramafic <b>rocks,</b> hybrid <b>alkaline</b> ultramafic <b>rocks,</b> alkali olivine basalt and basanite; they are difficult to classify because of strong clay alteration that has obliterated most of their original mineralogy.|$|R

50|$|Case {{hardening}} is a weathering {{phenomenon of}} rock surface induration. It is observed commonly in: felsic <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks,</b> such as nepheline syenite, phonolite and trachyte; pyroclastic rocks, as pyroclastic flow deposit, fine air-fall deposits and vent-filling pyroclastic deposits; sedimentary rocks, as sandstone and mudstone.|$|E
50|$|In nature, {{carbonate}} rocks, potentially carbonatite, kimberlites, carbonate-bearing melilitic {{rocks and}} other rare <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks</b> may satisfy these criteria.

5|$|In 1875, Edward Windsor Richards {{became the}} General Manager of the Middlesbrough Ironworks. Richards {{was in charge}} of the design and {{construction}} of the new plant at Eston, the Cleveland Steel Works. It had three coke fired haematite blast furnaces. Richards' work helped to improve the Bessemer process for making steel, in the case when the ore is rich in phosphorus, and an <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock</b> (dolomite, limestone or magnesite) is used. This variant is called the Gilchrist-Thomas process, after its inventor Sidney Gilchrist Thomas who persuaded Richards to adopt it.|$|R

40|$|The {{anorthosite}} and <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock</b> localities in the Precambrian Shield of Peninsular India were reviewed. There {{are approximately}} 50 localities of such rocks, generally {{restricted to the}} Eastern Ghats mobile belt. The alkaline plutons are typically confined to {{the margin of the}} Eastern Ghats. The anorthosites are all greater than 500 sq km, but many exhibit similarities to one another. It was suggested that the anorthosites are associated with cryptic sutures, and are thought to have originated as a result of ponding of basaltic magmas. An analogy was drawn between the Eastern Ghats belt and the Grenville Province of the Canadian Shield...|$|R
5000|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{takes place}} in various types of rocks, being notable in porous ones, for example sandstone, quartzite and volcanic ash. The cement effect by silica observed in sandstone and quartzite is prominent. A similar phenomenon is observed in felsic <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks,</b> such as nepheline syenite, alkaline syenite, phonolite, and trachyte, because of weathering vulnerability of nepheline and alkaline feldspar. The case hardening on trachytic clasts of volcanic breccia shows peculiar fabrics.|$|E
50|$|Gugiaite {{does not}} appear to have any {{political}} significance or economic value. From a historical perspective, Gugiaite is noted as being the first beryllium mineral found in skarn systems at contacts between <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks</b> and limestones (Peng et al. 1962). Also, thermodynamic equilibrium studies involving gugiaite have been conducted to determine the distribution of beryllium between gaseous and solid phases as a function of temperature in attempts to deduce the processes that formed the solar system (Lodders and Lauretta 1997).|$|E
50|$|In a strip along Paraná River tholeiitic basalts {{belonging}} to the Paraná Traps makes {{up most of the}} bedrock and overlies earlier sediments of the Paraná Basin. These tholeiites were erupted in the Early Cretaceous in association with the initial opening of the South Atlantic. The Cretaceous volcanism did also created minor outcrops of potassic alkaline volcanics in a graben structure developed between Asunción and Villarrica and in Amambay Department. Cretaceous volcanism did also left small units of sodic <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks</b> in Misiones Department in southern Paraguay.|$|E
50|$|Nepheline syenite is {{characterized}} by high ratio of (Na2O+K2O)/SiO2 and (Na2O+K2O)/Al2O3, which are represented respectively by the existence of nepheline and alkaline mafic minerals. Therefore, it is classified geochemically as <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock.</b> This rock has low Fe and Mg contents, in total about 3wt%, and in this sense it is classified to be felsic rock. However, the SiO2 content is not so high, being 53% to 62wt%, which is equivalent to andesite and diorite. In this sense, it corresponds to intermediate rock. Light rare earth elements are highly concentrated, indicating that the magma is highly differentiated.|$|R
50|$|Phosphate {{deposits}} {{are also}} formed from <b>alkaline</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> such as nepheline syenites, carbonatites, and associated rock types. The phosphate is, in this case, contained within magmatic apatite, monazite, or other rare-earth phosphates.|$|R
25|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province throughout its 20million year history has been mainly the production of alkaline lavas, including alkaline basalts. A range of <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock</b> types not commonly found in the Western Cordillera are regionally widespread in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. These include nephelinite, basanite and peralkaline phonolite, trachyte and comendite lavas. The trachyte and comendite lavas are understood to have been created by fractionation of mainly alkali basalt magma in crustal reservoirs. An area of continental rifting, such as the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, would aid the formation of high-level reservoirs of capable size and thermal activity to maintain long-lived fractionation.|$|R
5000|$|Generally {{occurs in}} Si-poor {{volcanic}} rocks, marine basalts and breccias, associated with other sodium zeolites such as analcime, Na(Si2Al)O6·H2O, natrolite, Na2(Si3Al2)O10·2H2O, and chabazite-Na, Na2Ca(Si8Al4)O24·12H2O. It also occurs in Na-rich pegmatites in <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{and as an}} alteration product in some nepheline syenite intrusions. [...] No sedimentary gmelinite has been found. [...] It is generally assumed that it forms at low temperatures, less than 100 °C. It is widespread as a hydrothermal alteration product of ussingite, Na2AlSi3O8(OH), associated with gobbinsite, Na5(Si11Al5)O32·11H2O, gonnardite, (Na,Ca)2(Si,Al)5O10·3H2O, and chabazite-K.|$|E
50|$|Jinshajiangite {{is a rare}} {{silicate}} mineral {{named after}} the Jinshajiang river in China. Its currently accepted formula is BaNaFe4Ti2(Si2O7)2O2(OH)2F. It gives a name of the jinshajiangite group. The mineral is associated with <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks.</b> In jinshajiangite, there is a potassium-to-barium, calcium-to-sodium, manganese-to-iron and iron-to-titanium diadochy substitution. Jinshajiangite is the iron-analogue of surkhobite and perraultite. It is chemically related to bafertisite, cámaraite and emmerichite. Its structure is related to that of bafertisite. Jinshajiangite is a titanosilicate with heteropolyhedral HOH layers, where the H-layer is a mixed tetrahedral-octahedral layer, and the O-layer is simply octahedral.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alkaline}} feldspar is not potassic, {{but generally}} sodic-potassic, which {{is characterized by}} interlocking anorthoclase, called perthite. In the alkali feldspar almost pure albite domains are observed. Nepheline generally shows partial alteration into natrolite and cancrinite. The clinopyroxene is sodic whose composition varies from hedenbergite to aegirine-augite. This mineral eventually presents resorption shape. The reaction rim constituted by amphibole and/or biotite is commonly observed. The amphibole is of high alkali, such as alkaline hornblende [...] and riebeckite. The alkaline clinopyroxene and amphibole are characteristics of typical <b>alkaline</b> <b>rocks.</b> Biotite is annite, with high Fe/Mg ratio.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} and {{characterization of the}} hydrochemistry of the groundwaters has been done for seven wells. The sampling occurred during three bimonthly campaigns. The results classified the waters as of the calcium bicarbonated type {{for the majority of}} the samples, except for one well, whose composition is of the sodium bicarbonated type. The major ions found and how they determine the quality parameters are consistent with the reactions of mineral dissolution of the majority of volcanic rocks and the reactions with intrusion of <b>alkaline</b> <b>rock</b> in only one well. Anomalous values of nitrate in some wells alert to the impact of especially polluting sources at the time the reservoirs of the hydroeletric plant were formed...|$|R
