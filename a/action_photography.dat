500|$|The {{aperture}} stop-down focal lengths {{make the}} lens a laggard among wide-angle lenses. [...] Thus, {{it is not}} strong at gathering light for stop <b>action</b> <b>photography.</b> [...] However, DSLR cameras have improved at higher ISO settings. However, wide-angle photography (below 16mm) continues to need stronger lighting than is possible by built in flashes if {{trying to make up}} for low light situations.|$|E
500|$|Motion-capture {{photography}} lasted 31days at the Hughes Aircraft {{stage in}} Playa Vista in Los Angeles. Live <b>action</b> <b>photography</b> began in [...] at Stone Street Studios in Wellington, New Zealand, and {{was scheduled to}} last 31 days. More than a thousand people worked on the production. In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film. Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests {{to get a feel}} for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.|$|E

500|$|Animation was an {{essential}} and integral component of films produced at Fort Roach. Animation provided FMPU filmmakers with scenarios not possible with live <b>action</b> <b>photography</b> due to technical or secrecy constraints. In an introductory training film, pilots {{learn how to}} fly airplanes {{with the help of}} colorful cartoon characters named Thrust, Gravity and Drag, representative of the forces which act on airframes. Another character, Mr. Chameleon was created to teach the fine points of military camouflage. [...] "Trigger Joe"'s appearance in Position Firing was an immediate hit amongst gunners. Animators used humor to illustrate common pitfalls when loading and firing and techniques to maximize their efficiency and accuracy. Gunnery personnel clamored for more: [...] "We want more films like Position Firing that make the theory simple and clear and yet keep us interested. And Trigger Joe! He's great!" [...] Joe became the central character in an entire series of films developed to further gunnery training. The animation department was staffed with a stellar assortment of animators, including department head Rudolf Ising, one of the creators of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, and one of Disney's Nine Old Men, Frank Thomas.|$|E
2500|$|In 1854, James Ambrose Cutting and his partner, Isaac A. Rehn, {{took out}} three patents that were [...] "improvements" [...] in the wet-plate {{collodion}} process. Cutting developed {{a method for}} adhering the two pieces of glass together using Canada balsam. Though meant {{as a way to}} hermetically seal the ambrotypes as a preservation method, the process was ultimately unnecessary as the varnish layer itself worked extremely well as a protectant. In fact, ambrotypes that utilized Cutting's patent are known to exhibit deterioration caused by the technique. Numerous high-profile lawsuits (E. Anthony, J. Gurney, C.D. Fredericks, J. Bogardus) and disputes surrounding the patents may have had an intimidating effect, and discouraged a wider use of [...] "instantaneous" [...] (stop <b>action)</b> <b>photography</b> during the Civil War. Cutting's patented formula featured the chemical component, bromide of potassium, which greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the collodion. When the patent extensions came up for renewal in 1868, the Patent Office decided that the original patents should not have been issued, and the extension was denied. The decision was partly based on evidence found in Henry Snelling's book, [...] "The History and Practice of Photography." [...] Snelling in 1853 had described the use of the same key ingredients found in Cutting's high-speed, emulsion.|$|E
2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for <b>action</b> <b>photography</b> and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E

Although mainly shot in the Universal studios, the climactic earthquake scenes were a mix of model and archival film footage, mixed in with live <b>action.</b> Principal <b>photography</b> on The Shock took place in June 1922, after Chaney finished work as Fagin on Oliver Twist (1922) in late May 1922.|$|R

40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world that}} has been seduced by the image. In our {{predominantly}} visual culture we are accustomed to relying on photographs for a myriad of diverse functions, which contribute to and inform the way we see the world around us. Through its images and associated <b>actions,</b> <b>photography</b> has transformed the way the world is discovered, remembered, chronicled and disseminated. This research is motivated by the apparent effect that photography has on our understanding of reality. It concentrates on the photographic practice associated with documentary photography. The practical work pulls apart images, recontextualising and manipulating ‘documentary photographs’ that are sourced from a variety of publications, but most significantly from National Geographic magazines. The aim is to question the status of the photograph as a ‘documentary’ tool intended to record reality by suggesting that it simultaneously contributes to creating that reality. The creative outcomes of this research investigate the uncertainties of visual perception. The way we see and read photographic images is influenced by a variety of factors that are largely beyond our control, not least our own personal preconceptions and expectations that we unwittingly project onto everything we see. ...|$|R

25|$|Mount Diablo has {{inspired}} many artists and writers. Early work centered on exploration, surveying and {{was related to}} the rise and popularization of tourism in the Pacific west. Themes were suggested and heightened by early tourism promoters, the beginnings of the area's preservation {{and the rise of the}} environmental movement. The focus was accelerated by artists associated with the University of California, Berkeley, the California College of Arts, the actions of the organizations Save Mount Diablo and the Mount Diablo Interpretive Association, and area art centers, galleries, and museums. In modern times Mount Diablo art has been most strongly represented in plein aire painting, especially the group Artists for <b>Action,</b> and <b>photography.</b>|$|R

50|$|The term 64 {{refers to}} a small {{aperture}} setting on a large format camera, which secures great depth of field, rendering a photograph evenly sharp from foreground to background. Such a small aperture sometimes implies a long exposure and therefore a selection of relatively slow moving or motionless subject matter, such as landscapes and still life, but in the typically bright California light this is less {{a factor in the}} subject matter chosen than the sheer size and clumsiness of the cameras, compared to the smaller cameras increasingly used in <b>action</b> and reportage <b>photography</b> in the 1930s.|$|R

Along with the electric fuzz guitar soundtrack, there are many [...] "dream" [...] or [...] "hallucination" [...] sequences at different points in the film giving it a surreal atmosphere. The camera locations on the motorcycle riding sequences give the viewer a point of view that is unusual in these type of moving action sequences.|$|R
