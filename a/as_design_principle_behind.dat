40|$|Motivated by {{experiments}} on superconductors in the microscopic {{regime and the}} realization of small superconducting devices such as qubits, we initiate a computational project {{in the form of}} a numerical simulation package to model and predict the behavior of these type of systems. It is a multidisciplinary endeavor in that it employs theory, computational science, software design, and to some extent new visualization techniques. Our intention is to create a flexible and modular code library which is capable of simulating a wide variety of superconducting systems, while significantly shortening the startup time for computational projects. We base the numerical model in quasiclassical theory with the Eilenberger transport equation, and execute the highly parallel computations on a contemporary graphics card (GPU). In this thesis we touch on the theoretical background, describe the discretization of the theory, and present a thorough overview on how to solve the equations in practice for a general 2 -dimensional geometry, as well <b>as</b> review the <b>design</b> <b>principles</b> <b>behind</b> the developed software. Moreover, a few selected results are presented to show that the output is sound, and to highlight some new findings. In paper I we examine a new low temperature phase in which spontaneous edge currents emerge in a d-wave superconducting square grain, breaking time-reversal symmetry. The modeling of such a system is made possible by our development of a simulation domain description which allows for specular boundary conditions in an arbitrarily shaped geometry...|$|R
40|$|Compartmentalization of {{biological}} content and function {{is a key}} architectural feature in biology, where membrane bound micro- and nanocompartments are used for performing a host of highly specialized and tightly regulated biological functions. The benefit of compartmentalization <b>as</b> a <b>design</b> <b>principle</b> is <b>behind</b> its ubiquity in cells and has led to it being a central engineering theme in construction of artificial cell-like systems. In this review, we discuss the attractions of designing compartmentalized membrane-bound constructs and review a range of biomimetic membrane architectures that span length scales, focusing on lipid-based structures but also addressing polymer-based and hybrid approaches. These include nested vesicles, multicompartment vesicles, large-scale vesicle networks, as well as droplet interface bilayers, and double-emulsion multiphase systems (multisomes). We outline key examples of how such structures have been functionalized with biological and synthetic machinery, for example, to manufacture and deliver drugs and metabolic compounds, to replicate intracellular signaling cascades, and to demonstrate collective behaviors as minimal tissue constructs. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the applications of these architectures and the state-of-the-art microfluidic engineering required to fabricate, functionalize, and precisely assemble them. Finally, we outline the future directions of these technologies and highlight how they could be applied to engineer the next generation of cell models, therapeutic agents, and microreactors, together with the diverse applications in the emerging field of bottom-up synthetic biology...|$|R

40|$|Biology {{achieves}} novel functions like error correction, ultra-sensitivity {{and accurate}} concentration measurement {{at the expense}} of free energy through Maxwell Demon-like mechanisms. The <b>design</b> <b>principles</b> and free energy trade-offs have been studied for a variety of such mechanisms. In this review, we emphasize a perspective based on dynamical phases that can explain commonalities shared by these mechanisms. Dynamical phases are defined by typical trajectories executed by non-equilibrium systems in the space of internal states. We find that coexistence of dynamical phases can have dramatic consequences for function vs free energy cost trade-offs. Dynamical phases can also provide an intuitive picture of the <b>design</b> <b>principles</b> <b>behind</b> such biological Maxwell Demons. Comment: 10 figures.

2500|$|Minimalism was the <b>design</b> <b>principle</b> <b>behind</b> the tower. The largest {{possible}} {{panes of}} glass were used. There are no spandrel panels, and the mullions are minimal. Cobb added a geometric modernist twist by using a parallelogram shape for the tower floor plan. From the most common views, this design makes {{the corners of the}} tower appear very sharp. The highly reflective window glass is tinted slightly blue, which results in the tower having only a slight contrast with the sky on a clear day. As a final modernist touch, the short sides of the parallelogram are marked with a deep vertical notch, breaking up the tower's mass and emphasizing its verticality. [...] In late evening, the vertical notch to the northwest catches the last light of the sky, while the larger portions of glass reflect the darkening sky.|$|R
