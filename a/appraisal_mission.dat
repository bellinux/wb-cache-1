5000|$|Late 1975 a World Bank <b>{{appraisal}}</b> <b>mission</b> visited Kenya and in June 1976 {{the first}} appraisal report (White Cover) was presented. The document proposed a 14,000 ha project with an economic {{rate of return}} of 11%. Internally the World Bank had classified Bura as a [...] "potential difficult and contentious project" [...] because of the level of external financing, incomplete preparation, high cost per family, cost recovery, remote area and settler selection. Interesting enough the soils were not seen as a problem, but {{a few months after the}} publication of the White Cover report this issue erupted, when World Bank staff reviewed the details of the soil studies and concluded that the classification of these soils by Ilaco was too optimistic and not justified.|$|E

As part of it, representatives of the French Development Agency (AFD) met the KMRL team {{as part of their}} pre-appraisal mission on 18-19 March 2013. The agency had detailed discussions with KMRL MD Elias George and other senior officials. They also visited the project alignment from Aluva to Petta to understand the project better. Mme. Aude Flogny, Regional Director, South Asia & Mr. Gautier Kohler, Project Coordinator India were there in the team. Based on the inputs received from the pre-appraisal mission team of AFD, a formal detailed- <b>appraisal</b> <b>mission</b> team visited Kochi from 25-27 April 2013. The team included Senior Transport Expert of AFD, Mr. Xavier Hoang; AFD regional director for South Asia, Aude Flogny and Project Coordinator, Gautier Kohler. The team inspected the project site and held discussions relating to the funding for Kochi Metro Rail project. Kochi Metro Rail Limited is hoping to get a final commitment from the French financial agency AFD - Agence Française de Développement by the end of December 2013. AFD has stated that they could provide a loan of up to 130 million Euros which is around Rs. 10 billion.|$|E

40|$|Årsliste 2000 This is an {{appraisal}} of the Melamchi Water Supply Project in Nepal with special focus on the component earmarked for funding by NDF. The objective of the <b>appraisal</b> <b>mission</b> was to provide NDF with necessary information to support its decisions for further involvement in this project. The mission confirms that NDF's contribution will be allocated solely to {{the supervision of the}} construction of the Melamchi Diversion Scheme. This scheme consists of a water intake structure in the Melamchi River and a 26 -km long tunnel for transferring of water from the river to the urban water supply system of the Kathmandu Valley. The appraisal concludes that significant {{progress has been made in}} filling the funding gaps of the Project since the last donor mission in July 2000. Moreover, all donors appears to agree that an obligatory condition for this project is the involvement of a private operator (PO) responsible for future operations and provision of water supply services. The construction supervision component of the Melamchi Diversion scheme is estimated to an upper ceiling of approximately UD$ 11 million including the consultant's office and transportation costs. The supervision budget is higher than the current NDF's pipeline credit for this Component and filling of the gap has to be settled. The mission also clarified that the construction supervision will be subject to Nordic Competitive Bidding. In general, considerable efforts will be needed by the Asian Development Bank and the Nepalese Governmental Institutions to complete the remaining project preparations in keeping with a tight time schedule.

40|$|Summary {{record of}} the Twelfth Meeting of the TAC, Rome, 2 - 6 February 1976; Sir John Crawford presiding. The team leader of the IRRI Quinquennial Review Mission, M. S. Swaminathan, {{presented}} the draft report of the first external review of a CGIAR center. The report expressed {{the views of the}} mission, not those of TAC. After discussion at the next meeting, a revised report would be sent to the CGIAR with a separate TAC commentary. Luis Marcano presented the report of TAC's Vegetable Research <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Mission.</b> TAC recognized that vegetable research deserved a higher priority than given in its first paper on priorities, and asked its secretariat to provide options for decision at the next meeting. TAC heard from Sterling Wortman, President of the International Agricultural Development Service (IADS), a Rockefeller Foundation initiative. Sir John concluded that the main purpose of IADS, to help governments prepare strategies for production and development, was complementary to the work of the centers. A discussion of center relations with advanced scientific institutions (ARI) identified many benefits to the research program, and also the danger of centers being asked to fund ARI programs. Discussion with the center directors was indicated. A TAC Secretariat draft provided the basis for extended discussion of possible changes in CGIAR research priorities, with attention to forestry, nonfood crops, relations among climate, soils, and crop growth, coconuts, plantains, bananas, goats, post harvest issues, vegetables, factor and socioeconomic research. The Secretariat would draft a self-contained revised paper for consideration at the next meeting. When complete it would be sent to those responsible for the CGIAR system review. Other topics: water buffalo, water use and management, combination of subcommittees on grain legumes and plant nutrients, aquaculture, soybeans, criteria for evaluating research, CATIE, and the CGIAR system review...|$|E

40|$|An <b>appraisal</b> <b>mission</b> fielded by the World Food Programme (WFP) expre ssed {{concern that}} the area of peaches being planted in {{northern}} Sinai could result in too high a level of production. A relatively large quantity of almonds have also been plan ted. The purpose of this project was therefore to assess present and potential markets, a nd forecast prices, for Sinai peaches and almonds in order to guide development of the areaThe consultancy mission fielded by the project found that the WFP's tentative forecast of a total peach production of 250 000 tons a year by the mid- 1990 s was too high, and concluded that production was unlikely to exceed 100 000 tons. Although the domestic market for fresh peaches could probably absorb the projected increase, attention should be paid to developing export markets and dried fruit production. In this context, {{it should be noted}} that proposals to set up a peach canning factory did not appear to be just ified. Further new plantings should not be considered until data were available to estimate the impact of increased supply on market pricesThe project found that, while the existing marketing procedures migh t be adequate for present production levels, they may not prove suitable for handling the greater production that is foreseen. A detailed survey of such procedures was therefore to be carried out during the next peach harvesting season. Both marketing and post-harvest sk ills needed to be improved: to this end, it was recommended that appropriate training cours es for extension workers be offered by the University of Agriculture at El Arish. In o rder to develop export markets, it was recommended that the practice of setting minimum export prices for peaches be discontinued. Advice should be given to exporters on mark et possibilities in the Arab Gulf statesSince almonds are planted not as a fruit crop but as stock to be gra fted with peaches, the increase in almond plantings is unlikely to affect the almond marke t significantl...|$|E
40|$|The {{project was}} {{successful}} and full achieved its objective as described below. The World Bank/FAO project identification activities, {{embodied in the}} reports of Rouchiche and El-Ferjani, contributed considerably to towards defining the possible scope of the proposed Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project. The report by Rouchiche described the general background to the natural resources and land use, the institutions likely to be involved and then outlined and discussed {{many aspects of the}} project identification. A variety of issues were discussed and recommendations made. The report of El-Ferjani made similar observations and contributions, with strong emphasis on the issues of soil conservation and watershed management. The report of Stevens, written after the Pre-appraisal Mission, defined the shape and scope of the possible forestry interventions. It detailed each intervention and gave costings. After these costings were revised during the <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Mission,</b> they formed the basis for the definition and allocation of about half of the funds which were eventually specified in the Staff Appraisal Report. The report discussed project implementation in forestry, organization and management, the role of women and environmental considerations. Outputs, benefits and risks were assessed in detail and the project justified. The report by Sanders covered the same topics but in relation to range management and soil conservation. His findings and costings were used in the same way. The reports by Chidley and Zadelhoff are abstracted in Appendix 5 and illustrate the contribution made to the project by these two consultants. The approach developed with the assistance of this TCP project addresses soil erosion control by developing an understanding of present land use practices uses in farming, range management and forest utilization under the prevailing socio-economic conditions of the village communities of the catchment area. Plans for land restoration are directed towards their sustainable, productive use. This was done through the design of appropriate and improved management packages for improved dryland and irrigated farming, better range management and adaptive forestry interventions. These will be tested for their economic advantages and social acceptability to the villagers. It is planned that the Government will bear the costs of demonstrating these packages and that the villagers will meet most of the costs of implementing them on their own lands. An outline was prepared within the established organizational framework which closely integrates the responsibilities and activities of the concerned Provincial Government agencies but with out the creation of any new agencies or the employment of any new staff. While each of the inputs mentioned above have made specific contributions to the achievements of the objective of this TCP project, each report makes it clear that Turkey will have similar and unmet requirements even after the completion of the Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project. There are some 40 million hectares under the nominal control of the Ministry of Forestry, Treasury and the Ministry of Agriculture which are in advanced stages of land degradation. The Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project aims not only to improve the soils and vegetation, but also the general living standards of the inhabitants of the project area. If successful, the Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project will be a model to be followed over a much more extensive area of Turkey. 1. There are not enough reliable data available to be able to estimate with any certainty the requirements needed to overcome the extensive land degradation problems so evident in Cental and Eastern Anatolia. The Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project is the first large scale and integrated attempt to overcome these problems. Consequently, it can be regarded as an important pilot exercise which should provide much of the information needed in terms of new technology, approaches to the problems and costs. However, it is a large and expensive project and the most should be made of it. It is therefore strongly recommended that the project's progress and achievements be very carefully monitored, costed, recorded and evaluated as a basis for further work in the region. 2. During the course of this TCP project poor range management has been identified as currently the most serious land management problem in Turkey. Some innovative approaches to this subject have been planned for the Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project. If successful this work will present a model which can be adapted and followed {{in other parts of the}} country. However, this is not likely to be enough by itself and it is recommended that as a priority, the Government undertake a study of the legislative, organizational and administrative aspects of range management with a view of overcoming the urgent problem...|$|E
