40|$|Abstract Comparative {{measurements}} of elder dementia patients using multiple choice auditory graphic interactive check (MAGIC) and standard audiometry Setting Considering the demographic change of Germany (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2011) and the accordingly increasing risk of age-related diseases (Neubauer, et al., 2011), this research analyzes {{the measurement of}} deafness of probands who suffer from dementia, aged between 69 and 95 years {{with an average age}} of 86, 3 years. One characteristic of dementia disease is communication problems (Alzheimer, 1911; Richter, 2003), which can be intensified by an eventually coexisting deafness (Lin, et al., 2011). Object of investigation The investigation, informing this research, engages in the question, wether an established <b>audiometry</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> can simplify the screening of hearing of elder people suffering from dementia and to what extent an additional loss of hearing can be detected. Research method The measurements were performed with a standard audiometry and compared to a multiple choice auditory graphic interactive check (MAGIC) (PATH, 2011) to analyze the grade of deafness of 18 nursing home residents (72 % female, 28 % male) who were diagnosed with dementia beforehand. The used ranges of frequencies in this measurement were 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz. Results Out of this group of probands 7 persons could be tested with the standard audiometry and 6 persons could be tested with the MAGIC. 5 persons could be tested also with the standard audiometry and the MAGIC. It was noticeable, that more probants were diagnoseable with the standard audiometry than there were with the MAGIC. During conducting the measurements it was often difficult for the probands to follow the sequence of the MAGIC. Conclusions The utilisation of the MAGIC in its current design is only restricted recommendable related to people suffering from dementia at present and often must be replaced by a the standard audiometry. The measurements performed {{in the context of this}} rersearch show the importance and necessity to diagnose a loss of hearing, since all probands showed signs of deafness.

40|$|Any loss {{in hearing}} {{sensitivity}} constitutes a major and if unidentified, an insurmountable barrier to effective learning. Current school-entry hearing screening in South Africa is unavailable to majority of children due to several challenges. This study aimed to provide research-based recommendations for clinical practice of schoolbased hearing screening. More explicitly, {{this study investigated}} the effect of hearing screening intensity (loudness) levels {{and the use of}} an immediate rescreen in reducing the referral rate in resource-limited contexts like South Africa. Furthermore, it investigated the use of a low-cost mobile smartphone application for calibrated hearing screening in schools. It also investigated the feasibility of conducting an automated diagnostic hearing evaluation on children in a school environment immediately after a refer rescreen result is obtained. Lastly, this study reported on the prevalence and nature of hearing loss in a representative urban school-aged population. A within-subject study was conducted to investigate the use of referral criteria in terms of screening intensity level and the use of a rescreen. It was found that the referral rate is reduced to 6. 7 % from 17 % when using 25 dB HL as opposed to 20 dB HL screening intensity. Furthermore, {{there was a significant difference}} between the referral rates obtained at 20 and 25 dB HL and 20 and 30 dB HL (McNemar, p 0. 05). Smartphone screening (hearScreen) was 12. 3 % faster than conventional screening (p< 0. 001). Sixty-two (mean age 8 ± 0. 9 years) of the 1070 participants were recruited to investigate the validity and time-efficiency of automated diagnostic air- and boneconduction <b>audiometry</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> in a natural school environment. With regards to the feasibility of automated diagnostic audiometry, 85. 7 % of air-conduction thresholds and 44. 6 % of bone-conduction thresholds corresponded within the normal range (15 dB HL) for manual and automated diagnostic audiometry. Both manual and automated diagnostic audiometry air- and bone-conduction thresholds exceeded 15 dB HL in 9. 9 % and 34. 0 % of thresholds respectively. For these thresholds average absolute differences for air- and bone-conduction thresholds were 6. 3 dB (8. 3 SD) and 2. 2 dB (3. 6 SD) and they corresponded within 10 dB across frequencies in 87. 7 % and 100. 0 %, respectively. There was no significant difference between manual and automated air- and bone-conduction across frequencies for these thresholds. The overall prevalence rate of hearing loss across the 1070 participants was 2. 2 %, with hearing loss being more prevalent in the Caucasian group (5. 1 %). A total of 24 children (12 male, 12 female) were diagnosed with a hearing loss (54. 3 % conductive, 25. 7 % mixed and 20. 0 % sensorineural). Furthermore, otoscopic examinations revealed that 6. 6 % of the children had cerumen and 7. 4 % presented with type B tympanograms which is indicative of middle ear effusion. Mobile technology together with automated diagnostic audiometry may be a feasible solution to overcome many of the prohibitive challenges faced by school-based hearing screening programs. Furthermore, prevalence data suggests that many children (2. 2 %) are in need of some form of follow-up service, most for medical intervention and a smaller number for audiological intervention. These findings provide valuable baseline data for realistic planning and appropriate implementation of hearing health services to ensure school-based hearing screening is employed sustainably across South Africa.

Pure-tone <b>audiometry</b> <b>for</b> air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz is traditionally used to classify the degree of hearing loss in each ear. Normal hearing thresholds {{are considered to be}} 25 dB sensitivity, though it has been proposed that this threshold is too high, and that 15 dB (about half as loud) is more typical. Mild hearing loss is thresholds of 25-45 dB; moderate hearing loss is thresholds of 45-65 dB; severe hearing loss is thresholds of 65-85 dB; and profound hearing loss thresholds are greater than 85 dB.|$|R

40|$|Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have {{historically}} been documented as relatively rare complications of vancomycin monotherapy. Recent reports have linked aggressive vancomycin dosing strategies to significant risks of nephrotoxicity. We evaluated the rate of high-frequency hearing loss detected by <b>audiometry</b> <b>for</b> patients on vancomycin therapy. For this purpose, we used retrospective case-control analysis of <b>audiometry</b> results <b>for</b> patients on vancomycin therapy for whom baseline and follow-up exams were available. Analysis of 89 patients for whom audiograms were performed after an average of 27 days of vancomycin therapy showed a 12 % rate of high-frequency hearing loss, with a trend in univariate analysis toward a higher rate with advanced age. The mean of the highest vancomycin trough levels for both patients with worsening audiograms and those without worsening audiograms was 19 mg/liter. Regression tree modeling demonstrated that for patients 53 years old, the incidence was 19 % (P = 0. 008). We conclude that a significant rate of high-frequency hearing loss in older patients receiving vancomycin monotherapy was detected by audiometry. While these data urge caution against continued indiscriminate vancomycin dose escalation to treat infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains for which vancomycin MICs are 2 mg/liter, further prospective {{studies are needed to}} determine the clinical significance and reversibility of these effects...|$|R

40|$|To {{validate}} the air- and bone-conduction AMTAS automated audiometry system. Design: Prospective study. Test-retest reliability {{was determined by}} assessing adults with AMTAS air- and bone-conduction audiometry. Accuracy was determined by comparing AMTAS and manual audiometry conducted on adults. AMTAS testing was conducted in a quiet room and manual audiometry in a sound booth. Study sample: Ten participants for test-retest reliability tests and 44 participants to determine accuracy were included. Participants had varying degrees of hearing loss. Results: For test-retest reliability the overall difference in air-conduction hearing thresholds (n 119) was 0. 5 dB. The spread of differences (standard deviation of absolute differences) was 4. 9 dB. For bone-conduction thresholds (n 99) the overall difference was 0. 2 dB, {{and the spread of}} differences 4. 5 dB. For accuracy the overall difference in air-conduction hearing thresholds (n 509) between the two techniques was 0. 1 dB. The spread of differences was 6. 4 dB. For bone-conduction thresholds (n 295) the overall difference was 0 dB, and the spread of differences 7. 7 dB. Conclusions: Variations between air- and bone-conduction <b>audiometry</b> <b>for</b> automated and manual audiometry were within normally accepted limits <b>for</b> <b>audiometry.</b> However, AMTAS thresholds were elevated but not signifi cantly different compared to other contemporary studies that included an automated audiometer.

50|$|Hearing {{thresholds}} {{of humans}} and other mammals can be found by using behavioural hearing tests or physiological tests.An audiogram can be obtained using a behavioural hearing test called <b>Audiometry.</b> <b>For</b> humans the test involves different tones being presented at a specific frequency (pitch) and intensity (loudness). When the person hears the sound they raise their hand or press a button so that the tester knows that they have heard it. The lowest intensity sound they can hear is recorded.The test varies <b>for</b> <b>children,</b> their response to the sound can be a head turn or using a toy. The child learns {{what they can do}} when they hear the sound, for example they are taught that when they heard the sound they can put a toy man in a boat. This is referred to as conditioned play audiometry. Visual reinforcement audiometry is also used with children. When the child hears the sound, they look in the direction the sound came from and are reinforced with a light and/or animated toy. A similar technique can be used when testing some animals but instead of a toy, food {{can be used as a}} reward for responding to the sound. Physiological tests do not need the patient to respond (Katz 2002). For example when performing the brainstem auditory evoked potentials the patient’s brainstem responses are being measured when a sound is played into their ear, or otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) which are generated by a healthy inner ear either spontaneously or evoked by an outside stimulus. In the US, the NIOSH recommends that people who are regularly exposed to hazardous noise have their hearing tested once a year, or every three years otherwise.|$|R

Participants - Forty-eight NHS patients referred to an otology outpatient clinic. Main Outcome Measures - Each patient had 2 pure-tone audiograms. Hearing thresholds in decibels hearing level were ascertained by fully trained British audiologists and by the Otogram. Results - Using the weighted κ statistic, the level of agreement in air-conduction (κ = 0. 965) and bone-conduction (κ = 0. 927) thresholds between the audiologist and the Otogram on the same patient was equivalent to the inter-rater level of agreement between pairs of audiologists.

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from conductive or {{mixed hearing loss}} may benefit from bone-conduction hearing systems (BAHS). The amount of amplification provided by the hearing system is selected based on the individual’s sensorineural frequency-specific threshold. With patients who {{are not able to}} provide thresholds behaviorally, such as young children, objective methods are required to estimate the unaided and aided hearing threshold and thus the success of the hearing system fitting. In a prospective study with ten adult Baha softband users, aided and unaided frequency-specific thresholds were estimated. Aided thresholds to tone bursts via Baha stimulation were obtained behaviorally and electrophysiologically using cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) and were compared to pure-tone thresholds using routine clinical <b>audiometry.</b> <b>For</b> all stimulation frequencies, the frequency-specific electrophysiological and behavioral hearing thresholds measured with Baha stimulation were highly correlated and not different.

40|$|A new set {{of speech}} <b>audiometry</b> <b>for</b> Norwegian - called "HiST taleaudiometri" - has been {{developed}} {{by the author of}} this thesis ("HiST" being short for the Norwegian name of Sør-Trøndelag University College and "taleaudiometri" being Norwegian <b>for</b> speech <b>audiometry).</b> The speech audiometry set consists of five-word sentences, three-word utterances, monosyllabic words, monosyllabic words <b>for</b> testing <b>children</b> and numrals. The process of developing the speech audiometry set is presented in this thesis. The five-word sentences are of the form Name-verb-numeral-adjetive-noun. Hagerman developed this sentence type <b>for</b> Swedish speech <b>audiometry</b> in the 1980 s, but for Norwegian the sentences were developed using a new diphone-splitting method. For each word category ten alternatives exist, makings it possible to generate a number of lists with the same phonemic content but with different sentences. A noise was developed from the speech material. This is intended for use together with the speech for the purpose of speech recognition threshold in noise measurements. The material is very suitible for performing repeated measurements on the same person, which is often a requisite for hearing aid evaluation or psychoacoustical testing. The three-word utterances are of the form numeral-adjective-noun. The words are identical with the last three words used in the five-word sentences. The three-word utterances are intended for speech recognition threshold measurement. The noise developed for five-word sentences can be used together with the three-word utterances for speech recogniton threshold in noise measurements. Monosyllabic word lists were developed mainly for the purpose of measuring maximum speech recogniton score or the performance-intensity function. The recorded lists earmarked <b>for</b> testing <b>children</b> were developed by Rikshospitalet University Hospital in Oslo.
