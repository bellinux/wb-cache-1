5|$|In Journey, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} a robed figure in a desert. After an {{introductory}} sequence, the player is shown the robed figure sitting in the sand, with a large mountain in the distance. The path towards this mountain, the ultimate destination of the game, is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly. The player can walk in the levels, as well as control the camera, which typically follows behind the figure, either with the analog stick or by tilting the motion-sensitive controller. The player can jump with one button, or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another; the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button is pressed, and the note stays in tune with the background music. These controls are presented pictorially {{in the beginning of the}} game; at no point outside of the credits and title screen are <b>any</b> <b>words</b> shown or spoken.|$|E
25|$|The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, {{originally}} {{started in}} 1902 and completed in 1933, is an abridgement {{of the full}} work that retains the historical focus, but does not include <b>any</b> <b>words</b> which were obsolete before 1700 except those used by Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and the King James Bible. A completely new edition was produced from the OED2 and published in 1993, with further revisions following in 2002 and 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Sedition Act plays {{its part}} by criminalizing the doing of any act or the uttering of <b>any</b> <b>words</b> having a seditious tendency, and {{dealings}} with seditious publications. The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act ("MRHA") is {{another piece of}} this legislative jigsaw. It was introduced to ensure that adherents of different religious groups exercise tolerance and moderation, and to keep religion out of politics. Minister for Home Affairs S. Jayakumar stated that the MRHA takes a pre-emptive approach and can be invoked in a restrained manner to enable prompt and effective action. In contrast with the punitive approach of the Sedition Act where a breach of the statute carries criminal liability, under the MRHA restraining orders may be imposed upon people causing feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different religious groups, among other things. Criminal sanctions only apply if such orders are contravened.|$|E

500|$|... "Drug Testing" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta and {{directed}} by show runner and executive producer Greg Daniels. Fischer noted that the subplot featuring Jim unable to talk was important because [...] "Pam and Jim can say a lot to one another without <b>any</b> <b>words</b> at all", {{a reference to the}} [...] "27 seconds of silence" [...] the two shared in the earlier episode [...] "Booze Cruise". Michael has a bandage around his finger in this episode because Steve Carell hurt his finger during the week and was unable to remove his wedding ring due to the swelling. Instead of cutting off his ring, the crew simply wrapped a bandage around it.|$|E

Of the song's introduction, bassist Adam Clayton says, [...] "When people put on the record, we wanted their first reaction to be either 'this record is broken' or 'this can't be the new U2 record, there's been a mistake.' So there is quite a dramatic extended intro where you just don't know what you are listening to."

500|$|Counsel for the Government held a {{different}} view. It was {{noted that the}} Peerage Act 1963 explicitly repealed the portions of the Articles of Union relating to elections of representative peers, and that no parliamentary commentators had raised doubts as to the validity of those repeals. As Article XXII had been, or at least purportedly, repealed, there was nothing specific in the Treaty that the bill transgressed. It was further asserted by the Government that Article XXII could be repealed because {{it had not been}} entrenched. Examples of entrenched provisions are numerous: England and Scotland were united [...] "forever", the Court of Session was to remain [...] "in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted", and the establishment of the Church of Scotland was [...] "effectually and unalterably secured". Article XXII, however, did not include <b>any</b> <b>words</b> of entrenchment, making it [...] "fundamental or unalterable in all time coming".|$|E

500|$|In Debs v. United States, the Court {{elaborated}} on the [...] "clear {{and present}} danger" [...] test established in Schenck. On June 16, 1918, Eugene V. Debs, a political activist, delivered {{a speech in}} Canton, Ohio, in which he spoke of [...] "most loyal comrades were paying the penalty to the working class – these being , Baker and Ruthenberg, who {{had been convicted of}} aiding and abetting another in failing to register for the draft." [...] Following his speech, Debs was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act. In upholding his conviction, the Court reasoned that although he had not spoken <b>any</b> <b>words</b> that posed a [...] "clear and present danger", taken in context, the speech had a [...] "natural tendency and a probable effect to obstruct the recruiting services". In Abrams v. United States, four Russian refugees appealed their conviction for throwing leaflets from a building in New York; the leaflets argued against President Woodrow Wilson's intervention in Russia against the October Revolution. The majority upheld their conviction, but Holmes and Justice Louis Brandeis dissented, holding that the government had demonstrated no [...] "clear and present danger" [...] in the four's political advocacy.|$|E
500|$|... "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was written}} by Halliwell, Andy Watkins and Paul Wilson {{in the autumn of}} 1998. The singer wanted to make a song with Spanish influences, in order to pay homage for her Spanish mother. During a day in the studio, they came up with a melody but did not have <b>any</b> <b>words.</b> Then she called her mother for help. Halliwell {{recalled}} asking her, [...] "Mum, {{what do you say to}} a bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic?" [...] Her mother then said she did not remember that.

[...] ("Where is the man with fire in his blood?" [...] in English), and she liked the way it sounded, and included the line at the beginning of the song.

[...] Monique Marcil of Zap2it said that the [...] "28 seconds of silence between co-workers Jim and Pam capture all the awkwardness and longing of unspoken love better than <b>any</b> <b>words</b> could. And it's these private moments caught on film by the unseen documentary crew that give this otherwise tart sitcom its sweetness." [...] John Krasinski stated that [...] "Booze Cruise" [...] included two of his favorite scenes to film: Jim's conversation with Pam, and Jim's conversation with Michael. He later called both of the shots [...] "beautiful" [...] and noted that it was [...] "nothing short of an honor" [...] to film them with Fischer and Carell, respectively. TV Fanatic reviewed several of the episodes quotes; Steve Marsi rated Jim's quote, [...] "You know what? I would save the receptionist. Just wanted to clear that up" [...] a 3 out of 5. Marsi also rated Jim and Michael's conversation about Pam a 5 out of 5.|$|E

500|$|Bilinda Butcher's vocals {{have been}} {{referred}} to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine's sound, alongside Shields' guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn't Anything and Loveless, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said [...] "influenced [...] sound" [...] by making them [...] "more dreamy and sleepy". The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine's recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument. Critics have often described an androgynous sound to the band's vocals. My Bloody Valentine's lyrics are mostly written by Shields. However, Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both Isn't Anything and Loveless, but has referred {{to a lot of the}} lyrics as [...] "plain nonsense." [...] According to Butcher, she [...] "didn't have a plan and never thought about lyrics until it was time to write them. I just used whatever was in my head for the moment." [...] Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to interpret rough versions of songs Shields had recorded. Butcher has said: [...] "He [...] never sang <b>any</b> <b>words</b> on the cassettes I got but I tried to make his sounds into words." [...] Butcher and Shields would often spend eight to ten hours a night writing lyrics, even though few changes actually resulted, as Shields believed [...] "there's nothing worse than bad lyrics." [...] Spin writer Simon Reynolds has noted that the band's lyrics often contain sexual themes, which are [...] "a paradoxical blend of force and tenderness".|$|E
