5|$|Blackader and {{his wife}} spent {{a year and a}} half in Bermuda, where their {{daughter}} Dorothy was born in April 1889, and moved to Nova Scotia when the battalion was transferred there in 1890; shortly <b>after</b> <b>arrival,</b> on 21 March, he was promoted to lieutenant on 21 March. Their second daughter Joan was born in April 1892, and a year later the battalion transferred again, this time to the West Indies; Blackader was appointed adjutant - the officer responsible for administration - to one wing of the battalion, a force of three companies stationed at Jamaica. In late 1895, the battalion moved to South Africa, but shortly <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> Blackader returned to England; he was promoted to captain on 6 December.|$|E
5|$|The Electress became {{pregnant}} in 1692; however, she miscarried. It {{is thought that}} soon <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> she contracted syphilis from the Elector, which explains why Anna Maria Luisa and Johann Wilhelm failed to produce any children.|$|E
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>arrivals</b> of new officials, the Jindo rebels {{joined the}} Naju rebels. Most were {{captured}} and {{sent back to}} Jindo. In October 10, 1,322 soldiers, composed mainly of slaves and lower officials, were sent to defend Jindo against possible rebel attacks.|$|R
50|$|Less {{than half}} of the total {{expedition}} of the duc d'Anville managed to reach Chibouctou Bay. <b>After</b> their <b>arrival,</b> the Acadiens helped take care of the soldiers and the marines. However, 1,200 men died during the crossing and more than 1,000 died of typhoid <b>after</b> their <b>arrival</b> at Chibouctou.|$|R

5|$|The {{settlement}} {{history of}} the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English <b>after</b> <b>arrival.</b> Now {{the majority of the}} United States population are monolingual English speakers, although English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state governments of the US.|$|E
5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito <b>after</b> <b>arrival.</b> It is estimated that the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Epatiana succeeded {{his father}} as King of Rurutu around 1886, while still a young child. Due to historians' lack of {{consensus}} about his birth year, sources differ on the actual age of Epatiana at the time. This early succession was a consequence of a decision taken in old age by Epatiana's father to abdicate and journey back to his homeland of Huahine, where he died shortly <b>after</b> <b>arrival.</b> The body of Teuruarii III was repatriated to Rurutu and interred in the royal cemetery. Because of Epatiana's youth and inexperience, his mother Taarouru served as regent for an indeterminate number of years until the prince was deemed fit to rule independently.|$|E

5|$|Later the Crown {{prosecutor}} {{conceded that}} Richards had procured the drugs <b>after</b> <b>arrival.</b> Despite the incident, {{the band played}} two shows in Toronto, only to raise more controversy when Margaret Trudeau, then-wife of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was seen partying with the band after one show. The band's two shows were not advertised to the public. Instead, the El Mocambo had been booked for the entire week by April Wine for a recording session. 1050 CHUM, a local radio station, ran a contest for free tickets to see April Wine. Contest winners who selected tickets for Friday or Saturday night were surprised to find the Rolling Stones playing.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 1915, Whittle {{transferred}} to the Australian Imperial Force {{in order to see}} active service overseas during the war. Allotted as a reinforcement to the 26th Battalion as a private, he embarked from Melbourne on 27 October aboard HMAT Ulysses bound for Egypt. Appointed acting corporal soon <b>after</b> <b>arrival,</b> he was reallocated to the 12th Battalion with the rank of private on 1 March 1916, following a period of divisional reorganisation and expansion to the Australian forces which were now stationed in Egypt. Whittle was promoted to the substantive rank of corporal two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} out of {{commission}} from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1907. Over the next five years, most of Yorktowns time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. <b>After</b> <b>arrival</b> at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919; she was sold in 1921 to an Oakland firm and broken up that same year.|$|E

5|$|As Preneuse {{had gone}} ashore near Port Louis, Sercey {{had come to}} observe the {{engagement}} and therefore witnessed {{the destruction of the}} last of his squadron of 1796. A commander without a command he subsequently took ship back to France and there retired from his commission, later returning to his family and settling on Île de France. The action temporarily left the French with no naval forces in the East Indies at all, although raiding cruises by privateers still posed a considerable threat to the British Indian Ocean trade routes. The only subsequent reinforcement to arrive in the region during the war was the frigate Chiffone was intercepted and captured at the Battle of Mahé shortly <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> in 1801, although substantial reinforcements did reach Île de France before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} associations with service there, Nolan had deliberately {{transferred to a}} regiment operating in India. He initially travelled to Maidstone, where the 15th maintained a troop to train new recruits, {{under the command of}} Captain George Key. He then caught a troopship to Bombay, the Malabar, which arrived on 9 November. Soon <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> he fell ill and was granted two years of sick leave, starting from 26 March 1840, and returned to Britain. He returned to active service in June 1841, again to the Maidstone depot, and became a Lieutenant on the 19th. He went on leave again in August to take the riding master's course and exam, and returned on 8 March 1842, newly qualified.|$|E
5|$|In case {{a doctor}} was needed, Major Charles H. Morhouse was summoned from Bataan to {{accompany}} the party. The remaining thirteen were members of MacArthur's staff. They were loyal and experienced, {{and some of them}} had been with MacArthur for years. Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers. Promoted from private that day, Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to post.|$|E

5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii was {{a fairly}} large rodent, larger than the black rat (Rattus rattus). A {{member of the family}} Cricetidae and {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae, it shares several distinctive characters with Holochilus and related genera within the tribe Oryzomyini, including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that Holochilus is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate genus, Noronhomys. Its close relatives, including Holochilus and Lundomys, are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, spending much of their time in the water, but features of the Noronhomys bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> at its remote island.|$|E
5|$|The liner {{arrived at}} Haifa on March 31, {{nearly a week}} late. Herman Hirsch {{reported}} that a passenger from Chicago, Jacob Drapekin, 72, had died aboard the ship on March 24. The man's dying wish was {{to be buried in}} the Holy Land, and the crew of President Arthur helped fulfill his wishes. <b>After</b> <b>arrival</b> in Haifa, his flag-draped coffin was placed on deck and services were conducted in English and Hebrew by Rabbi Ashinsky before the body was taken ashore for interment. A sizable crowd, comprising delegations from Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Tel Aviv, greeted the arriving ship. Most of the passengers on President Arthur were hurried to Jerusalem for the Hebrew University dedication ceremony the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{registry}} date to 1893, when the Hamidie Society sponsored an exhibit of Arabian horses from what today is Syria at the World Fair in Chicago. This exhibition raised considerable interest in Arabian horses. Records are unclear if 40 or 45 horses were imported for the exposition, but seven died in a fire shortly <b>after</b> <b>arrival.</b> The 28 horses that remained {{at the end of}} the exhibition stayed in America and were sold at auction when the Hamidie Society went bankrupt. These horses caught the interest of American breeders, including Peter Bradley of the Hingham Stock Farm, who purchased some Hamidie horses at the auction, and Homer Davenport, another admirer of the Hamidie imports.|$|E

5|$|The papal entourage {{arrived in}} Trier on 30 November 1147, but shortly <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> the pope {{decided to move}} the {{proceedings}} because of complaints from the residents of Trier, and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims, but still on the date given before. A feature of the council was that the pope ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials. Although some requested attendees were excused, it was mostly due to ill health, not {{to the need to}} see to the business of their offices. Those who did not attend were suspended from office. The Italian bishops, however, were mostly excused from attendance, as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1921, Connecticut again {{became the}} {{flagship}} of the Second Battleship Squadron when Rear Admiral Charles Frederick Hughes took command. The ships of the squadron departed Philadelphia on 7 April to perform maneuvers and training exercises off Cuba, though {{they returned to}} take part in the Presidential Review in Hampton Roads on 28 April. After participating in Naval Academy celebrations on Memorial Day, Connecticut and her squadmates departed on a midshipman cruise which took them to Europe. On 28 June, Connecticut hosted a Norwegian delegation that included King Haakon VII, Prime Minister Otto Blehr, the Minister of Defence, and the First Sea Lord of the Royal Norwegian Navy. After arriving in Portugal on 21 July, the battleship hosted the Civil Governor of the Province of Lisbon and the Commander-in-Chief of the Portuguese Navy. Six days later, Connecticut hosted the Portuguese president, António José de Almeida. The battleship squadron departed for Guantánamo Bay on 29 July and, <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> there, remained for gunnery practice and exercises. Connecticut, leaving the rest of the squadron, departed for Annapolis and disembarked her midshipmen on 30 August, then proceeded to Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The fate of {{the first}} egg is mostly unknown, but studies on the related royal penguin and erect-crested penguin show the female tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid. The task of {{incubating}} the egg {{is divided into three}} roughly equal sessions of around 12days each over a five-week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning to sea, leaving the female alone to tend the egg. Upon the male's return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched. Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37days <b>after</b> <b>arrival</b> until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36days, and the female fasts for 42days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period. Both adults lose 36–40% of their body weight during this period. The second egg hatches around 34days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean.|$|E
