40|$|In eukaryotes, protein {{phosphorylation}} of serine, threonine or tyrosine residues by protein kinases {{plays an}} important role in many cellular processes. Members of the protein kinase CK 1 family usually phosphorylate residues of serine that are close to other phosphoserine in a consensus motif of pS-X-X-S, and they are implicated in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes as well as in pathologies like cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Using a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) approach we have identified two anthraquinones as novel CK 1 delta inhibitors. These <b>amino-anthraquinone</b> analogs (derivatives 1 and 2) are among the most potent and selective CK 1 delta inhibitors known today (IC(50) = 0. 3 and 0. 6 microM, respectively) ...|$|E

We discuss the results obtained with both vertical and adiabatic (vibronic) approximations, choosing relevant examples for several series of dyes. These examples include reproducing absorption wavelengths of numerous families of coloured molecules, understanding the specific band shape of <b>amino-anthraquinones,</b> optimising the properties of dyes used in solar cells, mimicking the fluorescence wavelengths of fluorescent brighteners and BODIPY dyes, studying optically active biomolecules and photo-induced proton transfer, as well as improving the properties of photochromes...|$|R
