In this paper, we describe how the motivation models support the description of desirable outcomes and help to develop relevant high-level goals in policy making in particularly complex areas. We give two example domains where we have developed agent-based models. The first is data management policy for university researchers. The second one focuses on sustainable households, and how to provide relevant guidance for educating people and helping them to understand how to behave in a more environmentally friendly manner. Our two examples demonstrate that the agent-based models are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with shared quality goals and identifying the right stakeholders in these two multifaceted and abstract domains.

There are certain games that are made for just competitive multiplayer purposes. With those type of games, players focus entirely one choosing the right character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so {{that people in the}} area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best. Major League Gaming (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for {{the fact that they have}} played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with different strategies for facing different characters.

One of the ways used to achieve shorter time to markets for new product developments is by using design for manufacturing (DFM) methods to reduce time and energy going into resolving manufacturing based defects. It is also more vital in today’s manufacturing industry to make use of DFM methods much earlier in the product development lifecycle in order to prevent potentially known quality defects from happening and save on costs associated with late design changes. This requires enabling a more systemic feedback cycle of production data for the creation of DFM knowledge repositories as well as overcoming some wider knowledge sharing barriers across the organization. This investigation focuses on how the communications of manufacturing knowledge from production data is affected by factors within the overall organization. The investigation {{is one of the few}} that consider the influence of organizational factors on the communication of engineering knowledge as well as the related knowledge sharing barriers. The project is carried out empirically with a large UK based aerospace manufacturing company by gathering data primarily from observations and interviews.

On July 3, 1850, Columbia began her first run from Astoria to Portland and Oregon City. Columbia's first captain was Jim Frost, {{who had been a}} pilot on the Mississippi river. It took two days to get to Portland, largely because of the captain's lack of familiarity with the river channel and his resulting caution. After that, Columbia made the Oregon City-Portland-Astoria run twice a month at four miles per hour, charging $25 per passenger and $25 per ton of freight.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} and evaluate an experiment where actors {{were used to}} simulate the behaviour of processes in a distributed system in order to explain the concept of self-stabilisation in a graduate course on distributed systems. A self-stabilising system is one that ensures that the system's behaviour eventually stabilises to a safe subset of states regardless of the initial state. Protocols satisfying this elegant property, which enables a system to recover from transient failures that can alter {{the state of the}} system, are often hard to understand, especially for students that have not studied distributed computing and systems before. The experiment was part of an introductory course on distributed computing and systems for graduates in October 2000. The purpose of this interactive animation was to introduce to the students the basic concepts behind self-stabilisation (eligible states, transient faults, execution convergence) before their formal introduction. All of the students had a degree either in mathematics or computing science and had taken a course on algorithms before. However, most of the students did not have a background in distributed systems or distributed algorithms. The latter was not only the motivation for preparing this method of presentation but also what made this a challenging effort. The feedback from the class was that the concept and this teaching method were very well received.
