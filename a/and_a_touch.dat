He might have been the Alan Ladd or the Richard Widmark of the Sixties: but the Sixties didn't want a new Alan Ladd. Peppard began appearing in a series of action movies, predictably as a tough guy, but there were much tougher guys around - like Cagney, Bogart and Robinson, whose films had now become television staples.|$|E

25|$|The {{city has}} often been used as the {{backdrop}} for romances like Indiscreet (1958) with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>Touch</b> of Class (1973), and has become popular for romantic comedies in recent years. This is at least {{partly due to the}} television and film writer Richard Curtis, who has written some of the most successful British films of recent years — The Tall Guy (1989), Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), Notting Hill (1999) and Love Actually (2003), all set or partly set in the city. The films follow the awkward love lives of largely upper-middle class characters (aside from The Tall Guy, always including one played by Hugh Grant).|$|E
25|$|The Caprice PPV {{concept car}} {{was based on}} the Middle Eastern spec Caprice LS, which {{was based on the}} Holden WM Caprice Series I. The front end and grille are the same as the 2007-2010 Caprice LS. The Caprice letter is {{engraved}} into the chrome trim on the trunk, there is PPV lettering {{on the right side of}} the rear fascia and a FlexFuel nameplate, which was on GM vehicles in North America from 2007 through 2009. The PPV has dual exhaust, a floor shifter in the console, a prisoner partition with rifle and shotgun mounts, lights and siren controls in the console, 18 inch steel rims & center caps from the Impala 9C1, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> screen in place of the radio and HVAC controls. A prototype similar to the concept car in LAPD was shown around Australia by Holden. Another prototype tested by the LAPD had the same front end, grille, steel rims and center caps as the production models, while the car was based on the Series I WM Caprice with its rear bumper, colored turn signal indicators lamps on the side of the car, chrome trim with Caprice engraved on it, & V8 badge from the 2007-2010 Caprice.|$|E

The 15-inch notebook started at $2,399, compared to $1,999 for the previous iteration. On 5 June 2017, Apple upgraded the internals of the MacBook Pro, such as enhanced Iris Plus and AMD Radeon graphics, Kaby Lake processors, and added memory. Additionally, the 13-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a 128GB storage option (down from the base 256GB storage) with a lowered starting price of $1299. All other configurations of the MacBook Pro have the same price as last year, barring the incremental upgrades in processors and graphics.|$|E

500|$|Playboy {{noted that}} the {{advertisements}} for the film said, [...] "this film has no socially redeeming value" [...] and continued [...] "well, that's dead right, yet this movie has some value as a promising X-rated cartoon {{in the tradition of}} Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat. The New York Times called it a [...] "zany, lively, uninhibited, sexual odyssey that manages to mix a bit of Walter Mitty <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> of Woody Allen with some of the innocence of Walt Disney [...] urban smarts of Ralph Bakshi". Charles Solomon of The Los Angeles Times gave the film an extremely negative review, calling [...] "a sprawling undisciplined piece of sniggering vulgarity that resembles nothing so much as animated bathroom graffiti. [...] degrading to women, blacks, Chicanos, gays, cops, lesbians, and anyone with an IQ of more than 45". Variety commented that the film [...] "has little to recommend." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} sound of Lions but felt the songs were weak. [...] Writing for dotmusic, John Mulvey {{highlighted}} the [...] "gutsy, no-messing sound", but appreciated [...] "Cosmic Friend" [...] for being [...] "as impressively mad as you'd hope, too, beginning like Beatles psychedelia, taking in massive Brazilian drumming <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> of pedal steel, before coalescing into furious heavy rock." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described Lions as a [...] "powerful, textured hard rock record that covers a lot of ground, surging from powerful riffs to gospel choruses and funkier-than-expected riffs", though he also complained that [...] "the songs can seem incomplete." [...] Critics disagreed on which songs were lacking, though. [...] "Losing My Mind" [...] and [...] "Young Man, Old Man" [...] were called [...] "highlights" [...] by Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun, though elsewhere the former was called [...] "woeful" [...] and the latter a [...] "'Freddie's Dead' vamp" [...] {{that should have been}} skipped.|$|E

While writing the Rocket Science script, Blitz had been listening to indie rock band Clem Snide's music and suggested {{the use of their}} music on the soundtrack to the HBO executive producers. He contacted Clem Snide's lead singer Eef Barzelay to use some of the band's songs, but Barzelay says [...] "it just made more sense for me to write original instrumental music", and composed the incidental score himself. When choosing instruments, he tried to create sounds that would match Hal's awkwardness. [...] "I had this little ukulele that I never played... And Jeffrey [...] had gotten a little bee in his bonnet about the accordion... and then at one point I started using a kazoo." [...] One of his original songs, [...] "I Love the Unknown", was chosen from the 1999 album Your Favorite Music.|$|E

500|$|Many {{felt the}} tone of the album was millennial or futuristic, anticipating {{cultural}} and political trends. According to The A.V.

[...] In 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon described OK Computer as a [...] "prescient... dystopian essay on the darker implications of technology... oozing [...] a vague sense of dread, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> of Big Brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on Security Level Orange, post-9/11." [...] Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, [...] "It would {{be interesting to see how}} the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer. I think the world would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn't it change his?" ...|$|E
500|$|Crecine was {{instrumental}} in securing the 1996 Summer Olympics for Atlanta. In September 1989 he imagined a grand multimedia presentation for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The resulting 3-D presentation, developed by the institute's Multimedia Laboratory, provided a [...] "1996" [...] view of Atlanta, complete with digitized graphic models of non-existent facilities overlaid on their proposed sites. More than 40 Georgia Tech computer scientists were recruited to assemble the virtual reality, three-dimensional tour through Olympic venues {{that had not yet}} even been designed. The term [...] "virtual reality" [...] was almost unknown in 1989 when Tech's seven-foot tall, three-screen, 3-D interactive video and laser disc projection system debuted during a meeting of the IOC at San Juan, Puerto Rico. Members of the committee used a trackball <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> screen to view a dazzling montage of animation, computer graphics, aerial photography, video, and satellite topographical photographs created to depict Atlanta during the Centennial Olympic Games. Many believe the presentation showed the IOC that Atlanta was a major player in its Olympics bid and served to create the foundation for the city's high-tech theme for the Centennial Games.|$|E
500|$|The Toronto Suns Steve Tilley, who {{believed}} that Remedy did a [...] "killer job" [...] on Max Payne 2, felt that the company kept what was great about the previous game, [...] "while everything else has been tweaked, overhauled and juiced up". He was {{a fan of the}} Bullet Time from the first game, and therefore appreciated seeing it return in the sequel, with [...] "even more impressive" [...] visuals. Tilley found that the game's [...] "lifelike physics engine" [...] was easily its best aspect, and noted that while playing the game, he threw a grenade across a room, which resulted in an explosion that sent enemies flying through the air in a realistic fashion. In addition, Tilley applauded Remedy for listening to fan complaints and resolving issues from the previous game, including improved dream sequences in Max Payne 2. He was, however, disappointed with the general linearity of the game, and noted that players who are not interested in film noir themes will not enjoy them in Max Payne 2. Concluding, Tilley commented that the game [...] "has enough polish, cinematic flair and outright mayhem to thrill those who like their Sopranos with a dash of John Woo <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> of Frank Miller." ...|$|E
