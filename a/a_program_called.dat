40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a new scheme for {{software}} obfuscation and license protection that is based on an original transformation of the <b>program’s</b> <b>call</b> tree. The idea is based on the observation of similarities between <b>a</b> <b>program’s</b> <b>call</b> tree and Context Free Grammars. First, this paper proposes a practical technique for applying well studied LALR methodologies to transforming <b>a</b> <b>program’s</b> <b>call</b> tree. Second, we suggest methods of effective binding of the transformed program to the program’s installation site. Finally, we note that the given scheme provides us with a series of difficult to remove unique identifications integrally embedded into the transformed programs {{that could be used for}} software watermarking purposes...|$|R

5|$|Alongside the {{publication}} of the fifth edition, Wizards of the Coast established a two-pronged licensing approach. The core of the fifth edition rules have been made available under the OGL, while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials directly for Dungeons & Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> the DM's Guild. The DM's Guild does not function under the OGL, but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation between the content creators.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Chico was a Deputy Chief of Staff for Mayor Richard M. Daley. He coordinated {{efforts to}} drain freight tunnels that were flooded {{with water from}} the Chicago River. Chico was later {{promoted}} to Chief of Staff, a position he held from 1992 to 1995. As part of his duties, he oversaw {{the completion of the}} International Terminal of O'Hare International Airport, preparations for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the construction of new schools. Along with Budget Director Paul Vallas, Chico helped add 1,000 officers to the police force and improved neighborhoods throughout the city through <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> Neighborhoods Alive.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Ledonne {{discovered}} <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> RPG Maker, {{which allows}} a developer to add images, text, story and objectives {{to design a}} game; RPG Maker creates the necessary programming automatically. Ledonne had always conceptualized video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge; with RPG Maker {{he was able to}} fulfill his ambition. Ledonne decided to make a game that would explore why the Columbine shootings occurred, as well as refuting pervasive myths about the shooters and the alleged role video games played in the massacre.|$|E

5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 with <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed {{the user to}} launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of other applications in the screen's background.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Kerala {{became the}} first state in India to offer free cancer {{treatment}} to the poor, via <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> Sukrutham. People in Kerala experience elevated incidence of cancers, liver and kidney diseases. In April 2016, the Economic Times reported that 250,000 residents undergo treatment for cancer. It also reported that approximately 150 to 200 liver transplants are conducted in the region's hospitals annually. Approximately 42,000 cancer cases are reported in the region annually. This {{is believed to be}} an underestimate due as private hospitals may not be reporting their figures. Long waiting lists for kidney donations has stimulated illegal trade in human kidneys, and prompted the establishment of the Kidney Federation of India which aims to support financially disadvantaged patients.|$|E
5|$|The {{most senior}} {{military}} officer in-country was the AIRA, the ambassador's air attaché, an Air Force colonel. The air attaché office originally consisted of that officer {{and six other}} personnel. The burgeoning air programs in Laos however, dictated the dispatch of 117 more Air Force personnel during 1966. The Air Force conducted its operations {{under the aegis of}} Project 404, whose mission was to support the Royal Laotian military, the clandestine Hmong army, and to support project personnel, who coordinated the operational end of covert activities in Laos. Eventually, five air operations centers were created in Laos – at Vientiane, Pakse, Savannakhet, Long Tieng, and Luang Prabang. These centers supported the ambassador with intelligence, administrative services, and communications as well as the actual air operations under <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> Palace Dog.|$|E

5|$|The {{university}} runs {{a number}} of academic institutions and programs apart from its undergraduate and postgraduate schools. It operates the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (a private day school for K-12 students and day care), the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School (a residential treatment program for those with behavioral and emotional problems), and a public charter school with four campuses on the South Side of Chicago administered by the university's Urban Education Institute. In addition, the Hyde Park Day School, a school {{for students with learning}} disabilities, maintains a location on the University of Chicago campus. Since 1983, the University of Chicago has maintained the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project, a mathematics program used in urban primary and secondary schools. The university runs <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> the Council on Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences, which administers interdisciplinary workshops to provide a forum for graduate students, faculty, and visiting scholars to present scholarly work in progress.|$|E
5|$|Using <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> Blendanal, {{similar to}} the Blender {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>called</b> the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E
