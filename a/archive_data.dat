25|$|Dispersal, {{extent and}} {{duration}} of the resistance rendered research after 1990 more difficult in ascertaining structural information on the movement. Evaluating {{the archives of the}} Securitate the CNSAS (National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives) has assessed a provisional figure of 1196 resistance groups acting between 1948 and 1960. The size of the groups varied from small groupings of less than 10 members to intermediate sized groups counting around 40 fighters up to larger detachments of more than 100 men, with the highest distribution density placed around a strength of 1520 men. According to these assumptions, the total number of active resistance fighters may not fall below 10,000 persons, with an estimated figure of at least 4050,000 supporting persons. The number of killed victims on the insurgents’ side could be established according to both <b>archive</b> <b>data</b> and various memoirs published after 1990. The archives revealed several hundreds of death penalties, yet a much larger number of resisters have been killed either in battle or during different phases of detention. An estimated figure could amount 2,000 lost lives.|$|E
2500|$|In Eastern Europe, many Jews {{joined the}} ranks of the Soviet partisans: {{throughout}} the war, they faced antisemitism and discrimination from the Soviets and some Jewish partisans were killed, but over time, many of the Jewish partisan groups were absorbed into the command structure of the much larger Soviet partisan movement. [...] Soviet partisans arrived in western Ukraine in 1943, and consisted of Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, and Jews, and were smaller in size than that of units in Belarus, which was more suitable for partisan warfare. Released Soviet <b>archive</b> <b>data</b> suggest that Jews accounted for 5.2% of partisans in Ukraine.|$|E
2500|$|Adam Menelaws, also spelled Menelas (born between 1748 and 1756, presumably in Edinburgh – died 31 August 1831 in Saint Petersburg, [...] ) was an {{architect}} and landscape designer of Scottish origin, {{active in the}} Russian Empire from 1784 to 1831. Menelaws achieved success {{in the first two}} decades of the 19th century as the designer of town and country residences and parks of Razumovsky and Stroganov families, and later worked for emperor Alexander I, specializing in Gothic Revival architecture. From 1825 to 1831 Menelaws, then in his seventies, became the first house architect of Nicholas I and de facto the leading architect of the Empire. Except for this final, properly evidenced, stage, life story of Adam Menelaws remains scarcely documented and has been reconstructed by biographers based on sketchy <b>archive</b> <b>data</b> and circumstantial evidence; Menelaws still [...] "belongs to the category of almost unknown".|$|E

2500|$|Wilmington has {{consistently}} {{ranked among the}} most dangerous cities in the United States, along with several other cities in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, such as Camden, Chester, Trenton, and Atlantic City. In the 2000s, while most cities have seen a decrease in crime and murder, Wilmington has broken its record for homicides {{in a single year}} multiple times. In 2017, Wilmington saw an even steeper increase in crime. By August of 2017, Wilmington had already eclipsed the homicide total of 2016 despite only being 2/3 through the year. In 2014, Wilmington recorded 28 homicides, making for a rate of 39.5 per 100,000 residents, which is ten times the national average. Wilmington frequently appears on NeighborhoodScout's [...] "Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the United States" [...] list. Most recently, in 2017, Wilmington was ranked as the 5th most dangerous city in the US. Nearby cities such as Camden, New Jersey and Chester, PA, also ranked in the top 15. In early 2017, the mayor's office as well as many public advocates called for comprehensive action to reduce astronomical crime rates in Wilmington, as the city saw a shooting almost every other day throughout the spring, and by May, the city had already seen 15 homicides. Since 2011, 80.5% of perpetrators in shooting incidents have not been arrested. Even in shooting deaths, only 39.5% of the perpetrators are arrested, leading to feelings of stress and lawlessness among the city's residents. An analysis of Gun Violence <b>Archive</b> <b>data</b> by the Associated Press and USA Today found that, for the 3 1/2 year period from January 2014 to June 2017, Wilmington led the nation in teens injured or killed by gun violence with a rate of 3.4 per 1000 teens, nearly double the rate of second-place Chicago's 1.8 per 1000 teens. Between January 2015 and September 4, 2017, sixty-four children were shot in Wilmington, five of which died, with only 16 arrests made in those cases.|$|E
