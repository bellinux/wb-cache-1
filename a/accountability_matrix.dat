40|$|Abstract This article {{presents}} pioneering research on measuring virtual wealth {{in an open}} virtual world for diagnosing the health of virtual worlds. It proved {{the existence of an}} open virtual world by proving the existence of a free choice of virtual currencies for virtual goods between distinct virtual worlds. By discussing the features of open virtual world in a circled networked organization, the article devised a virtual wealth measuring scheme, called Gross Virtual Product (GVP), for any virtual world. Based on this scheme, it suggested an <b>accountability</b> <b>matrix</b> to account for a changing virtual world regarding its total virtual wealth, profitability, user participation and happiness. To demonstrate the suitability of GVP scheme and <b>accountability</b> <b>matrix,</b> the article has conducted a case study on SecondLife. com, which showed the appropriateness of the proposed scheme and matrix. The research made in this article is very important. The proposed measuring scheme and matrix help virtual world participants perceive the possible risks of the participated virtual worlds in advance to make better decisions on virtual business...|$|E
40|$|Various {{scholars}} have identified multiple sources of accountability in nonprofit and voluntary organizations (NPVOs) and have offered several typologies categorizing various streams of accountability. Only {{a few have}} attempted to offer strategies, however, to implement these differential forms of accountability. The study identifies multiple sources of NPVO accountabilities by engaging distinctions between these organizations ’ instrumental and expressive activities. From a qualitative study in 16 Chinese Canadian NPVOs, three forms of expressive accountability and two forms of instrumental accountability are distinguished. The study further develops a two-dimensional <b>accountability</b> <b>matrix</b> for categorizing organizations into four types according to their levels of commitment to expressive and instrumental accountabilities. Lastly, by associating organizational and managerial factors {{with the task of}} balancing the two accountabilities, the authors draw conclusions and offer implications for managerial practice...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{investigated}} {{the issue of}} virtual wealth and its realization in both real and virtual worlds, and argued that the realization of virtual wealth is necessary and possible. On the formation of virtual wealth, it has studied the labor theory of value, exchangeable value, and utility theory. From these theories, it has successfully explained the nature of virtual wealth that has difficulties in realization within a closed virtual world. It thus promotes an open virtual world for virtual wealth realization. In finding the approach to open virtual world, key elements about open virtual world are discussed. Based on the assumed open virtual world, the classification, measurement and factors of change on virtual wealth are described, and the methods of realizing virtual wealth in both virtual and real worlds are proposed. To validate the method, an <b>accountability</b> <b>matrix</b> is proposed and used to analyzing the case of Second Life virtual world. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{addressing}} {{the shortcomings of}} existing schemata for classifying and depicting <b>accountability</b> relationships, a <b>matrix</b> is proposed based on criteria espoused by category theorists. The matrix's utility in highlighting the mutual and self accountabilities of organizations and their constituents in meeting their role/task, legal/ethical and moral responsibilities is demonstrated by focusing on accountability relationships affecting the operator of a privately operated prison. The matrix is intended to generalize to identifying {{a wide range of}} accountability pressures and relationships that individuals, groups and organizations are subject to in trying to meet their various obligations. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{guide is}} for those staff {{who would like to}} learn more about how to {{implement}} activities that are accountable to people and communities. It is primarily aimed at country-level staff responsible for implementing development or humanitarian projects and programmes. The pack begins with an introduction to Oxfam GB's approach to accountability. This is followed by Oxfam International's <b>Accountability</b> <b>Matrix.</b> The Matrix shows the commitments to accountability found within Oxfam International's Programme Standards, and the different levels programmes can achieve in each area. Following this is an explanation of Oxfam GB's Minimum Standards on Accountability. The rest of the pack is divided into four sections - one {{for each of the four}} Standards that Oxfam GB is focussing on. For each Standard, there is a brief explanation as to why this Standard is important, then some 'How-To' Guidelines and a Good Practice example from one of Oxfam's programmes. We have also added an extra section on how to improve greater financial transparency as we have had so many requests for guidance specifically on this...|$|E
40|$|Sovereign wealth funds – state-controlled {{transnational}} {{portfolio investment}} vehicles – {{began as an}} externally imposed category {{in search of a}} definition. SWFs from different countries had little in common and no particular desire to collaborate. But SWFs as a group implicated the triple challenge of securing cooperation between deficit and surplus states, designing a legal framework for global capital flows, and integrating state actors in the transnational marketplace. This Article describes how an apparently artificial grouping of investors, made salient by the historical and political circumstances of their host states in the mid- 2000 s, became a vehicle for addressing some of the hardest policy problems of the past century and a site for innovation in international law-making and institution-building. I suggest that the funds’ hybrid public-private and transnational character makes them hard to define and govern, but also makes them exceptionally apt reflections of contemporary global finance and its multiple constituents. I elaborate this character in a four-part <b>accountability</b> <b>matrix.</b> The task of governing SWFs, just like the task of governing global finance, is about negotiating among public, private, internal and external demands for accountability {{in the absence of a}} stable hierarchy among them...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Responsibility and {{accountability}} {{are central to}} much of what managers do, but in the literature these complex social science concepts are confused. The paper aims to bring theoretical rigour, structure, consistency and parsimony to this field, using as an example the subcategories of responsibility referred to as corporate social responsibility (CSR) and global responsibility. Design/methodology/approach – This conceptual paper analyses and identifies overlaps, redundancies, gaps, limitations and flaws in current constructs of responsibility {{and accountability}}. Using this as a base, we propose a responsibility and <b>accountability</b> <b>matrix</b> comprised of eight constructs, which in turn underpin a process model in which responsibility precedes accountability. Findings – The eight constructs are shown to be sufficient and necessary to explain: {{the nature of the}} obligation that one party has to another (role, legal, ethical and moral responsibility); the responsibilities and accountabilities that arise from decisions, actions and behaviours (causal, judged and felt responsibility; external and felt accountability); and how these responsibilities differ from constructs that define the ambit of responsibility (personal, team, corporate, social and global responsibility). This then forms the basis of a proposed generic process model of responsibility and accountability that shows how the discrete and sequential stages of the process typically unfold, and how the responsibility and accountability constructs proposed above relate {{to each other and to}} the various process stages. It argues that concepts of CSR and global responsibility, poorly defined both in practice and in the literature, can be better understood when these eight constructs are applied to them. Practical implications – To underscore the practical implications of the theory, it shows, by reference to the model, how CSR and global responsibility can play out in the case of banks. However, being a generic model, it extends to many other applications in management and the social sciences. Originality/value – The proposed model is highly original, clarifying, augmenting, categorising and integrating concepts of accountability and responsibility. The paper is also original in providing a framework for reducing CSR and global responsibility to their constituent first-order constructs. 26 page(s...|$|E
40|$|ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF PATHS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN CHILE: A GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM APPROACH The main {{objective}} of this project is to analyse and evaluate the consequences of Chile’s high dependence on natural resources for the short and long-term growth of Chilean economy {{in a context of}} global balance. For this purpose, it was proposed to develop the necessary conceptual frameworks in order to understand growth determinants and, fundamentally, to develop 2 applied models of general balance through which these determinants could be incorporated. With this intention, a literature review was carried out, which allowed establishing growth determinants and developed a theoretical model that emphasizes the importance of generating public goods by using profits obtained from exploiting natural resources. Also, the importance of applying models that turn some growth determinants into endogenous, particularly education, trade spillovers and synergies associated to public goods. Based on the above, 2 applied models were developed. These models allow examining the impact of diverse development strategies on Chile. The ECOGEM-Chile static model was transformed into a recursive dynamic model, following a practice that is common in the applied field. Grassroots information of the model was improved, developing a social <b>accountability</b> <b>matrix</b> for the year 2003 Activity-Activity. Moreover, specific emission factors for Chile have been developed. A version of the model incorporating Ricardian incomes and their allocation mechanism was developed. Another version of the model incorporates inflexibilities in hydroelectric generation, thus allowing a better modelling of the impacts of energetic shocks on the economy. Moreover, following the most advanced practice in regard to endogenousness of some growth determinants, work was carried out together with Hans Lofgren, a renowned authority in applied general balance models at the World Bank, and the Maquette for MDG Simulation (MAMS) model was adapted for Chile. This model allows incorporating public goods and their respective synergies, endogenously presents human capital by linking education to work productivities, and incorporates diverse spillovers from trade openness. Using the ECOGEM model, the impact of copper price increase was assessed, and a royalty that allows implementing diverse distributive policies was applied. Besides, economic and social impacts of the shocks associated to the increase in oil price and the decrease in the availability of Argentine natural gas were assessed. Results show that social sectors are particularly sensitive to the distributive policies applied. A potential Dutch disease is also observed in the short-term, but reduced in the long-term. Using this model, the impact of free trade agreements signed with the United States and the European Union was also assessed, arriving to the conclusion that they have a significant effect only if there is a substantial change in foreign investment. Fulfilment of the millennium development goals for Chile was also assessed using the MAMS model; particularly, fulfilment of the goals for poverty, primary education, mother and children mortality and environmental goals related to water and sewer system coverage. Chile will meet all the above goals by 2015, except for the education goal. The effects of the Chilean tax reform on economic growth, and of spillovers associated to trade opening, are also examined. Results show that these are relatively small spillovers. In order to examine social effects of the shocks and proposed policies, the microsimulation method has been incorporated. This is an innovative approach based on probabilistic analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, used in recent models to relate general balance outflows with micro-data provided by home surveys. This project has made possible to elaborate several book chapters; generate various papers – one sent to an ISI journal and 2 to top-level international Congresses – which will later be sent to ISI journals; disseminate the subject of natural resources in national and international congresses; and elaborate several work documents and technical reports on the subject. Moreover, works have been developed together with international organizations such as ECLAC and UNDP. An important collaboration line has been opened in this field with the contribution of David Holland, from the Washington State University, and Hans Lofgren, from the World Bank. Also, human capital has been generated by carrying out various Master’s and PhD theses. Collaborative work has also been conducted with national institutions, such as the Central Bank of Chile.
