25|$|In Orthodox Church tradition, Mary of Bethany is {{honored as}} a {{separate}} individual from Mary Magdalene. Though they are not specifically named as such in the gospels, the Orthodox Church counts Mary and Martha among the Myrrh-bearing Women. These faithful followers of Jesus stood at Golgotha during the Crucifixion of Jesus and later came to his tomb early on the morning following the Sabbath with myrrh (expensive oil), according to the Jewish tradition, to anoint their Lord's body.

25|$|Some Sunni {{scholars}} {{do believe}} in Raj’a, believing in the return of number of people such as Seven Sleepers synchronous {{with the appearance of}} the Mahdi. Jalaluddin Al-Sayuti wrote about the raj`a but in a different way from the Shiites. According to his book The Possibility of Seeing the Prophet and the Angels (Arabic: تنوير الحلك في إمكان رؤية النبي والملك,) Suyuti claims to have seen the Prophet Muhammad over 70 times while he was awake. According to him, in contrast to Shiite belief, the return of the Prophet Muhammad is not limited to a specific time in the future. Al-Sayuti did not mention if any other religious figures will return after death before the resurrection. According to Abu 'Abdullah Al-Qurtubi, raj`a is understood as the lack of physical presence of a prophet, who marks his apparent death by absence in the physical world but will reappear, from time to time, to those who are pure in heart. The Maliki scholar Ibn al-Arabi, known for his exegesis of the Sunan al-Tirmidhi, stated that seeing <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> prophets while awake is possible for the pure believer.|$|E

Hanna could not make public appearances without having to field questions about the cartoons. Nevertheless, publisher J.B. Morrow, a friend of both McKinley and his campaign manager, stated that Hanna [...] "took his course regardless of local criticism". McKinley made no attempt to deflect criticism from Hanna and in fact kept a file of Davenport cartoons that particularly amused him. [...] Despite Hanna's discomfiture, both men were content to have Hanna attacked if it meant that McKinley would not be.|$|E

On being asked to join Salem, <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> description of her role, Lawless said that she thought [...] "that sounds like a great deal of fun" [...] and connected it to her childhood listening to horror stories and watching horror films. She agreed to be in the series in part because of her appreciation of its writing.

500|$|... "Marry the Night" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga and Fernando Garibay while {{on the road for}} The Monster Ball Tour, and was {{produced}} by both. It was first mentioned by Gaga as a track from her album, Born This Way, Ryan Seacrest's radio show, where she described it as one of her favorite songs from the album. Gaga and Garibay had worked previously on the song [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] (2009), from Gaga's previous release, The Fame Monster. Before starting work on [...] "Marry the Night", Gaga listened to [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] and decided she wanted to top that song's energy with her new collaboration with Garibay. [...] "I remember being backstage <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> concert start, so I go out there and hear 'Dance in the Dark' open up the whole concert, and I wanted to outdo that feeling.

500|$|Following {{over two}} months in Sausalito, Fleetwood {{arranged}} a ten-day tour to give the band a break and fan feedback. After the concerts, recording resumed at venues in Los Angeles, including Wally Heider Studios. Christine McVie and Nicks did not attend most of the sessions and took time off until they were needed to record any remaining vocals. The rest of Fleetwood Mac, with Caillat and Dashut, struggled to finalise the overdubbing and mixing of Rumours after the Sausalito tapes were damaged by repeated use during recording; the kick and snare drum audio tracks sounded [...] "lifeless". A sell-out autumn tour of the US was cancelled to allow {{the completion of the}} album, whose scheduled release date of September 1976 was pushed back. A specialist was hired to rectify the Sausalito tapes using a vari-speed oscillator. Through a pair of headphones which played the damaged tapes in his left ear and the safety master recordings in his right, he converged their respective speeds aided by the timings provided by the snare and hi-hat audio tracks. Fleetwood Mac and their co-producers wanted a [...] "no-filler" [...] final product, in which every track seemed a potential single. After the final mastering stage <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> songs back-to-back, the band members sensed they had recorded something [...] "pretty powerful".|$|E

500|$|Following the expiry of his {{contract}} at Stevenage, rejecting the club's offer of a new contract, Roberts signed for League Two side Fleetwood Town on a free transfer. On joining Fleetwood, Roberts stated — [...] "I was massively impressed with this club from the first moment. Joining Fleetwood is an exciting prospect and I {{jumped at the chance}} after seeing the plans <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> chairman's vision". Shortly {{before the start of the}} 2013–14 season, Roberts was named as Fleetwood's new captain, stating it was a [...] "massive honour to be named as club captain for the season". He scored just six minutes into his Fleetwood debut, also the first League Two goal of the new campaign, courtesy of a powerful header in a 3–1 home victory over Dagenham & Redbridge. Roberts was almost ever-present during the campaign and, similarly to his time at Stevenage, he also chipped in with a number of goals from central defence. He scored the winner in a 21 away victory at Rochdale on 14 December 2013, netting from close range after Nathan Pond's header had rebounded off the post and fallen into Roberts' path. He also scored in a 31 win over Bristol Rovers in March 2014, heading in a Josh Morris corner to double Fleetwood's lead. As a result of Fleetwood's fourth place finish in League Two, the club competed in the League Two play-offs. Roberts played in all three matches, with the team keeping three consecutive clean sheets, as Fleetwood won promotion to League One for the first time in the club's history after a 10 victory over Burton Albion at Wembley Stadium in the final. Roberts made 45 appearances in all competitions during his first season with the club, scoring three goals.|$|E

2500|$|As the British {{prepared}} to attack, a shell {{exploded in the}} officers' mess inside the fort, causing casualties.

Women and children, including his own daughter and grandchild, still resided within the fort. Against {{the advice of his}} subordinates, Hull hoisted a white flag of surrender. He sent messengers to Brock asking for three days to agree on terms of surrender. Brock replied he would allow him three hours. Hull surrendered his entire force, including Cass's and McArthur's detachment and Major Brush's supply convoy. There were rumours that General Hull had been drinking heavily prior to the surrender.

[...] Some of his fellow officers believed that he lost his nerve, concerned {{about the presence of}} Jeb Stuart on the battlefield <b>and,</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> sound of railroad cars approaching, imagining the possibility of a Confederate infantry force pinning him against the river. The Union advance had covered 2 miles over more than 12 hours and resulted in 78 casualties (6 killed, 50 wounded, 22 missing).

2500|$|Fleetwood Mac convened at the Record Plant February 1976 with hired {{engineers}} Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Most {{band members}} {{complained about the}} studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves. Despite his talent at keeping the group together, the recording of Rumours was fraught with emotional turmoil due to the collapsing relationships within the line-up. Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city's harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio's lodge in the adjacent hills. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant's owners, when the band jammed, recalled that [...] "The band would come in at 7atnight, have a big feast, party till1or2 in the morning, {{and then when they}} were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording". Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio's partition screen to better gauge Caillat's and Dashut's reactions to the music's groove. After the final mastering stage <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> songs back-to-back, the band members sensed they had recorded something [...] "pretty powerful".|$|E
2500|$|Alpert {{set up a}} small {{recording}} studio in his garage and had been overdubbing a tune called [...] "Twinkle Star", written by Sol Lake, who would eventually write many of the Brass's original tunes. During a visit to Tijuana, Mexico, Alpert happened to hear a mariachi band while attending a bullfight. Following the experience, Alpert recalled that he was inspired {{to find a way}} to express musically what he felt while watching the wild responses of the crowd, <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> brass musicians introducing each new event with rousing fanfare. Alpert adapted the trumpet style to the tune, mixed in crowd cheers and other noises for ambience, and renamed the song [...] "The Lonely Bull". He personally funded the production of the record as a single, and it spread through radio DJs until it caught on and became a Top 10 hit in the Fall of 1962. He followed up quickly with his debut album, The Lonely Bull by [...] "Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass". Originally the Tijuana Brass was just Alpert overdubbing his own trumpet, slightly out of sync. The title cut reached No. 6 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. This was A's first album with the original release number being #101, although it was recorded at Conway Records. [...] For this album and subsequent releases, Alpert recorded with the group of L.A. session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew, whom he holds in high regard.|$|E
