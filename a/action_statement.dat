5|$|Two Air Corps historians {{state that}} no {{evidence}} exists that the Navy {{was behind the}} order. One explained that Craig believed the Air Corps violated War Department policy on publicity, while the second asserted that Craig was unhappy about not being provided details of the mission before it was publicly announced, and thus issued the order to ensure full notification before granting exceptions to the restriction. Deputy chief of staff Embick made {{the claim that the}} restriction had been issued only as a safety measure. Greer, however, in his history of Air Corps doctrine, firmly attributes the restriction to the Navy, noting that in November 1938 it achieved a new modification of the Joint <b>Action</b> <b>statement</b> specifically granting it the authorization for long-range land-based flights that the Army was denied, and immediately prepared six major bases to conduct them. A fourth historian, in a biography of Arnold, stated that the restriction had actually been promulgated on 1 September 1936, at the insistence of the Navy, but was not enforced by Craig until after the Rex incident.|$|E

500|$|Regardless of the MacArthur-Pratt agreement, the Navy {{had gone}} ahead with {{development}} of land-based patrol aircraft {{and expansion of}} its naval air stations, and in 1933 formally repudiated the agreement after Adm. Pratt retired. On 11 September 1935, the Joint Board, {{at the behest of}} the Navy and the concurrence of Gen. MacArthur, issued a revised Joint <b>Action</b> <b>statement</b> that reasserted the limited role of all Air Corps missions, including coastal defense, as auxiliary to the [...] "mobile Army". However, long-range bomber advocates interpreted its language to mean that the Air Corps could conduct long-range reconnaissance, attack approaching fleets, reinforce distant bases, and attack enemy air bases, all in furtherance of its mission to prevent an air attack on America.|$|E
500|$|When the Air Service {{was renamed}} the Air Corps in 1926, the Joint Army-Navy Board {{was in the}} process of reconsidering service {{responsibilities}} in coastal defense. Both Chief of Air Corps Major General Mason Patrick and Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, resisted any restrictions on range or missions for their respective services' aircraft. The resulting Joint <b>Action</b> <b>statement</b> was vague regarding Air Corps actions over water but [...] "left the door open" [...] for the Navy's interpretation of its own authority, which was that the shore-based coastal patrol mission was its prerogative. Efforts by the War Department to clarify the issue were rebuffed by the Navy to the extent that the Secretary of War warned President Herbert Hoover in 1930 that the situation was endangering national defense.|$|E
500|$|On 7 January 1931, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Navy CNO Adm. William V. Pratt {{reached an}} {{agreement}} modifying the Joint <b>Action</b> <b>statement</b> by assigning the coastal defense role for land-based aircraft to the Air Corps. This {{came at a time}} when the Air Corps was seeking a mission to justify the development of all-metal monoplane bombers, and theorists at the Air Corps Tactical School were advocating the use of long-range heavy bombers. In August of that year, to garner publicity and generate favorable public opinion, Lt.Col. Frank M. Andrews, on the staff of outgoing Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. James Fechet, proposed to bomb another ship during joint maneuvers with the Navy off the coast of North Carolina. Before the mission Col. Roy Kirtland, the base commander at Langley Field, cautioned reporters that the operation was to be only a bombing exercise using small bombs, and that [...] "nothing spectacular" [...] should be expected.|$|E

2500|$|The {{moratorium}} also {{resulted from}} the enmity of the Navy incurred by the Air Corps on 12 May 1938 when it widely publicized the interception of the Italian ocean liner Rex by three B-17s while it was [...] off-shore of New York City. Possibly {{under pressure from the}} Navy, Craig placed a limit of [...] on all future off-shore flights by the Army. The services together issued a revised Joint <b>Action</b> <b>statement</b> in November reasserting that the mission of the Air Corps in coastal defense was only for supporting the Navy if called upon to do so, while simultaneously authorizing for the Navy the long-range shore-based coastal patrol mission denied the Air Corps. Westover, who stridently opposed cancellation of the Woodring program, was killed in an air crash on 21 September 1938 and was succeeded by Arnold.|$|E
2500|$|The Air Corps in January 1931 [...] "got its {{foot in the}} door" [...] for {{developing}} a mission for which only it would have capability, {{while at the same}} time creating a need for technological advancement of its equipment. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William V. Pratt was desirous of having general assent to his proposition that all naval aviation including land-based aircraft was by definition tied to carrier-based fleet operations. Pratt reached an agreement with new Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur that the Air Corps would assume responsibility for coastal defense (traditionally a primary function of the Army but a secondary, war-time function of the Navy) beyond the range of the Army's Coast Artillery guns, ending the Navy's apparent duplication of effort in coastal air operations. The agreement, intended as a modification of the Joint <b>Action</b> <b>statement</b> on coastal defense issued in 1926, was not endorsed by the Joint Army-Navy Board and never had authority other than personal agreement between the two heads of service. Though the Navy repudiated the statement when Pratt retired in 1934, the Air Corps clung to the mission, and provided itself with the basis for development of long-range bombers and creating new doctrine to employ them.|$|E
2500|$|A {{month later}} (15 October 1935), the General Staff {{released}} {{a revision of}} the doctrinal guide for the Air Corps, training regulation TR 440-15 Employment of the Air Forces of the Army. [...] A year earlier MacArthur had changed TR 440-15 to clarify [...] "the Air Corps's place {{in the scheme of}} national defense and... (to do away with)... misconceptions and interbranch prejudices." [...] The General Staff characterized its latest revision as a [...] "compromise" [...] with airpower advocates, to mitigate public criticism of the Joint <b>Action</b> <b>Statement,</b> but the newest revision parroted the anti-autonomy conclusions of the Drum and Baker Boards, and reasserted its long-held position (and that of the Secretary Dern) that auxiliary support of the ground forces was the primary mission of the Air Corps. [...] TR 440-15 did acknowledge some doctrinal principles asserted by the ACTS (including the necessity of destroying an enemy's air forces and concentrating air forces against primary objectives) and recognized that future wars would probably entail some missions [...] "beyond the sphere of influence of the Ground Forces" [...] (strategic bombardment), but it did not attach any importance to prioritization of targets, weakening its effectiveness as doctrine. The Air Corps in general assented to the changes, as it did to other compromises of the period, as acceptable for the moment. TR 440-15 remained the doctrinal position of the Air Corps until it was superseded by the first Air Corps Field Manual, FM 1–5 Employment of Aviation of the Army, on 15 April 1940.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{expansion}} of the British Columbia provincial park system, combined with static agency funding and increased demand for public involvement, has made it extremely difficult for BC Parks to meet their commitment to a comprehensive public involvement program. To resolve this issue, 3 cost-effective public involvement techniques were selected and applied, using a case study approach, towards development of a management plan for the Moose River Route region of Mount Robson Provincial Park. The 3 techniques selected for use were semistandardized interviews, opinion questionnaires and a Delphi advisory group. The semistandardized interviews and opinion questionnaires were used to obtain visitor use data and stakeholder opinion on appropriate management of the Moose River Route region. The Delphi advisory group used this information to create management objectives and associated <b>action</b> <b>statements</b> for the study area. BC Parks has used both semistandardized interviews and opinion questionnaires in previous planning initiatives- {{the uniqueness of the}} Moose River Route study came from the use of the Delphi technique to facilitate interaction between members of the advisory group. Rather than meeting face-to-face, advisory group members used a series of three mailout questionnaires to create, prioritize and reach consensus on management objectives and associated <b>action</b> <b>statements</b> for the Moose River Route region. Results from the semistandardized interviews and opinion questionnaires indicate that stakeholders are concerned with conservation of the Moose River Route region. Interest was expressed in completing wildlife-related studies, developing facilities to protect park resources and regulating visitor use. Delphi advisory group members created management objectives and associated <b>action</b> <b>statements</b> to address these concerns. Specifically, advisory group members proposed (a) the completion of comprehensive habitat assessments and wildlife movement studies, (b) the development of toilets and bear poles, and (c) the placement of restrictions on campsite location and party size. A cursory evaluation of the Delphi advisory group process identified both strengths and weaknesses to this technique. The major strengths include fairness and cost-effectiveness, whereas the major weaknesses include limited opportunity for participant social learning, creation of statements with potential for misinterpretation and lack of resolution on particularly contentious issues. Recommendations to resolve these weaknesses are discussed. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R
