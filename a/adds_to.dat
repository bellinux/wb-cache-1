Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading {{him to believe}} that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intense single character focus of his first novel, ¡Ecue-Yamba-O! (Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World.

5|$|In {{terms of}} the broader {{evolutionary}} relationships between the giant freshwater whipray {{and the rest of}} the family Dasyatidae, a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA reported that it was most closely related to the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray (H. granulata) and the tubemouth whipray (H. lobistoma). This finding <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> a growing consensus that the genus Himantura is paraphyletic.|$|E

Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5000|$|Suffix- [...] "Chaa" [...] and [...] "Ju" [...] are two popular suffixes. [...] "Chaa" [...] is <b>added</b> <b>to</b> signify [...] "junior" [...] or [...] "lesser". But when <b>added</b> <b>to</b> a name, {{it is used}} derogatorily. For example, kya'ah-chaa means nephew where [...] "chaa" [...] {{is being}} <b>added</b> <b>to</b> kya'ah(son). When <b>added</b> <b>to</b> name like Birat for [...] "Birat-chaa", it is being used derogatorily. The suffix [...] "ju" [...] is <b>added</b> <b>to</b> show respect. For example, [...] "Baa-ju" [...] means [...] "father-in-law" [...] where [...] "ju" [...] is <b>added</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Baa(father)". Unlike [...] "chaa", [...] "ju" [...] is not <b>added</b> <b>to</b> a first/last name directly. Instead, honorific terms like [...] "Bhaaju" [...] is added for males and [...] "Mayju" [...] for females. Example, [...] "Birat bhaaju" [...] for a male name (Birat) and [...] "Suja Mayju" [...] for a female name (Suja).|$|R

5|$|Octave couplers, which add {{the pipes}} an octave above (super-octave) or below (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one {{division}} only (for example, the Swell super octave, which adds the octave above {{what is being}} played on the Swell to itself), or act as a coupler to another keyboard (for example, the Swell super-octave to Great, which <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the Great manual {{the ranks of the}} Swell division an octave above what is being played).|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for.

Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E

5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E
5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E

5|$|Combined (or multi-discipline) {{events are}} {{competitions}} in which athletes {{participate in a}} number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.|$|E
5|$|Flag {{hoisting}} {{ceremonies and}} cultural programmes {{take place in}} governmental and non-governmental institutions throughout the country. Schools and colleges conduct flag hoisting ceremonies and cultural events. Major government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights. In Delhi and some other cities, kite flying <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> the occasion. National flags of different sizes are used abundantly to symbolise allegiance to the country. Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories with replicas of the tri-colour. Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from nationalism to a broader celebration of all things India.|$|E
5|$|Gould made {{significant}} contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, especially in his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism <b>adds</b> <b>to</b> its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.|$|E
