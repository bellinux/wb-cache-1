25|$|In {{cognitive}} theory, {{behavior is}} explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> Cognitive theories are theories of personality that emphasize cognitive processes, such as thinking and judging.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{approached}} the question by connecting {{it with another}} one: how can two people have beliefs about the same external object? He offers, in answer, a picture of triangulation: beliefs about oneself, beliefs <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> and beliefs about the world come into existence jointly.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have also}} noticed that people {{demonstrate}} more optimistic bias when making comparisons {{when the other}} is a vague individual, but biases are reduced when {{the other is a}} familiar person, such as a friend or family member. This also is determined due to the information they have about the individuals closest to them, but not having the same information <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{throughout history}} had, arguably, {{been tempted to}} reduce two {{of these kinds of}} belief and knowledge to the other one: René Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.)</b> It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.|$|E
25|$|Social {{psychology}} {{is the study}} of how humans think about each other and how they relate to each other. Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. conformity, persuasion), and the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of group dynamics reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the microsocial level. In recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in implicit measures, mediational models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior. The study of human society is therefore a potentially valuable source of information about the causes of psychiatric disorder. Some sociological concepts applied to psychiatric disorders are the social role, sick role, social class, life event, culture, migration, social, and total institution.|$|E

500|$|In other words, the {{welcoming}} of the Other, to Levinas, {{was the very}} essence of conscience properly conceived; it encouraged our ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> that selfish freedom of will [...] "does not have the last word" [...] and that realising this has a transcendent purpose: [...] "I am not alone... in conscience I have an experience that is not commensurate with any a priori [...] framework-a conceptless experience." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his speech, Colbert joked <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the audience, including Peter Pace, Antonin Scalia, John McCain, and Joe Wilson. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing Jesse Jackson: [...] "You can ask him anything, but he's going to say what he wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Marqusee {{has written}} at length on the {{conflicts}} in Dylan's life during this time, with its deepening alienation from his old folk-revival audience and clear-cut leftist causes. He {{suggests that the}} song is probably self-referential: [...] "The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home. Dylan himself has noted that, after his motorcycle accident in 1966, he realized that [...] "when I used words like 'he' and 'it' and 'they,' and talking <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> I was really talking about nobody but me." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} of Debut was [...] "long and laborious", as it required Björk to realise her compositional {{ideas from the}} past ten years in a creatively autonomous fashion. Thus, after Debuts release, she was free to concentrate on her present life for new musical clues for her following album. Once again, she contacted Nellee Hooper to produce the album. He refused initially, encouraging her to produce the album herself, but agreed when she insisted. However, Björk agreed to contribute to the album's production as a co-producer and to enlist other producers; [...] "to make it stay fresh, she had to think <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> being involved". With Hooper's confirmation, Björk commenced work on the album almost immediately at the Bahamas' legendary Compass Point Studios. The picturesque locale inspired the singer to meld the recording process with the exotic natural environment. Biographer Mark Pytlik writes: [...] "The tales surrounding these recording sessions are appropriately evocative". For example, Rolling Stone wrote that for her vocals: [...] "Björk extended her mic cord to a beach so she could sing to the sea". Additionally, the first version of [...] "Cover Me" [...] was recorded entirely from a nearby cave, and rumours have persisted that Björk recorded [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] in the nude.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the storyline {{which saw}} Kyla's Alcoholics Anonymous {{companion}} Stuart McElroy (Conor Mullen) violently attack her colleague, Ward Sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Ayola has stated: [...] "It makes her finally accept what Stuart was capable of. She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> are wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has no excuses – {{all she can}} think is that she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll have less to worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze." [...] When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: [...] "I hope so. Kyla's had trouble being a good parent to Max, but she's had lots of time to reflect on why this is." ...|$|E
500|$|Scenes {{four to six}} {{describe}} the 50th day celebration {{of the birth of}} Atsunaga-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Suzaku, on Kankō 7, 1st month, 15th day (February 1, 1010). The lengthy fourth section of text is split into two parts. Murasaki Shikibu briefly mentions her friendly relationship with Lady Kokosho and that they join their rooms separating them by kichō partitions only when both are at home. This behaviour made Michinaga believe that they are gossiping <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> [...] Murasaki Shikibu then describes the day's festivities: the Queen and her audience, the clothing, names and titles of the participants which included the Emperor, the infant prince and various court ladies. Dazzled in their presence, she escapes to an inner room. As the nurse, Madam Nakadaka comes away from the Emperor and Queen under the canopy, carrying the prince in her arms, Murasaki Shikibu praises her dignified demeanour, tranquility and earnestness. The painting associated with this scene shows four courtiers on the balcony (engawa) of a Japanese style building outside fabric enclosed rooms, which are not visible. Two of the men are shown walking, the others are kneeling and appear to be talking to a person inside the building or to be handing something to someone inside. Two of the men (one standing, one walking) carry trays with cups.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Gibson {{said of his}} philanthropic works, [...] "It {{gives you}} perspective. It's one of my faults, you {{tend to focus on}} {{yourself}} a lot.

2500|$|Social {{cognition}} is {{a growing}} area of social psychology that studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about others. Much research rests on the assertion that people think <b>about</b> (<b>other)</b> <b>people</b> differently from non-social targets. [...] This assertion {{is supported by the}} social cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism. Person perception is the study of how people form impressions of others. The study of how people form beliefs about each other while interacting is known as interpersonal perception.|$|E
2500|$|Eisner in 2005 {{recalled}} his studio as [...] "a friendly shop, and I guess I {{was the same}} age as the youngest guys there. We all got along. The only ones who ever got into a hassle were George Tuska and Bob Powell. Powell was kind of a wiseguy and made remarks <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the shop. One day, George had enough of it, got up, and punched out Bob Powell". Eisner on another occasion said his partnership with Everett M. [...] "Busy" [...] Arnold created tensions when Arnold wanted to hire Powell separately: ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Culture" [...] is {{a unique}} set of behaviors, {{including}} language, belief and customs learnt from being raised in social groups or by joining a particular group throughout time. Culture defines context and is the social totality that defines behavior, knowledge, beliefs and social learning. It is a set of shared values characterizing a specific organization. Fairhurst identifies culture as defining events, people, objects, and concepts. Communication and culture are intertwined. Shared language of a group links together individuals and joins common cultures. Culture influences mental models. [...] "Mental models" [...] are the images in your mind <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> yourself, substance and events.|$|E
2500|$|Sara {{states that}} {{if he wants to}} {{progress}} in his current relationship, he needs {{to find out what happened}} to move on emotionally. Since Tsukuru doesn't use the Internet, she'll help him getting started: [...] "We live in a pretty apathetic age, yet we're surrounded by an enormous amount of information <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> If you feel like it, you can easily gather that information about them. Having said that, we still hardly know anything about people." [...] After using Google and Facebook to locate these former friends, she updates Tsukuru on their current whereabouts and even arranges for his travel tickets.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1935, when Cash {{was three}} years old, the family settled in Dyess, Arkansas, a New Deal colony {{established}} to give poor families {{a chance to work}} land that they had a chance to own as a result. J.R. started working in cotton fields at the age of five, singing along with his family while working. The family farm was flooded on at least two occasions, which led him later to write the song [...] "Five Feet High and Rising". His family's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs, especially those <b>about</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> facing similar difficulties. He had sympathy for the poor and working class.|$|E
5000|$|Li had a {{breakdown}} in 2012 and attempted suicide twice. After recuperating and leaving the hospital, she lost interest in writing fiction and {{for a whole year}} she focused on reading several biographies, memoirs, diaries and journals.
