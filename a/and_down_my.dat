500|$|... "West Coast" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary music critics. Michael Nelson of Stereogum commented, [...] "This {{is just a}} haunting, hypnotic piece of music that sends chills up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> entire skeleton, especially when the tempo shifts downward on the chorus". Nylon writer Liza Darwin deemed the track [...] "silky-smooth" [...] and [...] "total ear candy". Lauren Valenti of Marie Claire lauded the song as [...] "a slice of retro heaven". The track was noted by Stern to be [...] "revolutionary" [...] {{in the sense that}} it sounded [...] "entirely different from anything being offered in pop music at the moment" [...] and deemed it [...] "the very antithesis of everything radio in 2014". Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club named [...] "West Coast" [...] as the album's most accomplished track and [...] "the one song on Ultraviolence that gets the formula of Lana Del Rey right". AltSounds deemed the track as one of Del Rey's best works and one of the best singles released in 2014. The publication went on to opine, [...] "when songs defy descriptions, and artists defy expectation, they tend to stick around long after the 'pop hits' and divas have suck back into obscurity". Oyster journalist Jerico Mandybur commented, [...] "there's no denying that the song has excellent aural pulling power, especially if you like your odes to LA mysterious, darkly surfy and dripping in femme fatale".|$|E

60|$|I {{was almost}} stunned by my discovery. I paced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> cell like a madman, but all to no purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly they would,--and break <b>down</b> all <b>my</b> gates if I {{had them}} locked, <b>and</b> pull <b>down</b> <b>my</b> park palings {{to let the}} hounds through." ...|$|R
60|$|I rose to <b>my</b> feet, <b>and</b> taking <b>down</b> <b>my</b> hat {{commenced}} {{to brush}} it. Mabane {{looked up from}} his work.|$|R
60|$|In {{reply to}} this appointment, I only bowed; <b>and</b> pulling <b>down</b> <b>my</b> veil, <b>and</b> {{gathering}} round me my cloak, I glided away.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{teardrop}} trembled {{from its}} source, [...] <b>And</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> surface crept. [...] My {{sense of touch}} is something coarse, [...] But I believe she wept.|$|E

6000|$|... 2. <b>And</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> cheeks {{the quick}} tears fell, etc. (line 366.) The word fell is Rossetti's cj. (to rhyme with tell, line 369) for ran 1819, 1839).|$|E
6000|$|Don Sebastian smiled. [...] "I will {{be frank}} <b>and</b> put <b>down</b> <b>my</b> cards. I {{would not do}} so, se√±or, if I thought you could beat them." ...|$|R
60|$|I half rose <b>and</b> threw <b>down</b> <b>my</b> napkin, {{though with}} some reluctance. I held {{out my hand}} regretfully to Mr. Marx, {{but he refused to}} take it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you tell}} him," [...] a subdued voice said, and the man, who I think was Steel, came near choking {{me as he}} poured more spirit than I could swallow <b>down</b> <b>my</b> throat <b>and</b> also <b>down</b> <b>my</b> neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's an almighty good hunch," [...] Kearns said, adding his slip for two {{thousand}} {{to the growing}} heap. [...] "I can feel her crawlin' up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He did,' {{answered}} Fledgeby. 'The assassin. Lammle. He {{rubbed it}} into my mouth and up my nose <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> throat--Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah--h--h--h! Ugh!--to prevent my crying out, and then cruelly assaulted me.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew what}} that meant, and a cold shiver went up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> backbone. But I looked down at him--spick-and-span and glossy--his neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three o'clock.|$|E
6000|$|I {{care not}} for beauty. I desire {{strength}} in [...] battle and {{wind in the}} chase that I may kill my [...] enemy <b>and</b> run <b>down</b> <b>my</b> meat.|$|R

6000|$|... 'You go <b>and</b> lie <b>down,</b> <b>my</b> dear,' said Mr. Macrae. 'Your maid {{is in your}} cabin,' and thither he {{conducted}} the overwrought girl, Merton anxiously following her with his eyes.|$|R
60|$|I had an {{exquisite}} moment. It was unique also. Jumping {{up from my}} seat, I paced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> room for a long time. But when I came downstairs I behaved with sufficient composure. Only I couldn't eat anything at dinner.|$|E
60|$|In my rooms a {{surprise}} awaited me. Felicia was there, walking nervously up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> little sitting-room She stopped short as I entered and came swiftly towards me. In {{the joy of}} seeing her so unexpectedly I would have taken her into my arms, but she shrank back.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are plain Mr. Gerard now," [...] said he, [...] "and a Channel Islander. I {{would be}} obliged {{to you if you}} would kindly forget your {{military}} ways and drop your cavalry swagger when you walk up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> deck. A beard, too, would seem more sailor-like than those moustaches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} {{some bad news}} for you, John. There, light your pipe again, <b>and</b> sit <b>down.</b> <b>My</b> good dame has gone off to bed, and we have got the cabin to ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stared at}} me in ineffable surprise. [...] "But the Lord Giovanni is brave and valiant," [...] she cried, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in <b>my</b> heart I laughed in bitter mockery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dropped them}} flowers in a cracker-barrel, {{and let the}} news trickle in <b>my</b> ears <b>and</b> <b>down</b> toward <b>my</b> upper {{left-hand}} shirt pocket until it got to my feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's nothin' else I {{can think}} of," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine; [...] "at least, nothin' I can carry; and so I suppose we {{may as well}} begin, for your talk of the ship sinkin' under our feet gives me a sort o' feelin' like an oyster creepin' up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{a thrill}} as went up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> back, Marilla! I don't think I'd ever really {{believed}} until then {{that there was}} honestly {{going to be a}} picnic. I couldn't help fearing I'd only imagined it. But when a minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it." ...|$|E
60|$|It was horrible. I was {{trembling}} all over, and I {{could feel the}} shivers running up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> spine and the sweat standing out on my forehead. Surely {{there can be little}} in this world more awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> jumping <b>down</b> without <b>my</b> assistance, {{she laughed}} and {{disappeared}} into the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that I care a cent--I'm not {{jealous of}} her. I ain't so bad off for company as she is. She can't take anybody away from me, {{but she must}} go <b>and</b> break <b>down</b> <b>my</b> faith in the judge." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{came back}} <b>and</b> sat <b>down,</b> for <b>my</b> curiosity, a great failing with me, was excited.|$|R
6000|$|The {{return of}} my companions {{prevented}} any open demonstration of my fears and condition of mind, but I certainly swore inwardly. During the dinner hour I felt {{all the time}} as if I had on a horsehair shirt with the ends protruding toward my skin, and, in the exaggerated sensitiveness of the moment, made sure [...] "'em" [...] were chasing up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> back.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{whether it}} were by {{peculiar}} grace, [...] 50 [...] A leading from above, a something given, [...] Yet it befel, that, in this lonely place, [...] When up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> fancy thus was driven, [...] And I with these untoward thoughts had striven, [...] I saw a Man before me unawares: [...] The oldest Man he seem'd that ever wore grey hairs.|$|E
60|$|Do {{not let it}} be {{supposed}} that I had become a swash-buckler of a soldier. The cold chill of fear still crept up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>my</b> spine whenever I thought of taking part in an engagement; but I was becoming so nearly a man as to desire, in case it became necessary to fight, that I might gain some honor for standing stiffly when really my heart was faint.|$|E
6000|$|I {{rose from}} <b>my</b> bed, flung <b>down</b> the bandage, <b>and</b> ran <b>down</b> <b>my</b> little staircase. [...] "Oh, Mrs Bowater," [...] I said, burying {{my face in}} her camphory skirts, [...] "be kind to me; be kind to me! I've nobody but you." ...|$|R
60|$|With some {{difficulty}} I placed the keg in position <b>and</b> brought <b>down</b> <b>my</b> full weight upon it. The {{first time the}} bolt merely creaked, but the second there was a snap, and {{the lower part of}} the door burst outward several inches.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come <b>and</b> sit <b>down,</b> <b>my</b> dear," [...] said Lady Ball, in her sweetest voice. [...] "It {{has got to}} be very cold, and you {{had better}} come near the fire." [...] Margaret did as she was bidden, <b>and</b> sat herself <b>down</b> in the chair {{immediately}} opposite to her aunt.|$|R
