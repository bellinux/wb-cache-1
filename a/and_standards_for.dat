5|$|One of {{the first}} serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which laid out the themes <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> much {{subsequent}} research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer {{was the work of}} the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' in America has stimulated interest.|$|E

5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing the discount rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles <b>and</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E

25|$|The {{standardization}} of the Portuguese language started in 1536, when Fernão de Oliveira published his Grammatica da lingoagem portuguesa, the first literary piece that laid rules <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> the Portuguese language.

João de Barros's Grammatica was the second piece that sought to standardize the Portuguese language, and is considered the world's first illustrated text book.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{aspect of}} Reform {{doctrine}} is the personal autonomy of each adherent, who may formulate his own understanding and expression of his religiosity. Reform is unique among all Jewish denominations in placing {{the individual as}} the authorized interpreter of Judaism.

This highly individualistic stance also proved one of the movement's great challenges, for it impeded the creation of clear guidelines <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> positive participation in religious life and definition of what was expected from members.|$|E

25|$|In its Corps of Engineers Civil Works mission, CRREL {{researchers}} developed {{innovative ways}} to avoid ice jams and databases to address the widespread occurrence of such problems. A substantial ice engineering facility was built to support modeling of these problems. A remote-sensing and GIS (geographic information system) facility and organization were established to better employ the resources of satellite imagery and mapping of information to address problems worldwide. Another major facility, the Frost Effects Research Facility, was built to study problems associated with airfields and roadways, subject to freeze-thaw. An automated loading machine was acquired to simulate the passage of vehicle and aircraft tires on pavements. In building technology, researchers helped develop statistical means to identify snow and icing loads throughout the United States <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> measuring heat loss, roof moisture detection, and frost-protected shallow foundations.|$|E

25|$|Reform {{mathematics}} is {{an approach to}} mathematics education, particularly in North America. It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The NCTM document, Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) mathematics education in the United States and Canada. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards {{with the publication of}} Principles <b>and</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> School Mathematics (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to {{serve as the basis for}} many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a de-emphasis on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and conceptual thinking. The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes conceptual thinking and problem solving.|$|E
25|$|PELs for {{short-term}} and career astronaut exposure to space radiation {{have been approved}} by the NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer. The PELs set requirements <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> mission design and crew selection as recommended in NASA-STD-3001, Volume 1. NASA has used dose limits for cancer risks and the non-cancer risks to the BFOs, skin, and lens since 1970. For Exploration mission planning, preliminary dose limits for the CNS risks are based largely on experimental results with animal models. Further research is needed to validate and quantify these risks, however, and to refine the values for dose limits. The CNS PELs, which correspond to the doses at the region of the brain called the hippocampus, are set for time periods of 30 days or 1 year, or for a career with values of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mGy-Eq, respectively. Although the unit mGy-Eq is used, the RBE for CNS effects is largely unknown; therefore, the use of the quality factor function for cancer risk estimates is advocated. For particles with charge Z>10, an addition PEL requirement limits the physical dose (mGy) for 1 year and the career to 100 and 250 mGy, respectively. NASA uses computerized anatomical geometry models to estimate the body self-shielding at the hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules <b>and</b> <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E
