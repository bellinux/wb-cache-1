Following a drug {{free period}} of 7 days they received <b>azapropazone</b> 600 mg twice daily for 7 {{days and then}} both treatments for a further 7 days. Sodium excretion fell from 141 +/- 16. 8 mmol/day to 84. 3 +/- 6. 8 mmol/day (P less than 0. 01) on initiation of <b>azapropazone</b> treatment. The natriuretic response to frusemide was unchanged by premedication with <b>azapropazone.</b> Urate excretion rose from 3. 35 +/- 0. 249 mmol/day to 4. 98 +/- 0. 365 mmol/day on initiation of <b>azapropazone</b> therapy but subsequently returned to baseline values.

40|$|Plasma {{concentrations}} of <b>azapropazone</b> have been measured in young and elderly subjects after a single dose of 600 mg <b>azapropazone.</b> Maximum concentrations were {{higher in the}} elderly. Renal function was impaired in the older subjects. Mean <b>azapropazone</b> clearance was significantly reduced (P less than 0. 001) in the old, compared to the young. Elimination half-life was prolonged but the difference did not reach statistical significance due to the wide variation of the values in the elderly. The volume of distribution of <b>azapropazone</b> and degree of adipose tissue did not differ between the two groups. <b>Azapropazone</b> clearance correlated well with creatinine clearance (P less than 0. 001) when all the subjects were included and for the younger subjects only but not for the elderly patients alone. The addition of fat mass into the regression equation improved the relationship in all groups but in the older group levels of statistical significance were not achieved. Reasons for the difference between young and old are discussed.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to extend these observations, by examining the dose-response and to compare the uricosuric effect of <b>azapropazone</b> with that of probenecid. Patients were given varying doses of <b>azapropazone</b> from 900 - 2400 mg daily for 4 -day periods at separated intervals.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} variety of {{experimental}} observations which strongly support {{the assumption that the}} warfarin binding site, or site I of human serum albumin, is better described as the warfarin-azapropazone binding area, consisting ofthe overlapping binding sites for warfarmn and <b>azapropazone.</b> In general, drugs interacting with one of the two sites will also displace drugs bound to the other site, although their displacing potencies for both sites may vary considerably. This is most pronounced in the case of glibenclamide, which strongly inhibits the binding of drugs to the <b>azapropazone</b> site with only minor effects on drugs bound to the warfarin site. The lone tryptophan residue of human serum albumin, previously shown {{to be part of the}} warfarin binding site, is obviously located in the not-overlapping part of the warfarin site, so that its modification affects only the binding of drugs to the warfarin and not to the <b>azapropazone</b> site of this large binding area.

The binding of warfarin, phenylbutazone, <b>azapropazone,</b> diazepam, digitoxin and cholic acid by rat alpha 1 -FP and serum albumin was studied by equilibrium dialysis at 4 degrees C. Rat alpha 1 -FP was shown to have neither albumin's high-affinity site II (diazepam as marker) nor its site III (digitoxin and cholic acid as markers). High-affinity binding by alpha 1 -FP was found for the specific markers (warfarin, phenylbutazone, <b>azapropazone)</b> of albumin's drug-binding site I. However, instead of albumin's one high-affinity site/molecule, a mean value of 0. 5 site/molecule was obtained with rat alpha 1 -FP. Charcoal treatment at neutral pH of rat serum albumin did not affect its measured binding properties, but treatment of the alpha 1 -FP led to an increased affinity for warfarin, phenylbutazone and <b>azapropazone</b> without a change in the measured number of sites, indicating competition for binding at this site by (an) endogenous ligand(s).

40|$|Of {{the many}} {{varieties}} of drug interactions, which {{occur when the}} disposition or actions of one drug are changed by another, only a few are serious or potentially fatal. A representative outline {{of some of these}} illustrates the problem. Precipitant drugs are those which produce the interaction, and object drugs are those whose effects are changed. The interactions which are usually significant are those which alter the metabolism, involve renal excretion, or change the effects of the object drug, especially when the object drug has a low therapeutic index (cardiovascular drugs, anticoagulants, drugs acting on the brain, hypoglycemic drugs, hormones, and cytotoxic drugs). Warfarin toxicity, for example, is produced by aspirin, phenylbutazone, and <b>azapropazone.</b> The dosage requirements of warfarin are reduced by chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and other quinolones, erythromycin {{and some of the other}} macrolides, metronidazole and other imidazoles, tetracyclines, amiodarone, cimetidine (but not ranitidine), and fibrates. Potassium-depleting drugs can potentiate the action of digoxin, and the elimination of digoxin can be reduced by amiodarone, propafenone, quinidine, and verapamil. Combined oral contraceptives can lose effectiveness through the interaction of carbamazepine, griseofulvin, phenytoin, or rifampicin, which increase estrogen metabolism. In addition, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin or tetracyclines also reduce contraceptive effectiveness by altering gut absorption. Even a single drink of an alcoholic beverage may be dangerous to people taking antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotic drugs, benzodiazepines, or lithium. Antihistamines suffer inhibited metabolism in the liver if taken in conjunction with the antifungal imidazoles and some of the macrolide antibiotics. Cardiotoxicity of antihistamines is also enhanced by drugs with similar cardiotoxic effects. Lithium potentiation is enhanced by the new serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and lithium excretion can be reduced by diuretics or fluoxetine. When drugs such as antifungal imidazoles, <b>azapropazone,</b> or phenylbutazone are permitted to inhibit the metabolism of sulphonylureas, hypoglycemic effects are enhanced and, if unnoticed, may cause brain damage. Fibrates should not be combined with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors because of the increased risk of myopathy. Patients taking non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors should avoid amine-containing foods and drugs such as matured cheeses, meat, yeast extracts, some wines, unfresh protein, and cold-curing medications. The metabolism of azathioprine is inhibited by allopurinol, and this combination requires a reduced dosage of azathioprine. Mercaptopurine, used in the treatment of leukemia, is also a metabolite of azathioprine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} {{relative}} risks of serious gastrointestinal complications reported with individual non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. DESIGN [...] Systematic review of controlled epidemiological studies that found a relation between {{use of the}} drugs and admission to hospital for haemorrhage or perforation. SETTING [...] Hospital and community based case-control and cohort studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] (a) Estimated relative risks of gastrointestinal complications with use of individual drugs, exposure to ibuprofen being used as reference; (b) a ranking that best summarised the sequence of relative risks observed in the studies. RESULTS [...] 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. 11 provided comparative data on ibuprofen and other drugs. Ibuprofen ranked lowest or equal lowest for risk in 10 of the 11 studies. Pooled relative risks calculated with exposure to ibuprofen used as reference were all significantly greater than 1. 0 (interval of point estimates 1. 6 to 9. 2). Overall, ibuprofen {{was associated with the}} lowest relative risk, followed by diclofenac. <b>Azapropazone,</b> tolmetin, ketoprofen, and piroxicam ranked highest for risk and indomethacin, naproxen, sulindac, and aspirin occupied intermediate positions. Higher doses of ibuprofen were associated with relative risks similar to those with naproxen and indomethacin. CONCLUSIONS [...] The low risk of serious gastrointestinal complications with ibuprofen seems to be attributable mainly to the low doses of the drug used in clinical practice. In higher doses ibuprofen is associated with a similar risk to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Use of low risk drugs in low dosage as first line treatment would substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality due to serious gastrointestinal toxicity from these drugs...|$|E

Albumin isolation {{was carried out}} by means of PEG precipitation followed by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A 50 and then on SP-Sephadex C 50. The electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed only one spot that comigrated with commercial human albumin. Binding to albumin was measured by equilibrium dialysis of an aliquot of albumin solution (0. 7 ml) against the same volume of 0. 13 M sodium orthophosphate buffer (pH 7. 4). At a total concentration of 2 -mu-g/ml (therapeutic range), the unbound fraction of furosemide was 2. 71 % (fetal albumin) and 2. 51 % (adult albumin). Two classes of binding sites for furosemide were observed in fetal and adult albumin. The number of binding sites (moles of furosemide per mole of albumin) was 1. 22 (fetal albumin) and 1. 58 (adult albumin) for the high-affinity site and 2. 97 (fetal albumin) and 3. 25 (adult albumin) for the low-affinity site.

40|$|Although ulcers {{are often}} {{associated}} with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{little is known about}} the feasibility of predicting their development in patients taking NSAIDs. In addition, the ulcerogenic potentials of the newer NSAIDs, taken on long term basis, have not been compared with those of more established preparations. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical and pathological characteristics of patients at a higher risk of NSAID induced ulcers, measure the ulcerogenic potential of a variety of NSAIDs, and test the effect of these potentials on the predictability of ulceration. Altogether 190 long term NSAID users were studied. The presence of abdominal complaints, previous history of ulcers, arthritis related physical disability, anaemia, gastritis, and Helicobacter pylori status were all assessed as possible risk factors. NSAIDs were classified into established drugs (group I), and newer agents (group II). Group I included naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, ketoprofen, piroxicam, and flurbiprofen. Group II included fenbufen, nabumetone, ibuprofen, etodolac, <b>azapropazone,</b> and tiaprofenic acid. Of 63 ulcers identified in the study group, 51 (81 %) were seen in group I NSAID patients (51 of 132, 39 %) compared with 12 ulcers in group II (12 of 58, 21 %), p < 0. 02; estimated relative risk (ERR) : 2. 41). In group I, 25 ulcers were found in 38 patients with abdominal pain (25 of 38, 66 %, p < 0. 01, ERR: 5. 03); 18 in 25 (72 %) patients with a previous history of ulcers (p < 0. 001, ERR: 5. 77), 26 in 44 (59 %) patients with debilitating arthritis (p < 0. 001, ERR 3. 64), and 35 in 73 (48 %) patients with H pylori associated gastritis (p < 0. 01, ERR: 2. 48). The presence of these factors in group II patients did not influence the risk of ulceration.

40|$|The nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are very}} commonly prescribed, {{especially in the}} elderly population. In many countries more than 10 different NSAIDs are available. As the older pyrazole compounds like phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone and <b>azapropazone</b> are most prone to pharmacokinetic interactions, {{the use of these}} compounds should be avoided where possible. Acidic NSAIDs interact with bile acid-binding resins, resulting in decreased concentrations of NSAIDs in the blood. In earlier reports it was suggested that the absorption of NSAIDs was affected by antacids and sucralfate. More recently, it was shown that there is delayed absorption of these drugs, but there is no difference in the extent of absorption. Only salicylates had their urinary secretion enhanced by antacids, which increase the urinary pH to values > 7. Histamine H- 2 -receptor antagonists can be combined safely with NSAIDs. The concomitant administration of probenecid increased the blood concentration of NSAIDs, so an enhanced anti-inflammatory effect can be expected when these 2 drugs are combined. More importantly, NSAIDs can cause pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with other drugs. As can be expected, interactions with drugs that have a small therapeutic window art most likely to be of clinical significance. For example, lithium, medium to high dose methotrexate and, to a lesser extent, cyclosporin may be affected by concomitant administration of an NSAID. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and/or pyrazoles interact with oral anticoagulants, oral antihyperglycaemic agents and the anticonvulsants phenytoin and valproic acid (sodium valproate). Elevation of blood concentrations of these agents can be potentially dangerous. Similarly, NSAIDs interact with digoxin. This interaction is most likely to occur in the elderly, in neonates or in patients with renal impairment. Indomethacin can influence the blood concentrations of aminoglycosides in neonates. Unfortunately, this effect seems unpredictable, so practical therapeutic recommendations cannot be made. When NSAIDs are combined with salicylates or diflunisal, the blood concentrations of the salicylate or diflunisal may increase. However, the clinical relevance of this increase in drug concentration seems to be of minor importance. Gastrointestinal bleeding caused by NSAIDs is the most dangerous when it results from a mixed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction; however, patients are also at risk when pharmacodynamic interactions only are involved...|$|E
40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are among}} the most widely used drugs. Drug interactions with this class of compounds are frequently reported and can be pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic in nature. The pharmacokinetic interactions can be divided into 3 classes: (1) drugs affecting the pharmacokinetics of an NSAID. (2) an NSAID interfering with the pharmacokinetics of another NSAID and (3) NSAIDs altering the pharmacokinetics of another drug. Although the pharmacokinetics of some NSAIDs may be significantly affected by the concurrent administration of certain other drugs (including other NSAIDs), this type of interaction only occasionally leads to serious complications. Concurrent administration of antacids or sucralfate may delay the rate of oral absorption of NSAIDs but generally has little effect on the extent. Use of antacids increases urinary pH, leading to increased renal excretion of unchanged salicylic acid and decreased plasma concentrations of this antirheumatic agent. The H 2 -receptor blocking agent cimetidine inhibits the oxidative metabolism of many concurrently administered drugs, including certain NSAIDs. Probenecid inhibits the renal secretion of drug glucuronides and this will lead to accumulation in plasma of those NSAIDs eliminated primarily by the formation of labile acyl glucuronides such as naproxen, ketoprofen, indomethacin, carprofen. Cholestyramine decreases the oral absorption of many concurrently administered drugs, including NSAIDs. It may also decrease plasma concentrations of those NSAIDs undergoing enterohepatic circulation (e. g. piroxicam, tenoxicam) by interrupting the enterohepatic cycle. Corticosteroids stimulate the clearance of salicylic acid, leading to low plasma salicylate concentrations. Plasma concentrations of many NSAIDs are significantly reduced when the NSAID is coadministered with aspirin. The clinical relevance of most of these interactions is not well established. However, in those cases where the interaction results in elevated plasma concentrations of the NSAID, special caution should be exercised to avoid excessive accumulation of the NSAID especially in elderly and/or very sick patients who may be more sensitive to the more serious gastroduodenal and renal side-effects of these agents. By virtue of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, NSAIDs may significantly affect the disposition kinetics of a number of other drugs. They can displace other drugs from their plasma protein binding sites, inhibit their metabolism or interfere with their renal excretion. If the affected drug has a narrow therapeutic index, the interaction may be clinically significant. The pyrazole NSAIDs (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, <b>azapropazone)</b> inhibit the metabolism of many drugs such as the coumarin anticoagulants, oral antidiabetics and anticonvulsants such as phenytoin. Salicylates displace oral anticoagulants from their plasma protein binding sites. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
