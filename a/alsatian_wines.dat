2500|$|Previously, the Pinot gris wines {{produced}} in Alsace were originally labeled Tokay d'Alsace. In the Middle Ages, the grape was popularized {{in the region}} by Hungarian traders who {{were introduced to the}} grape from Burgundy. During this time, Tokaji {{was one of the most}} popular and sought after wines on the market and the name was probably used to gain more prestige for the <b>Alsatian</b> <b>wine.</b> Pinot gris was believed to have been brought back to Alsace by General Lazarus von Schwendi after his campaign against the Turks in the 16th century.

However, the Pinot gris grape has no known genetic relations to the Furmint, Hárslevelű, Yellow Muscat and Orémus grapes that are traditionally used in Tokaji wine. In 1980, the European Economic Community passed regulations related to Protected designations of origin (PDOs), and when Hungary started negotiations for European Union membership, it became clear that the Tokay name would have to become a PDO for the Tokaj-Hegyalja region. Therefore, in 1993, an agreement was reached between the Hungary and the European Union to phase out the name Tokay from non-Hungarian wine. In the case of Alsace, Tokay Pinot Gris was adopted as an intermediate step, with the [...] "Tokay" [...] part to be eliminated in 2007.

50|$|Alsace is a French grape growing {{region on}} the German border outside Strasbourg. The grapes are mostly whites-Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Blanc, and Pinot Gris. The wines all tend to share roundness, unctuousness, and power {{emanation}} from the warm days and a crisp acidity locked {{in by the}} cold nights of the growing region. This diurnal shift between temperature highs and lows {{is what makes the}} wines of Alsace important and is what Foris Vineyards in the Illinois Valley share in common.An easy way to experience this phenomenon is to compare a Pinot Gris from Alsace or Oregon with a Pinot Grigio(same grape, Italian name) from Italy. Though there are exceptions, most Italian Pinot Grigio is grown in areas characterized by warm days and mild nights. Without the cold nights the acidity in the grapes gradually diminishes and one is left with a fairly light, soft textured wine. While pleasant, they do not share the exuberance of an <b>Alsatian</b> or Oregon <b>wine</b> made from the same grape. The bright acidity found in Oregon Pinot Gris emphasizes the fruit, brings it into focus, and carries it along throughout the finish.|$|R
