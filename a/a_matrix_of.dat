40|$|AbstractLet G be a semi-direct {{product of}} a cyclic group of an odd order by a {{generalized}} quaternion group Qs. We consider the ring R obtained from the group ring ZG by identifying the elements ± 1 {{in the center of}} Qs with ± 1 of the rational integer ring Z. If the right regular representation <b>of</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> element in R is <b>an</b> Hadamard <b>matrix,</b> we call this <b>an</b> Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> generalized quaternion type. An Hadamard matrix generated by the Paley type 1 matrix is Seidel-equivalent to <b>an</b> Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> generalized quaternion type, bound by some conditions. When the order of generalized quaternion group is minimum, i. e. when Qs is the quaternion group, then <b>an</b> Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> generalized quaternion type is exactly <b>an</b> Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> type Q. See Ito [2]. Moreover if the four component <b>matrices</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> type Q are symmetric, then this becomes <b>an</b> Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> Williamson type. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to prove the existence of some infinite series <b>of</b> Hadamard <b>matrices</b> <b>of</b> generalized quaternion type. The theory of the relative Gauss sum is very important for the construction of our infinite series.

40|$|AbstractThe first {{infinite}} {{families of}} symmetric designs {{were obtained from}} finite projective geometries, Hadamard matrices, and difference sets. In this paper we describe two general methods of constructing symmetric designs {{that give rise to}} the parameters of all other known infinite families of symmetric designs. The method of global decomposition produces <b>an</b> incidence <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> symmetric design as <b>a</b> block <b>matrix</b> with each block being <b>a</b> zero <b>matrix</b> or <b>an</b> incidence <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smaller symmetric design. The method of local decomposition represents incidence <b>matrices</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> residual and a derived design of a symmetric design as block matrices with each block being <b>a</b> zero <b>matrix</b> or <b>an</b> incidence <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smaller residual or derived design, respectively...|$|R
25|$|Matrix {{structures}} {{include the}} incidence matrix, <b>a</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> 0's and 1's whose rows represent vertices and whose columns represent edges, and the adjacency matrix, {{in which both}} the rows and columns are indexed by vertices. In both cases a 1 indicates two adjacent objects and a 0 indicates two non-adjacent objects. The Laplacian matrix is a modified form of the adjacency matrix that incorporates information about the degrees of the vertices, and is useful in some calculations such as Kirchhoff's theorem {{on the number of}} spanning trees of a graph.|$|E
25|$|Resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogel (RF aerogel) {{is made in}} a way {{similar to}} {{production}} of silica aerogel. A carbon aerogel can then be made from this resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogel by pyrolysis in an inert gas atmosphere, leaving <b>a</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> carbon. It is commercially available as solid shapes, powders, or composite paper. Additives {{have been successful in}} enhancing certain properties of the aerogel for the use of specific applications. Aerogel composites have been made using a variety of continuous and discontinuous reinforcements. The high aspect ratio of fibers such as fiberglass have been used to reinforce aerogel composites with significantly improved mechanical properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{natural process}} of healing a {{fracture}} starts when the injured bone and surrounding tissues bleed, forming a fracture hematoma. The blood coagulates {{to form a}} blood clot situated between the broken fragments. Within a few days, blood vessels grow into the jelly-like matrix of the blood clot. The new blood vessels bring phagocytes to the area, which gradually remove the non-viable material. The blood vessels also bring fibroblasts in {{the walls of the}} vessels and these multiply and produce collagen fibres. In this way the blood clot is replaced by <b>a</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> collagen. Collagen's rubbery consistency allows bone fragments to move only a small amount unless severe or persistent force is applied.|$|E

To the north, including White Pike, much of Threlkeld Common and the margins of Threlkeld Knotts are rocks of the Buttermere Formation, part of the Skiddaw Group. Mudstones, siltstones and sandstones which had been deposited in deep water on the northern margin of an ancient continent (Avalonia) in the early Ordovician Period were chaotically disrupted by a huge undersea avalanche to form an olistostrome deposit in which blocks of rock are now embedded in <b>a</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> mudstone, and intensely deformed by minor folds, slumps and shears. This event can be dated to about 460 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{components}} of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds <b>a</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used {{through most of the}} 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.|$|E

This subspecies requires permanent standing water and medium to dense vegetation. It is evident that the dominant plant preferred by this subspecies is bulrush (Scirpus olneyi), however, other plant species are also frequently found in ecosystems where Amargosa voles are known to live, including seepweed (Suaeda torreyana), arrowweed (Pluchea sericea), quailbush (Atriplex lentiformis), southern reed (Phragmites australis), and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). It is estimated that there are only 247 acres of land that meets the habitat requirements of the Amargosa vole within their range.|$|E
