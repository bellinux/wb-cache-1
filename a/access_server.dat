50|$|To let {{different}} clients <b>access</b> <b>servers,</b> {{a number}} of standardized RPC systems have been created.

50|$|The access router uses Proxy ARP to {{make the}} dial-up node present in the subnet without being wired into the Ethernet: the <b>access</b> <b>server</b> 'publishes' its own MAC address for 192.168.0.254. Now, when another node wired into the Ethernet {{wants to talk to}} the dial-up node, it will ask on the network for the MAC address of 192.168.0.254 and find the access server's MAC address. It will {{therefore}} send its IP packets to the <b>access</b> <b>server,</b> and the <b>access</b> <b>server</b> will know to pass them on to the particular dial-up node. All dial-up nodes therefore appear to the wired Ethernet nodes as if they are wired into the same Ethernet subnet.|$|E

40|$|Event-based {{computing}} {{is vital}} {{for the next generation}} mobile services and applications that need to meet user requirements irrespective of time and location. The event paradigm is a form of asynchronous one-to-many communication and allows clients to receive information that matches their interests through filtering. Event-based communication is a good candidate for mobile computing, because it is asynchronous and supports disconnected operation. However, user and terminal mobility present problems pertaining to synchronization and delivery that need to be solved. In this paper, we examine and analyze mobility in the Rendezvous-Notify architecture. This event-delivery architecture is based on two <b>server</b> roles: <b>access</b> <b>servers</b> that maintain subscription information and buffered events, and resolution servers that are responsible for event channels and routing events to <b>access</b> <b>servers.</b> <b>Access</b> to event channels is done using a rendezvous mechanism...|$|R

Keywords: security, authentication, email reception, email address Introduction In this paper, I describe the use of email reception as an authentication mechanism for public <b>access</b> <b>servers,</b> such as email- and Web-based servers in untrusted and low-risk environments [DoD]. Even the simplest implementation provides security that is significantly better than trust and requires significant power to crack. Despite its security limitations, this type of authentication should be attractive for {{a large percentage of}} servers that are now currently trust-based.
