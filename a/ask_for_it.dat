5|$|During the 1980s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} Government of Norway to have a permanent base in Queen Maud Land. The area had been annexed as a dependency on 14 January 1939, at the time mainly based on Norwegian whaling interests in the Antarctic. From 1956, Norway operated the research station Norway Station, but this was given to South Africa in 1959. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Norway's research activities in Antarctica were sporadic and without a fixed base. This gave the advantage that the research was not bound geographically, but it weakened the Norwegian claim for Queen Maud Land {{and the right to}} participate as a consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty. In 1989, any party to the Treaty could <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be renegotiated, and Norwegian authorities saw the need for a permanent base to strengthen Norway's claim to Queen Maud Land.|$|E
5|$|National referendums, or plebiscites, are {{elections}} whereby {{citizens can}} {{determine whether a}} specific legal text can become official law or not. For this to take place, {{one of the following}} conditions must be met: The president wishes to hold one, both houses of the National Assembly request to hold one, or the citizens petition for it. If the National Assembly calls for a plebiscite, a majority is needed in both chambers for it to be official. If the citizens request a plebiscite, they must gather 430,000 signatures from eligible voters across the country. Additionally, over 30,000 people from each region must sign the petition, including the capital Minsk. Once either condition is met, the president must issue a decree setting the date of the national plebiscite. The plebiscite must take place less than three months after the decree was signed. Local cities can hold their own plebiscites if ten percent of the local population <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{wealthy and}} educated women in Madras were granted voting right in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925 {{irrespective}} of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor.

The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Equality of women with men is enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture of the Sikh faith.|$|E

The book's initial royalty was {{slated to be}} given to Frank in January. However, Maud told Frank to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in advance to purchase Christmas gifts. Begrudgingly, Frank requested and received the money, pocketing it. Not glancing at the money, Frank returned home, finding Maud ironing his shirt. He gave her the money after she asked for it, whereupon she became shocked. Anticipating it to be no more than $100, Maud was delighted to learn that the check was for $3,432.64. Maud misremembered the iron during the ensuing flurry and burned Frank's shirt.|$|E
25|$|The {{feast of}} the Epiphany is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which falls on 11 Tobe of the Coptic calendar, as the moment when in the baptism of Jesus the skies opened and God himself {{revealed}} to all as father of Jesus and all mankind. It is then a moment of revelation of epiphany. This celebration started to include all the processes of incarnation of Jesus, from his birth on Christmas until his baptism in the river Jordan. For the Coptic Orthodox Church {{it is also a}} moment in which the path of Jesus to the Cross begins. Therefore, in many celebrations there are certain similarities with the celebrations of Holy Friday during the time of Easter. Since the Epiphany is one of the seven great feasts of the Coptic Orthodox Church, it is a day of strict fasting, and several religious celebrations are held on this day. The day is related to the blessing of waters that are used all throughout the year in the church celebrations, and it is a privileged day to celebrate baptisms. It is also a day in which many houses are blessed with water. It may take several days for the local priest to bless all the houses of the parishioners that <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and so the blessing of the houses may go into the after-feasts of the Epiphany celebrations. However, it must be done before the beginning of Lent.|$|E
500|$|Every adult {{woman has}} to have a close male {{relative}} as her [...] "guardian". As a result, Human Rights Watch has described the position of Saudi women as no different from being a minor, with little authority over their own lives. The guardian is entitled to make a number of critical decisions on a woman's behalf. These include giving approval for the woman to travel, to hold some types of business licenses, to study at a university or college and to work if the type of business is not [...] "deemed appropriate for a woman." [...] Even where a guardian’s approval is not legally required, some officials will still <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Women also face discrimination in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women, and in family and inheritance law (see above).|$|E

500|$|The series {{makes use}} of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Beginning with the second season, visual effects became an {{in-house}} department. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden feels this improved the series because a fixed budget allowed them to compensate for other scenes that lacked effects, such as in [...] "Nightshifter". Wide shots of the bank's exterior—featuring closed-off streets, police, and SWAT helicopters—were accomplished with visual effects. The series' catchphrase—"Scary just got sexy"—was added to a billboard in the background. For the episode [...] "Houses of the Holy", production did not want viewers {{to be able to}} determine that the [...] "angel" [...] was in actuality a priest. Thus, the shape engulfed in light was a girl wearing a skintight white leotard. At times, the visual effects used were subtle. Cockroaches were digitally inserted into the sewer scenes of [...] "No Exit"; director Kim Manners did not <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but thought the addition [...] "made it really creepy". The episode [...] "Playthings" [...] featured a scene of a man dying after falling down stairs. The department added blood flowing from underneath him, and also made his fingers twitch and his mouth open and close to create a more lifelike appearance.|$|E
500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of}} his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E
500|$|American Beauty was {{released}} on VHS on May9, 2000, and on DVD with the DTS format on October24, 2000. Before the North American rental release on May9, Blockbuster Video wanted to purchase {{hundreds of thousands of}} extra copies for its [...] "guaranteed title" [...] range, whereby anyone who wanted to rent the film would be guaranteed a copy. Blockbuster and DreamWorks could not agree on a profit-sharing deal, so Blockbuster ordered two-thirds the number of copies it originally intended. DreamWorks made around one million copies available for rental; Blockbuster's share would usually have been about 400,000 of these. Some Blockbuster stores only displayed 60 copies, and others did not display the film at all, forcing customers to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The strategy required staff to read a statement to customers explaining the situation; Blockbuster claimed it was only [...] " [...] customer demand" [...] due to the reduced availability. Blockbuster's strategy leaked before May9, leading to a 30% order increase from other retailers. In its first week of rental release, American Beauty made $6.8million. This return was lower than would have been expected had DreamWorks and Blockbuster reached an agreement. In the same year, The Sixth Sense made $22million, while Fight Club made $8.1million, [...] though the latter's North American theatrical performance was just 29% that of American Beauty. Blockbuster's strategy also affected rental fees; American Beauty averaged $3.12, compared with $3.40 for films that Blockbuster fully promoted. Only 53% of the film's rentals were from large outlets in the first week, compared with the usual 65%.|$|E

2500|$|He had {{an abiding}} {{confidence}} in the natural, untutored instinct for rightness and beauty in the average person: [...] "all men have {{sense of what is}} right in this matter, if they would only use and apply this sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if he would only <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> when he does so, and not allow it to be forced upon him when he does not want it." [...] This contrasts with the thread of modernism that holds that people must be taught to appreciate good design. Another contrast with modernism is in the aesthetic of functionality: Ruskin saw no beauty in well-designed tools: beauty is out of place where there is not serene leisure, or [...] "if you thrust it into the places of toil. Put it in the drawing-room, not into the workshop; put it on domestic furniture, not upon tools of handicraft." [...] For Ruskin, Beauty was not an inherent characteristic but a thing that could be applied to an object or withheld from it.|$|E
