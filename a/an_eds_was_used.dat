Generally, the amount of In is gradually depleted with the increase in temperature [13, 28] because TMIn, which is the precursor for In, easily decomposes as compared to TMGa and is, thus, sensitive to the temperature. We studied the relationship between the growth temperature and the In concentration in the InGaN layers in our CVD system. For this study, the InGaN shell is deposited to a thickness of 50 nm on the GaN nanowires for the convenience of the compositional analysis of the shell by TEM since the typical InGaN shell, which is several nanometers thick, is difficult to analyze. Figure  3 d shows the In composition in InGaN shells as a function of temperature. It shows that the amount of In has a linear relationship with the temperature and that In is gradually depleted with the increase in temperature. <b>An</b> <b>EDS</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to determine the composition in the InGaN shell (Additional file 2 : Figure S 2).|$|E

An aberration-corrected STEM equipped with an HAADF detector and <b>an</b> <b>EDS</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to analyze the atomic structure of each specimen (Titan 200  kV). Au-Pd bimetallic particles deposited on a thin amorphous carbon film was used as a reference for correcting the aberration coefficients of the electronic optics system. Because the aberrations were visible when the beam was tilted out of the optical axis, a series of images was acquired at different beam tilt angles [3]. The aberration correction process was principally achieved by calculating the Zemlin tableau of a series of aberration coefficients followed by visualization of the phase shift image (phase plate). The required accuracy for compensation of the various residual aberration coefficients needed to achieve sub-angstrom resolution with the system was then determined. The probe forming aperture semiangle was 9.8 mrad, and the probe was focused to the size of 1  Å on the specimen with a beam current of 70 pA. The EDS was used to detect the chemical element distribution of the SiGe/Si interface. In this method, a coherent focused probe was scanned across the specimen, and the resultant x-ray emission spectrum was recorded at each probe position. These spectra were then used to construct an elemental line scan. The acquisition time for a single x-ray spectrum was 20  s.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The study {{aimed to}} provide a {{recommended}} list of performance indicators from routinely collected data that measure most aspects of the patient journey through the emergency department (ED). Methods: Data from <b>a</b> large tertiary <b>ED</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to investigate the proposed performance indicators, which fell into 7 categories: background information, time from arrival to triage, time from triage to treatment, length of stay, readmission rate, left without being seen, and deaths in the ED. Main Results: Category 1 patients were triaged, treated, and discharged rapidly. For category 2 patients, the times from arrival to triage increased but times from triage to treatment were relatively stable. Patients in categories 3 and 4 were not triaged rapidly and both the arrival to triage and triage to treatment processes were unstable and deteriorating. The average time to treatment for patients treated outside recommended times was unstable and increasing for categories 2, 3, and 4. The number of patients who left without being seen was stable except for 2 periods, and the readmission rate was stable except for 1 period of increase.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether there are real differences in emergency department (ED) performance between Australian states and territories. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of 2009 - 10 attendances at <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> contributing to the Australian non-admitted patient ED care database. The main outcome measure was difference in waiting time across triage categories. Results There were more than 5. 8 million ED attendances. Raw ED waiting times varied by a range of factors including jurisdiction, triage category, geographic location and hospital peer group. All variables were significant in a model designed to test the effect of jurisdiction on ED waiting times, including triage category, hospital peer group, patient socioeconomic status and patient remoteness. When the interaction between triage category and jurisdiction entered the model, it {{was found to have}} a significant effect on ED waiting times (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and triage was also significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Jurisdiction was no longer statistically significant (P = 0. 248 using all triage categories and 0. 063 using only Australian Triage Scale 2 and 3). Conclusions Although the Council of Australian Governments has adopted raw measures for its key ED performance indicators, raw waiting time statistics are misleading. There are no consistent differences in ED waiting times between states and territories after other factors are accounted for. What is known about the topic? The length of time patients wait to be treated after presenting at <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>is</b> routinely <b>used</b> to measure ED performance. In national health agreements with the federal government, each state and territory in Australia is expected to meet waiting time performance targets for the five ED triage categories. The raw data indicate differences in performance between states and territories. What does this paper add? Measuring ED performance using raw data gives misleading results. There are no consistent differences in ED waiting times between the states and territories after other factors are taken into account. What are the implications for practitioners?

40|$|Background: In {{paediatric}} anaesthesia, the dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) and the caudal block (KB) {{are established}} methods in regional anaesthesia (RA) for intra- and postoperative analgesia with few side effects. With a successful RA the patient should feel absolutely no pain. In the clinic for paediatric anaesthesia, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, an increased need of additional opioid piritramide could be observed after a DPNB. The failure rate (FR) was investigated and improvements of the analgesia concept were discussed. Methods: The retrospective observational study evaluated 507 archived anaesthesia logs from 1. 1. 2006 to 4. 9. 2007. FR was described via additional intra- and postoperative opioid requirement. Misinterpretations of Emergence Delirium (ED) as postoperative pain with following piritramide medication were reassessed {{on the basis}} of pain and delirium scores and excluded in the calculations for the FR. Concluding from the results and literature review, approaches to improve the analgesia concept were discussed. Results: FR of KB is 7. 5 % (5 / 67) and hence at a low level compared to previously published studies that range from 4 - 20 %. FR of DPNB is significantly higher with 34. 5 % (19 / 55) with regard to published study data from 3. 7 - 6. 4 %. Regression analysis shows a significant correlation of piritramide application (p = 0. 002) for DPNB and moderate (p = 0. 014) and severe (p = 0. 042) pain in the recovery room (RR). Only 15. 6 % (19 / 122) of the children had been documented with delirium scores, of these 26. 3 % (5 / 19) fulfilled the criteria for <b>an</b> <b>ED.</b> Children with ED received piritramide in 60 % of the cases (3 / 5), compared to 21. 4 % of children without ED (3 / 14). None of the children <b>were</b> treated concerning <b>an</b> <b>ED.</b> Discussion: 1. 	The data confirm the observation that KB has a good success rate, whilst DPNB compared to KB and to published studies has a higher FR. Statistical analysis did not reveal influencing factors and no convincing explanation regarding the higher FR could be found. A possible explanation {{may be related to the}} technique of DPNB itself. For effective and optimized analgesia of the penis, the combined analgesia of the Nervi dorsales penis and Nervi perineales, by combining the subpubic dorsal penile nerve block by Dalens with an additional subcutaneous injection in the ventral penoskrotal transition for anaesthesia of the frenulum sensory innervating Nervi perineales, could be promising. 2. 	No child with <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>was</b> excluded from the calculations of the FR. It could not be ruled out that also a failure of RA with pain occurred simultaneously. The present study shows, based on a small number of cases, a tendency that children without adequate RA develop an increased risk of ED. Under these conditions, children with <b>ED</b> cannot clearly <b>be</b> discriminated from children with pain. To improve diagnostic differentiation between pain and ED the "induction compliance checklist (ICC) " by Kain and systematic recording of other influencing factors of <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> should <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> 3. 	Scoring of pain and <b>ED</b> can <b>be</b> optimized. Establishing standardized, validated and age-appropriate pain and ED scorings at specific times in the RR should be considered. 4. 	In the context of quality management, prospective studies should re-evaluate the modified RA and all relevant procedures related to analgesia in routine hospital practice. Conclusion: On the basis of indications and contraindications, and if the parents agree to the procedure, no child should be denied intra-and postoperative analgesia with KB and the (modified) DPNB by Dalens. Successful RA is based on evidence-based technology and includes a coherent concept of the anaesthetic procedures with validated scores and the participation of professional nurses and parents...|$|R

We report a pilot study of a case management program for ED frequent users to reduce ED usage and radiation exposure. Methods: This observational retrospective study was performed at <b>a</b> community hospital <b>ED.</b> Between May 2006 and April 2008, 96 patients were enrolled in a case management program and were followed through November 2008. The case management program consisted of a multi-disciplinary team of physicians, nurses, social services and specialists in pain management and behavioral health. Patients were enrolled if they had five or more visits to the ED in the previous month, if a concern about <b>a</b> patient’s <b>ED</b> <b>use</b> <b>was</b> raised by staff, or if they were identified by the California prescription monitoring program. Case management addressed specific patient issues and assisted with receiving consistent outpatient care. The number of ED visits per patient and the number of radiological studies at each of these visits was recorded. When reviewing data for analysis, we used the number of total images in all computed tomography (CT) scans during the given time period. Results: In the six months prior to enrollment, patients averaged 2. 3 ED visits per patient per month. In the six months after enrollment, patients averaged 0. 6 ED visits per patient per month (P< 0. 0001), and all visits after enrollment up to November 2008 averaged 0. 4 visits per patient per month (P< 0. 0001). In the six months prior to enrollment, these patients averaged 25. 6 CT images per patient per month. In the six months after enrollment, patients averaged 10. 2 CT images per patient per month (P= 0. 001), and all CT images after enrollment up to November 2008 averaged 8. 1 CT images per patient per month (P= 0. 0001). This represents <b>a</b> decrease in <b>ED</b> use by 83 % and a decrease in radiation exposure by 67 %. Conclusion: Case management can significantly reduce ED use by frequent users, and can also decrease radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging. [West J Emerg Med. 2010; 11 (4) : 336 - 343]...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} of the aerospace industry in thermoplastic composites has increased over the last years. One {{of the advantages of}} using thermoplastics over thermosets is the possibility to use thermoplastic welding as a joining technique. Ultrasonic welding {{is considered one of the}} most promising variants: it is very fast, results in high-quality welds, can be applied to any fibre and resin type, is easy to automate and makes use of compact tooling. Therefore, it is a suitable technique for assembly and spot welding. This thesis research aims to improve the current processes for ultrasonic welding at TU Delft, while keeping a close eye on the industrial application. The first part of the research was focussed on the energy directors (EDs) : resin protrusions between the substrates that heat up before the bulk material in the laminates. Previous research at TU Delft has mostly used loose EDs, but for industrial purposes it is preferable to integrate the EDs into the laminates. In this research, two production methods were developed that are suitable for moulding slender ED strips onto laminates: the first with aluminium strips with holes, the second with an Invar mould in which slender grooves have been machined. Both <b>were</b> <b>used</b> in combination with neat PEKK foil. An issue that was encountered with both methods is the variability in the thickness of the strips, leading to uneven melting. A comparison was made between the welding process of integrated and loose <b>EDs.</b> Moreover, it <b>was</b> found that the loose energy directors outperformed the integrated energy directors in terms of joint strength. Next, the displacement ceiling was investigated: a maximum in sonotrode travel that occurs before the optimum weld stage has been reached. When this happens, it is more difficult to use displacement as a welding driver to create welds of high strength. It was found that there are two types of displacement ceiling. The first occurs when <b>a</b> single <b>ED</b> strip <b>is</b> <b>used,</b> or the strips are placed far apart and the flow fronts do not merge. The origin possibly lies in changes in impedance and friction of the energy director flow. The second type of ceiling occurs when multiple ED strips flow and merge, which only happens if the spacing between them is small enough. The flow of the EDs pushes into each other, increasing the impedance of the flow and preventing further displacement of the sonotrode. To overcome the displacement ceiling, new displacement-controlled welding strategies have been investigated. First, the vibration phase was stopped before the ceiling had been reached. This resulted in welds of poor quality and strength. By reducing the pressure, the welds could be improved, but not to a satisfactory level. In the second strategy, the welding pressure was increased during the vibration phase. It was found that it is possible to push through the displacement ceiling and use a higher displacement value as the welding driver, which improves the strength of the welds greatly. These results showed significant scatter in the strength, which could be reduced by preventing secondary welding.

In order to have more influence on unnecessary self-referral, {{it is essential to}} know why patients visit the ED without referral. The goal of this systematic review therefore is to explore what motivates self-referred patients in those countries to visit the ED. METHODS: Recommendations from the PRISMA <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to search and analyze the literature. The following databases; PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library, were systematically searched from inception up to the first of February 2015. The reference lists of the included articles were screened for additional relevant articles. All studies that reported on the motives of self-referred patients to visit <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>were</b> selected. The reasons for self-referral were categorized into seven main themes: health concerns, expected investigations; convenience of the ED; lesser accessibility of primary care; no confidence in general practitioner/primary care; advice from others and financial considerations. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Thirty publications were identified from the literature studied. The most reported themes for self-referral were 'health concerns' and 'expected investigations': 36 % (95 % Confidence Interval 23 - 50 %) and 35 % (95 % CI 20 - 51 %) respectively. Financial considerations most often {{played a role in the}} United States with a reported percentage of 33 % versus 4 % in other countries (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide, the most important reasons to self-refer to <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>are</b> health concerns and expected investigations. Financial considerations mainly play a role in the United States...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss proven {{practices}} for developing Emergency Department (ED) simulations based on recent project success. From human decisions to political agendas, <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>is</b> filled with unpredictable elements, {{making it a}} difficult environment to model. However, the key decision-making information that will be uncovered from a study is worth the effort. This paper will thoroughly analyze each step of <b>a</b> typical <b>ED</b> simulation project, identifying key areas of focus and tips for success. Defining the objective, process map, scenarios, outputs and animation requirements are the first steps. A system for gathering the <b>ED</b> data will <b>be</b> discussed, as well as advice for the verification and validation phases. Finally, {{the presentation of the}} findings will be analyzed. No part <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> simulation project should be discounted. This paper will stress dependency of each phase on the successful outcome of the entire project...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} code which captures the {{topology}} of closed-curve based diagrams (e. g. Euler diagrams (<b>EDs)</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to visualize set-based relationships, whilst knot diagrams represent knotted structures), {{often used in}} visual languages. We briefly indicate how to construct a diagram from such a code. Furthermore, we present an interactive software artefact with a human-centric focus, permitting users the freedom to construct and transform diagrams at either the diagram or the code level, implementing algorithmic procedures developed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: One out of 50 injury-related presentations to <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> transport-related cycling injury. Detailed {{information}} about the most frequent mechanism of cycling injuries, sustained injuries and patterns are under-reported. The objective {{of this research was}} to examine the pattern of injuries sustained by cyclists at a level 1 trauma centre. Methods: A retrospective review of data of injured cyclists admitted and treated at a level 1 trauma centre between 2011 and 2012 evaluated demographic data, mechanism of injury, injury pattern, economic costs and outcome. Results: Data of 261 patients (mean age of 39 years) were reviewed, of which 88...|$|R
40|$|An {{original}} HPLC assay {{was developed}} for pyrimethamine (PYR) in plasma, RBCs, and buffer {{for the purpose of}} studying its plasma protein binding and RBC partitioning. Equilibrium dialysis (<b>ED)</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to study protein binding. Isotonic phosphate buffer used in ED did not prevent small volume shifts. The pH of the plasma affected the protein binding of PYR although it was not significant for the comparison of binding at pH 7. 4 vs. 8. 0. PYR at 1000 ng/ml averaged 93. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model for <b>an</b> {{emergency}} department (<b>ED).</b> The model <b>is</b> developed in close {{collaboration with the}} French hospital Saint Camille, and <b>is</b> validated <b>using</b> real data. The objective of this model <b>is</b> to help <b>ED</b> managers better understand {{the behavior of the}} system and to improve the ED operations performance. The most essential features of <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>are</b> considered in the model. A case study is conducted in order to allow decision makers select the most relevant investment in the human staffing budget. A simulation-based optimization algorithm is adopted to minimize the average Length of Stay (LOS) under a budget constraint. We conduct a sensitivity analysis on the optimal average LOS {{as a function of the}} staffing budget, and derive useful recommendations to managers on how the budget can impact the performance of the system...|$|R
40|$|Ambulance {{diversion}} (AD) <b>is</b> often <b>used</b> by emergency departments (EDs) {{to relieve}} congestion. When <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>is</b> on diversion status, the ED requests ambulances {{to bypass the}} facility; therefore ambulance patients are transported to another ED. This paper studies the effect of AD policies on the average waiting time of patients. The AD policies analyzed include (i) a policy that initiates diversion when all the beds are occupied; (ii) a policy obtained by using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, and (iii) a policy that does not allow diverting at all. The analysis <b>is</b> based on <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> that comprises two treatment areas. The diverted patients {{are assumed to be}} transported to <b>a</b> neighboring <b>ED,</b> whose average waiting time is known. The results show significant improvement in the average waiting time spent by patients in the ED with the policy obtained by MDP formulation. In addition, other heuristics are identified to work well compared with not diverting at all. ...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to study the role of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) {{in the use of}} the emergency department (<b>ED)</b> as <b>a</b> source of routine healthcare. Adult patients presenting to <b>an</b> urban <b>ED</b> <b>were</b> surveyed. We assessed demographics, race/ethnicity, SES, and perceptional factors related to choosing the ED for the current visit. Stepwise logistic regression analyses <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to explore whether SES accounted for racial/ethnic trends in ED use. Of 1375 patients, 936 (68 %) were enrolled. After controlling for insurance status, income, employment status, and education, neither race nor ethnicity remained a strong predictor of routine ED use. Race/ethnicity-based disparities in routine <b>ED</b> <b>use</b> <b>were</b> due to the confounding effects of SES. Programs to reduce inappropriate <b>ED</b> <b>use</b> must <b>be</b> sensitive to an array of complex socioeconomic issues and may necessitate a substantial paradigm shift in how acute care is provided in low SES communities...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} if geographic proximity to <b>an</b> emergency department (<b>ED)</b> <b>is</b> related to <b>ED</b> <b>use</b> in <b>a</b> metropolitan population {{of patients with}} cardiovascular risk factors. Design Population-based, retrospective cohort study. Setting The census metropolitan area of Montreal, Que. Participants Cohort of 99 [*] 400 patients with diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia in 2007 without a history of cardiovascular disease. Each patient was spatially referred to 1 of 5857 dissemination areas (DAs). Main outcome measures Annual number of visits to <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> {{with respect to the}} distance between the centroid of a patient’s DA and the closest ED, controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, and neighbourhood immigration, social, and material characteristics. Multilevel logistic and negative binomial regressions <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to {{determine if}} the proximity to the closest <b>ED</b> <b>was</b> related to <b>ED</b> <b>use,</b> frequent ED use (≥[*] 4 visits in a year), and number of <b>ED</b> visits. Results <b>A</b> total of 25 [*] 889 (26. 0 %) patients in the cohort visited <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> at least once during a 1 -year period, among which 4563 (4. 6 %) were frequent users with at least 4 visits. These frequent users were responsible for 28 [*] 249 (45. 5 %) of all 62 [*] 021 visits to EDs. The distance between a DA and its closest <b>ED</b> <b>was</b> significantly and negatively correlated with ED use (P <. 001), even after controlling for confounding variables. Patients living in a DA close to <b>an</b> <b>ED</b> <b>were</b> also more likely to be frequent users, but the extent of use among them (range from 4 to 82 <b>ED</b> visits) <b>was</b> not related to the distance to the closest ED. Conclusion These results suggest that patients at risk of cardiovascular disease living in a metropolitan area are more likely to seek a medical encounter at the ED if they live closer to it.
