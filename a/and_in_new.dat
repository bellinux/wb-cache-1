5|$|After the Civil War, the Corps of Engineers {{undertook}} {{a program of}} river and harbor improvements. Raynolds supervised the dredging and improvement of navigation on the Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. He also helped supervise several harbor dredging and construction projects, involving the harbor in Buffalo, New York, the Harbor of Refuge in New Buffalo, Michigan, Erie Harbor in Erie, Pennsylvania, and the river harbors of St. Louis, Missouri and Alton, Illinois. Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area, where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870. Raynolds was promoted to permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Corps of Engineers on March 7, 1867.

5|$|After {{the success}} of the {{nomination}} speech, Howe and Roosevelt planned that the latter would run for Governor of New York in 1932 and President in 1936. However, Governor Smith was named the Democratic presidential candidate in 1928, and persuaded the state convention to draft Roosevelt. Howe predicted disaster, feeling that a Republican challenger was sure to beat Roosevelt in what was expected to be nationally a Republican year. Though Howe remained Roosevelt's unofficial campaign manager, he was technically subordinate to a state campaign manager selected by Smith, as well as Smith's personal campaign manager, Belle Moskowitz, with whom Howe frequently clashed. In the fall election, Roosevelt won the governorship by a small margin, though Smith was defeated by Herbert Hoover both nationally <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York State.|$|E

5|$|Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's {{first major}} bowl game in school history, tickets and travel {{packages}} {{were in high}} demand.

5|$|Beginning in 1999, Monster Ballads, {{a series}} of {{compilation}} albums that feature popular power ballads, usually from the glam metal genre, capitalized on the nostalgia, with the first volume going platinum. The VH1 sponsored Rock Never Stops Tour, beginning in 1998, has seen many glam metal bands take to the stage again, including on the inaugural tour: Warrant, Slaughter, Quiet Riot, FireHouse, and L.A. Guns. Slaughter also {{took part in the}} 1999 version with Ted Nugent, Night Ranger, and Quiet Riot. Poison and Cinderella toured together in 2000 and 2002, and in 2005 Cinderella headlined the Rock Never Stops Tour, with support from Ratt, Quiet Riot, and FireHouse. In 2007 the four-day-long Rocklahoma festival held in Oklahoma included glam metal bands Poison, Ratt and Twisted Sister. Warrant and Cinderella co-headlined the festival in 2008. Nostalgia for the genre was evidenced in the production of the glam metal themed musical Rock of Ages, which ran in Los Angeles in 2006 <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York in 2008. It was made into a film released in 2012.|$|E

5|$|During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four {{transport}} units: Nos.33, 34, 35 and 36Squadrons. No.36 Squadron {{was established}} on 11March at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, {{under the control}} of Southern Area Command. Its initial strength was twenty-six personnel and one Douglas DC-2. This was gradually built up to a force of six DC-2s, as well as examples of various de Havilland types including the DH.84 Dragon, DH.86 Express, DH.89 Dragon Rapide, and Tiger Moth. Tasked with transport operations throughout Australia and to Port Moresby, New Guinea, the squadron relocated to Essendon, Victoria, on 17July. One of the DC-2s crashed at Seven Mile Aerodrome, Port Moresby, on 14September; all aboard were killed. The squadron was transferred to Townsville, Queensland, on 11December 1942.

5|$|In England, ain't is {{generally}} considered a non-standard or illiterate usage, as it is used by speakers of a lower socio-economic class, or by educated people in an informal manner.

5|$|Quarrington was a rural {{community}} {{during the early}} and middle Anglo-Saxon period while mills along the River Slea in the Middle Ages gave the village its alternative name of Millthorpe. The Bishop of Lincoln and Ramsey Abbey held manors in Quarrington after the Norman Conquest, but the Carre family of Sleaford were the principal land-owners between 1559 and 1683, when its estate passed by marriage to the Marquesses of Bristol. Although the growth of Victorian Sleaford saw the town encroach into the parish's boundaries, the old village remained a small cluster of farm buildings and cottages for much of its history. The sale {{of most of the}} surrounding farmland by successive Marquesses of Bristol in the late 20th century led to the rapid development of residential estates on Quarrington Hill <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Quarrington which have engulfed the original settlement. Low crime rates, affordable housing, high standards of living and access to good schools have attracted home-buyers to the area, contributing to a sharp rise in the population.|$|E
