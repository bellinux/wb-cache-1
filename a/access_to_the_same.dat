40|$|In {{this section}} {{we will study}} the {{approach}} of using caching {{for the management of}} data in distributed systems. Caching always tries to keep data at the place where it is needed. The problem with this approach is that it may not be known in advance which processor will be <b>the</b> next <b>to</b> <b>access</b> a certain data item. Is it nevertheless possible to find good caching strategies? When is a caching strategy “good”? Obviously, a model is needed that allows us <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> performance of caching strategies. 6. 1 The model Let G = (V, E) be an arbitrary graph, and let U be the set of all shared objects. We assume that an adversary specifies a distributed application running on the nodes of the network, i. e., the adversary initiates read and write requests <b>to</b> <b>the</b> objects at the nodes of the network G. These requests must be served by an on-line caching strategy. We restrict the class of allowed applications specified by <b>the</b> adversary <b>to</b> be data-race free, i. e., a write <b>access</b> <b>to</b> an object is not allowed to overlap with other <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> object, and there is some order among <b>the</b> <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> object such that for each read and write access, there is a unique least recent write.

25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children do not have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, a Canadian {{teacher and}} writer Florence Deeks unsuccessfully sued Wells for {{infringement}} of copyright and breach of trust, claiming {{that much of}} The Outline of History had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript, The Web of the World's Romance, which had spent nearly nine months {{in the hands of}} Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada. However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not even know it existed, let alone having seen it. The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were {{due to the fact that}} the books had similar nature and both writers had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sources. In 2000, A. B. McKillop, a professor of history at Carleton University, produced a book on the case, The Spinster & The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past. According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case. In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Ontario, published an article on Deeks v. Wells. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{algorithm}} for dynamic data-race detection. Our algorithm reports no false positives and runs on arbitrary C and C++ code. Unlike previous algorithms, {{we do not}} have to instrument every memory access or track a full happens-before relation. Our data-race detector, which we call IFRit, is based on a run-time abstraction called an interference-free region (IFR). An IFR is an interval of one thread’s execution during which any write to a specific variable by a different thread is a data race. We insert instrumentation at compile time to monitor active IFRs at run-time. If the runtime observes overlapping IFRs for conflicting <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> variable in two different threads, it reports a race. The static analysis aggregates information for multiple <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> variable, avoiding <b>the</b> expense of having to instrument every memory access in the program. We directly compare IFRit to FastTrack [10] and Thread-Sanitizer [25], two state-of-the-art fully-precise data-race detectors. We show that IFRit imposes a fraction of the overhead of these detectors. We show that for the PARSEC benchmarks, and several real-world applications, IFRit finds many of the races detected by a fully-precise detector. We also demonstrate that sampling can further reduce IFRit’s performance overhead without completely forfeiting precision. ∗ This material is based upon work supported by the National Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Automatic race {{detection}} of C programs requires fast, yet sufficiently precise, analysis of dynamic memory. Therefore, {{we present a}} region-based pointer analysis which seeks to identify disjoint regions of dynamically allocated objects to ensure that write <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> region are always protected by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mutexes. Our approach has been implemented within the interprocedural analyzer of concurrent C programs GobLint and we have successfully applied it on code from the Linux kernel, such as the access vector cache. This code relies on a synchronized hash table where an array of doubly linked lists is protected by an array of locks. ...|$|R

Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure {{the health and well-being of}} families, including information and advice on family planning.|$|E

30|$|Regarding data-intensive loads, [82] {{states that}} they {{represent}} a special class of applications where the size and/or quantity of data is large. As a direct result, transfer costs are significantly higher and more prominent. While the authors do address data transfers in their resource model, several aspects of data access are not acknowledged. For instance, <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> resource leads <b>to</b> a communication cost of zero. Transfer costs are calculated based on average bandwidth between the nodes, without regards to I/O contention, multiples <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> resource, containers and VMs co-located in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> node sharing network and I/O resources, among other factors. This is also observed in other works such as [15, 33, 64, 95]. Other models consider transfers as part of computation time, such as [70]. This is depicted as a fundamental challenge by [127], which states that “in most studies, data transfer between tasks is not directly considered, data uploading and downloading are assumed as part of task execution”. Wu et al. [127] complements by stating that {{this may not be}} the case for modern applications and workflows –in fact, data movement activities might dominate both execution time and cost. For the authors it is essential <b>to</b> design <b>the</b> data placement strategies for resource provisioning decision-making. Moreover, employing VMs deployed in different regions intensifies the data transfer costs, leading to an even more complicated issue. This is correlated to having more complex cloud environments in terms of resource distribution, such as hybrid and multicloud scenarios.|$|R
