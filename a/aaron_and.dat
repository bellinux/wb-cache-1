5|$|In 968, Bulgaria was invaded {{from the}} north by the Kievan Prince Sviatoslav. By that time, the Bulgarian Empire, which had once {{threatened}} the existence of Byzantium under the reign of Simeon, had {{lost much of its}} power. During the conflict, the Kievan raids were repeatedly defeated by the Byzantines, who were also at war with the Bulgarians, a continuous conflict since the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav in 971. This war had resulted in the Bulgarian Emperor Boris II being forced to renounce his Imperial title in Constantinople, and eastern Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule. The Byzantines assumed that this act would signify the end of independent Bulgaria, but the western Bulgarian lands remained autonomous and under the Comitopuli brothers David, Moses, <b>Aaron</b> <b>and</b> Samuel, resistance against the Byzantines emerged.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over five weeks, {{on the outskirts of}} Dallas, Texas. The film was produced on a budget of only USD$7,000, and a skeleton crew of five. Carruth acted as writer, director, producer, cinematographer, editor, and music composer. He also stars in the film as <b>Aaron,</b> <b>and</b> many of the other characters are played by his friends and family. The small budget required conservative use of the Super 16mm filmstock: the carefully limited number of takes resulted in an extremely low shooting ratio of 2:1. Every shot in the film was meticulously storyboarded on 35mm stills. Carruth created a distinctive flat, overexposed look for the film by using fluorescent lighting, non-neutral color temperatures, high-speed film stock, and filters.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, Mexico {{underwent}} {{a period of}} instability under the Plutarco Elías Calles administration who was seeking to limit {{the influence of the}} Catholic Church to modernize and centralize the state within the religious sphere of Mexican society. To protest the policies, the Catholic Church suspended all religious services, bringing about an uprising in Mexico. This uprising, or Cristero War, lasted from 1926 to 1929 and reemerged in the 1930s. On April 6, 1926 González had a vision in which God changed his name from Eusebio to <b>Aarón</b> <b>and</b> was later told to leave Monterrey where he and his wife served Saulo and Silas. On his journey, he preached near the entrances of Catholic churchesoften facing religious persecutionuntil he arrived at Guadalajara on December 12, 1926. The Cristero Wars impacted both Catholic and non-Catholic congregations and preachers, especially evangelical movements. Small movements were attacked by the government and the Cristeros, resulting in a hostile environment for González's work.|$|E

Five Braves and two Dodgers were named to the first while six Braves and four Dodgers played in the second. Five future Hall of Famers were on the Braves roster in 1959 (Aaron, Mathews, Schoendienst, Slaughter, Spahn) while the Dodgers had three (Drysdale, Koufax, Snider).

Jeter finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits {{on the day he}} achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is {{the only member of the}} 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as a Yankee. Jeter became the second player to reach 3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus Wagner). Only Ty Cobb, Hank <b>Aaron,</b> <b>and</b> Robin Yount were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit.

Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. <b>Aaron</b> <b>and</b> Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B.

Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she {{had to go back to}} New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E
