5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> impact the postseason, and {{the simple fact that}} not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E

Elsewhere, Tyrion and Bronn are also {{discussing}} the match <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> affect Shae. Tywin Lannister meets his grandson, King Joffrey Baratheon, and teaches him {{a lesson in}} ruling; Joffrey asks {{what they should do}} about the rumors of Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons, but Tywin claims there is no threat. When they meet later, Shae tells Tyrion that she will not continue their relationship once he marries Sansa.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic concept}} was {{primarily}} {{developed in the}} non-positivist theory of Max Weber to observe how human behaviors relate to cause and effect in the social realm. For Weber, sociology {{is the study of}} society and behavior and must therefore look at the heart of interaction. The theory of social action, more than structural functionalist positions, accepts and assumes that humans vary their actions according to social contexts <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> affect other people; when a potential reaction is not desirable, the action is modified accordingly. Action can mean either a basic action (one that has a meaning) or an advanced social action, which not only has a meaning but is directed at other actors and causes action (or, perhaps, inaction).|$|E

25|$|As an example, marlin lures are {{typically}} 7-14 inches or more long with a shaped plastic or metal {{head and a}} plastic skirt. The design of the lure head, particularly its face, gives the lure its individual action when trolled through the water. Lure actions range from an active side-to-side swimming pattern to pushing water aggressively on the surface to, most commonly, tracking along {{in a straight line}} with a regular surface pop and bubble trail. Besides the shape, weight and size of the lure head, the length and thickness of skirting, the number and size of hooks and the length and size of the leader used in lure rigging all influence the action of the lure: how actively it will run <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> respond to different sea conditions. Experienced anglers fine tune their lures to get the action they want.|$|E
25|$|Soil carbon {{storage is}} an {{important}} function of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil contains more carbon than plants and the atmosphere combined. Understanding what maintains the soil carbon pool {{is important to understand}} the current distribution of carbon on Earth, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> respond to environmental change. While much research has been done on how plants, free-living microbial decomposers, and soil minerals affect this pool of carbon, it is recently coming to light that mycorrhizal fungi—symbiotic fungi that associate with roots of almost all living plants—may {{play an important role in}} maintaining this pool as well. Measurements of plant carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi have been estimated to be 5-20% of total plant carbon uptake, and in some ecosystems the biomass of mycorrhizal fungi can be comparable to the biomass of fine roots. Recent research has shown that mycorrhizal fungi hold 50 to 70 percent of the total carbon stored in leaf litter and soil on forested islands in Sweden. Turnover of mycorrhizal biomass into the soil carbon pool is thought to be rapid and has been shown in some ecosystems to be the dominant pathway by which living carbon enters the soil carbon pool.|$|E
500|$|According to Rimsky-Korsakov, {{the other}} members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the {{orchestra}} in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that [...] "they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path". Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by Anton Rubinstein, a composer opposed to the nationalists' music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov [...] "might amount to something" [...] as a composer. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, [...] "Apparently [...] is now passing through this crisis, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> end will be difficult to predict. Either a great master will come out of him, or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks".|$|E

500|$|The novel's {{language}} {{is viewed as}} rife with labeling and product placements. Postmodern theorist Fredric Jameson calls it [...] "a kind of hyped-up name-dropping ... an encyclopaedic familiarity with the fashions ... class status {{as a matter of}} knowing the score rather than of having money and power". He also calls it [...] "postmodern nominalism" [...] in that the names express the new and fashionable. This name-dropping demonstrates how commercialism has created and named new objects and experiences and renamed (or re-created) some that already existed. This naming includes nationalities; there are eight references to nationality (or locality) in the first three pages. Zeidner wrote that the novel's [...] "new century is unsettlingly transitional making it difficult to maintain an individual identity". One character argues that [...] "there will soon be no national identity left … [...] all experience [...] reduced, by the spectral hand of marketing, to price-point variations on the same thing." [...] This is juxtaposed against the footage that contains no hints of time period or location. Globalization is represented by characters of varying nationalities, ease of international travel, portable instant communication, and commercial monoculture recognizable across international markets. As an example, Gibson writes how one ‘yes or no' decision by Cayce on the logo will impact {{the lives of the people}} in remote places who will manufacture the logos <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> infect their dreams.|$|E

The recurrence of this mortality theme {{can be viewed as}} autobiographical. Because her work was not intended for the public, she was referring to her own medical problems and her belief that she would die. In addition to her medical history (smallpox and partial paralysis), Bradstreet and her family dealt with a major house fire that left them homeless and devoid of all personal belongings.

2500|$|Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were {{recognized}} for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, {{two of the}} most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: [...] "How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?" [...] Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him {{to send a message to}} the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks [...] "on behalf of our Afghan brethren": [...] "Why should I send a message? Why are you talking on our behalf? Don't we have leaders here to talk on our behalf?" [...] Khan replied [...] "This is how it has been <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be. Do you have a message?" [...] Massoud told the foreign minister that [...] "nobody who talks on our behalf will have any kind of result." [...] Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post-communist leader of Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|Stay Alive shows a {{different}} side of Nina, consisting mostly of original songs, and covers {{a wide range}} of genres from piano-driven ballads, midtempo pop blues, and house/synthpop to contemporary R The album showcases her passion for dance music, relying on more upbeat, catchy tunes. Nina expressed that the album's direction to a new sound reflects to her new improved self, saying [...] "I have changed a lot. From the time I came out with the Heaven album [...] I gained a lot of the confidence that I have now when I started gaining awards but not too much that it went to my head. It's confidence in my singing and performing and letting people know that I'm a singer." [...] She stated that the album will be a studio album with two covers, and that its sound is going to be [...] "sexy-soul," [...] which she defined as [...] "singing from the soul but having a degree of sexiness to it." [...] Stay Alive is heavily considered as Nina's comeback in the recording scene, being described as a mixture of pop, club and R songs which is very different from her previous sound. She admitted the idea of wanting to try something new, saying [...] "I want to try {{a different}} genre that’s why we decided {{to come up with a}} dance album," [...] recalling her dance performances onstage during concerts <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be some sort of experiment for her. She also wants people to know that she loves to dance, and that she dares to show a more sexy, sensual side for the album. In preparation, she decided to maintain physical fitness by working out, playing tennis, and practicing boxing everyday.
