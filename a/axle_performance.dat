25|$|The GT variant {{kept the}} twin driving lights, but reverted to a bonnet {{blackout}} with no stripes {{at all on}} the vehicle. The front guards received fake 'vents' just behind the indicators, and NACA ducts were added to the bonnet. Steel 12-slot wheels were reintroduced, although some GTs received the five-spoke Globe 'Bathurst' wheels, which had been ordered for the GT-HO Phase IV and now needed to be used. The GT's rear suspension featured radius rods to help locate the elliptical-spring solid rear <b>axle.</b> Other <b>performance</b> parts from the aborted Phase IV found their way onto GTs, including larger fuel tanks and winged sumps.

50|$|The vehicle's other {{drawback}} {{was limited}} mobility in heavily wooded areas and on broken terrain; armored cavalry units preferred using the ¼-ton reconnaissance car (Jeep) in these environments. A large turning radius, limited wheel travel, open differentials, and limited cross-country mobility made the M8 armored car susceptible to immobilization off-road in off-camber terrain and defiles. This limited operators {{to using the}} vehicle mostly on existing roads and paths, where it became vulnerable to ambush. The lack of continuous tracks like a tank led to a high ground pressure and hampered its off-road performance in mud, snow and alpine terrain and the M8 frequently sank to its <b>axles.</b> Conversely, the <b>performance</b> of the M8 on hard surfaces was exceptional, with the vehicle having long range and able to consistently maintain its top speed of 55 mph.

40|$|Modern urban buses {{with low}} floor and {{considerable}} over hung design {{are known to}} cause poor ride quality and excessive pavement loads. Such performance {{is partly due to}} the present status of urban roads and their rapid deterioration. On the other hand, variations in the dynamic tire forces of such vehicles are known to be a cause for acceleration of road damage and are strongly related to vibration modes of the vehicle associated with vertical and pitch motion of the sprung and unsprung masses. The high levels of tire induced road damage has prompted a growing demand for the design of heavy vehicles that are both passenger- and road-friendly. In this investigation, a six degrees-of-freedom pitch plane model of a modern urban bus is developed to study the ride and <b>axle</b> load <b>performance</b> under deterministic as well as measured urban road excitations. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing the response characteristics with available measured data. The ride quality of the vehicle is assessed in relation to the proposed guidelines upon applying the recommended frequency-weighting filters. An extensive list of performance measures for dynamic wheel loads and their pavement damage potentials are discussed and used for the assessment of road-friendliness performance. The influence of variations in design and operating variables on the ride performance of the vehicle is investigated through a comprehensive parametric study. The variations in operating conditions include the speed, road roughness, tire inflation pressure and bus load. The parametric study on design variables includes the variations in suspension dampers and springs, geometry of the suspension and wheel base. The results of the study are discussed to highlight the contributions of these parameters on the ride quality and pavement load, and to identify most desirable design and operating condition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a long life}} pavement {{that has been in}} existence as an experimental section on a national highway in Gauteng, South Africa for the past 30 years. The section is part of a suite of test sections that were originally constructed in 1968, but that required major rehabilitation of the base and surfacing due to stabilisation cracks and deterioration during the first four years of its life. The base was reworked through the addition of bitumen emulsion and a new surfacing added during 1974. For the past 30 years the section has received more than 11. 5 million standard 80 kN <b>axles,</b> and the <b>performance</b> during this period was excellent. Very little rutting or cracking is visible on the surfacing of the section. Recently, Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) was conducted on the section to determine the ultimate failure condition and bearing capacity of the pavement. During this test, more than 30 million additional standard 80 kN axles were applied to the pavement with little deterioration. The history and background to the test section are provided in the paper, followed by a description of the pavement structure. The pavement design parameters are discussed and performance data provided. Finally, the reasons for the good performance of this specific pavement are assessed, from which principles for perpetual / long-life pavements could be developed.

40|$|At present time, {{the brake}} test bench conducts the braking and {{suspension}} tests of front or rear axles {{and the test}} results are evaluated through one axle. The purpose of the brake testing system is to determine braking force and damping coefficient dissymmetry of one axle.

For this reason, the effects of different braking and damping forces applied by right and left wheels of both <b>axles</b> on braking <b>performance</b> of all vehicle are not determined due to available algorithm of the test bench. Also, the other brake failures are not occurred due to the algorithm of brake test system. In this study, the interface has been developed to determine the other effects of dissymmetry and the other brake failures by using the one axle results of brake test bench. The interface has algorithm computing the parameters according to the interaction between front and rear axles by only using measured test results. Also, it gives the warnings by comparing changes in the parameters with braking performance rules. Braking and suspension tests of three different vehicles have been conducted by using brake test bench to determine {{the performance of the}} algorithm.

Engine choices were down to three: the 225 cu in slant-6, the 318 cu in V-8, and a performance oriented 340 cu in V-8 which was equipped with a 4-barrel carb, performance camshaft, heads and dual exhausts. All three were detuned to lower compression ratios in order to run on lead-free gasoline, and the horsepower ratings were lowered to reflect the more accurate Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) net hp calculations.

5000|$|As for {{the rest}} of the Firebird line, GM made a new dual {{catalytic}} converter exhaust system (RPO code N10) available, freeing up 13% more power from some LB9- and L98-equipped Formulas and Trans Ams; so equipped, LB9 engine output was increased to 225 hp while the L98 increased to 235 hp. The N10 option remained available throughout the balance of the Third Generation production run, however the L98 powerplant was only available with an automatic transmission, whereas the LB9/N10 combination could only be coupled to a 5-speed manual (RPO code MM5) and a limited-slip differential (RPO code G80) using a 3.45 <b>performance</b> <b>axle</b> ratio (RPO code GM3). According to a March 1990 (Vol. 35, No. 9) Car and Driver article, when the latter set of options were combined into the relatively unassuming (and 300-pounds-lighter) Formula body, which shared the same WS6 suspension with the top-end Trans Am GTA, it created a [...] "sleeper" [...] Firebird that could out-perform the heavier Trans Am GTA (even when equipped with the L98 engine) - at a roughly 30% lower sticker price.

Although not an exhaustive comparison, these claims would seem to be supported by a simple examination of the weight-to-power ratios of both models: a 225 hp Formula at a curb weight of 3300 lb versus a 235 hp Trans Am GTA at a curb weight of 3600 lb; the weight-to-power ratio for the Formula is 14.67 lb/hp compared to 15.32 lb/hp for the Trans Am GTA. According to the same Car and Driver article, very few of these [...] "sleeper" [...] Formulas hit the streets; only about 50 were built each model year, as almost all LB9-equipped Formulas came with an automatic transmission - which disqualified them from receiving the high-performance N10 and GM3 options.|$|R
40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has {{developed}} and patented methods to weigh slowly moving vehicles. We {{have used this}} technology to produce a portable weigh-in-motion system that is robust and accurate. This report documents {{the performance of the}} second-generation portable weigh-in-motion prototype (WIM Gen II). The results of three modes of weight determination are compared in this report: WIM Gen II dynamic mode, WIM Gen II stop-and-go mode, and static (parked) mode on in-ground, static scales. The WIM dynamic mode measures axle weights as the vehicle passes over the system at speeds of 3 to 7 miles per hour (1. 3 to 3. 1 meters/second). The WIM stop-and-go mode measures the weight of each axle of the vehicle as the axles are successively positioned on a side-by-side pair of WIM measurement pads. In both measurement modes the center of balance (CB) and the total weight are obtained by a straight-forward calculation from axle weights and <b>axle</b> spacings. The <b>performance</b> metric is measurement error (in percent), which is defined as 100 x (sample standard deviation) /(average); see Appendix A for details. We have insufficient data to show that this metric is predictive. This report details the results of weight measurements performed in May 2005 at two sites using different types of vehicles at each site. In addition to the weight measurements, the testing enabled refinements to the test methodology and facilitated an assessment of the influence of vehicle speed on the dynamic-mode measurements. The initial test at the National Transportation Research Center in Knoxville, TN, involved measurements of passenger and light-duty commercial vehicles. A subsequent test at the Arrival/Departure Airfield Control Group (A/DACG) facility in Ft. Bragg, NC, involved military vehicles with gross weights between 3, 000 and 75, 000 pounds (1, 356 to 33, 900 kilograms) with a 20, 000 -pound (9, 040 kilograms) limit per axle. For each vehicle, four or more separate measurements were done using each weighing mode. WIM dynamic, WIM stop-and-go, and static-mode scale measurements were compared for total vehicle weight and the weight of the individual axles. We made WIM dynamic mode measurements with three assemblages of weight-transducer pads to assess the performance with varying numbers (2, 4, and 6) of weigh pads. Percent error in the WIM dynamic mode was 0. 51 %, 0. 37 %, and 0. 37 % for total vehicle weight and 0. 77 %, 0. 50 %, and 0. 47 % for single-axle weight for the two-, four-, and six-pad systems, respectively. Errors in the WIM stop-and-go mode were 0. 55 % for total vehicle weight and 0. 62 % for single-axle weights. In-ground scales weighed these vehicles with an error of 0. 04 % (within Army specifications) for total vehicle weight, and an error of 0. 86 % for single-axle weight. These results show that (1) the WIM error in single-axle weight was less than that obtained from in-ground static scales; (2) the WIM system eliminates time-consuming manual procedures, human errors, and safety concerns; and (3) measurement error for the WIM prototype was less than 1 % (within Army requirements for this project). All the tests were performed on smooth, dry, level, concrete surfaces. Tests under non-ideal surface conditions are needed (e. g., rough but level, sun-baked asphalt, wet pavement), and future work will test WIM performance under these conditions. However, we expect the performance will be as good as, if not better than, the present WIM performance. We recommend the WIM stop-and-go mode under non-ideal surface conditions. We anticipate no performance degradation, assuming no subsurface deformation occurs...|$|R
