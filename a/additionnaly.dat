In one paper, Ślopek describes the effect phages had on his patients suffering from Sepsis caused by bacterial infections. Between the years 1981-1986, five hundred and fifty cases [...] were treated, all aged from 1 to 86. The treatment began with antibiotics, however, {{they turned out to}} be inefficient for five hundred and eighteen patients. Therapy began by isolating the phages to form the etiologic agents which was then administrated to the patients. The treatment could be taken either orally (phages were given 3 times a day before eating after the patient had received the necessities to neutralise gastric acids) or locally (application on wounds or cavities of a moist containing phages). <b>Additionnaly</b> drops of the etiologic serum could be dropped on the eyes. In case the bacterias became resistant the phages were replaced by newly selected phages.|$|E

The measured acoustic field is decomposed as the sum of a diffuse field and a source field, using a priori knowledge on these field, i. e. structured sparsity deduced from the governing equations of acoustics. Simulations and experimental results in 2 D domains, using greedy algorithms as well as optimisation-based methods, show that the method is robust with respect to noise and sensors localisation. <b>Additionnaly,</b> the density of sensors required can be lower than the Nyquist frequency. These facts make this method a interesting alternative to standard localisation methods particularly when {{a large number of}} narrowband sensors are deployed...|$|E

40|$|Distal {{acquired}} demyelinating symmetric (DADS) neuropathy is clinically characterised by distal {{motor and}} sensory disturbances. Typically DADS {{does not respond}} or responds poorly to intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). We report {{the case of a}} 58 -year-old patient who developed distal paraparesis. Serum electrophoresis demonstrated monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia having an anti-GM 1 but no anti-MAG activity. Conduction velocities showed demyelinating pattern. Work-up excluded a lymphoproliferative disorder After IVIg treatment we observed a clinical and neurophysiological improvement. Regarding these peculiar findings, we suggest that DADS needs to be splitted in several forms determined among others by clinical, neurophysiological and antiganglioside profile and therapeutic response. We advocate to perform systematic antiganglioside antibodies assay <b>additionnaly</b> to anti-MAG when DADS is suspected in order to improve dysimmune neuropathies classification.

It uses template-programming techniques {{together with}} code-generation. The achieved performances shows some {{advantage over the}} state-of-the art dynamic library RBDL mostly on ATOM processor and for the inertia matrix computation, which are relevant for robotics application. On recent desktop computer, {{the ratio of the}} gain is not so obvious and in general the time achieved by both library is not significantly different for inverse dynamics. The advantage of this library is that it is open-source and does not rely on any external symbolic computational software. A main drawback is the increase complexity in debugging the code source due to template programming. <b>Additionnaly</b> we show how it can help in current control problems for humanoid robots, and more specifically for dynamic filtering of walking gait trajectories...|$|E
40|$|Restoring images {{degraded}} by spatially varying blur is {{a problem}} encountered in many disciplines such as astrophysics, computer vision or biomedical imaging. Blurring operators are modelled using integral operators with some regularity and decrease conditions on the kernel. Recently, we studied the approximation of these operators in wavelet bases in which operators are highly compressible. They also allow to fastly compute matrix-vector products with a complexity O(Nϵ^-d/M) for a precision ϵ in spectral norm, where N {{is the number of}} pixels of a d-dimensional image and M describes the kernel regularity. <b>Additionnaly,</b> we have shown that the sparsity pattern of the matrix can be pre-defined. We exploit these results to study the estimation/reconstruction of the operator from the knwoledge of few point spread functions located at arbitrary positions in the image domain.

Gb – Dynamic properties Abstract. - In this paper {{we report on}} zero field cooled magnetization relaxation experiments on a concentrated frozen ferrofluid exhibiting a low temperature superspin glass transition. Using a method initially developped for spin glasses {{we are able to}} extract the dynamical correlation length and its time dependence from the Zeeman coupling between the applied magnetic field and the typical number of correlated spins participating in the dynamics. Our results are in general agreement with the expressions obtained for spin glasses and extend the generality of these behaviors to the class of superspin glasses. <b>Additionnaly,</b> since the typical flipping time for thermally activated dynamics over the anisotropy barrier is much larger for superspins than for atomic spins our experiments are probing a time regime which is much closer to that probed in numerical simulations.

40|$|In this research, key {{determinants}} of expected short-term export performance improvement are identified. We develop {{a conceptual framework}} that incorporates past, current and expected performance, internal and external forces of the firm, and pricing strategy adaptation to the foreign market. The framework is tested via a field survey of industrial exporters. Surprisingly, findings reveal {{that the effect of}} firms commitment to exporting on expected short-term export performance improvement is negative. More importantly, findings indicate that past export intensity has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between export intensity increase and expected short-term export performance improvement. Similarly, the relationship between external market forces and expected short-term export performance improvement is moderated by the level of past export satisfaction. <b>Additionnaly,</b> findings suggest that for {{a better understanding of the}} effects of pricing strategy change on export performance, particular attention should be given to the moderating effects of previous experience with past pricing strategies. These and other surprising results have important implications for both public policy and management decision-making, and suggest several potentially fruitful streams for global marketing research of industrial products. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the Polynomial Linear Equivalence (PLE) Problem {{which is the}} problem of finding two linear transformations S and T such that B = T ◦ A ◦ S given two vectors of multivariate {{quadratic}} polynomials A and B. This problem is interesting since it is related to the problem of recovering the secret key of some multivariate cryptographic schemes given only the public key. <b>Additionnaly,</b> the problem is known to be Graph-Isomorphism hard. We show that pencils of matrices and pencils of quadratic forms are convenient tools to tackle these problems. Pencils have been studied since the 19 th century by Weierstrass and Kronecker to solve calculus problems, such as finding extrema of some functions. Here, we efficiently solve classes of PLE instances arising from cryptographic schemes. We also show {{that in the case of}} the SFLASH cryptosystem, the vectors lying in the kernel of the bilinear symmetric form associated with a pencil of two public polynomials reveal enough information about the secret elements to recover them in polynomial-time, even when very little public information is available. This allows us to break the full range of parameters for SFLASH. 1...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the SIGMA plan, Flemish authorities (Waterways and Maritime Affairs Administration, division Sea Scheldt) plan a large controlled inundation area (CIA) in polders (Kruibeke-Bazel-Rupelmonde, 578 ha) along the freshwater - oligohaline border of the Scheldt estuary. Beside fulfilling an important role in enhancing safety against flooding, a CIA could contribute to the restoration of degraded ecosystem functions and habitats by implementing specific management options. However, as the outcome of some management types on ecosystem structures and functions are still uncertain, preliminary projects on a smaller scale must yield adequate information to allow, if necessary, appropriate adaptations. In the pilot project ‘Lippensbroek’, a management scenario for {{the northern part of the}} future Kruibeke-Bazel-Rupelmonde CIA will therefore be tested beforehand on an innerdike area of 10 ha. Carefully designed sluices will allow the exchange of limited amounts of Scheldt water, causing a semidiurnal submersion of ca. 0. 5 m. <b>Additionnaly,</b> submersions with larger water quantities will occur on a less regular base during storm floods. We discuss the present and future hydrologic regime of the Lippensbroek polder, together with the necessity of a multidisciplinary program to monitor the restoration of ecosystem structures (fresh water tidal marshes, mudflats, creeks, etc.) and functions (nutrient cycling, storage capacity enhancement, sediment retention, biodiversity and habitat support, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|Study Objective: {{to assess}} the {{efficacy}} and safety of different combinations of antiemetic drugs and adjuvants as part of anesthetic care in prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in oncological patients. Materials and methods: 165 patients who undergone surgical treatment for female oncological diseases on the II—III stages with common anaesthesia were included. Depending on the scheme of postoperative nausea and vomiting prevention participants were divided into 4 groups. Patients from group С (comparative, n= 43) received treatment with ondansetron (8 mg) and dexamethasone (8 mg) in the induction stage. Patients from group E (n= 40) <b>additionnaly</b> received continuous infusion of esmolol 0, 59 ± 0, 94 mg/kg/h. Patients from group D (n= 41) on the traumatic stage of operation received bolus of intravenous droperidol 0, 038 ± 0, 055 mg/kg. Patients from group K (n= 41) on the traumatic stage of operation received bolus of intravenous of clonidine 0, 0013 ± 0, 0004 mg/kg. Postoperative nausea and vomiting episodes were monitored during 24 hours after the surgery. Results: in group С postoperative nausea and vomiting developed in 15 patients from 43 (34, 9 %). In group E this complication was detected in 8 from 40 patients (20 %). In group D &# 8211; in 8 from 41 patients (19, 5 %). Groups E and D did not have statistically significant differences from group С {{in terms of the}} frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting. In group С this complication was detected in 6 from 41 patients with the rate of 14, 6 % which is significantly lower than in group С (p= 0. 03). The intensity of the nausea and vomiting was lower in groups E,D, and K as compared with group С. Conclusion: the inclusion of clonidine in scheme of postoperative nausea and vomiting prevention lead to statistically significant decrease of the frequency of this complication. Administration of esmolol and droperidol leads to decrease of postoperative nausea and vomiting intensity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of radar altimetry over rivers along the past 20 years {{has shown a}} strong potential to provide hydrologist with valuable information on river water level dynamics. The {{development of}} new sensors and satellite mission concepts such as spatial interferometry or temporal interferometry opens midterm (10 -­ 20 years) perspectives for the spatialized measurement of river surface variables such as width W, water level Z, surface slope Is and surface velocity Vs. Although not as accurate as in situ measurements can be, satellite measurements would ensure exhaustive and homogeneous global coverages, and provide repetitive and near real time information on these variables. Therefore a key question arises for hydrologists : assuming the availability of satellite measured river surface variables, with known uncertainty levels, {{would it be possible}} to estimate river discharge without any in situ measurement, and what would be the resulting uncertainty on discharge estimate? We developed a method to estimate river bottom parameters (river bottom elevation Zb, bottom slope Ib, velocity profile coefficient α and Manning coefficient n) from a time series of synchronous surface variable measurements (W(ti), Z(ti), Is(ti), Vs(ti)) (ti i= 1 [...] N) realized on a given river section at different stages along the hydrological cycle. The method relies on the forcing of equality (or minimization of deviation) between two expressions of the river discharge : velocity integration on the section and Manning head loss equation. Various criteria have been developed based on the quadratic difference between these two expressions, and minimization techniques have been tested and optimized to estimate the river bottom parameters. The method has been implemented both on simulated data (without noise or with added measurement noise), and on real data (Amazon river). <b>Additionnaly,</b> the robustness of the method to surface variable uncertainty has been explored. A simplified version of the method, with fixed value of the Manning coefficient,results in a 8 % discharge estimation with a 25 % standard deviation over the Amazon dataset (12 stations). The full method, while giving relevant estimates of river bottom parameters and river discharge on exact simulated data and on some in situ gauging stations, leads to inaccurate results on most of in situ gauging stations as well as on simulated data with significant measurement noise. Current works are dedicated to improve its robustness...|$|E
