40|$|A {{process has}} been {{developed}} for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated, fine textured; solid wastes so that the treated material will meet EPA's TCLP and Total Extractable Metal Limits. The process involves the formation of strong aggregates using dry agglomeration methods. Remediation is achieved either by incorporating metal fixation agents into the agglomerates, or by leaching of heavy metal and other soluble salts by percolation through a packed bed of agglomerated soil. The handling problems encountered during solid liquid separations in conventional soil washing are overcome by agglomerating the fine textured solids. The newly developed process {{was applied to the}} remediation of a fine textured soil sample from a Dupont site contaminated with lead and a sediment from the Coeur d'Alene river, contaminated with Pb, Cd, and Zn. Because of low hydraulic flow-rates leaching of metals from unagglomerated solids was slow. The removal of metals from <b>agglomerated</b> <b>feed</b> occurred on the time scale of hours compared to days for the original materials. Batch column extraction studies showed that HCl, EDTA and citric acid were effective extractants for the removal of lead from the agglomerated material. The results of this study demonstrate that NRC's remediation process is suitable for the remediation of contaminated soil or soil like materials and has potential for commercialization.

[...] However the centrifugal force and vibration and acts to prevent aperture blockage and <b>agglomerated</b> particle formation. <b>Feed</b> particles {{are classified as}} fine, near-sized and oversized particles; most near-sized and fines pass through the aperture rapidly. The ratio of fine and near-size particles to oversize should be maximized to obtain high screening rates.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a scenario of Titan 2 ̆ 7 s formation matching the constraints imposed by its current atmospheric composition. Assuming that the abundances of all elements, including oxygen, are solar {{in the outer}} nebula, we show that the icy planetesimals were <b>agglomerated</b> in the <b>feeding</b> zone of Saturn from a mixture of clathrates with multiple guest species, so-called stochiometric hydrates such as ammonia hydrate, and pure condensates. We also use a statistical thermodynamic approach to constrain the composition of multiple guest clathrates formed in the solar nebula. We then infer that krypton and xenon, {{that are expected to}} condense in the 20 - 30 K temperature range in the solar nebula, are trapped in clathrates at higher temperatures than 50 K. Once formed, these ices either were accreted by Saturn or remained embedded in its surrounding subnebula until they found their way into the regular satellites growing around Saturn. In order to explain the carbon monoxide and primordial argon deficiencies of Titan 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere, we suggest that the satellite was formed from icy planetesimals initially produced in the solar nebula and that were partially devolatilized at a temperature not exceeding 50 K during their migration within Saturn 2 ̆ 7 s subnebula. The observed deficiencies of Titan 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere in krypton and xenon could result from other processes that may have occurred both prior to or after the completion of Titan. Thus, krypton and xenon may have been sequestrated in the form of XH+ 3 complexes in the solar nebula gas phase, causing the formation of noble gas-poor planetesimals ultimately accreted by Titan. Alternatively, krypton and xenon may have also been trapped efficiently in clathrates located on the satellite 2 ̆ 7 s surface or in its atmospheric haze. We finally discuss the subsequent observations that would allow us to determine which of these processes is the most likely...|$|R
