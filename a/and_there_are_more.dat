25|$|Concerning {{the longest}} passage of anapaestic septenarii (Miles Gloriosus 1011-93), Moore notes the close {{resemblance}} between the metre {{in this passage}} and trochaic septenarii. The German classicist Marcus Deufert notes that the style of writing in these lines {{is different from the}} usual anapaests, in that it is more regular <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> long syllables. He draws the conclusion that the lines from Miles Gloriosus were recited {{in the same way as}} trochaic septenarii, while other anapaestic passages (which usually contain an admixture of other metres) were sung.|$|E
25|$|In Classical Latin, stress changed. It {{moved from}} the first {{syllable}} {{to one of the}} last three syllables, called the antepenult, the penult, and the ultima (short for antepaenultima 'before almost last', paenultima 'almost last', and ultima syllaba 'last syllable'). Its position is determined by the syllable weight of the penult. If the penult is heavy, it is accented; if the penult is light <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> than two syllables, the antepenult is accented. In a few words originally accented on the penult, accent is on the ultima because the two last syllables have been contracted, or the last syllable has been lost.|$|E
25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they {{have to take into account}} the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Prof. Jacques Gutwirth {{estimated}} {{there were}} some 400,000 men, women, and children adhering to Hasidic sects worldwide, and that figure was expected to grow due to high birth rates of Hasidic Jews. About 200,000, he assumed, lived in the State of Israel, another 150,000 in the United States, and further 50,000 were scattered around the world, especially in Britain, but also in Antwerp, Montreal, Vienna, and other centers. In Israel, the largest Hasidic concentrations are in the Ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods of Jerusalem – including Ramot Alon, Batei Ungarin et cetera – in the cities of Bnei Brak and El'ad, and in the West Bank settlements of Modi'in Illit and Beitar Illit. There is considerable presence in other specifically Orthodox municipalities or enclaves, like Kiryat Sanz, Netanya. In the United States, most Hasidim reside in New York and New Jersey, though there are small communities across the entire country. In Brooklyn, Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights all house a particularly large population. So does the hamlet of Monsey in upstate New York. In the same region, New Square, Monroe, and Kiryas Joel are rapidly growing all-Hasidic enclaves, one founded by the Skver dynasty and the other by Satmar. In Britain, Stamford Hill {{is home to the}} largest Hasidic community in the country, and there are others in London and Prestwich in Manchester. In Canada, Kiryas Tosh is a settlement populated entirely by Tosh Hasidim, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> adherents of other sects in and around Montreal.|$|E

Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Kavanagh into the house for her (because her father might disapprove) and a friend lent her Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre in late 1849. Jane Eyres influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him [...] "Carlo" [...] after the character St. John Rivers' dog.

Its architectural styles are Decorated and Perpendicular. The tower is in three stages with angle buttresses.

500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} Quatermass 2 {{in the years}} since its release remains divided. Writing in Science Fiction in the Cinema, John Baxter found the film “a {{faithful}} but ponderous adaptation of Kneale's TV sequel. There are effective sequences, director Guest and cameraman Gerald Gibbs shooting with light lancing up through the shadows in a manner reminiscent of Jacques Tourneur's Night (or Curse) of the Demon. Otherwise the film is indifferent”. Similarly, John Brosnan, in his book The Primal Screen, wrote that “Quatermass 2 isn't as good as the first one, despite a bigger budget. Again the theme is possession (all four Quatermass stories are variations on the same theme) with Kneale again cleverly mixing sf with the supernatural. The alien invasion may be sf but it is presented with the trappings of traditional horror, such as the V-shaped [...] "mark of the devil" [...] that all possessed people display”. On the other hand, Bill Warren, in Keep Watching The Skies!, found Quatermass 2 to be “one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s. It is not notably better than , but the story idea is more involving, the production is livelier <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> events in the unfolding of the story”. Kim Newman in 1986 praised the film as [...] "extraordinary" [...] and, comparing it to Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Newman notes that while Don Siegel’s film is [...] "a general allegory" [...] about dehumanisation and conformity, Quatermass 2 is “a specific attack on the Conservative Government of the time, down to the inclusion of several characters obviously based on real political figures”.|$|E
