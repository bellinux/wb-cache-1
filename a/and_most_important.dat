5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Roskilde became a market town but it was {{certainly}} enjoying trading privileges under King Eric II who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were firmly established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268.

5|$|A {{critical}} and commercial success in 1990, Fear of a Black Planet sold two {{million copies in}} the United States and received rave reviews from critics, many of whom named {{it one of the}} year's best albums.

Since then, it has been viewed as one of hip hop's greatest <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2003, Fear of a Black Planet was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2005, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry.|$|E

5|$|After the military, {{the second}} largest <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> {{industry}} for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports.

In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and {{is home to the}} world's largest and fastest container cranes. Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
