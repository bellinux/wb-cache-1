5|$|Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull {{recognized}} {{a need for}} an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars.

5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit <b>around</b> <b>their</b> stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness {{can be interpreted}} as planets whose orbits move in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|E

5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled <b>around</b> <b>their</b> face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled <b>around</b> <b>their</b> backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|Maya warriors entered {{battle against}} the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. Members of the Maya {{aristocracy}} wore quilted cotton armour, and some warriors of lesser rank wore twisted rolls of cotton wrapped <b>around</b> <b>their</b> bodies. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the Sun at a semi-major axis {{greater than that of}} Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood <b>around</b> <b>their</b> orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E

5|$|Prior to European settlement, the {{indigenous}} Noongar {{people had a}} considerable network of tracks <b>around</b> <b>their</b> territory in the south-west of Western Australia. One such track, used as a trade route, linked the Swan River (in modern-day Perth) with the area now known as Albany. The track followed a similar alignment to modern-day Albany Highway.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 100,000 British and German {{troops were}} {{involved}} in the unofficial cessations of hostility along the Western Front. The first truce started on Christmas Eve 1914, when German troops decorated the area <b>around</b> <b>their</b> trenches in the region of Ypres, Belgium and particularly in Saint-Yvon (called Saint-Yves, in Plugstreet/Ploegsteert – Comines-Warneton), where Capt. Bruce Bairnsfather described the truce.|$|E

5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, skirts and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy {{families}} could wear purple scarves <b>around</b> <b>their</b> shoulders. The main difference in women's apparel from that of men was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps <b>around</b> <b>their</b> upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn <b>around</b> <b>their</b> necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
