40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of osmotic stress on forage sorghum varieties at critical stage of germination to salinity stress. A study was conducted at the Seed Technology Laboratory of Mansoura University, Egypt during April to June 2012. Three forage sorghum cultivars (Mabrouk, Horas, Pionner- 8581) were evaluated in the salinity concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 dSm- 1 NaCl. Four parameters namely final germination percentage, germination index, energy of germination and seedling vigour index were estimated. Eight seedling characters namely shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> length, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> foliage weight, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> dry weight, seedling height reduction and relative seedling dry weight were measured. Forage sorghum cultivars significantly varied in means of final germination percentage, germination index, seedling vigor index, energy of germination, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> lengths, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> fresh weights, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> dry weights, seedling height reduction and relative dry weight. Horas cultivar surpassed other cultivars {{in all of the}} studied characters followed by Mabrouk cultivar which came in the second rank, while Pioneer 858 cultivar came in the last rank. Pioneer 858 cultivar recorded highest values of seedling height reduction and relative dry weight followed by Mabrouk cultivar, while, Horas cultivar came in the last rank for both characters. Increasing salinity levels from 0 to 15 dSm- 1 significantly decreased germination percentage, germination index, seedling vigor index, energy of germination, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> lengths, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> fresh weights, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> dry weights <b>and</b> relative dry weight, the control treatment recorded the highest averages of these characters. Thus, the lowest averages of these characters were recorded with highest salinity levels i. e. 15 dSm- 1. Seedling height reduction percentage was increased significantly with increasing salinity levels from 0 to 15 dSm- 1. Results clearly showed that germination index, seedling vigor index, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> lengths, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> fresh weights, shoot <b>and</b> <b>root</b> dry weights, seedling height reduction and relative dry weight significantly affected by the interaction between forage sorghum cultivars and salinity concentrations.

40|$|Background: Evaluate the {{adjunctive}} use {{of locally}} delivered green tea catechin with scaling <b>and</b> <b>root</b> planing, {{as compared to}} scaling <b>and</b> <b>root</b> planing alone {{in the management of}} chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with two sites in the contralateral quadrants with probing pocket depth of 5 − 8 mm were selected. Each of the sites was assessed for the plaque index, gingival index, and probing pocket depth at baseline and 21 days and for microbiological analysis at baseline, 1 week and 21 days. Test sites received scaling <b>and</b> <b>root</b> planing along with green tea catechin strips and control sites received scaling <b>and</b> <b>root</b> planning alone. Results: The result showed intercomparison of the plaque index and gingival index for test and control groups at 21 days was not significant with P> 0. 05, whereas the probing depth at 21 days was significant with P< 0. 001. Intercomparison between microbial results demonstrated a considerable reduction of occurrence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium species and Capnocytophaga in test.

5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
5|$|Carabane, {{also known}} as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme {{south-west}} of Senegal, {{in the mouth of}} the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> of the mangrove trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of Ziguinchor Region, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a dry season and a wet season. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are mangos and oranges. Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims A {{number of}} <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits have been {{proposed}} as important for acquisition of P. However, it remains unknown whether these traits are most important in determining macro- and micronutrient uptake at low soil fertility. This study investigated the variations in <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits among spring wheat genotypes <b>and</b> examined which <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits are most important for high uptake of macro- and micronutrients. Methods Six spring wheat genotypes were grown in a soil with low nutrient availability. The <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits {{as well as the}} content of macro- and micronutrients were identified. Results A significant genetic variability in <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits was found. High <b>root</b> growth vigour <b>and</b> long <b>and</b> dense <b>root</b> hairs enhanced uptake of macro- and micronutrients under low soil nutrient availability. Root growth vigour, however, was a better predictor of early nutrient acquisition than <b>root</b> hair length <b>and</b> density. Conclusions Selection and breeding for high <b>root</b> growth vigour <b>and</b> long <b>and</b> dense <b>root</b> hairs is a promising strategy to ensure efficient acquisition of both macro- and micronutrients in the early establishment of spring wheat in nutrient-limited soil and low nutrient input cropping systems. ...|$|R

5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders {{and consume}} {{a range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part of}} the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks in a circle around the doublegree (Emex australis) to twist out and remove the underground parts.|$|E
5|$|Equines are {{monogastric}} hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to ruminants, equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E

5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E
5|$|The eggs may be {{deposited}} singly or {{in small}} groups, or may {{take the form of}} spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings.
