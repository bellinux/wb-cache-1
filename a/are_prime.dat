5|$|Copper's {{superior}} conductivity {{enhances the}} efficiency of electrical motors. This is important because motors and motor-driven systems account for 43%–46% of all global electricity consumption and 69% of all electricity used by industry. Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases {{the efficiency of}} the motor. Copper motor rotors, a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings <b>are</b> <b>prime</b> design objectives, are enabling general-purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium efficiency standards.|$|E
5|$|The Brezhnev generation— {{the people}} who lived and worked during the Brezhnev Era— owed their rise to {{prominence}} to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the late 1930s. In the purge, Stalin ordered the execution or exile of nearly all Soviet bureaucrats over the age of 35, thereby opening up posts and offices for a younger generation of Soviets. This generation would rule the country from the aftermath of Stalin's purge up to Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985. The majority of these appointees were of either peasant or working class origin. Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kosygin, and Brezhnev <b>are</b> <b>prime</b> examples of men appointed in the aftermath of Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E

50|$|In number theory, a provable <b>prime</b> <b>is</b> {{an integer}} {{that has been}} {{calculated}} to <b>be</b> <b>prime</b> using a primality-proving algorithm. Contrast with probable <b>prime,</b> which <b>is</b> likely (but not certain) to <b>be</b> <b>prime,</b> based on the output of a probabilistic primality test. In principle, every <b>prime</b> number can <b>be</b> proved to <b>be</b> <b>prime</b> in polynomial time by using the AKS primality test. In practice, other methods which guarantee that their result <b>is</b> <b>prime,</b> but which do not work for all <b>primes,</b> <b>are</b> useful for the random generation of provable primes.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the Plantagenet era an English Gothic {{architecture}} flourished—the medieval cathedrals such as Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and York Minster <b>are</b> <b>prime</b> examples. Expanding on the Norman base {{there was}} also castles, palaces, great houses, universities and parish churches. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century Tudor style; the four-centred arch, {{now known as the}} Tudor arch, was a defining feature as were wattle and daub houses domestically. In the aftermath of the Renaissance a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity, synthesised with Christianity appeared—the English Baroque style, architect Christopher Wren was particularly championed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, <b>are</b> <b>prime</b> examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-6th century, the {{introduction}} of Buddhism from Korea (Baekje) to Japan resulted in a revival of Japanese sculpture. Buddhist monks, artisans and scholars settled around the capital in Yamato Province (present day Nara Prefecture) and passed their techniques to native craftsmen. Consequently, early Japanese sculptures from the Asuka and Hakuhō periods show strong influences of continental art, which initially were characterized by almond-shaped eyes, upward-turned crescent-shaped lips and symmetrically arranged folds in the clothing. The workshop of the Japanese sculptor Tori Busshi, who was strongly influenced by the Northern Wei style, produced works which exemplify such characteristics. The Shakyamuni triad and the Guze Kannon at Hōryū-ji <b>are</b> <b>prime</b> examples. By the late 7th century, wood replaced bronze and copper. By the early Tang dynasty, greater realism was expressed by fuller forms, long narrow slit eyes, softer facial features, flowing garments and embellishments with ornaments such as bracelets and jewels. Two prominent examples of sculptures of this period are the Shō Kannon at Yakushi-ji and the Yumechigai Kannon at Hōryū-ji.|$|E
