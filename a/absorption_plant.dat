Modeling and simulation of such plants have achieved an interesting place in research, and several steady state models already exist.

A dynamic model for the absorption column in a CO 2 removal plant is been developed. Usability of simple thermodynamics for modeling is checked with the development of this model, instead of using complex thermodynamic models which are very popular in recent research.

In order to remove 87 % of CO 2 from the flue gas stream generated from a 750 MW supercritical {{coal-fired power plant}} and produce a CO 2 concentration of 95 % in the CO 2 product stream, a post-combustion CO 2 capture plant with three absorbers and two strippers are needed,. A decentralized control structure composed of 11 proportional- integral (PI) controllers was proposed to maintain the dynamic operability of this commercial-scale CO 2 capture plant. The evaluation of the plant's performance in closed-loop were conducted using multiple scenarios, i. e., the loss of CO 2 recovery (%CC) control loop during variation of flue gas flow rate, a positive ramp change in the flue gas flow rate under a maximum withdrawal constraint on the reboilers’ heat duty, and the disturbance in the flue gas composition resulting from the variation in coal composition and air flow rate.

40|$|Abstract]: Non-point {{source water}} {{pollution}} of waterways {{is a significant}} environmental problem throughout the Fitzroy Basin. Grazing being the major land use (i. e. about 88 {{percent of the land}} area in the region), it is also the major source of pollutants, including sediment and nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus). The effect of livestock grazing, and the need for the restoration of the riparian vegetation zones along the waterways to reduce nutrient and sediment inputs is being recommended. Maintaining riparian zone vegetation is also crucial for the water quality of the catchment as well as the GBR lagoon. Riparian buffer zones can improve and maintain water quality by filtering sediment, nutrients, organic mater, and pesticides from surface and groundwater flow, through the processes of deposition, <b>absorption,</b> <b>plant</b> uptake, and denitrification. It can effectively reduce the amount of sediment reaching streams and rivers. A relatively large body of studies exists that support the use of riparian buffer strips to manage nutrients and sediments. While it is well recognized that buffer zones have great potential to improve water quality and enhance riparian biodiversity, however how best to realize this potential is still a matter of considerable debate. In many occasions, a patchwork of policies and initiatives featuring either a regulatory or marketbased or a mixture of regulatory and voluntary approaches have developed to encourage the protection/establishment of riparian buffer zones. In this report, the importance of riparian zones in reducing sediment and nutrient loads into the receiving waters are described and a review of on-ground initiatives in the region is made...|$|E

This paper presents the development and validation of an ANN model of a CO 2 capture plant. An evaluation of the concept is made of the usefulness of the ANN model as well as a discussion of its feasibility for further integration into a conventional heat and mass balance programme. It is shown that the trained ANN model can reproduce the results of a rigorous process simulator in fraction of the simulation time. A multilayer feed-forward form of Artificial Neural Network was used to capture and model the non-linear relationship between inputs and outputs of the CO 2 capture process. The data used for training and validation of the ANN were obtained using the process simulator CO 2 SIM. The ANN model was trained by performing fully automatic batch simulations using CO 2 SIM over the entire range of actual operation for an amine based <b>absorption</b> <b>plant.</b> The trained model was then used for finding the optimum operation for the example plant with respect to lowest possible specific steam duty and maximum CO 2 capture rate.

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{screening}} apparatus of CO 2 absorption {{has been applied}} to test the absorption characteristics for mixed systems. The main absorption characteristics of absorbents for CO 2 removal are the absorption rate and the absorption capacity of CO 2. The goal for this thesis was to find a solvent mixture system that will form two phases after 95 % of absorption. The results of both the screening and the VLE measurements are compared with the generally more used 5 M (30 mass %) monoethanolamine (MEA) solution. The mixture of the tertiary amine n-tert-butyldiethanolamine (N-tBDEA) and the diamine diaminopropane (DAP) with a concentration of 3, 5 and 2 moles/litre, respectively, gave two phases. It was not observed an increase in the lower phase as expected when the CO 2 partial pressure increases. It was not investigated further. The mixture of the tertiary amine Diethylethanolamine (DEEA) and DAP was run at partial pressures of 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17 and 19 kPa of CO 2 at 40, 60 and 80 &# 176;C. It formed two phases after 95 % of absorption and the lower phase volume increased with increasing partial pressure. The 40 &# 176;C experiments obtained the highest loading and the cyclic capacity for the 10 kPa CO 2 partial pressure at 40 &# 176;C absorption and 80 &# 176;C desorption was 0, 110 and for MEA it is 0, 238. This is quite low. The highest absorption rate was obtained at 80 &# 176;C and 19 kPa. The lower phases from the screening were tested in a high-pressure vapour-liquid equilibrium for temperatures up to 120 &# 176;C to see how the total pressure changes, as this is an important factor for amine solvent selection.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 205 - 209. An {{extensive}} {{literature study}} {{on the subject of}} absorption refrigeration has revealed that there is no proven methodology {{that can be used to}} design, optimise and size a plant. On the contrary there are numerous methods which analyse the performance of an existing plant from collected data. These methods however, do not provide any means of predicting how the analysed plant would perform if one or more of its working conditions should change. This work provides a complete design for an ammonia-water absorption refrigeration plant. The ranges of the working conditions in the evaporator and condenser are from - 5 °C to - 55 °C and from 5 °C to 45 °C respectively. For any combination of temperatures within these ranges, the temperature of the generator is optimised for maximum performance of the plant. Depending on the refrigeration capacity, the components are sized and designed. The proper design of the various components takes into account both heat and mass transfer correlations, something which has not been considered in the past as a necessary step for absorption refrigeration machines. Literature indicates that there is a vast amount of research into the absorption of gases into liquids and two-phase flows through tubes of various sections. The correlations cited in these studies have been used in designing the absorption column, evaporator and generator. The proposed optimisation method is a novel approach in designing a plant and stems from the fact that the performance of the absorption refrigerator reaches a maximum at a specific generator temperature. For this, optimisation curves have been developed, which for a particular combination of evaporator and cooling environment temperatures, both the optimum generator temperature and the maximum performance of the plant are predicted. The equations used in the computerised simulation procedure are based on the well-established enthalpy-concentration chart for the ammonia-water mixtures. Thus the properties of the mixture at various points in the plant are accurately predicted. Published computerised procedures in the past have been proven inaccurate in predicting the properties of the mixtures at near pure-ammonia concentrations. The validity of the simulation model is verified by tests performed on a laboratory size <b>absorption</b> <b>plant.</b> The plant was built from design parameters predicted by the simulation model for a refrigeration capacity of 1 kW at -l 5 °C evaporator coil and 25 °C condensate temperatures.

40|$|Human {{lifespan}} {{has increased}} significantly in {{developed and developing}} countries, raising considerably the percentage of elderly people. Aging is an important risk factor {{for the development of}} age-related diseases and is associated with decreased cellular antioxidant defenses and impaired stress responses, reducing the ability of cells to cope with stress. Epidemiological studies indicate a direct relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and increased longevity as well as decreased mortality from chronic age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Antioxidant phytochemicals are proposed as bioactive compounds. However, due to their low bioavailability after intestinal <b>absorption,</b> <b>plant</b> bioactive compounds are likely to act not as direct antioxidants but rather through the modulation of proteins, gene expression and cell signaling pathways. As xenobiotics, we hypothesize that, by imposing mild stress on human cells, antioxidant phytochemicals may afford anti-aging properties through induction of stress responses and cellular antioxidant defenses. Our group, under the scope of the undergoing NaturAge project, is currently investigating this hypothesis, namely the ability of some plant extracts and isolated phytochemicals to induce antioxidant defenses through Nrf 2 /ARE signaling. That, by making use of biochemical and molecular tools, will be associated with possible anti-aging effects using normal human skin fibroblasts undergoing aging in vitro. Recently, we have shown the ability of the polyphenol curcumin to induce cellular antioxidant defenses through induction of a stress response in normal human skin fibroblasts, affording protection from a further oxidant challenge with tert-BOOH [1]. Curcumin incubation for 24 h induced heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) protein levels, GST activity, GSH levels and GSH/GSSG ratio. These effects were preceded by induction of oxidative stress as shown by increased levels of ROS and DNA damage, and impairment of the cells’ GSH redox state. The induction of antioxidant defenses in human fibroblasts was shown to be redox and PI 3 K/Akt dependent [1]. Replicative senescent cells possessed higher constitutive HO- 1 levels, and induction of HO- 1 by curcumin was considerably impaired. In conclusion, the induction of stress responses by curcumin in human skin fibroblasts, which resulted in protection against a subsequent stressor, supports the view that phytochemical-induced hormetic stimulation of cellular antioxidant defenses can be a useful approach toward anti-aging intervention.

40|$|Introduction: The most {{important}} problems of farmers in arid and semi-arid regions are adequate nutrition, optimum rooting, emergence, establishment and optimal density, and ultimately plant yield. Using grain priming and mycorrhizal inoculation is effective strategies in these conditions. Priming can cause earlier growth of seedling, to increase emergence rate, emergence percentage, plant {{tolerance to drought}} and salinity stress, early flowering {{as well as to}} increase {{the quality and quantity of}} yield and nutrient <b>absorption.</b> <b>Plant</b> hormones such as salicylic acid and gibberellic acid can be used for priming. Regarding plant response to environmental stresses, salicylic acid, which is an important signal molecule, plays a key role in the regulation of several physiological processes such as growth and plant development, absorption of ions, emergence and photosynthesis. Gibberellic acid (GA 3) has been shown to be involved in many physiological processes such as cell division activity of meristem regions, increase the cell length, emergence speed, and emergence percentage, seedling growth in field condition, early flowering and yield. Mycorrhizal inoculation increases the availability of nutrients especially plant phosphorus, concentrations of plant hormones (auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins), chlorophyll content, the efficiency of biological nitrogen fixation, assimilates allocation to host plant organs, the changes of root structure, and improve soil structure. Materials and Methods: In order to evaluate the response of lentil to grain priming (without grain priming, hydro-priming, 100 ppm gibberellic acid, 100 ppm salicylic acid, 100 ppm gibberellic acid + 100 ppm salicylic acid) and soil mycorrhizal inoculation (non-inoculated control, inoculated with Glomus moseae and Glomus intraradices), a factorial experiment based on a completely randomized block design with four replications carried out in a greenhouse and research farm of the Gonbad Kavous University during 2013 and 2014. Various priming treatments - applied in the laboratory. Then, during planting, mycorrhizal inoculation treatment was kept in the closet place to the grains about 5 g per gram of grain (40 spores per gram). To determine the activity of roots (root length and number of nitrogen fixation nodes) 10 seedlings per pot were kept. Measured traits in the field condition were included the concentration and uptake of total phosphorus in aerial parts, concentration and total phosphorus uptake of grain, grain yield, and biological yield. Results and Discussion: Variance analysis showed that different treatments of mycorrhizal inoculation, priming, and their interactions had significant effects on the studied traits such as the root length, number of nitrogen fixation nodules, phosphorus concentration of aerial parts, grain phosphorus concentration, grain phosphorus uptake, biological yield, and grain yield.

40|$|This thesis gives a {{detailed}} {{evaluation of the}} part-load operation of a natural gas-fired combined cycle with an <b>absorption</b> <b>plant</b> for capture of CO 2. The study looks into each of the processes related to the plant. Both the combined cycle and the absorption process are investigated separately, {{in terms of their}} part-load behavior, and a recommendation on how the total plant should be operated at part-load is given. The first part of the current work was a theoretical study of combined cycles, absorption plants and the integration between those. Both design and off-design models have been looked into. Based on the theory, a reference plant was designed and considered {{as a starting point for}} the part-load investigation. By means of simulation models and the theory, several parameter changes have been analyzed for each of the processes. The investigation of the part-load operation of the power plant indicated a significant net plant efficiency saving if inlet guide vanes were used to reduce the air flow into the gas turbine compressor, in combination with fuel reduction. The most recommended control strategy of the inlet guide vanes regulation was an almost constant target exhaust gas temperature relative to the design point. A higher target exhaust gas temperature obtained marginally better combined cycle efficiency, but problems could occur related to very high temperature gradients in the heat recovery steam generator. Analysis of the absorption process showed a dramatic reduction in the liquid circulation rate that provided the lowest reboiler duty, as the gas turbine load was reduced. The reduction in liquid flow rate into the absorber was about 30 % relative to the flow rate in the design point, for a gas turbine load of 60 % with an almost constant exhaust gas temperature. Regarding problems due to insufficient wetting of the packing material in the absorber, a restriction on the liquid flow rate at part-load operation could be profitable. A relative increase in total reboiler duty of 5 % was detected from the simulations if a constant liquid flow rate restriction was used, compared to 30 % reduction of liquid flow rate, at 60 % gas turbine load. For the integrated power plant and absorption process, steam was preferable extracted from the crossover between the intermediate-pressure- and low-pressure turbine at 3, 5 bar. This extraction pressure was independent of the part-load operation, and the low-pressure turbine should be throttled in order to meet the required steam extraction pressure at part-load. The design power plant with CO 2 capture obtained a total plant efficiency of 53 %, disregarded mechanical losses- and compressor work in the capture plant. At 60 % gas turbine load with almost constant exhaust gas temperature, the respective net plant efficiency was about 49 % dependent of the liquid flow rate in the absorber. A efficiency loss of 0, 3 % percent points were detected if a constant liquid flow rate restriction was used, compared to 30 % reduction of liquid flow rate at 60 % gas turbine load. </p...|$|E

One GHG mitigation alternative is post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture using chemical absorption, which is a promising alternative due to its proven technology and the relative ease to install on existing coal-fired power plants. Nevertheless, the implementation of commercial-scale CO 2 capture plants faces several challenges, such as high energy consumption, commercial availability, and geological CO 2 storage. Therefore, {{there is a great}} incentive to develop studies that provide insights needed to design and dynamically operate industrial-scale CO 2 capture plants for coal-fired power plants. This work presents a mechanistic dynamic model of a pilot plant of a post-combustion CO 2 capture plant using the monoethanolamine (MEA) absorption processes. This model was implemented in gPROMS. The process insights gained from the sensitivity analysis, on six manipulated variables and six potential controlled variables, was used to determine promising control schemes for this pilot plant. This study then proposed three decentralized control structures. The first control scheme was designed based on the traditional-RGA (Relative Gain Array) analysis, whereas the other two control schemes were designed using heuristics. The performance evaluation of those control structures were conducted under eight scenarios, e. g. changes in flue gas composition, set point tracking, valve stiction, reboiler heat duty constraint, and flue gas flow rate. Under the condition where the reboiler temperature is to be controlled, a control scheme obtained from the heuristic showed faster response to achieve the process control objectives (90 % CO 2 capture rate and 95 mol% CO 2 purity in the CO 2 product stream) than the RGA-based control scheme. Furthermore, this study describes a step-by-step method to scale-up an MEA <b>absorption</b> <b>plant</b> for CO 2 capture from a 750 MW supercritical coal-fired power plants. This industrial-scale CO 2 capture plant consists of three absorbers (11. 8 m diameter, 34 m bed height) and two strippers (10. 4 m diameter, 16 m bed height) to achieve 87 % CO 2 captured rate and 95 % CO 2 purity in the CO 2 product stream. It was calculated that the reboiler heat duty of 4. 1 GJ is required to remove 1 tonne of CO 2 at the base case condition (20 kmol/s of flue gas flow rate with 16. 3 mol% of CO 2). The mechanistic model of an industrial-scale CO 2 capture plant including a proposed control structure was evaluated using different scenarios. The performance evaluation result revealed that this plant can accommodate a maximum flue gas flow rate of + 22 % from the nominal condition due to absorbers’ flooding constraints. Moreover, it is able to handle different disturbances and offers prompt responses (After a plant is disturbed by an external perturbation, control variables in that plant are able to return to their set points in timely fashion using the adjustment of manipulated variables.) without significant oscillating signal or offset. In addition, this study highlights that the poor wetting in the strippers can be avoided by the implementation of a process scheduling, which has not been presented in any publications. Based on the above, the mechanistic models of CO 2 absorption plants and proposed control structures provide insights regarding dynamic behaviour and controllability of these plants. In addition, the industrial-scale CO 2 capture plant model can be used for future studies, i. e. integration of power plant and CO 2 capture plant, feasibility of plant operation, and controllability improvement...|$|E

The laboratories of the two universities house two similar solar driven <b>absorption</b> <b>plants,</b> with evacuated tubes solar collectors and Water-Lithium Bromide thermosyphon absorption refrigerators of the same manufacturer, but of different cooling capacity. In both plants measurement facilities allow to record in real time all the main operating parameters of internal and external circuits (temperatures, pressures and flow rates). It is known that the main problem for such solar chiller system is to have the highest feeding temperature when the refrigerating load request is greater since many parameters influence their correlation. Therefore, the aim of research has been focusing on the study of feeding temperature variations versus solar radiation and some system parameters, for both absorption chiller, conditions to find the optimal one...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{absorption}} by monoethanolamine (MEA) {{is a very}} extensively studied {{process and}} its modeling represents an open issue in the specialized literature. In the present work, the key parameters necessary to set the absorber model are discussed and evaluated based on rigorous analysis. The exper- imental data from two different <b>absorption</b> <b>plants</b> size were considered to validate the model. The mate- rial and the thermal Peclet number were evaluated for both plants in order to quantify {{the influence of the}} axial diffusion/dispersion. The results obtained from the Peclet number evaluation were used to cor- rectly define the number of segments required in the rate-based model. Moreover, the uncertainty in the kinetic parameters associated to the reaction between MEA and CO 2 reaction was examined to define a new set of values that minimize the standard error between the experimental and predicted temperature and composition values. The model proposed describes correctly the experimental data and particularly the bulge in the temperature profile, independently on its location. This result is particularly significant when it is required to examine the dynamic behavior of the column or when it is necessary to set an appropriate control system. C...|$|R
