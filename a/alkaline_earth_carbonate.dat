The reliability of such calculations is highly dependent on the equilibrium reactions that are considered as entry data, and the values chosen for the equilibrium constants. The working group " Speciation " of the CETAMA (Analytical methods establishment committee of the French Atomic Energy commission, CEA) has organized a modelling exercise, including four participants, in order to compare modellers' selections of data and test thermodynamic data bases regarding the calculation of U(VI) inorganic speciation.

This volume compiles and critically evaluates solubility data of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> <b>carbonates</b> in water and in simple aqueous electrolyte solutions. Part 1, the present paper, outlines the procedure adopted in this volume in detail, and presents the beryllium and magnesium carbonates. For the minerals magnesite (MgCO 3), nesquehonite (MgCO 3. 3 H 2 O), and lansfordite (MgCO 3. 5 H 2 O), a critical evaluation is presented based on curve fits to empirical and=or thermodynamic models. Useful side products of the compilation and evaluation of the data outlined in the introduction are new relationships for the Henry constant of CO 2 with Sechenov parameters, and for various equilibria in the aqueous phase including the dissociation constants of CO 2 (aq) and the stability constant of the ion pair MCO 3 0 (M=alkaline earth metal).

40|$|The {{prebiotic}} {{significance of}} laboratory experiments that study {{the interactions between}} oligomeric RNA and mineral species is difficult to know. Natural exemplars of specific minerals can differ widely depending on their provenance. While laboratory-generated samples of synthetic minerals can have controlled compositions, they are often viewed as "unnatural". Here, we show how trends in the interaction of RNA with natural mineral specimens, synthetic mineral specimens, and co-precipitated pairs of synthetic minerals, can make a persuasive case that the observed interactions reflect {{the composition of the}} minerals themselves, rather than their being simply examples of large molecules associating nonspecifically with large surfaces. Using this approach, we have discovered Periodic Table trends in the binding of oligomeric RNA to <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> <b>carbonate</b> minerals and alkaline earth sulfate minerals, where those trends are the same when measured in natural and synthetic minerals. They are also validated by comparison of co-precipitated synthetic minerals. We also show differential binding of RNA to polymorphic forms of calcium carbonate, and the stabilization of bound RNA on aragonite. These have relevance to the prebiotic stabilization of RNA, where such carbonate minerals are expected to have been abundant, as they appear to be today on Mars...|$|E
40|$|One factor {{which may}} limit {{the scale of}} {{application}} of oxide superconductors is their intrinsic instability when in contact with air containing water vapour. All families of these materials are to some extent subject to surface degradation reactions to form insulating products. These reactions may be monitored conveniently by surface sensitive techniques such as photoemission. Here we show examples of the application of this technique to degradation reactions occurring in ceramic and single crystal material, and initial results from superconducting tapes. Systems studied include YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x, Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +x and BaPb 1 -xBixO 3. For the latter, we show that the extent of degradation is sensitively dependent on the chemical composition, with metallic compositions being dramatically more unstable than non-metallic compositions. Amongst the degradation products formed from materials containing Ba, Sr or Ca is the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> <b>carbonate.</b> This is formed by reaction with CO 2 in a reaction catalysed by water vapour.

An investigation {{has been carried out}} into the production of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> <b>carbonate</b> and oxide powders and coatings suitable as cathode emission materials by the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDT A) gel method for potential application as cathode emission materials. The emission performance of thermionic cathodes coated with these materials has been measured, and found to give encouraging results, comparable with conventionally prepared oxide emission materials, despite the former having not been optimised. Amorphous gels of composition Ca-EDTA, Sr-EDTA, Ba-EDTA, [SrO. 5 Bao. 5 J-EDTA and [SrO. 5 Bao. 5 Cao. 05 J-EDTA were successfully prepared from aqueous solutions of alkaline earth nitrates and EDT A.

Nine candidate containment/HX alloy materials and two TCE materials were tested with six candidate solar thermal alkali and <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> <b>carbonate</b> storage salts (both reagent and technical grade of each). Compatibility tests were conducted with salt encapsulated in approx. 6. 0 inch x 1 inch welded containers of test material from 300 to 3000 hours.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a description of}} the main accomplishments of the EMSP funded research, including products such as conference presentations and publications (including those still in preparation). The {{purpose of this study was}} to better understand the chemical interactions between dissolved aqueous contaminants and carbonate minerals occurring as coatings on mineral grains in the vadose zone beneath the Hanford reserve. This information is important for construction of improved reactive transport models intended to predict the subsurface migration of contaminants. We made improvements to the hydrothermal atomic force microscope (HAFM) design to be used in this project. The original HAFM was built with funding from the U. S. DOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences. Improvements include operating limits of 70 bars and 170 C, from an original limit of 12 bars and 150 C. This product is patented. We completed a series of studies of magnesite, MgCO 3, because this mineral is structurally equivalent to calcite but reacts much more slowly, allowing us to study carbonate reactivity under pH conditions (i. e., low pH) that are much more problematic for studies of calcite but which are nevertheless relevant to in-situ conditions. We found that dissolving magnesite exhibits a dramatic change in step orientation, and therefore etch pit shape, as pH is lowered through 4. 2 to 3 and 2. This change in step orientation is NOT accompanied by an increase in step velocity with decreasing pH. We also found that, after growing magnesite on a magnesite substrate, the newly grown magnesite dissolved much more readily than the underlying substrate magnesite, and exhibited far larger etch pit densities. This effect may have been related to the rate of growth or to the presence of an Fe impurity in the growth solutions. We studied the dissolution of magnesite and calcite (104) surfaces under a wider variety of conditions with a new hydrodynamically defined hydro thermal AFM fluid cell, and we have observed the precipitation of a strontium-containing carbonate phase on dissolving calcite. We have applied the advection-diffusion equation coupled to proposed homogeneous and heterogeneous kinetic models to test rate laws for dissolution observed by HAFM. Our main conclusions in the magnesite studies are that step density, rather than step velocity, is a strong function of pH near the surface and that the step orientation is sensitive to pH. In these studies, we definitively demonstrate that diffusive mass transport is only important at very low fluid velocities for magnesite, but that studies of calcite dissolution are generally in the mixed transport-kinetics controlled regime (even at high fluid velocities) where quantitative information can only be obtained by accounting for the transport components. We also have found that <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> <b>carbonate</b> secondary precipitate formation on calcite surfaces significantly alters the net flux o f Ca 2 + and may passivate the CaCO 3 surface from further reaction.

Predicting the behaviour of uranium in the freshwater environment is thus key in understanding its behaviour, fate, bioaccumulation and toxicity. Speciation modelling, including prediction of uranium partitioning between solution and suspended sediment, clearly has a potentially important role to play.
