5|$|Barnum Brown {{recovered}} the first described remains of Saurolophus in 1911, including a nearly complete skeleton (AMNH 5220).

It was found in rocks of early Maastrichtian age, in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (then known as the Edmonton Formation) near Tolman Ferry on the Red Deer River in Alberta. Brown wasted little time in describing his material, giving it its own subfamily. Saurolophus was an important early reference for other hadrosaurs, as seen in the names of Prosaurolophus ("before Saurolophus") and Parasaurolophus ("near Saurolophus").

5|$|Ferugliotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals from the Campanian and/or Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, around 70 million years ago) of Argentina {{in the family}} Ferugliotheriidae. It {{contains}} a single species, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, which was first described in 1986. Originally interpreted {{as a member of}} Multituberculata, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, {{on the basis of a}} single brachydont (low-crowned) molar, it was recognized as related to the hypsodont (high-crowned) Sudamericidae after the discovery of <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid Sudamerica was described in 1999, these animals (collectively known as Gondwanatheria) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be Ferugliotherium were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead. Since 2005, a relationship between gondwanatheres and multituberculates has again received support. A closely related animal, Trapalcotherium, was described in 2009 on the basis of a single tooth.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1990 David W. Krause and Bonaparte {{argued that}} Gondwanatheria, {{including}} Ferugliotherium (family Ferugliotheriidae), Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica (family Sudamericidae), {{should be placed}} within Multituberculata. Two years later, Krause, Bonaparte, and Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska described <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> of Ferugliotherium (which they tentatively placed in the multituberculate suborder Plagiaulacoidea) and suggested that the supposed upper molars of Vucetichia were in fact heavily worn first lower molariforms (mf1) of Ferugliotherium. In 1993, Krause described an unworn mf1 of Ferugliotherium and confirmed that Vucetichia was based on worn specimens of Ferugliotherium and therefore a synonym of the latter. In the same year, he and Bonaparte argued once again that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica formed a closely related group of multituberculates, which they called the superfamily Gondwanatherioidea. Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte described a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate-like lower fourth premolar (p4) from Los Alamitos in 1996 and tentatively identified it as Ferugliotherium. On {{the basis of the}} morphological features of the jaw fragment, they argued that gondwanatherians were not closely related to any other multituberculate group, and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own, Gondwanatheria.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, British {{paleontologist}} Guy Pilgrim described {{two species}} from the Miocene {{of what is}} now India and Pakistan, Sivanasua palaeindica from Chinji (Pakistan) and Sivanasua himalayensis from Haritalyangar (India). He attributed both to Sivanasua, a carnivoran genus otherwise known from Europe. The next year, American scientist G. Edward Lewis described the new genus and species Indraloris lulli from Haritalyangar, which he provisionally allocated to the family Lorisidae. The generic name, Indraloris, combines the name of the god Indra with the generic name Loris, and the specific name, lulli, honors Richard Swann Lull, at the time director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History. It was not until 1968 that American anthropologist Ian Tattersall noted that Pilgrim's Sivanasua species had been misidentified; he suggested that Sivanasua himalayensis was probably the same as Indraloris lulli, but left the affinities of Sivanasua palaeindica open. Tattersall, who also described <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> of Indraloris, continued to regard the animal as a lorisid.|$|E
5|$|As {{for other}} lambeosaurines, it is {{believed}} that the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small crest, was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because the crest of Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines.|$|E
5|$|Production on Casino Royale {{was troubled}} and chaotic, with five {{different}} directors being credited for helming different {{segments of the}} film: Ken Hughes, John Huston, Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish and Val Guest. In addition, stunt director Richard Talmadge was uncredited as co-director of the final sequence. Ben Hecht was originally commissioned by Feldman as writer, and he provided a serious interpretation of Fleming's source novel, before {{it was decided to}} turn the film into a comedy. Three main screenwriters then worked on the project—Wolf Mankowitz, John Law and Michael Sayers—and a further nine people provided uncredited <b>additional</b> <b>material.</b> Problems arose on set between Peter Sellers and director Joseph McGrath and between Sellers and Orson Welles. Sellers eventually demanded that he and Welles should not share the same set. Sellers left the film before his part was complete. A further agent's part was then written for Terence Cooper, to cover Sellers' departure, while re-writes, additional filming and post-production cutting compensated for the missing actor. Principal photography started on 11 January 1966 and was scheduled to take up to 26 weeks. Because of the delays and chaotic nature of the filming process, it finally finished ten months later in November.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or Eric Clapton are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E
5|$|IV. Allegro. This {{movement}} {{is written in}} 6/8 and in tarantella style, and is characterised by a relentless galloping rhythm calling on demanding pianistic effects with frequent hand-crossing and leaps across registers. It employs the three-key exposition, a recurrent element in Schubert's style. The first theme shifts from C minor to C major – another Schubertian feature, and contains many allusions to D-flat major, which finally becomes established in a climactic reference to the Adagio's characteristic plagal cadence. The second theme, proceeding with the enharmonic parallel minor of this cadence (C-sharp minor), further develops the cadence in its alternation of tonic and subdominant tonalities. After a series of modulations, the exposition ends in the traditional relative major, E-flat. The development section begins in C-flat with a new theme, derived from the last bars of the exposition. Later on, <b>additional</b> <b>material</b> from the exposition is developed, gradually building up towards a climax. The recapitulation is also written in three keys; the first theme is drastically shortened, {{and this time the}} second theme veers to B-flat minor, the result being that the closing section appears in the traditional tonic. The coda begins with a long anticipatory passage which stresses A-flat, the submediant, and then reintroduces the first theme, restoring the most of the music omitted from its reprise. This last passage is characterized by sweeping arpeggios with violent dynamic contrasts - a series of subito fortissimo decaying to piano, following {{the rise and fall of}} the melody. On the last iteration, the melody hits triple forte at the zenith of its register and then plunges four octaves in a descending arpeggio, poco a poco diminuendo al pianissimo. An emphatic cadence then concludes the piece.|$|E
