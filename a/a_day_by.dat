5|$|An inquiry {{was held}} into {{widening}} the section from the Archway intersection to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971. It was {{originally intended to}} widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978, and a second inquiry in 1984, chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings, was also abandoned. The traffic flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> 1981, but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day.|$|E
5|$|Back in the West End, Richardson was {{in another}} Sherriff play, The White Carnation, in 1953, and in November {{of the same year}} he and Gielgud starred {{together}} in NCHunter's <b>A</b> <b>Day</b> <b>by</b> the Sea, which ran at the Haymarket for 386 performances. During this period, Richardson played Dr Watson in an American/BBC radio co-production of Sherlock Holmes stories, with Gielgud as Holmes and Orson Welles as the evil Professor Moriarty. These recordings were later released commercially on disc.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, traffic {{had reached}} 172,300vehicles a day, which had {{increased}} by nearly 10percent {{over the previous}} year. It was hoped that the construction of SR52 would help to reduce the congestion. A revised Mission Gorge Road eastbound exit opened in 1979, merging with traffic from I-15. Traffic reached 212,000vehicles <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> February1981, and Caltrans declared I-8 east of I-805 the busiest highway in the region. In 1987, Caltrans determined that I-8 west between College Avenue and Waring Road had the highest ratio of cars to number of lanes worldwide, at 2400cars per hour. Plans to add another lane to I-8 west from College Avenue to I-15 began in March1992.|$|E

5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived Much Ado About Nothing, this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's <b>A</b> <b>Day</b> <b>by</b> the Sea for ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television {{over the next four}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Metro also {{encountered}} {{significant problems}} estimating {{the number of}} riders who would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992). Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders <b>a</b> <b>day</b> (<b>by</b> June 1992).|$|E
5|$|Royal Tunbridge Wells is policed by Kent Police, and in May 2000 {{the main}} police station {{for the area}} moved from Royal Tunbridge Wells to a new {{building}} in Tonbridge and operations at the Royal Tunbridge Wells station, in Crescent Road, were scaled back so that it now operates as an administrative centre.

5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>by</b> a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in Turku, Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi {{and his friends were}} inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.|$|E
