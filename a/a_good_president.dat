5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned about the}} world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>president,</b> but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|A Quinnipiac poll, {{published}} January 21, {{showed him}} trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the leading potential Democratic contender, 46% to 38%, {{which was a}} downturn from two previous polls that showed Christie and Clinton about even, after Christie had gained considerably in the polls against her since March 2013. Peoples' view of his presidential capabilities went down with 35% agreeing and 36% disagreeing {{that he would make}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>president.</b> This was down from 49% agreeing to 31% disagreeing in a November poll. For those who had heard of the Bridgegate scandal, 50% said this scandal would hurt Christie's presidential hopes, and made 34% of those polled less likely to vote for him. His favorability rating declined to only 33% viewing him generally as favorable with 30% unfavorable. This was down from his highest rating of 47% favorable to 23% unfavorable in December 2013. The poll showed that he had gone from the leading potential Republican candidate in December to a statistical tie with three others.|$|E
500|$|Willkie's Senate {{testimony}} {{made him}} the leading interventionist outside the government, with Lindbergh (who had testified against Lend-Lease) the leading isolationist, and they debated {{in the pages of}} magazines. Roosevelt weighed in, backing his former opponent in a radio address on March 29. [...] "The leader of the Republican Party himself—Mr. Wendell Willkie—in word and in action is showing what patriotic Americans mean by rising above partisanship and rallying to the common cause." [...] That same month, a Gallup poll showed that 60 percent of Americans believed Willkie would have made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E

500|$|Reactions to Türk's victory from {{international}} media were positive. The Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung {{described him as}} [...] "more or less the ideal man for the job". The media focused on the landslide victory that was perceived to be a severe defeat for Janša’s centre-right coalition. Since the EU presidency was closing, Türk's diplomatic background was put forward. [...] "Slovenia is your solid, faithful and credible partner. Rely on us, and we'll be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>president</b> of the European Union next year," [...] Türk said. Türk was also expected to maintain Slovenia's alliance with the United States {{even though he was}} highly critical of the war in Iraq, as Al Jazeera reported.|$|E
2500|$|National Republicans soon followed. Ronald Reagan {{spoke at}} the school in 1980, {{although}} the Joneses supported his opponent, John Connally, in the South Carolina primary. Later, Bob Jones III denounced Reagan as [...] "a traitor to God's people" [...] for choosing George H. W. Bush—whom Jones called a [...] "devil"—as his vice president. Even later, Jones III shook Bush's hand and thanked him for being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>president.</b> In the 1990s, other Republicans such as Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm, Bob Dole, and Alan Keyes also spoke at BJU. Democrats were rarely invited {{to speak at the}} university, in part because they took political and social positions (especially support for abortion rights) opposed by the Religious Right.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>president.</b> In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{author and}} {{journalist}} Bryan Appleyard described his Beta Male column as [...] "light in tone, insightful but unpretentious, and above all, {{just the right}} length. I always enjoy Crampton - a naturally funny, likeable columnist. He's the kind of fellow you'd like to go for beer with, so he'd make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> US <b>President.</b> It's <b>a</b> real drag when he's away and a substitute fills in for him." ...|$|R

50|$|Communications {{technology}} {{was determined to}} be <b>an</b> interstate <b>good.</b> <b>President</b> Franklin Roosevelt, along with lobbyists and state regulators, wanted communications technology, both wired and wireless, to be monitored in a similar way and influenced Congress to pass the Communications Act of 1934. The goal was to have telephone and broadcasting regulated with the same jurisdiction in a way similar to that in which the ICC regulates the railways and interstate commerce. The act did not, however, allow for price regulation through the FCC due to strong lobbying efforts from the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC).|$|R
60|$|Whatever you do, read {{something}} else besides novels and newspapers; the first are good enough {{when they are}} good; the second, at their best, are worth nothing. Read great books of literature and history; {{try to understand the}} Roman Empire and the Middle Ages; be sure you do not understand when you dislike them; condemnation is non-comprehension. And if you know something of these two periods, you will know a little more about to-day, and may be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>President.</b>|$|E

When she attended the Inaugural Ball, she did not dance. She hosted the first annual Thanksgiving dinner at the White House.|$|R
5000|$|In {{more recent}} years, Niebuhr has enjoyed {{something}} of a renaissance in contemporary thought, although usually not in liberal Protestant theological circles. Both major-party candidates in the 2008 presidential election cited Niebuhr as an influence: Senator John McCain, in his book Hard Call, [...] "celebrated Niebuhr as a paragon of clarity about the costs of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> war". <b>President</b> Barack Obama said that Niebuhr was his [...] "favorite philosopher" [...] and [...] "favorite theologian".

He said she had moderated and no longer generated the same animosity among conservatives. Ruddy told The New York Times he and Scaife had changed their views: [...] "Both of us have had a rethinking. Clinton wasn't such a bad president. In fact, he was <b>a</b> pretty <b>good</b> <b>president</b> in <b>a</b> lot of ways, and Dick feels that way today." [...] This got some attention in conservative circles where Ruddy and Scaife were criticized for their newfound liking of the former president. David Horowitz defended Ruddy in response, suggesting the comment referred to Clinton's domestic policies and arguing that Ruddy had not considered those objectionable even during the Clinton administration itself.|$|R
