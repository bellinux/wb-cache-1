25|$|Only {{the third}} {{approach}} promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become {{upset about the}} disruptive state and thus change their current pattern {{to cope with the}} issue. The first and second approaches lead people to adopt the victim role by blaming others and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, spring back, and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, <b>and</b> <b>hopelessness</b> which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears and worries weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.|$|E

Another objective was to determine whether grade attributions could explain a portion of the variance of self-esteem, <b>hopelessness</b> <b>and</b> depression. The results have shown that stable causes of poor grades are negatively correlated with self-esteem and positively correlated with <b>hopelessness</b> <b>and</b> depression, while the explanations of good grades are positively correlated with self-esteem and negatively with depression. On the other hand, controllability of both poor and good grade causes was positively correlated with self-esteem <b>and</b> negatively with <b>hopelessness</b> <b>and</b> depression.

Apart from that, it was shown that controllability of poor grade causes, and stability and globality of good grade causes explained {{a significant portion of the}} variance of self-esteem.

25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression <b>and</b> <b>hopelessness</b> are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E

Meanwhile, Jean is being chased by the MRD in the hospital and, once cornered, ratted out by Marjorie, she unintentionally manifested her enormously powerful Phoenix abilities in the heat of her fear <b>and</b> <b>hopelessness,</b> which caused an intense psionic wave that affected almost the entire city. Archangel, under Mr. Sinister's command, went to capture Jean but Cyclops and Emma intervened. They soon discovered that the reason why Jean was not in mental contact with Scott was because she had no memory of Scott. Archangel pursued them as they tried to get Jean home, Cyclops desperately fought him, but in the end both he and Jean were captured so that Sinister could take samples of their DNA for his experiments. The X-Men came to rescue them and fought the Marauders, but just as Archangel is about to kill Cyclops, Jean manifests her immensely powerful Phoenix Force abilities and defeats him. Scott was able to calm her down and take her to the Institute for rest and promised her that she would regain her memories in conjunction with Emma's help. Everyone at the institute then became unconscious, except Emma, an undercover agent of the Hellfire Club who now had Jean, and therefore the Phoenix Force itself, in their hands.|$|E

He noted a hidden sense of despair on the song, not immediately apparent on first listen. The song also contains parallels to Ocean's own musical career, where Ocean recognizes that an album is much like a relationship: [...] "the main track, the single, often {{is not the best}} choice." [...] While singles are generally regarded as an album's best song, Ocean remarks that sometimes the most obvious decision holds more subtly. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard mused that Ocean took on the role of a [...] "captain" [...] on the track, prodding the privileged to reach for more by unraveling their lavish realities; [...] "Why see the world, when you got the beach?"

Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail stated that the track depicts dislocated lives of easy pleasure, of [...] "keepin’ it surreal" [...] with pills and sunshine, in music that’s supposedly all about feeling good.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{relationships between}} self-reported sexual abuse, depression, <b>hopelessness,</b> <b>and</b> suicidality {{in a community}} sample of adolescents. Method: In 1995, students (mean age 13 years) from 27 high schools in Australia (n = 2, 603) completed a questionnaire including measures of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), <b>hopelessness,</b> sexual abuse, <b>and</b> suicidality. Data analysis included logistic regression. Results: Sexual abuse is associated with suicidality, both directly <b>and</b> indirectly through <b>hopelessness</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms in the model developed. High suicide risk (behavior exceeding thoughts such as plans and threats, or deliberate self-injury) is strongly correlated with suicide attempts (odds ratio 28. 8, 95 % CI 16 – 52, p <. 001). Hopelessness is associated with high suicide risk only, whereas depressive symptoms are associated with high suicide risk <b>and</b> attempts. <b>Hopelessness</b> is more strongly associated with sexual abuse in boys than girls. Depressive symptoms are more strongly associated with high suicide risk in girls than boys. Controlling for other variables, sexual abuse is independently associated with suicide attempts in girls but not boys. Conclusions: Clinical assessment should consider gender differences in relationships between sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, <b>hopelessness,</b> <b>and</b> suicidality. Sexually abused girls may be at increased risk of attempting suicide, independent of other psychopathology...|$|R

In the soundtrack's liner notes, Eglee writes:Reminiscent of another time and place... that part of the Bronx in the late 1970s known as Fort Apache: a place that for white America, defined lack and limitation, violence <b>and</b> <b>hopelessness.</b> What white Americans couldn't see or hear then was the beautiful thing being birthed there, which, years later, would {{come to be known as}} Hip Hop.... This album remembers the foundations of Hip Hop as it contemplates its future. [...] Randy Gerston said that because of the near future setting of the series, he avoided any major hit songs as these would not sound futuristic. This gave them the opportunity to discover new talent instead. The album features predominately female hip hop and neo soul artists whose lyrics typically [...] "focus on the expression of female agency and power – particularly with regard to sexuality." [...] It peaked at No. 50 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic gave the soundtrack three out of five stars. He noted the lack of major artists on the album and commented that it [...] "seems to be a female-orientated soundtrack, perhaps because of the show's female lead character".

The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse <b>and</b> <b>hopelessness,</b> and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up faster than you can count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them — just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail – in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] – described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future."
