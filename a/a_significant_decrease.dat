40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of biomechanical pelvic blocking to segmental drop piece adjustments {{in the treatment of}} sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Method: Thirty participants were randomly divided in two equal groups. Group A (n = 15) received biomechanical pelvic blocking and Group B (n = 15) received segmental drop piece adjustments. The trial consisted of seven treatment visits over a period of three weeks, of which the first six were treatment sessions, with the final seventh session serving the purpose of obtaining final post-treatment data. Data was obtained only at the first, fourth, and seventh visits. Subjective data was obtained by having each participant complete a numerical pain rating scale and the oswestry low back pain and disability questionnaire. Objective data consisted of pain pressure threshold over the posterior superior iliac spine by using a pressure algometer. Results: The subjective results showed that there was a decrease in the numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) reading scores over the treatment visits for both groups. Group A had <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> (p = 0. 000) in the NPRS reading scores between visit 1 and 4, and <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> (p = 0. 000) between visit 4 and 7. Group B showed that there was <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> (p = 0. 001) from visit 1 to 4, and <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> (p = 0. 002) between visit 4 and 7. According to the Mann-Whitney test both groups showed <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> in their NPRS readings over the treatment period (p = 009), however Group A had a greater decrease in pain than Group B when looking at the mean score values. This indicates that both biomechanical pelvic blocking and segmental drop piece adjustments delivered to the dysfunctional sacroiliac joints are effective in decreasing pain. Over time, statistical analysis showed that there was a decrease in oswestry pain and disability for both groups A and B when looking at the Friedmann and Wilcoxon-signed rank test. Group A showed <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> (p = 0. 012) from visit 1 to 4, and <b>a</b> statistically <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> (p = 0. 002) for visit 4 to 7.

5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E

5|$|The ethnic Chinese {{population}} in Indonesia grew {{by an average}} of 4.3 percent annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the Great Depression and many areas experienced a net emigration. Falling growth rates were also attributed to <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> in the number of Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s. The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old nationwide and the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their population pyramid had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in total fertility rates. This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in fertility rates began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age. It is estimated that 60.7 percent of the Chinese Indonesian {{population in}} 2000 constitute the generation which experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government.

5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was {{embedded within a}} large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures {{of no more than}} 77°F (25°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E

40|$|Moisture {{variability}} across China and Mongolia (hereafter, CM) during 1951 - 2005 {{was investigated}} using the recently developed monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) dataset. In total there are 206 PDSI grid points across CM, {{based on a}} 2. 5 ° × 2. 5 ° gridding system. For CM as <b>a</b> whole <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decreasing</b> trend in mean moisture availability was observed during 1951 - 2005, but with strong decadal (17. 1 -year) and interannual (5. 0 -year, 3. 2 -year, 2. 4 - 2. 8 year) variations. The areas affected by moderate and severe moisture deficit over CM have increased significantly since the mid- 1950 s. In contrast, there is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decreasing</b> trend for areas affected by moderate wetness since the mid- 1950 s, and no significant trend was found for the areas affected by severe wetness. Ten moisture-related spatial patterns were objectively defined for CM using rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis. These patterns are related to distinct geographical areas and are associated with distinct temporal variations. Four of these patterns, in Northeast China (NE), North China (NC), Central China (CC), and East China (EC), generally demonstrate <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decreasing</b> trend in moisture availability. Two patterns located in western areas of Northwest China (NW) and the Tibetan Plateau (TP) show <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> moisture increase, while four patterns in Mongolia (MN), far western China (FW), South China (SC), and Southwest China (SW) do not have significant moisture trends during 1951 - 2005. Based on REOF results we propose that CM should be divided into ten coherent moisture divisions. Moisture variations within each division are generally coherent, but may show either similar or contrasting covariability with adjacent divisions. © Springer-Verlag 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{changing}} nature of the intraseasonal oscillatory (ISO) modes of Indian summer monsoon manifested by active and break phase, and their association with extreme rainfall events are necessary for probabilistic estimation of flood-related risks in a warming climate.
