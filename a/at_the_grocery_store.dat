5|$|Michael {{discovers that}} Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) has artificially inseminated herself from a sperm bank when Kevin runs into her <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store.</b> She {{explains}} {{that she did}} this while she was dating Michael, but still wants him {{to be involved in}} the pregnancy. He initially is indecisive, but eventually calls and agrees to attend Lamaze class with her.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

25|$|Dairy {{products}} are constantly {{in need of}} refrigeration, {{and it was only}} discovered {{in the past few decades}} that eggs needed to be refrigerated during shipment rather than waiting to be refrigerated after arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store.</b> Meats, poultry and fish all must be kept in climate-controlled environments before being sold. Refrigeration also helps keep fruits and vegetables edible longer.|$|E
25|$|On October 2, 2014, Groupon {{unveiled}} Snap, a new app {{specifically for}} giving customers cash {{back when they}} buy certain items <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store.</b> Snap asks shoppers to upload photos of their receipts after they've gone to the supermarket to buy groceries. Certain items are then eligible for discounts, which shoppers receive {{in the form of}} a cash-back deal. The new app comes from Groupon's previous acquisition of SnapSaves, a Canadian start-up that works much like Snap.|$|E
25|$|When Toole {{was unable}} to resume his {{position}} at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor. This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument. He stopped by the house {{the next day to}} pick up some things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store.</b> He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account. After a week she called the police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and waited for him to surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels knew where he was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.|$|E

40|$|It has {{happened}} to nearly all of us. Buying coffee <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> or a cup <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coffee shop down the street, we see the Fair Trade logo and wonder whether purchasing Fair Trade coffee rather than conventional coffee really helps farmers in developing countries. In other words, does Fair Trade work...|$|R
25|$|Since {{his days}} in middle grade, he would often visit {{some of the local}} saints like Swami Zanakak Tufchi of Habbakadal {{locality}} and Swami Baalak Kaw, a jatadhari sadhu, at Sekidafer locality. He would also press Swami Baalak Kaw's feet at times. Yet another saint that he is known to have paid regular visits to was Swami Jeevan Sahib. He would also visit Swami Narayan Joo Bhan of Bodhgeer locality in Kashmir. He would regularly attend gatherings of these saints discussing spiritual and philosophical topics on vedanta, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and Kashmir Shaivism.

Sometimes he would spend whole night at the store while being absorbed in meditation.|$|E
500|$|Scully and Bonsaint visit Froelich, {{who claims}} Melissa is the {{descendant}} of witches {{and that she}} is passing her cursed lineage to Polly. Later, while speaking with a park ranger, Melissa sees a bloody image of Froelich and she quickly turns around to head home. Meanwhile, Froelich is confronted by the enlarged Chinga and is forced to slit her own throat with the shard of a phonograph record. At the scene, Scully receives {{a phone call from}} Mulder who (in a twist of character) believes {{that there might be a}} scientific explanation to the people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> - chorea, otherwise known as [...] "dancing sickness"; Scully, however, remains doubtful. After Melissa sees a vision of Riggs, the deputy is forced to bludgeon himself to death with his own night stick. Finally, Melissa sees a bloodied reflection of herself in a window, a hammer buried in her skull. She proceeds to burn the house down in an attempt to destroy the doll. Polly arrives in the kitchen with Chinga, who somehow manages to extinguish the lit matches that Melissa strikes.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{notes that}} he shares his {{birthday}} with Eva Longoria, {{and that it will}} be a perfect icebreaker if he ever meets Teri Hatcher. After Michael asks what Dwight is playing on the recorder, Dwight replies that it is [...] "for the longest time", by [...] "William Joel" [...] (Billy Joel released [...] "The Longest Time" [...] in 1984). [...] When Kevin mentions he might have skin cancer, Kelly starts discussing a case involving cancer on the popular medical drama Grey's Anatomy. She later says that the saddest funeral she ever saw was the one for Princess Diana. For Michael's birthday, his mother sent him a picture of James Dean Resignedly, Michael notes that [...] "I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this". While <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store,</b> Jim and Pam buy a copy of the American comedy movie American Pie 2. Pam later impersonates Darth Vader, a character from the science fiction movie franchise Star Wars on the store's intercom. To show his support for Kevin, Michael makes a fake Livestrong wristband out of construction paper. Dwight later gives Michael a Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins jersey with the words [...] "From Dwight" [...] on the back.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem with}} food waste {{has become more}} and more evident during recent years and a {{reduction}} of the waste would be one important step towards a more sustainable society. The purpose of this comparative study is to examine how some Swedish <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> handle their food waste and compare if there are any differences between the three main actors on <b>the</b> Swedish <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> market; Coop, ICA, and Hemköp. The study will examine how <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> handle their food waste today, what they do to reduce it and if anything hinders them from taking better care of the waste. Theoretical results indicate an improved infrastructure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> can reduce <b>the</b> waste, which involves resources, activities and partners. It also shows an efficient supply chain is important and to reach more efficiency must the chain actors be able to handle uncertainties, collaborate and share information. But to know {{what needs to be done}} is one thing, to make it happen is another and to change old habits and routines can be difficult. Empirical findings demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> are very much dependant on their customers’ behaviours and attitudes as well as the efficiency of the whole food supply chain when it comes to food waste reduction.

2500|$|Much of {{the fuel}} price at the pump is due to fuel tax. [...] If you buy {{vegetable}} oil <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> {{it does not have}} such high taxes. [...] So at times people have bought vegetable oil at the store for their cars because it was cheaper. [...] They did this {{in spite of the fact}} that packaging by the gallon adds to the cost and it was illegal to use in a car since no fuel tax had been paid on it.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Strauss's {{father was}} a Disciples of Christ member and his mother a Baptist, but neither {{attended}} church during James' childhood.

2500|$|Bringing Sarafem {{to market}} harmed Lilly's {{reputation}} in some quarters. The diagnostic category of PMDD was controversial {{since it was}} first proposed in 1987, and Lilly's role in retaining it in the appendix of the DSM-IV-TR, the discussions for which got underway in 1998, has been criticized. [...] Lilly was criticized for inventing a disease {{in order to make}} money, and for not innovating but rather just seeking ways to continue making money from existing drugs. [...] It was also criticized by the FDA and groups concerned with women's health for marketing Sarafem too aggressively when it was first launched; the campaign included a television commercial featuring a harried woman <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> who asks herself if she has PMDD.|$|E

During dinner, Claire confesses her decision to drop out college, which Noah is immediately opposed to. After Claire cuts herself and Doug faints, she and Noah discuss the clippings on Noah's wall; Noah insists Samuel and the carnival are dangerous and shows her the compass. Gretchen then appears, and tells Claire she was invited by Noah as Claire was feeling bad those days. Once everyone is leaving, Noah assures Claire she has many options, unknowing she later takes this advice to visit the carnival. Before leaving, Lauren asks Noah {{to go out and}} watch a movie some day.|$|E

40|$|Presentation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Library of Michigan's Loleta Fyan Small and Rural Library Conference - April 30, 2014. In {{the library}} and {{information}} fields, we spend countless hours focusing on making our world a more self-service environment. While many patrons much prefer to work independently and easily find resources on their own, we have placed our emphasis on creating a self-service environment that removes the “middle man” from the information equation. And with the move that many have made away from conventional reference desks and reference service, we can (at times) look more like self-check express lanes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> than like <b>the</b> libraries {{that we used to}} be. And while our patrons most certainly enjoy accessing resources in an unmediated fashion, there are many instances (especially with more difficult research projects) where they do need assistance with finding print and electronic resources. This presentation takes a look at how we have used methods from the hospitality and service industries <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kresge Business Administration Library (University of Michigan) to ensure that we are not only meeting the information needs of our patrons, but also being available to assist them when it is needed. In this presentation, we will discuss the role of public service in {{the library and}} how the lessons on the hospitality industry can improve our interaction with the patrons...|$|R
