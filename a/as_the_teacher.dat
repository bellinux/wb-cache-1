25|$|The Antimenes Painter (530–500 BC) {{liked to}} {{decorate}} hydria with animal friezes in the predella, and otherwise especially neck amphoras.

500|$|This work's title, {{translatable}} as [...] "tutor", {{refers to}} Christ <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> of all mankind, and it features an extended metaphor of Christians as children. It {{is not simply}} instructional : the author intends {{to show how the}} Christian should respond to the Love of God authentically. Clement, following Plato (Republic 4:441), divides life into three elements: character, actions and passions. The first having been dealt with in the Protrepticus, he devotes the Paedagogus to reflections on Christ's role in teaching us to act morally and to control our passions. Despite its explicitly Christian nature, Clement's work draws on Stoic philosophy and pagan literature; Homer alone is cited over sixty times in the work.|$|E

The teething problems were soon over and on December 1949, Aroozoo launched the school's periodical, Onward to chronicalise the legacy and milestones of the school. On 29 May 1950, GESS became the first school in Singapore to form the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA).

2500|$|In The Journal of the American Medical Association, [...] Zimbardo's {{situational}} perspective received {{support from}} other social situational experiments that demonstrated {{the same idea}} and concept. Almost ten {{years prior to the}} Stanford Prison Experiment (1971), Stanley Milgram conducted research on obedient behavior in 1965 that embraced situational forces. Milgram had [...] "teachers" [...] that delivered mock electric shocks to the [...] "learner" [...] for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20–50 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> there was a [...] "confederate" [...] that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, [...] "I advise you to continue with this experiment" [...] or [...] "I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks" [...] and the one that caught most teachers was [...] "You must continue with the shocks." [...] Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.|$|E
