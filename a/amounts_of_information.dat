Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply enormous <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about the world: the program {{needs to have}} {{some idea of what}} it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

It {{makes it possible to}} store large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E

The major findings of this study are shown as follows: 1. Both the showing duration and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> will influence the ability of recognition and memorization <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> When the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> increase and the showing duration decreases, the ability of recognition and memorization <b>of</b> the <b>information</b> will decrease. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and showing duration increase, then the ability of recognition and memorization <b>of</b> <b>information</b> will increase. On the other hand, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and showing duration decrease, then the ability of recognition and memorization <b>of</b> <b>information</b> will decrease. 2. There are significant differences between the interaction of showing duration and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (F= 3. 231, P<. 05). 3. There are significant differences when the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is equal to or larger than the six (P<. 05). 4. There are significant differences when the showing duration is 6 fps, 12 fps and 24 fps (P<. 05) ...|$|R

Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E
5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation {{about what is going on}} as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the same as before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E

25|$|The Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory {{includes}} creativity as {{a subset}} of intelligence. Specifically, it {{is associated with the}} broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include: ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al. conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests, and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor. Martindale extended the CHC-theory {{in the sense that it}} was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.|$|E

In discussion, information access is often defined as concerning the insurance of free and closed or public access to information and is brought up in discussions on copyright, patent law, and public domain.
