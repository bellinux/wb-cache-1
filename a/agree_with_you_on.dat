6000|$|... "I'm {{inclined}} to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> one point," [...] said Dick. [...] "And {{that is that}} no ordinary person could have worked the combination of that safe. It {{must have been some}} professional." ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{very much}} {{interested}} and gratified by your letter concerning [...] "A Tale of Two Cities." [...] I do not quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> two points, {{but that is}} no deduction from my pleasure.|$|E
60|$|But I do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> the League {{question}}, nor on {{the woman}} question connected with it, only we will not quarrel to-day, and I have written enough already without an argument at the end.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Well, sir,’ {{said the}} ostler, ‘I believe you’ll find they won’t <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> They count <b>on</b> a good fling, you see; or who would risk it?—And here’s my best respects to you, Miss Nance.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{said the}} ostler, [...] "I believe you'll find they won't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> They count <b>on</b> a good fling, you see; or who would risk it?--And here's my best respects to you, Miss Nance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't, but he's {{a friend}} {{of one of the}} Eagle boys. I reckon we would have seen him anyhow; but we'll <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to hold <b>on</b> until we do. It's a go. Goodby, old pard! So long." ...|$|R
60|$|I should <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> Prince Napoleon, if it {{were not}} that I want the Emperor's disinterestedness to remain in its high place. We can't spare great men and great deeds out of the honour of the world. There are so few.|$|E
6000|$|... "I pardon your ignorance {{concerning}} many {{matters of}} this Northland, for {{you are a}} young man and have travelled little; but, at the same time, I am inclined to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> one thing. The mammoth no longer exists. How do I know? I killed the last one with my own right arm." ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul {{himself has}} been {{ambivalent}} about Paulville: [...] "You want {{to spread out}} and be as pervasive as possible .... I don’t see Paulville as a solution, but it can't hurt anything either." [...] He believes that [...] "it shows how desperate people are for freedom." [...] He finds the prospects for additional communities entertaining, but says, [...] "I don't know how much Paulvilles would do."Andrew Sullivan of the Atlantic said, [...] "Who wants to live around people who <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> everything? Not my kind of libertarian"; he was echoed by Jesse Walker of Reason. The Libertarian Party of Texas believes Paulville has potential for demonstrating practical libertarianism in action.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> at all <b>on</b> that head,' said Mr. Pole. 'We {{certainly}} {{are not very}} popular at this moment, and I feel convinced that a connection with a person who attracts so much notice as Cadurcis unfortunately does, and whose opinions on morals and religion must be so offensive to {{the vast majority of}} the English public, must ultimately prove anything but advantageous to our party.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are all {{accustomed}} to obey orders, promptly enough, when at work," [...] James said, [...] "though {{there is no}} attempt at discipline when off duty. You see them at their worst here. There is, of course, nothing like military order in the woods, but obedience is just as prompt as among our troops. As to the uniform, I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> but <b>on</b> that head I should not be particular. I can hardly fancy any of the scouts buttoned tightly up with stiff collars; but as, after all, although {{they are to be}} enlisted, they will be attached to the corps, rather than be regular members of it, I do not think I need insist upon the uniform." ...|$|R
6000|$|BURGE [puzzled but patient, {{trying to}} get at Franklyn's drift in order to {{ascertain}} his price] I have not made myself clear. Listen. I am <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I am <b>on</b> your side. I am accepting your proposal. There isnt going to be any more coalition. This time there wont be a Tory in the Cabinet. Every candidate will have to pledge himself to Free Trade, slightly modified by consideration for our Overseas Dominions; to Disestablishment; to Reform of the House of Lords; to a revised scheme of Taxation of Land Values; and to doing something or other to keep the Irish quiet. Does that satisfy you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Mrs Loper, <b>on</b> that point. To my mind it {{does not}} so much depend on the family, as on the notions, and the {{capacity}} to manage, in the head of the family. I remember one family just now, whose head was cut off suddenly, I may say in the prime of life. A hundred and fifty a year or thereabouts was the income the widow had to count on, and she was left with five little ones to rear. She trained them well, gave them good educations, made most of their garments with her own hands when they were little, and sent one of her boys to college, yet was noted for the amount of time she spent in visiting the poor, the sick, and the afflicted, for whom she had always a little to spare out of her limited income. Now, if wealth is to be measured by results, I think we may say that that poor lady was rich. She was deeply mourned by a large circle of poor people when she was taken home to the better land. Her small means, having been judiciously invested by a brother, increased a little towards the close of life, but she never was what the world esteems rich." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE [adroitly, as he thinks] I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> absolutely. I dont {{believe in}} {{coalition}} governments.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> of course, Miles. I always <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Mr. Fentolin has {{the knack}} of being right about most things," [...] she continued, turning to Lord Saxthorpe. [...] "His {{judgment}} is really wonderful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> my dear; quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you!</b> I told Ciss the spoons were solid silver, {{and worth}} forty shillings, {{so if the}} thief were found, he'd be tried for his life.' 'Hanged, do you mean?'Una said.|$|R
50|$|Kennedy: I would <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hear you}} have been to Torquay," [...] he said, looking at her critically, [...] "it seems to have <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You are looking well!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope, Cora, you are {{not still}} {{disappointed}} because I did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> when you spoke about the place for yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE (rising). I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I think it's most important.|$|R
5000|$|Ek stem nie nié met jou saam nie. ("I dont not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you," [...] i.e., I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.)</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you do {{not answer}} my question. Do you bring any {{accusation}} against me? If so, I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that you had better go to your lawyer." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seems to}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> very well. I've not seen you look better for years.|$|R
60|$|RAMSDEN. [sarcastically] I {{hope you}} are satisfied, Mr Tanner. Go on, Annie: I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Umph,' sighed Claude, {{throwing}} {{himself into}} his father's arm-chair, ''tis a Herculean labour! It seems I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> both.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Millicent. When we {{come back}} we can see about entirely refurnishing it, and, perhaps, adding some rooms to it, and we need not go down until a {{complete}} change has been made. We shall be able to manage it somehow or other, and I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that anything will be better than going back to the house {{for a day or two}} before the wedding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may call}} it {{so if you}} like," [...] he answered. [...] "Personally, I should not be {{inclined}} to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You will be alive {{when you go into}} the sea. If you cannot swim, the fault is not ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> These {{hurricane}} bursts, {{when one}} is becalmed, are always dangerous, even {{when one is}} under bare poles." ...|$|R
3000|$|C: But I {{think it}} should be {{discussed}} differently. I cannot <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> I must say. How do you think? [...]...|$|R
60|$|ARJILLAX. For once, Ecrasia, I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> A {{world in}} which there were nothing plastic would be an utterly miserable one.|$|R
6000|$|... "They don't look hospitable, certainly, Percy. I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> We {{had better}} {{keep in the}} open country, as long as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my mind <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Anne. But my soul remains doleful and uninspired. I'm always grubby and dingy on rainy nights." ...|$|R
5000|$|Explore {{arguments}} that challenge your perspective, and report embarrassing facts {{that support the}} opposition. Ask critical questions of people who <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|PARAMORE. I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> there, Mr. Cuthbertson. Er--by the way, do {{you think}} is Miss Craven {{attached}} to Charteris at all? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I play," [...] Norgate admitted, [...] "but I rather <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> How wonderfully well Mrs. Benedek is looking, isn't she!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, sir. As {{you have}} often said (and as I have often <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>you),</b> you are master. It may {{surprise}} you to hear it, Mr. Noel, but I have a private reason for wishing that you should see Miss Bygrave again." ...|$|R
