40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a control strategy of <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> switch {{for an independent}} eight in-wheel motor drive vehicle. There are three <b>drive</b> <b>modes,</b> and they are eight-wheel <b>drive</b> with ASR <b>mode,</b> eight-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>mode</b> and four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>mode.</b> The control strategy is designed to improve the integrated performance of the vehicle, such as safety, dynamic performance and economic performance, but the previous research can only improve one of them. When the road adhesion coefficient is very small, the vehicle will drive in eight-wheel <b>drive</b> with ASR <b>mode</b> to ensure the vehicle’s safety, when the driver torque demand is very big, the vehicle will <b>drive</b> in eight-wheel <b>mode</b> to get better dynamic performance and when the driver torque demand is very small, the vehicle <b>drive</b> in four-wheel <b>mode</b> to get better economic performance. The vehicle switches among the three modes according to the driving condition. Simulations of the new control strategy were carried out on two different driving conditions. The results showed that an improvement in safety or economic performance was achieved with the control strategy. 1...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{drive method}} is {{proposed}} {{to increase the}} vibration amplitude of <b>drive</b> <b>mode</b> of silicon vibratory gyroscopes based on the nonlinear dynamics research made in this paper. A nonlinear dynamic equation, considering the nonlinear mechanical-elastic and electrostatic force, was firstly deduced according to the simplified structure schematic of <b>drive</b> <b>mode.</b> Then, experiments were made to characterize the nonlinear amplitude-frequency response characteristic {{as well as its}} dependence on drive voltage. Besides, by solving the nondimensional nonlinear dynamics using Matlab and Simulink, the influence of initial status of <b>drive</b> <b>mode,</b> that is, the displacement and the velocity, on the stable vibration amplitude was presented. The amplitude-frequency characteristic was also analyzed by simulation. The result of simulation shows good agreement with that of experiments. When nonlinearity is present in the amplitude-frequency characteristic, there is a wide flat region with larger amplitude than the peak amplitude obtained in the linear characteristic. Finally, a novel drive method was presented to excite the nonlinear vibration of large amplitude in the downwards-sweeping characteristic curve. It is numerically proved that this merit can be utilized to enlarge the <b>drive</b> <b>mode’s</b> vibration amplitude so as to enhance silicon gyroscopes’ performance...|$|R
40|$|Multi-phase motors {{are gaining}} more {{attention}} {{due to the}} advantages of good fault tolerance capability and high power density, etc. By applying dual-rotor technology to multi-phase machines, a five-phase dual-rotor permanent magnet synchronous motor (DRPMSM) is researched in this paper to further promote their torque density and fault tolerance capability. It has two rotors and two sets of stator windings, and it can adopt a series <b>drive</b> <b>mode</b> or parallel <b>drive</b> <b>mode.</b> The fault-tolerance capability of the five-phase DRPMSM is researched. All open circuit fault types and corresponding fault tolerance techniques in different <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> are analyzed. A fault-tolerance control strategy of injecting currents containing a certain third harmonic component is proposed for five-phase DRPMSM to ensure performance after faults in the motor or drive circuit. For adjacent double-phase faults in the motor, based on where the additional degrees of freedom are used, two different fault-tolerance current calculation schemes are adopted and the torque results are compared. Decoupling of the inner motor and outer motor is investigated under fault-tolerant conditions in parallel <b>drive</b> <b>mode.</b> The finite element analysis (FMA) results and co-simulation results based on Simulink-Simplorer-Maxwell verify {{the effectiveness of the}} techniques...|$|R

40|$|The ISAC RFQ cavity {{nominally}} {{operates at}} a frequency of 35 MHz.

In the <b>driven</b> <b>mode,</b> the frequency is slaved to an external stabilized, digitally synthesized frequency source. In order to achieve glitchless transitions between the two modes, the RFQ frequency source is buffered by a phase-locked loop. When operating in the <b>driven</b> <b>mode,</b> RF switches in the loop configure the loop to lock to the external direct digital synthesizer. Reconfiguration of the RF switches in the self-excited mode turns the phase-locked loop into an oscillator whose frequency is determined by the phase shift of the RFQ cavity. The overdamping characteristic of the phase-locked loop prevents sudden transitions in either frequency or phase during switching between operating modes. ...|$|R

Additionally, the rover is assessed as an educational platform for use in teaching various STEM topics at both the high school and undergraduate university levels. The vehicle, termed BeagleRover, uses four DC motors and four servo motors to independently steer each wheel and achieve a total of six different driving modes, four of which are inherently stable four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> while two are unstable two-wheel <b>drives</b> <b>modes.</b> Two of the four stable <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> implement Ackermann steering geometry to reduce side slip when driving around a turn. Experimental results using measurements from an onboard gyroscope suggest that side slip is indeed reduced by this method. Stability in the two unstable <b>drive</b> <b>modes</b> is achieved through classical control methods including lead and lag control. Complementary filtering of gyroscope and accelerometer measurements is used to derive accurate body position data for use in feedback.
