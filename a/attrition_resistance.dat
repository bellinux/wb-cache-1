40|$|A {{customized}} jet cup {{for measuring}} <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of oxygen carrier particles for chemical looping combustion has been constructed {{and used to}} evaluate 25 different material samples, all of which previously {{have been subject to}} continuous operation in chemical looping reactors at Chalmers University of Technology. The effect of continuous operation has been assessed by comparing attrition behavior of fresh particles with that of used ones. It is concluded that the correlation between the jet cup tests and operational experience is robust, and that there is always considerable difference in <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> between fresh and used particles of the same batch. Composite materials with NiO or Fe 2 O 3 as active phase and Al 2 O 3 -, NiAl 2 O 4 - or MgAl 2 O 4 -based support and materials based on the CaMnO 3 -δ perovskite structure typically had high <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance,</b> which improved further following operation with fuel. Combined (FexMn 1 -x) 2 O 3 oxides and all materials containing smaller or larger amounts of either CuO or ZrO 2 experienced reduced <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> during operation with fuel, and usually also had low <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> to begin with. Fresh particles of the commonly used oxygen carrier ilmenite had reasonably high <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance,</b> while ilmenite that had been subject to chemical looping combustion of natural gas showed higher rate of attrition. No strong correlation between the commonly used crushing strength index and <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> measured with jet cup could be established, but it was clear that particles with a crushing strength above 2 N {{were much more likely to}} have high <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to softer particles. As compared to crushing strength, the jet cup testing was better correlated to attrition in actual operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactivity}} and <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of Mn–Fe {{oxygen carriers}} with addition of Al 2 O 3 as support have been investigated. Spray-dried oxygen-carrier particles with Mn:Fe molar ratios of 80 : 20 and 33 : 67 were prepared using different amounts of Al 2 O 3. Each material was calcined for 4 h at 950 °C, 1100 °C or 1200 °C. The oxygen carriers were studied in a batch fluidized bed reactor to investigate their reactivity with wood char, CH 4, syngas and also their oxygen release in N 2. In order {{to measure the}} mechanical stability of the different materials, the <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> was measured in a jet-cup apparatus. Addition of Al 2 O 3 to materials with a Mn:Fe molar ratio of 80 : 20 was not advantageous. Generally oxidation of these materials was problematic. The Al 2 O 3 supported materials with a Mn:Fe molar ratio of 80 : 20 calcined at 950 °C and 1100 °C showed poor <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> and were highly fragmented or turned to dust, whereas those calcined at 1200 °C showed high <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> but poor gas conversion. Materials with a Mn:Fe molar ratio of 33 : 67 supported with Al 2 O 3 generally showed better <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> Also their oxidation with 5 vol% of oxygen was possible at temperatures higher than 850 °C. Furthermore, some of these materials showed good reactivity with methane, syngas and char. Low attrition, good reactivity and CLOU properties in combination with potentially low raw materials costs, make these materials interesting for CLC...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of expected attrition phenomena during chemical-looping processes in interconnected fluidized-bed reactors, and also describes a customized method for measuring <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of oxygen-carrier particles. The proposed method is similar to the jet cup method, but has been scaled down in order to be suitable for samples as small as 5 g. Experimental results for materials, which previously have been used in continuous experiments in different reactor systems, are presented in brief. The attrition behaviour of materials during continuous operation was compared to results obtained with the jet cup test rig, and a strong correlation was established. Also, a weaker correlation between oxygen carrier performance and the commonly used crushing strength index was found. Some general guidelines with respect to particle attrition during chemical-looping combustion are provided. Materials that show good <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> in the jet cup tests {{are much more likely to}} perform well in real operation. Also particles with a crushing strength greater than 2 N are more likely to perform well compared to softer particles. Composite materials with NiO or Fe 2 O 3 as active phase and Al 2 O 3 -, NiAl 2 O 4 - or MgAl 2 O 4 -based support, as well as materials based on the CaMnO 3 -δ perovskite structure, are among the materials that were found to have high <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance,</b> and which also improved further following operation with fuel. In contrast, combined iron-manganese oxides (FexMn 1 -x) 2 O 3, and materials containing smaller or larger amounts of either CuO or ZrO 2 experienced reduced <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> during operation with fuel, and usually also had low <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> to begin with...|$|E

These materials are indicated as long term full coverage dental restorative materials. However the mechanical and physical properties of new Second Generation Indirect Composites for this particular application have not been fully evaluated. The {{purpose of the study}} was to compare the appropriateness of the four commercially available laboratory composite resins for application as long term full coverage restorative materials. Water solubility and sorption levels, staining resistance, gloss, surface roughness, wear due to tooth brush abrasion, two-body and three-body wear, fracture toughness and radiopacity of four indirect composite restorative materials; Radica (Dentsply), Sculpture Plus (Pentron), Belleglass-NG (Kerr) and Gradia Indirect (GC America) were determined. The results showed that the four composites differed significantly from each other. Bell eglass-NG and Gradia Indirect showed negative water solubility. All the four groups demonstrated less color stability when exposed to coffee slurry for 3 weeks. Significant decrease in gloss and volume occurred when the omposites were exposed to simulated tooth-brush abrasion. Sculpture Plus v demonstrated lowest abrasion and <b>attrition</b> wear <b>resistance</b> among the four indirect composites. Radica had the highest fracture toughness and radiopacity of all the composites with values close to or less then dentin. In conclusion, different indirect composite systems possessed different mechanical and physical advantages when compared to each other.

40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) of {{gaseous fuels}} {{could be of}} interest in industrial processes for heat, power or hydrogen production with carbon capture. For instance, production of steam or hydrogen from refinery gas are possible applications. A series of collaborate European projects {{has been carried out}} since 2002, which focused on oxygen-carrier development and upscaling of both the CLC process and oxygen-carrier production with methane or natural gas as fuel. Most recently, in the FP 7 SUCCESS project (2013 - 2017), Ca-Mn-based materials with perovskite structure, CaMnO 3, were produced at a larger scale and with cheap and commercial raw materials. The main advantage with this type of oxygen carrier is the ability to release oxygen to the gas phase, hence promoting reactivity in the fuel reactor. In the project, a significant number of such materials were produced and tested. It was found that a perovskite structure can be obtained relatively easy with widely different raw materials for Ca, Mn, Ti and Mg. The produced materials generally had high reactivities and high <b>attrition</b> <b>resistances,</b> but were prone to sulfur poisoning. In this paper, selected results are presented from the different stages of material development and upscaling, i. e., from bench-scale reactors with batch and continuous operation, respectively, as well as from a laboratory-scale unit with continuous operation and a nominal fuel input of 10 kWth. In the 10 kW unit, the gas velocities in the riser and in the grid jet zone of the gas distributor come close to gas velocities of industrial-scale units and, therefore, this unit is used to assess particle lifetime. Results from the 10 kW unit show that very high degrees of fuel conversion can be reached while achieving very high lifetimes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{the toll}} of {{tropical}} parasitic diseases on human {{life in the}} developing world, present therapies still rely on drugs developed decades ago. In many cases, the clinical usefulness of these compounds is limited due to poor efficacy, toxicity and the constant <b>attrition</b> of drug <b>resistance.</b> The absence of a profit incentive regarding diseases afflicting the very poor {{has resulted in a}} lack of investment by the pharmaceutical industry in new chemotherapies. OBJECTIVE: Given this background, this review addresses what alternative economic and scientific strategies have been implemented to procure novel drugs. METHODS: The latest chemical, genetic and screening technologies to discover and develop drugs for tropical parasitic diseases are reviewed. In many cases these strategies are being implemented within the framework of public-private partnerships established to sustain dynamic drug development portfolios. Examples of public-private partnerships and their portfolios are discussed. Further, the contribution of dedicated academic screening centres to target discovery and preclinical prosecution of new small molecules is also highlighted. In every case, the latest scientific literature is cited, but also relevant press releases and website information to indicate the present vitality in the field. CONCLUSION: The tools, institutions and consortia are now in place and evolving to deliver new pharmaceuticals. Short-term results have already been realised in the clinic, mainly through the provision of new formulations of existing drugs. Long-term and consistent investment will be required, however, to identify, develop and clinically validate new chemical entities...|$|R

The principle is to contain Zn{sub 2 }TiO{sub 4 } in a structural matrix of excess TiO{sub 2 }. A fluidized bed test was completed this quarter on the first of two promising sorbent formulations. The chemical reactivity in the form of breakthrough curves became progressively better over ten sulfidation-regeneration cycles.

40|$|The Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) {{reaction}} {{provides a}} way of converting coal-derived synthesis gas (CO+H{sub 2 }) to liquid fuels. Since the reaction is highly exothermic, {{one of the major}} problems in control of the reaction is heat removal. Recent work has shown that the use of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) can largely solve this problem. Iron-based (Fe) catalysts are preferred catalysts for F-T when using low CO/H 2 ratio synthesis gases derived from modern coal gasifiers. This is because in addition to reasonable F-T activity, the F-T catalysts also possess high water gas shift (WGS) activity. However, a serious problem with the use of Fe catalysts in a SBCR is their tendency to undergo attrition. This can cause fouling/plugging of downstream filters and equipment, making the separation of catalyst from the oil/wax product very difficult if not impossible, and results in a steady loss of catalyst from the reactor. The objectives of this research are to develop {{a better understanding of the}} parameters affecting <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of Fe F-T catalysts suitable for use in SBCRs and to incorporate this understanding into the design of novel Fe catalysts having superior <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> Catalyst preparations will be based on the use of spray drying and will be scalable using commercially available equipment. The research will employ among other measurements, attrition testing and F-T synthesis, including long duration slurry reactor runs in order to ascertain the degree of success of the various preparations. The goal is to develop an Fe catalyst which can be used in a SBCR having only an internal filter for separation of the catalyst from the liquid product, without sacrificing F-T activity and selectivity. The effect of silica addition via coprecipitation and as a binder to a doubly promoted Fischer-Tropsch synthesis iron catalyst (100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K) was studied. The catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation, followed by binder addition and drying in a 1 m diameter, 2 m tall spray dryer. The binder silica content was varied from 0 to 20 wt %. A catalyst with 12 wt % binder silica was found to have the highest <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> F-T reaction studies over 100 hours in a fixed-bed reactor showed that this catalyst maintained around 95 % CO conversion with a methane selectivity of less than 7 wt % and a C 5 + selectivity of greater than 73 wt %. The effect of adding precipitated silica from 0 to 20 parts by weight to this catalyst (containing 12 wt % binder silica) was also studied. Addition of precipitated silica was found to be detrimental to <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> and resulted in increased methane and reduced wax formation. An HPR series of proprietary catalysts was prepared to further improve the <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> Based on the experience gained, a proprietary HPR- 43 catalyst has been successfully spray dried in 500 g quantity.

It is, therefore, of very high relevance for many industries, to have a clear understanding of what are the parameters I need to trigger in order to generate the requested quality. Such understanding was the target of this work. The specific equipments designed at Delft University of Technology enabled us to measure the <b>resistance</b> to <b>attrition</b> and the <b>resistance</b> to abrasion of both reference coating agents and commercially pre-mixed coating systems. The <b>resistance</b> to <b>attrition</b> was directly related to the intrinsic properties of the coating material, to the process parameters used to apply the coating layer (fluid bed coating in this case) and to the conditions in which the particles are stored. The viscoelastic properties of the coating layers were measured by using nano indentation. Very good correlation between the viscoelasticity term, tan ?, and the <b>resistance</b> to <b>attrition</b> was found. Cast and sprayed films were produced as representation of the coating film. The morphology and the structure of coating layers were mimicked much better by sprayed films which could be obtained by novel equipment designed during this work. To assess the quality of the coating layer and determine how efficient the coating process was, X-Ray micro tomography in combination with image analysis was used. This gave us a very robust set of data which could be used to correlate the quality of the coating layer to the parameters chosen during coating process and those two with the final performance of the {{coated particle}}s in respect of resistance to attrition/abrasion. Finally commercially available pre-mixed coating systems were used as case study.

40|$|Chemical looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is {{a promising}} technology for energy production with inherent capture {{of carbon dioxide}} at minimal energy penalty. In CLC, oxygen is transferred from an air reactor to a fuel reactor {{by means of a}} solid oxygen carrier. Direct contact between air and fuel is avoided, resulting in an undiluted CO 2 exhaust stream. As such, CLC was picked up recently as a high potential carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. While initial focus was on storage projects, CO 2 is more and more considered as a valuable chemical substance for enhanced oil/gas recovery projects {{as well as for the}} production of chemicals, polymers or building materials. A critical aspect of the CLC technology is the oxygen carrier performance which has a very strong impact on the economic viability. Parameters such as particle size, density, porosity, strength, <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance,</b> reactivity, environmental aspects and cost, define the performance of the oxygen carrier. The first generation oxygen carriers was Ni-based. However, due to cost of nickel and toxicity, a search for Ni-free oxygen carriers was conducted with similar or superior performance in CLC. This lead to the development of Cu-, Fe and Mn-based oxygen carriers, that demonstrate the beneficial oxygen uncoupling effect, with complete fuel conversion as a result. In this contribution it is shown that the industrial spray-drying technique is a very versatile and scalable technique for the fabrication of oxygen carriers. New and promising oxygen carriers with varying compositions, good fluidisability, high sphericity, high <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance,</b> and homogeneity on the micro-scale have been synthesized.

Recent work has shown that the use of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) can largely solve this problem. The use of iron-based catalysts is attractive not only due to their low cost and ready availability, but also due to their high water-gas shift activity which makes it possible to use these catalysts with low H{sub 2 }/CO ratios. However, a serious problem with use of Fe catalysts in a SBCR is their tendency to undergo attrition. This can cause fouling/plugging of downstream filters and equipment, makes the separation of catalyst from the oil/wax product very difficult if not impossible, and results in a steady loss of catalyst from the reactor. Recently, fundamental understanding of physical attrition is being addressed by incorporating suitable binders into the catalyst recipe. This has resulted in the preparation of a spray dried Fe-based catalyst having aps of 70 mm with high <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> This Fe-based attrition resistant, active and selective catalyst gave 95 % CO conversion through 125 hours of testing in a fixed-bed at 270 C, 1. 48 MPa, H{sub 2 }/CO= 0. 67 and 2. 0 NL/g-cat/h with C{sub 5 }{sup +} selectivity of > 78 % and methane selectivity of < 5 %. However, further development of the catalyst is needed to address the chemical attrition due to phase changes that any Fe-catalyst goes through potentially causing internal stresses within the particle and resulting in weakening, spalling or cracking. The objective of this research is to develop robust iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts that have suitable activity, selectivity and stability {{to be used in the}} slurry bubble column reactor. Specifically we aim to develop to: (i) improve the performance and preparation procedure of the high activity, high attrition resistant, high alpha iron-based catalysts synthesized at Hampton University, (ii) seek improvements in the catalyst performance through variations in process conditions, pretreatment procedures and/or modifications in catalyst preparation steps and (iii) investigate the performance in a slurry reactor. The effort during the reporting period has been devoted to attrition study of the iron-based catalysts. Precipitated silica appeared to decrease <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of spray-dried iron FT catalysts. It was found that the catalyst with precipitated silica content at around 12 wt% showed the lowest <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> The results of net change in volume moment and catalyst morphology showed supporting evidences to the attrition results. Catalysts with low <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> generated more fines loss, had higher net change in volume moment and showed more breakage of particles. BET surface area and pore volume of this catalyst series fluctuated; therefore no conclusion can be drawn from the data obtained. However, catalyst with no precipitated silica showed the lowest in BET surface area and pore volume, as expected. Addition of precipitated silica to the catalysts had no effect to the phase changes of iron that could have significant influence to catalyst attrition. The presence of precipitated silica is needed for enhancing catalyst surface area; however, the amount of silica added should be compromising with <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of catalysts...|$|E

Under a previous Department of Energy (DOE) /University Research Grant (UCR) grant, Hampton University reported, for the first time, the development of demonstrably attrition-resistant Fe F-T synthesis catalysts having good activity, selectivity, and <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> These catalysts were prepared by spray drying Fe catalysts with potassium (K), copper (Cu), and silica (SiO{sub 2 }) as promoters. SiO{sub 2 } was also used as a binder for spray drying. These catalysts were tested for activity and selectivity in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor. Fundamental understanding of attrition is being addressed by incorporating suitable binders into the catalyst recipe.

Catalyst activity and selectivity is evaluated using a small fixed-bed reactor and a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation, followed by binder addition and spray drying at 250 C in a 1 -m-diameter, 2 -m-tall spray dryer. The binder silica content was varied from 0 to 20 wt%.

Thus, concentration rather than the type of SiO{sub 2 } incorporated into catalyst has a more critical impact on catalyst <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of spray-dried Fe catalysts. Lower amounts of SiO{sub 2 } added to a catalyst give higher particle densities and therefore higher attrition resistances. In order to produce a suitable SBCR catalyst, however, the amount of SiO{sub 2 } added has to be optimized to provide adequate surface area, particle density, and <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> Two of the catalysts with precipitated and binder silica were tested in Texas A&M University's CSTR (Autoclave Engineers).

Mechanical integrity (attrition strength) of these two catalysts was markedly dependent upon their morphological features.

Three (3) formulations of attrition resistant granules of the copper chromite sorbent (i. e., CuCr- 10, CuCr- 21, and CuCr- 29) as well as one (1) copper chromite sorbent in pellet form (i. e., CuCr- 36) were selected for cyclic desulfurization tests. The desulfurization and regeneration capabilities of the selected formulations as well as the effects of operating parameters were determined, to identify the {open_quotes}best{close_quotes} sorbent formulation and the optimum operating conditions. The durability of the {open_quotes}best{close_quotes} sorbent formulation was determined in {open_quotes}long-term{close_quotes} multicycle tests conducted at the optimum operating conditions. The <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of the selected formulations were determined and compared with those of other sorbents, including a limestone, a dolomite, and a commercial zinc titanate sorbent. The results obtained in this study indicate that, the CuCr- 29 sorbent has excellent <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> and desulfurization performance, which are far superior to the commercial zinc titanate sorbents. The optimum desulfurization temperature in terms of sorbent efficiency and utilization appears to be about 600 {degrees}C.

40|$|Spray {{granulation}} {{was applied}} to prepare attrition-resistant Ni-Mg/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for fluidized bed methanation. The tested binders included alumina sol (AS, pH = 4. 0), acidic silica sol (SS, pH = 3. 0), alumina-modified silica sol (AM, pH = 8. 7) and alkaline silica sol (CC, pH = 9. 6). By air-jet attrition test {{it was found that}} the attrition strength of the resulting catalysts followed an order of C-SS > C-AM > C-AS > C-CC, here C-SS, as an example, refers to the catalyst using SS as the binder. Characterization shows that the higher the volume of pores above 20 nm, the less <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of the catalyst there was, especially for catalysts using silica binders, whose high particle density was also beneficial to improving the <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of the catalyst. Syngas methanation over the catalysts in a fluidized bed at 2. 5 MPa clarified an activity order of C-AS > C-SS > C-AM approximate to C-CC at 623 - 923 K. The AS binder enabled highly dispersed metallic Ni and many surface active sites for methanation reactions. Continuous methanation for 20 h at 900 K and 2. 5 MPa verified the stability of the catalysts using the AS, SS and CC binders, but the activity clearly decreased over C-AM. Analyzing the spent catalysts via TPO demonstrated that a high amount of inactive carbon on C-AM caused its deactivation in the 20 h test...|$|E
40|$|Fischer-Tropsch (FT) {{synthesis}} {{to convert}} syngas (CO + H{sub 2 }) derived from natural gas or coal to liquid fuels and wax is a well-established technology. For low H{sub 2 } to CO ratio syngas produced from CO{sub 2 } reforming {{of natural gas}} or from gasification of coal, the use of Fe catalysts is attractive because of their high water gas shift activity {{in addition to their}} high FT activity. Fe catalysts are also attractive due to their low cost and low methane selectivity. Because of the highly exothermic nature of the FT reaction, there has been a recent move away from fixed-bed reactors toward the development of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) that employ 30 to 90 {micro}m catalyst particles suspended in a waxy liquid for efficient heat removal. However, the use of Fe FT catalysts in an SBCR has been problematic due to severe catalyst attrition resulting in fines that plug the filter employed to separate the catalyst from the waxy product. Fe catalysts can undergo attrition in SBCRs not only due to vigorous movement and collisions but also due to phase changes that occur during activation and reaction. The objectives of this research were to develop {{a better understanding of the}} parameters affecting attrition of Fe F-T catalysts suitable for use in SBCRs and to incorporate this understanding into the design of novel Fe catalysts having superior <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation, followed by binder addition and spray drying at 250 C in a 1 m diameter, 2 m tall spray dryer. The binder silica content was varied from 0 to 20 wt %. The results show that use of small amounts of precipitated SiO{sub 2 } alone in spray-dried Fe catalysts can result in good <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> All catalysts investigated with SiO{sub 2 } wt% {le} 12 produced fines less than 10 wt% during the jet cup attrition test, making them suitable for long-term use in a slurry bubble column reactor. Thus, concentration rather than type of SiO{sub 2 } incorporated into catalyst has a more critical impact on catalyst <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of spray-dried Fe catalysts. Lower amounts of SiO{sub 2 } added to a catalyst give higher particle densities and therefore higher attrition resistances. In order to produce a suitable SBCR catalyst, however, the amount of SiO{sub 2 } added has to be optimized to provide adequate surface area, particle density, and <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> Two of the catalysts with precipitated and binder silica were tested in Texas A&M University's CSTR (Autoclave Engineers). Spray-dried catalysts with compositions 100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K/ 11 (P) SiO{sub 2 } and 100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K/ 1. 1 (B) SiO{sub 2 } have excellent selectivity characteristics (low methane and high C{sub 5 }{sup +} yields), but their productivity and stability (deactivation rate) need to be improved. Mechanical integrity (attrition strength) of these two catalysts was markedly dependent upon their morphological features. The attrition strength of the catalyst made out of largely spherical particles (1. 1 (B) SiO{sub 2 }) was considerably higher than that of the catalyst consisting of irregularly shaped particles (11 (P) SiO{sub 2 }) ...|$|E
40|$|Attrition-resistant Ni-Mg/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 {{catalysts}} for {{fluidized bed}} syngas methanation were prepared by combining co-precipitation and spray granulation using different silica sources including acidic silica sol (SS), sodium silicate (NS) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Air-jet attrition {{tests showed that}} the attrition strength of the resulting catalysts followed an order of C- 10 TEOS > C- 33 SS > C- 1 ONS > C- 10 SS, where C- 10 TEOS, as an example, refers to the catalyst with 10 wt. % silica using TEOS as its silica source. Characterizations show that the porosity and skeletal structure have strong correlation with catalyst attrition strength. Simultaneous hydrolysis of TEOS and co-precipitation caused C- 10 TEOS to have dense and continuous skeletal structure to have the high strength of its Ni-Mg/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 precursor particles and thus the improved <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of sprayed catalyst. Silica sol filled in the voids among precursor particles resulted in a compact framework in C- 33 SS but its Ni-Mg/Al 2 O 3 precursor had weak <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> Atmospheric syngas methanation over these catalysts at an SV of 600 NL g(- 1) h(- 1) in a fixed bed reactor clarified an activity order of C- 10 TEOS > C- 1 ONS approximate to C- 33 SS. The TEOS also enabled highly dispersed metallic Ni and many surface active sites to facilitate the methanation activity and stability of this catalyst. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

40|$|Dry {{regenerative}} sorption processes {{have recently}} attracted increasing attention in flue gas desulfurization (FGD) {{because of their}} several advantages over the conventional wet-scrubbing processes. Dry sorbents are usually made by coating a transition or alkaline earth metal precursor {{on the surface of}} a porous support. Major disadvantages of these sorbents prepared by the conventional methods include relatively poor <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> and low SO{sub 2 } sorption capacity. The physical and especially chemical attrition (associated with the sulphation-oxidation-reduction cycles in the process) deteriorates the performance of the sorbents. The low SO{sub 2 } sorption capacity is primarily due to the small surface area of the support. Materials with a high surface area are not used as the supports for FGD sorbents because these materials usually are not thermally stable at high temperatures. In the past year, the research supported by Ohio Coal Development Office was focused on synthesis and properties of sol-gel derived alumina and zeolite sorbents with improved properties for FGD. The sol-gel derived alumina has large surface area, mesopore size and excellent mechanical strength. Some alumina-free zeolites not only posses the basic properties required as a sorbent for FGD (hydrophobicity, thermal and chemical stability, mechanical strength) but also have extremely large surface area and selective surface chemistry. The major objectives of this research program were to synthesize the sol-gel derived sorbents and to explore the use of the zeolites either directly as adsorbents or as sorbent support for FGD. The research was aimed at developing novel FGD sorbents possessing better sorption equilibrium and kinetic properties and improved physical and chemical <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) {{reaction}} {{provides a}} way of converting coal-derived synthesis gas (CO and H{sub 2 }) to liquid fuels. Since the reaction is highly exothermic, {{one of the major}} problems in control of the reaction is heat removal. Recent work has shown that the use of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) can largely solve this problem. Iron-based (Fe) catalysts are preferred catalysts for F-T when using low CO/H{sub 2 } ratio synthesis gases derived from modern coal gasifiers. This is because in addition to reasonable F-T activity, the F-T catalysts also possess high water gas shift (WGS) activity. However, a serious problem with the use of Fe catalysts in a SBCR is their tendency to undergo attrition. This can cause fouling/plugging of downstream filters and equipment, making the separation of catalyst from the oil/wax product very difficult if not impossible, and results in a steady loss of catalyst from the reactor. The objectives of this research are to develop {{a better understanding of the}} parameters affecting <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> of Fe F-T catalysts suitable for use in SBCRs and to incorporate this understanding into the design of novel Fe catalysts having superior <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance.</b> Catalyst preparations will be based on the use of spray drying and will be scalable using commercially available equipment.

40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate dry, regenerable, alkali carbonate-based sorbents for the capture of CO{sub 2 } from power plant flue gas. Electrobalance, fixed-bed and fluid-bed reactors were used to examine both the CO{sub 2 } capture and sorbent regeneration phases of the process. Sodium carbonate-based sorbents (calcined sodium bicarbonate and calcined trona) were {{the primary focus of}} the testing. Supported sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate sorbents were also tested. Sodium carbonate reacts with CO{sub 2 } and water vapor contained in flue gas at temperatures between 60 and 80 C to form sodium bicarbonate, or an intermediate salt (Wegscheider's salt). Thermal regeneration of this sorbent produces an off-gas containing equal molar quantities of CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O. The low temperature range in which the carbonation reaction takes place is suited to treatment of coal-derived flue gases following wet flue gas desulfurization processes, but limits the concentration of water vapor which is an essential reactant in the carbonation reaction. Sorbent regeneration in an atmosphere of CO{sub 2 } and water vapor can be carried out at a temperature of 160 C or higher. Pure CO{sub 2 } suitable for use or sequestration is available after condensation of the H{sub 2 }O. Flue gas contaminants such as SO{sub 2 } react irreversibly with the sorbent so that upstream desulfurization will be required when sulfur-containing fossil fuels are used. Approximately 90 % CO{sub 2 } capture from a simulated flue gas was achieved during the early stages of fixed-bed reactor tests using a nominal carbonation temperature of 60 C. Effectively complete sorbent carbonation is possible when the fixed-bed test is carried out to completion. No decrease in sorbent activity was noted in a 15 -cycle test using the above carbonation conditions coupled with regeneration in pure CO{sub 2 } at 160 C. Fluidized-bed reactor tests of up to five cycles were conducted. Carbonation of sodium carbonate in these tests is initially very rapid and high degrees of removal are possible. The exothermic nature of the carbonation reaction resulted in a rise in bed temperature and subsequent decline in removal rate. Good temperature control, possibly through addition of supplemental water and evaporative cooling, appears to be the key to getting consistent carbon dioxide removal in a full-scale reactor system. The tendency of the alkali carbonate sorbents to cake on contact with liquid water complicates laboratory investigations as well as the design of larger scale systems. Also their low <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> appears unsuitable for their use in dilute-phase transport reactor systems. Sodium and potassium carbonate have been incorporated in ceramic supports to obtain greater surface area and <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance,</b> using a laboratory spray dryer. The caking tendency is reduced and <b>attrition</b> <b>resistance</b> increased by supporting the sorbent. Supported sorbents with loading of up to 40 wt% sodium and potassium carbonate have been prepared and tested.
