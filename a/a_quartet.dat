5|$|<b>A</b> <b>quartet</b> of riders {{made the}} climb in second {{position}} on the road behind Pellizotti: race leader Denis Menchov, Danilo Di Luca, Ivan Basso, and Stefano Garzelli. Di Luca rode with a very high cadence {{in an attempt to}} separate himself from Menchov, but was unable to until the sprint for the finish line. By virtue of the time bonuses gained for third place as well as the gap on the road, Di Luca closed his deficit to Menchov to under 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were hired for individual unique sessions; {{there was no need}} to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotiv played by low woodwinds, including <b>a</b> <b>quartet</b> of alto flutes.|$|E

Cortini and Josh Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band and Justin Meldal-Johnsen was added on bass guitar. Freese and Cortini left the live band, but it became <b>a</b> <b>quartet</b> {{with the addition of}} Ilan Rubin on drums.|$|E
5|$|The album {{represented}} {{a turning point}} in the musical maturation of the band, after a turbulent period of personnel changes in which it shrank from a six-man ensemble to <b>a</b> <b>quartet.</b> Working with the Furs for the first time, Todd Rundgren placed his own sonic imprint upon the album as producer and guest musician. Rundgren also added new types of instrumentation to the band's sound, including cello and marimba.|$|E

5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1982 {{was marred by}} both Downey and Gorham having to take breaks from the European tour to recover from personal problems. Downey {{was involved in a}} fight in a nightclub in Denmark in February, and Gorham was suffering from drug-induced exhaustion. Downey missed five concerts, and was replaced by Mark Nauseef again for three of them, and by Mike Mesbur of support band The Lookalikes for the other two. In March, Gorham collapsed and returned home; eight concerts were performed as <b>a</b> <b>quartet</b> and six others were postponed.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers did {{not seek}} to replace her at the time, and opted to {{continue}} as <b>a</b> <b>quartet.</b> Following a final EP for Touch and Go—1989's Widowermaker—the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also brought them to Touch and Go, for a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990s The Hurdy Gurdy Man, which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued Digital Dump by The Jackofficers, Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic house music side project.|$|E
5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received <b>a</b> <b>quartet</b> of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E

5|$|Film showing resumed in 1900 {{during the}} American period. Walgrah, a British entrepreneur, opened the Cine Walgrah at No. 60 Calle Santa Rosa in Intramuros. It was also {{during this time}} that a movie market was {{formally}} created in the country along {{with the arrival of}} silent movies. These silent films were always accompanied by gramophone, a piano, <b>a</b> <b>quartet,</b> or a 200-man choir. During the Japanese occupation, filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of Philippine cinema with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures.|$|E

John Hughes noticed the quartet when they auditioned for the movie, and agreed to become their manager. The Corrs signed with Atlantic Records in 1995 and travelled to North America to record their debut album Forgiven, Not Forgotten. The album featured six instrumental selections among its Celtic-influenced tracks. When released, it was successful in Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Spain. The album reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia, and quadruple platinum in Ireland, which made {{it one of the}} most popular debuts by an Irish group.|$|E

5|$|In December 1969, Bell and Wrixon met {{by chance}} in a pub in Dublin {{and found that}} they shared similar ideas of forming a band, and decided to visit the Countdown Club where they saw Lynott and Downey perform with Orphanage. Lynott was not playing bass guitar at this time, but Bell was {{particularly}} impressed by Downey, and introduced himself to Lynott and Downey during a break. When Bell asked if they would consider forming a band together, Downey was initially sceptical, but both men were aware of Bell's musical reputation. They agreed on condition that Lynott play bass guitar as well as sing, and that the band would perform some of Lynott's compositions. Wrixon was also included as organist, making the initial line-up <b>a</b> <b>quartet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Return of Saturn is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band No Doubt, {{released}} on April 11, 2000 by Trauma Records and Interscope Records. It marked the band's first album as <b>a</b> <b>quartet,</b> following the departure of original keyboardist Eric Stefani in 1994. After touring {{for two and a}} half years to promote their breakthrough third studio album, Tragic Kingdom, No Doubt wrote several dozen songs for its follow-up and eventually settled on working with producer Glen Ballard. Creating the album became a tumultuous process lasting two years, during which there was dissension among band members and between the band and its label. The album was completed after the band returned to the studio and recorded what became two of the album's singles.|$|E

40|$|Heroes Are Born Then Made is a theatre piece {{involving}} live actors on stage, {{and live}} music originating from an orchestra pit. The script and music is original. The music {{is meant to}} literally depict actions and emotions on stage whether the actors are present or not. The duration of the entire production is about two and one-half hours long. Six main actors are used with additional walk-ons. Sixteen musicians are required {{to make up the}} orchestra which is organized into <b>a</b> woodwind <b>quartet,</b> <b>a</b> brass trio, <b>a</b> string <b>quartet,</b> <b>a</b> piano, and <b>a</b> percussion <b>quartet.</b> The play is based on the author's conception of how people tend to treat each other when someone is caught at a disadvantage.

5|$|The {{results of}} two further days of {{recording}} in 2002 were split over two trio albums: Anything Goes, released in 2004, contained performances of compositions by others; the Mehldau originals were released {{two years later}} on House on Hill. A solo piano recording from a 2003 concert, Live in Tokyo, showed greater lyricism appearing in Mehldau's playing, and was released in 2004 as his first album for Nonesuch Records, an imprint of Warner Bros. In the summer of 2004 he toured Europe for three weeks with a band that included guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel and Redman. That autumn, Mehldau formed <b>a</b> <b>quartet,</b> with Mark Turner on saxophones, Grenadier on bass, and Jeff Ballard on drums.|$|E
5|$|Timmons' career {{declined}} {{quickly in}} the 1960s, {{in part because of}} drug abuse and alcoholism and {{partly as a result of}} frustration at being typecast as a composer and player of seemingly simple pieces of music. In 1968 he made his second, final, recording for Milestone, Do You Know the Way? In the following year he played in <b>a</b> <b>quartet</b> led by Sonny Red, with Dexter Gordon on one of the saxophonist's temporary returns to the US from Europe, and in a trio backing vocalist Etta Jones. Timmons continued to play in the early 1970s, mostly in small groups or in combination with other pianists, and mainly in the New York area.|$|E

Other formats included <b>a</b> <b>quartet</b> with Joe Henderson, Herbie Lewis, and Freddie Waits; another quartet with Charlie Rouse, Calvin Hill and Horacee Arnold; a trio with Hill and Arnold; and a duo with Cameron Brown. Waldron performed and recorded extensively throughout Europe and Japan. In the early 1980s he reported that he allotted agents in France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia a month each per year of his time, but set aside two months for Japan.|$|E
