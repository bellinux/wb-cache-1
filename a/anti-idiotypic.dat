50|$|Racotumomab is an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> mouse {{monoclonal}} antibody that mimics NGc gangliosides, thus triggering an immune response against the tumor antigen NGcGM3. Therefore, {{rather than being}} a passive antibody therapy, Racotumomab acts as a therapeutic vaccine.

The specific expression of NGcGM3 in malignant cells reduces the potential risk of an immune cross-reactivity that could cause serious adverse effects.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} explore idiotypic, <b>anti-idiotypic,</b> and anti-anti-idiotypic {{responses}} to allergens, BALB/c mice were immunized with affinity- purified human idiotypic antibodies directed against a highly purified shrimp allergen.

40|$|When the IgG 1 {{fraction}} of <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies raised in guinea pigs is injected into mice, sensitization of idiotypic T and B lymphocytes occurs (1 - 3).

40|$|According to {{the network}} theory {{antibodies}} may act as antigens thus generating <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies that can function as regulators of immune responses.

40|$|NOD mice spontaneously develop type I {{diabetes}} {{resulting from}} autoimmune destruction of their insulin-producing b cells. Among the self-antigens targeted by NOD autoimmune T cells is a peptide, p 277, from {{the sequence of}} the 60 kDa heat shock protein (hsp 60). Common to the anti-p 277 T cell populations of NOD mice is an idiotope, C 9, that spans the CDR 3 region of the C 9 TCR. We now report: (i) that the C 9 idiotope peptide can be presented directly to anti-C 9 <b>anti-idiotypic</b> T cells by C 9 T cells, (ii) that spontaneous anti-C 9 <b>anti-idiotypic</b> T cell activity falls as disease progresses, but immunization can activate the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> T cells to regulate the autoimmune process, (iii) that the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> T cells secrete IFN-g, but appear to control the disease by down-regulating the IFN-g produced by the pathogenic population of anti-p 277 T cells, (iv) that intrathymic administration of the C 9 idiotope peptide at 1 week of age can accelerate the disease, and (v) that administering the p 277 target peptide can up-regulate the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> T cells and arrest the disease process.

40|$|<b>Anti-idiotypic</b> binders which {{specifically}} {{recognize the}} variable region of monoclonal antibodies {{have proven to}} be robust tools for pharmacokinetic studies of antibody therapeutics and for the development of cancer vaccines. In the present investigation, we focused on the identification of <b>anti-idiotypic,</b> shark-derived IgNAR antibody variable domains (vNARs) targeting the therapeutic antibodies matuzumab and cetuximab for the purpose of developing specific capturing ligands. Using yeast surface display and semi-synthetic, CDR 3 -randomized libraries, we identified several highly specific binders targeting both therapeutic antibodies in their corresponding variable region, without applying any counter selections during screening. Importantly, <b>anti-idiotypic</b> vNAR binders were not cross-reactive towards cetuximab or matuzumab, respectively, and comprised good target recognition in the presence of human and mouse serum. When coupled to magnetic beads, <b>anti-idiotypic</b> vNAR variants could be used as efficient capturing tools. Moreover, a two-step procedure involving vNAR-functionalized beads was employed for the enrichment of potentially bispecific cetuximab[*]×[*]matuzumab antibody constructs. In conclusion, semi-synthetic and CDR 3 -randomized vNAR libraries in combination with yeast display enable the fast and facile identification of <b>anti-idiotypic</b> vNAR domains targeting monoclonal antibodies primarily in an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> manner...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{reports have}} shown the A/J anti-para-azophenylarsonate (anti- Ar) {{antibodies}} that share a major cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) comprise a family of closely related but nonidentical molecules. Serological studies with CRI+ monoclonal anti-Ar antibodies have suggested {{the presence of a}} conserved idiotypic determinant within the family. The present study utilized monoclonal ant-idiotypic determinant within the family. The present study utilized monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies to define further the nature of the conserved idiotypic determinant. It was found that 8 of 10 CRI+ monoclonal antibodies possess an idiotypic determinant reactive with each of three monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies. In addition, approximately 60 % of CRI+ serum anti-Ar antibodies reacted with one of the monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> preparations. The monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies react with an idiotope in the region of the hapten-binding site, as indicated by the ability of free haptens to inhibit idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions.

40|$|Rabbit {{antibodies}} induced against alprenolol, {{a potent}} beta-adrenergic antagonist, bind to other antagonists, and, with less avidity, to catecholamine agonists. <b>Anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies were raised against the anti-alprenolol immunoglobulins. The <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies specifically bind and agglutinate turkey erythrocytes; {{this is not}} observed for human agglutinate turkey erythrocytes; this is not observed for human or sheep erythrocytes, which are devoid of beta-adrenergic receptors. The <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies compete with ( [...] ) -[3 H]-dihydroalprenolol for binding on the beta-adrenergic receptors on purified turkey erythrocyte membranes. The binding to the membrane-bound receptors is prevented by preincubation of the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies with their immunogen, the antialprenolol immunoglobulins. The binding to the receptor is not merely passive: the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibodies stimulate basal adenylate cyclase activity [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] and enhance adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamine. These observations {{support the notion that}} antiidiotypic antibodies may constitute an "internal image" of the original antigen and may mimic its biological effects...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} role of <b>anti-idiotypic</b> {{antibodies}} in the regulation of the immune response to Lol p I (the major allergenic component of rye grass pollen), we have recently generated a panel of three MoAbs directed against distinct epitopes of Lolp I and an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> MoAb directed against the idiotype borne {{by one of the}} anti-Lol p I MoAbs (290 A- 167). The effects of pretreatment with this <b>anti-idiotypic</b> MoAb in BALB/c mice before immunization with the antigen have been examined. The <b>anti-idiotypic</b> MoAb or unrelated MoAb were given weekly for 8 weeks intraperitoneally. Mice then received the antigen (2 micrograms) adsorbed with alum (2 mg) at weeks 9, 11 and 13. Serum anti-Lol p I antibodies (IgG or IgE) and specific idiotypic responses were measured. Anti-Lol p I IgG antibodies could be detected before immunization with Lol p I only in mice pretreated with <b>anti-idiotypic</b> MoAb. Immunization with Lol p I induced an anti-Lol p I IgG response in both groups, but this response was higher in mice that received <b>anti-idiotypic</b> MoAb. Similar profiles were seen for specific IgE antibodies and idiotypic responses. Surprisingly, idiotypes borne by other anti-Lol p I MoAbs (539 A- 6 and 348 A- 6) had also been enhanced after pretreatment with the anti- 290 A- 167 MoAb. These observations suggested that the pretreatment with this <b>anti-idiotypic</b> MoAb modulates not only the expression of the respective idiotype, but also affects other idiotype responses...|$|E

Serial measurements of the idiotypes, naturally occurring autoantibodies, and antibodies obtained after antigenic stimulation were performed in the sera of the injected mice and in the offspring of pregnant mice. No idiotypic suppression was noted in newborn injected mice. Transient suppression of idiotypes recognized by the syngeneic <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antibody was noted in the offspring of pregnant mice injected with the rabbit polyclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> antiserum.

Futhermore, the eluted suppressor factor can be specifically reabsorbed and recovered from a second <b>anti-idiotypic</b> immunoadsorbent. The concordance between antigen- binding specificity {{and the presence of}} idiotypic determinants was demonstrated by adsorbing ABA SF to antigen columns and then fractionating the ABA-specific factor on <b>anti-idiotypic</b> immunoadsorbents.
