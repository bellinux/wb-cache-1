25|$|These {{tests are}} rough-and-ready tools which grammarians employ to reveal clues about {{syntactic}} structure. <b>A</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests {{on a scale}} of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test {{does not mean that the}} unit is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not mean necessarily that the unit is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given unit in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.|$|E

25|$|In Ultima, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the Avatar, who embodies eight virtues.

Each virtue also has a mantra and each principle <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> power that the player must learn. The Eight Virtues explored in Ultima are Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility. These Eight Virtues are based on the Three Principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Principles are derived from the One True Axiom, the combination of all Truth, all Love, and all Courage, which is Infinity.|$|E
