5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Bjorøy Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The Jurassic sediments encountered in the tunnel included breccia and conglomerate in contact with the underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late Jurassic) for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by <b>a</b> <b>fault</b> zone, which later reactivated, disrupting the bedding and causing steep dips.|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} the fully {{relativistic}} screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method we investigate the effect of stacking faults on the magnetic properties of hexagonal close-packed cobalt.

With the exception of the intrinsic deformation <b>fault</b> which has <b>a</b> positive impact on the MAE, we find that the presence of <b>a</b> stacking <b>fault</b> generally reduces the MAE of bulk Co. Finally, we consider a pair of intrinsic growth faults and find that their effect on the MAE is not additive, but synergic. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5|$|Labrador {{colouration}} {{is controlled}} by multiple genes. It is possible for recessive genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to {{different parts of the}} body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are <b>a</b> <b>fault,</b> not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, <b>a</b> <b>fault</b> noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude. Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the fault. Several scientists believe that the small earthquakes from the zone highlight the reactivation of deep, ancient faults. Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century. The earthquakes have been moderate, never reaching above magnitude 5.1, and tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away. Major events include those in 1916, 1997, and 2003. Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama, earthquakes from nearby fault zones, including the New Madrid Seismic Zone, pose a serious threat to infrastructure. Even an earthquake similar in size to the 1916Irondaleevent today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to $1billion in damage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – A large modern {{wind farm}} should keep {{connected}} to the grid {{in the case of}} <b>a</b> grid <b>fault</b> whilst it should be isolated for <b>an</b> intertie <b>fault.</b> To achieve this function, this paper proposes a distance relaying algorithm suitable for intertie protection of a wind farm in the time domain. The proposed algorithm estimates impedance based on a differential equation method because the frequencies of the voltage and the current deviate from the nominal frequency. To discriminate <b>an</b> intertie <b>fault</b> from <b>a</b> grid <b>fault,</b> the algorithm uses a voltage blocking scheme because the magnitude of the voltage at the point of common coupling for <b>an</b> intertie <b>fault</b> becomes less than that for <b>a</b> grid <b>fault.</b> The performance of the algorithm is verified using the PSCAD/EMTDC simulator under various fault conditions. The results indicate that the algorithm can extend the reach of Zone 1 up to 100 % of the length of an intertie and thus discriminate successfully the intertie fault from the grid fault...|$|R

At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of <b>a</b> <b>fault</b> in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E
5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to <b>a</b> <b>fault,</b> they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E

Struggling to support his family, Pete finds himself in two run down jobs and suffering from depression, which Jenny seems oblivious too. Seeing <b>a</b> <b>fault</b> in their love life, she pursues a fling with client Trevor Green (Nicholas Gleaves), who begins to stalk her. Torn apart after the death of Harry (James Bolam), an old man who he was caring for, Pete considers suicide. David is entangled through a wrongdoing at work and is arrested, something which his wife Robyn finds humiliating and throws him out of their luxury Cheshire home. Karen finds herself on the dating game, and soon falls for Adam's father-in-law Eddie (Art Malik), though later discovers that they live in two very different worlds, with Karen's twin daughters Ellie (Ella Hunt) and Olivia (Daisy Edgar-Jones) still dependant on her. Jenny's ex-partner Robert (Robert Webb) from her time in New York City turns up on her doorstep determined to see their daughter Chloe (Madeleine Edmondson), who still believes that Pete is her father. Struggling to cope with living in Manchester and being step-mother to Matthew, Angela decides to end her marriage with Adam, who fell quickly for his landlord Tina Reynolds (Leanne Best). At Adam's 49th Birthday party, the Marsden's eldest son Josh (Callum Woodhouse) arrives from Spain with former nanny Ramona (Jacey Salles), and it is later revealed that he is gay.|$|E

5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} entire staff of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked so strange that another programmer thought it was <b>a</b> <b>fault</b> and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players.

5|$|When Germany {{surrendered}} to the Allies of World War I in November 1918, the German troops evacuated, allowing the surviving members of the imperial family time to escape abroad. The British warship HMS Marlborough rescued the Dowager Empress Marie {{and some of her}} family from the Crimea but Grand Duchess Olga and Kulikovsky decided to stay in Russia and travelled to the Caucasus region, where the Bolsheviks had been pushed back by the White Army. During the journey, a coupling on the train carriage in which they were travelling developed <b>a</b> <b>fault,</b> possibly from sabotage, and Kulikovsky crawled over the carriage roofs to reach the driver and stop the train. In the Caucasus, Kulikovsky took a job working on a farm as he was unable to secure a military posting in the White Army because the commanding general, Anton Denikin, wished to avoid association with the Romanovs. In a rented farmhouse at the large Cossack village of Novominskaya Olga and Kulikovsky's second son, Guri, was born on 23 April 1919. He was named after Guri Panaev, who had been killed serving in Olga's Akhtyrsky regiment. As the White Army was pushed back and the Red Army approached, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia; they travelled to Rostov-on-Don, and from there took refuge at Novorossiysk in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of Dowager Empress Marie's safe arrival in Denmark.|$|E
