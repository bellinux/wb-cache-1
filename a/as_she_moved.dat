5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her bow, raking {{her with a}} {{broadside}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her bow and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E

5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E

500|$|Bessie's {{aggressive}} anti-Toryism {{was frequently}} in evidence {{during her first}} years in parliament, especially when she could attribute to them the economic miseries of her Liverpool constituents. In a Commons debate on 28March 1946 she welcomed the government's decision to close the Liverpool Cotton Association, which she denounced as [...] "the bulwark of the Tory administration in Liverpool", {{nothing more than a}} group of financiers who gambled with the industry in order to make profits for themselves. On 1May 1947 The Manchester Guardian, reporting the chaotic Commons scenes during the divisions following a debate on the nationalisation of the railways, recorded that [...] "Mrs E.M.

Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes.|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{now found}} herself in a desperate position. The much more {{powerful}} three-decked Orient fired several broadsides into the Bellerophon, smashing her boats, dismounting guns and cutting rigging. French marines on the higher decks poured volleys of musket fire onto Bellerophons exposed upper decks. Between 60 and 70 of her crew were killed or wounded in the first stages of the engagement, including Darby, who was rendered unconscious by a head wound. Command then devolved to the first lieutenant, Lieutenant Daniel. Daniel and the second lieutenant, Lieutenant Lander, were both wounded, but were able to direct the fighting until a shot took away Daniel's left leg. As he was carried below {{he was hit by}} grapeshot and killed outright. The fourth lieutenant, John Hadaway, was wounded and was taken below to the surgeon, while the fifth lieutenant, George Joliffe, was killed on the deck. After an hour fighting Orient alone, Bellerophons mizzenmast collapsed, followed shortly afterwards by the mainmast. Lieutenant Lander was among those killed in the fall of the mainmast, and command devolved to the third lieutenant, the uninjured Lieutenant Robert Cathcart. Several fires had broken out on both Bellerophon and Orient. [...] According to the Bellerophons logbook, at 9pm, when a further fire broke out on the Orient, Cathcart was down below on duty, and the 13 year old Midshipman John Hindmarsh was briefly the senior officer on deck. [...] He ordered the anchor cable cut and the spritsail was hoisted, but put too great a strain on the foremast, which collapsed. Now totally dismasted, Bellerophon began to drift away from the action, her crew fighting fires. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> out of the line she received some long range shots from the French Tonnant.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the council}} met again on 23 April, the members {{had been warned}} by District Auditor Brian Skinner of [...] "serious consequences" [...] {{including}} surcharge should they decide not to set a rate; Margaret Hodge ignored the advice and commented <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> the motion {{that she would not}} [...] "abandon the collective unity that is so important in the struggle against the Government". However the council sent out a circular requesting ratepayers to volunteer rate payments in accordance with the previous years' demands. The council deliberately took steps to justify its delay in setting a rate by obtaining counsel's opinion; on 26 April Hodge wrote to Brian Skinner declaring that [...] "important [...] matters justifying such a deferral arose" [...] and that [...] "matters [...] taken to minimize and cancel any possible losses which might arise".|$|E

2500|$|On September 22, 1827, Joseph and Emma took a {{horse and}} {{carriage}} belonging to Joseph Knight, Sr., {{and went to a}} hill now known as the Hill Cumorah where Joseph said he received a set of golden plates.

Emma's parents helped her and Joseph obtain a house and a small farm. Once they settled in, Joseph began work on the Book of Mormon with Emma acting as a scribe. She became a physical witness of the plates, reporting that she felt them through a cloth, traced the pages through the cloth with her fingers, heard the metallic sound they made <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> them, and felt their weight. She later wrote in an interview with her son, Joseph Smith III: [...] "In writing for your father I frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us."
