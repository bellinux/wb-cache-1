5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.|$|E
5|$|Solar energy {{may be used}} in a water {{stabilization}} pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Its <b>advantages</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the digital}} signals require very little battery power.|$|R
2500|$|Another <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} allow heavy {{machinery}} and other materials to be transported to the power station at a later date.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> {{most of the}} optimisations used {{in actual}} Rankine cycle can be {{achieved}} in this Cycle, such as reheat and regeneration.|$|R
5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E
5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E
5|$|The Battle for Middle-earth II {{introduces}} {{three new}} factions with unique units and heroes: Goblins, Dwarves, and Elves. Rohan and Gondor {{are combined into}} one faction called Men of the West. Along with Mordor and Isengard from , there are six playable factions. The troops of Gondor provide a solid offense and defense with standard infantry and archers, and the Rohirrim of Rohan act as elite cavalry. The Elven archers are effective at inflicting damage from a distance, and their support units, the Ents, can perform a combination of melee and siege attacks, they are often considered the strongest defensive faction due to their strong missile units and powerful 'silverthorn arrows'. Although slow and expensive, Dwarven infantry, pikemen, and axe-throwers are very powerful and well-armored allowing them to prevail in even the longest clashes with enemy troops. A collection of wild creatures and beasts of Middle-earth make up the Goblin faction, this includes goblins, trolls, spiders, and dragons, which are effective in large numbers. Their only <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the goblin archer and soldier units are cheap to make at only 75 resources and build faster than other basic infantry. Isengard troops are highly trained Uruk-hai under Saruman's command. Berserkers are used by Isengard as one-man armies that move extremely fast and deal significant damage (particularly to enemy buildings and heroes). Additionally, Isengard is the only Evil faction that can build walls. Mordor forces are a mixture of Orcs, Men, Trolls, Mumakil, and Sauron's lieutenants. Mordor Orcs have tough armor, making them useful for absorbing enemy damage while stronger units attack enemies. Trolls contribute greatly to the Mordor offensives, having strong melee attacks {{and the ability to}} throw boulders or wield trees like swords.|$|E
50|$|DIP {{switches}} are {{an alternative}} to jumper blocks. Their main <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> quicker to change {{and there are no}} parts to lose.|$|R
50|$|However, the <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> album covers <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} textured, such as Back in Black by AC/DC or Fear of Music by Talking Heads can {{retain the}} texturing on the CD release.|$|R
3000|$|... ‘Almost real’ test-observed {{modes of}} vibration, the <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we could neglect the {{influence}} of damping in the problem of dynamic equilibrium and warrant comparison with numerical modes obtained in non-damped free vibrations.|$|R
25|$|Another big <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{results can}} be {{obtained}} wishing 48 hours after transfection.|$|E
25|$|A further <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the radar}} can operate {{effectively}} at relatively low frequencies. This {{was important in}} the early development of this type when high frequency signal generation was difficult or expensive.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{integral}} ARPA {{combines the}} conventional radar data {{with the computer}} data processing systems into one unit. The main operational <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both the radar and ARPA data are readily comparable.|$|E
50|$|Plated wire {{memory is}} a {{variation}} of core memory developed by Bell Laboratories in 1957. Its primary <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it could <b>be</b> machine-assembled, which potentially led to lower prices than the hand-assembled core.|$|R
5000|$|ENQUIRE {{was similar}} to Apple's HyperCard which also lacked {{clickable}} text and was not [...] "hypertext", but ENQUIRE lacked an image rendering system. The <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> portable and ran on different systems.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, the kettles were heated inside steam jackets. The <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all had {{the same}} steam {{pressure}} and the temperature was uniform. As a result, only one quality of salt was produced.|$|R
25|$|RADius and RadaScan. These are radar based system, {{but have}} no moving parts as Artemis. Another <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the transponders are {{much smaller than the}} Artemis unit. The range is {{typically}} 500 – 1000 meters.|$|E
25|$|In elderly {{patients}} with displaced or intracapsular fractures many surgeons prefer {{to undertake a}} hemiarthroplasty, replacing the broken part of the bone with a metal implant. The <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the patient can mobilize without having to wait for healing.|$|E
25|$|The second <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{most of the}} {{state-owned}} firms are being privatized under the general policies of article 44 in the Iranian constitution. Under the circumstances, people are allowed to buy the shares of newly privatized firms.|$|E
50|$|LFP's major {{commercial}} <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> {{it poses}} few safety concerns such as overheating and explosion, {{as well as}} long cycle lifetimes, high power density and has a wider operating temperature range. Power plants and automobiles use LFP.|$|R
5000|$|Simple bind/cast off : Involves simply passing each {{loop over}} an {{adjacent}} stitch. (The yarn is {{passed through the}} final loop to secure the whole chain.) This technique produces a tight edge with little elasticity. Its <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> ...|$|R
30|$|One of the <b>advantages</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the same}} {{algorithm}} can add reference {{objects to the}} existing database, which allows to develop such a database whenever it is necessary. Presented method may efficiently assist the operators of the automated maintenance monitoring systems.|$|R
25|$|Aitutaki {{is famous}} for its {{turquoise}} central lagoon, uninhabited islands and palm-fringed beaches. Another <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> until now it has been spared by mass tourism. Noteworthy also are an old church (the oldest in the Cook Islands) and some gigantic Banyan trees (Ficus prolixa).|$|E
25|$|Sebeolsik Noshift is {{a variant}} of sebeolsik {{which can be used}} without {{pressing}} the shift key. Its <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people with disabilities who cannot press two keys at the same time will still be able to use it to type in Hangul.|$|E
25|$|One clear <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{electrical}} conductivity is different between {{different kinds of}} cells. Living cells have a lower conductive medium while the dead ones have minimum or no conductive medium. The system {{may be able to}} manipulate roughly 10,000 cells or particles at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The {{apparent}} <b>advantages</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> this configuration {{maintained a}} small frontal area, and that Fiat already had previous {{experience with the}} AS.5, while having a combined displacement of 50 litres (3,066 cu in) it <b>was</b> thought <b>that</b> the power requirement would be easily met.|$|R
50|$|Biodiesel, a diesel-equivalent {{made from}} {{vegetable}} oils or animal fats, {{is considered a}} practical option for the island. Biodiesel's greatest <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> it can <b>be</b> distributed through existing diesel infrastructure and be {{used in conjunction with}} petro-diesel after an inexpensive engine conversion.|$|R
50|$|Fripp {{used this}} {{technique}} to dynamically create recordings containing {{layer upon layer}} of electric guitar sounds in a real time fashion. An added <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> by nature of the technique, the complete performances were recorded in their entirety on the original looped tape.|$|R
25|$|Interlingua's {{greatest}} <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is {{the most}} widely understood international auxiliary language besides Interlingua (IL) de A.p.I. by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these adverse effects, {{a different type of}} MAOI has been developed: the reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) class of drugs. Their primary <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they do not require the person to follow a special diet, while being purportedly effective as SSRIs and tricyclics in treating depressive disorders.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{mechanical}} plating evenly coats all surfaces and features, unlike electroplating which has issues plating recesses. Mechanical plating can evenly coat up to 75 μm thick. For thicker plating {{mechanical plating}} is especially cost advantageous versus electroplating, because the cycle time does not increase {{much for the}} thicker plating, unlike electroplating.|$|E
50|$|Psychologists have {{explored}} {{many aspects of}} human and animal behaviour using this kind of approach. <b>Advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the effects of confounding variables are controlled, including the influence of observation on behaviour; disadvantages {{are associated with the}} lack of relationship to the 'real world'.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>advantage</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cost <b>is</b> very low, since bulk postage {{is cheap}} in most {{countries}} ...|$|R
50|$|The {{speed of}} the {{emulsion}} process was unremarkable. It was not {{as fast as the}} ordinary wet process, but was not nearly as slow as the dry plate processes.
