The club {{officials}} were {{all set to}} go with this until News Limited's Lachlan Murdoch told them to go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However co-CEOs Chris Johns and John Ribot decided {{to go with the}} themes lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Steiger {{played a}} chauvinistic big game hunter, {{explorer}} and war hero opposite Susannah York in Mark Robson's Happy Birthday, Wanda June, before agreeing to star alongside James Coburn as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in Sergio Leone's Duck, You Sucker!, which was alternatively titled <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dynamite. Leone was initially dissatisfied with {{his performance in}} that he played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan's stagecoach is destroyed. After the film's completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned {{for the role of}} Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him.|$|E

The film was shot in Italy and directed by Giuliano Carnimeo.|$|R
5|$|Yojimbo (The Bodyguard), Kurosawa Production's second film, {{centers on}} a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two {{opposing}} violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the Western, {{while at the same}} time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring Tatsuya Nakadai in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by Kazuo Miyagawa (who shot Rashomon) and Takao Saito, the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. The movie and its blackly comic tone were also widely imitated abroad. Sergio Leone's <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake with Toho filing a lawsuit on Kurosawa's behalf and prevailing.|$|E

Megaforce repackaged <b>a</b> compilation <b>of</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Metal and the 1985 extended play Armed and Dangerous in 2005, which featured a different artwork and some liner notes, but excluded any new mixes and bonus tracks. Commemorating its 25th anniversary, Megaforce reissued the album on three colored 10-inch LPs, also including Armed and Dangerous.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Arthur (born September 28, 1971) is an American singer-songwriter {{and artist}} from Akron, Ohio, United States.

Combining poetic lyrics with a layered sonic palette, Arthur has built his {{reputation}} over the years through critically acclaimed releases and constant touring; his unique solo live performances often incorporate the use of a number of distortion and loop pedals, and his shows are recorded live at the soundboard and made available to concertgoers immediately following the show on recordable media.|$|R
500|$|Michael Christopher of The Boston Phoenix {{commented that}} Anthrax {{has learned from}} its past {{mistakes}} in making the album. He observed that the humor that characterized the previous albums was still present, and called this album <b>a</b> [...] "fresh <b>fistful</b> <b>of</b> metal". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times compared Worship Music to Metallica's Lulu, saying that Anthrax, unlike Metallica, opted to [...] "reclaim ground" [...] dominated by younger bands. Mark Fisher, writing in Metal Forces, highlighted the guitar performance, saying {{it reminded him of}} the sound Anthrax is mostly associated with. Although Fisher preferred the albums with John Bush on vocals, he remarked that Worship Music is a fine recording with a career-defining performance by Joey Belladonna. Chad Bowar from About.com also praised Belladonna's performance, noting that the vocal delivery was filled with angst and emotion. He opined that Anthrax sounded rejuvenated and qualified the album as a return to form.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent re-releases {{have largely}} used the title <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dynamite, {{although}} the DVD appearing in The Sergio Leone Anthology box set, released by MGM in 2007, used the original English language title of Duck, You Sucker!.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} Spaghetti Westerns {{were those of}} Sergio Leone, whose Dollars Trilogy (<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), {{featuring}} Clint Eastwood and scores by Ennio Morricone, came to define the genre along with Once Upon a Time in the West.|$|E
25|$|The {{turning point}} in Morricone's career took place in 1964, {{the year in which}} his third child, Andrea Morricone, who would also become a film composer, was born. Film {{director}} Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's different version of the Western, <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars (1964).|$|E

25|$|Subsequent to {{the success}} of the Dollars trilogy, Morricone {{composed}} also the scores for Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Leone's last credited western film <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dynamite (1971), as well as the scores for My Name Is Nobody (1973) and A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe (1975), produced by Sergio Leone.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars was {{released}} in Italy in September 1964. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed {{more than any other}} Italian film up to that point. In January 1967 the film premièred in the United States grossing $4.5 million for the year. It eventually grossed $14.5 million in its American release. In 1969 it was re-released, earning $1.2 million in rentals.|$|E

25|$|Being period drama pieces, {{both the}} Western and samurai genre {{influenced}} {{each other in}} style and themes throughout the years. The Magnificent Seven was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's film The Seven Samurai, and <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars was a remake of Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which itself was inspired by Red Harvest, an American detective novel by Dashiell Hammett. Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was {{a fan of the}} genre, most especially John Ford.|$|E
25|$|As few Spaghetti Westerns had {{yet been}} {{released}} in the United States, many of the European cast and crew took on American-sounding stage names. These included Leone himself ("Bob Robertson"), Gian Maria Volontè ("Johnny Wels"), and composer Ennio Morricone ("Dan Savio"). <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars was shot in Spain, mostly near Hoyo de Manzanares close to Madrid, but also (like its two sequels) in the Tabernas Desert and in the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, both {{in the province of}} Almería.|$|E

25|$|The Western films {{directed}} by Sergio Leone were felt {{by some to}} have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns. Veteran American actors Charles Bronson, Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as James Coburn, Henry Fonda, Klaus Kinski, and Jason Robards. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series Rawhide, unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars was {{at first}} {{intended}} by Leone to reinvent the western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite {{the fact that even}} Hollywood began to gear down production of such films, Leone knew that there was still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences laughed at the stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting.|$|E
25|$|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was {{marketed as}} {{the third and final}} {{installment}} in the Dollars Trilogy, following <b>A</b> <b>Fistful</b> <b>of</b> Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is now seen {{as one of the greatest}} and most influential Westerns of all time.|$|E
