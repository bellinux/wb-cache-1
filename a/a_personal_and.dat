5|$|Under Wild, Ops (B) was {{expanded}} and {{divided into two}} sections – Operations and Intelligence. It received greater power, including control of the information flowing to double agents. Wild used this to help with planning for Operation Fortitude, the major segment of the Bodyguard plan. This situation did not last long; another 'A' Force alumnus, Lieutenant Colonel David Strangeways, was brought over to head up R Force, the operational deception unit of the 21st Army Group. Strangeways and Wild clashed on <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> professional level. Eventually, Strangeways rewrote large portions of the Fortitude South plan, and pushed Ops (B) into a more supporting role.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his defeat}} of Metatron {{and access to}} Heaven having been restored, Castiel {{continues}} to face challenges on <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> large scale, as some angels prefer to remain on Earth and his stolen Grace continues to consume him.

Sam and Dean remain ignorant of Castiel's fate, although Crowley is aware of Castiel's condition, at one point killing another angel to transfer her Grace to Castiel so that Castiel could help Sam cure the now-demonic Dean after he was transformed by the Mark of Cain.|$|E
