By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|In 1759, peace {{negotiations}} at The Hague came to nothing. The series of Franco-Austrian losses were reversed until, in 1762, the Empress Elizabeth of Russia died. Her successor Peter III greatly admired Frederick, {{and at once}} withdrew Russia's support from the French coalition. Prussia began a drive to expel the Austrians from Saxony, and the French from Hesse-Kassel. Though she was only partially successful as her own forces were exhausted, the conflict had essentially descended into <b>a</b> <b>costly</b> stalemate, with Maria Theresa no longer believing that she could retake Silesia. The peace treaties of Hubertusburg and Paris exacted harsh terms from France, as {{she was forced to}} relinquish most of her American colonies.

5|$|On 8 March 1668, the Venetians were victorious in a hard-fought night battle off {{the island}} of St Pelagia, where 2,000 Ottoman troops and 12 galleys {{attempted}} to seize a small Venetian galley squadron.
