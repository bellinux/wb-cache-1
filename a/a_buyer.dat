5|$|Faced {{with growing}} losses {{from the late}} 1990s onwards, the {{government}} offered 40percent of Biman to foreign airlines in 2004, hoping <b>a</b> <b>buyer</b> would take over {{the management of the}} carrier. However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the offer was ignored by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6million in consultancy fees with no positive results.|$|E

5|$|After Rio de Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek <b>a</b> <b>buyer</b> for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|Cementco {{continued}} to transport coral until the mid-1980s, when QCL {{was acquired by}} the firm Holderbank and another ship was purchased to transport clinker to the company's new factory at Gladstone. She was subsequently laid up at Mary Street Wharf while {{attempts were made to}} sell her; during this period she was renamed Crusader II to avoid confusion with a new ship named Cementco. <b>A</b> <b>buyer</b> was not found, and in 1986 Cementco was sunk at Flinders Reef off Cape Moreton where she later became a popular dive wreck.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted <b>a</b> <b>buyer,</b> selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000.

She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and attempts made to find <b>a</b> <b>buyer</b> that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E
5|$|Potter had {{maintained}} {{contact with her}} last governess Annie Carter Moore and had grown fond of her children. Through the 1890s, she sent illustrated story letters to the children. Mrs. Moore recognised the literary and artistic value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish. Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find <b>a</b> <b>buyer</b> for the tale, she published it {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901.|$|E

5|$|When it {{was shown}} at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1825, it {{attracted}} near-universal praise from critics for its technical excellence, its fusion of the styles of different schools of painting, and its subject matter. Nevertheless, it failed to find <b>a</b> <b>buyer</b> at the Summer Exhibition, and was instead bought by fellow artist John Martin. The painting proved too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold {{it on to the}} Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the National Gallery of Scotland, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Due to tank sales, Rheinmetall's L/44 {{tank gun}} has been {{manufactured}} for other nations. For example, the Leopard 2 {{armed with the}} 44 caliber long gun, has been sold to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, and other countries. Egypt had manufactured 700–800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005, and in 2008 requested permission to build another 125 tanks; their M256 main guns (the US version of the L/44) were manufactured by Watervliet Arsenal. The M1A1 has also been exported to Australia, while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The American license-built M256 has also been offered by General Dynamics Land Systems {{as part of the}} M60-2000 Main Battle Tank which would upgrade older M60 Patton tanks to have capabilities of their M1A1 Abrams at a reduced cost, though the company has not yet found <b>a</b> <b>buyer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} <b>a</b> <b>buyer</b> for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who stripped the house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired by the State and opened to the public. In the late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest. The trees have reclaimed most of the land once occupied by the formal gardens: all that remains is the brickwork {{at the rear of the}} Turner glasshouses and the system of irrigation canals and ponds for the exotic plants contained within.|$|E

30|$|Using {{their own}} language, lime bosses {{identified}} an economic principle—failures and frauds in transaction {{were due to}} <b>a</b> <b>buyer’s</b> market in <b>an</b> economic sense; the later emergence of a stable market order {{was the result of}} the development of a seller’s market. In fact, the ultimate cause of these phenomena cannot be attributed to the existence of <b>a</b> <b>buyer’s</b> market before the mid- 1990 s. Even when <b>a</b> <b>buyer’s</b> market has appeared since the 21 st century due to an abundance of supply in the lime market, the phenomena described have seldom occurred. From my observations and analysis, these phenomena have their roots in the prevailing business ethics of “zhongliqingyi (valuing interests above justice)”, in which people are oriented towards material interests with little regard for moral principles.|$|R
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find <b>a</b> <b>buyer,</b> she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E

Nova Corps officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln. A powerful inmate there, Drax, {{attempts to}} kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora has <b>a</b> <b>buyer</b> for the orb, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the Milano.|$|E
5|$|York were relegated {{from the}} Second Division in 1998–99, after {{dropping}} into 21st {{place on the}} last day of the season. In December 2001, long-serving chairman Douglas Craig put the club and its ground up for sale for £4.5million, before announcing that the club would resign from the Football League if <b>a</b> <b>buyer</b> was not found. Motor racing driver John Batchelor took over the club in March 2002, and by December the club had gone into administration. The Supporters' Trust (ST) bought the club in March 2003 after an offer of £100,000 as payment for £160,000 owed in tax was accepted by the Inland Revenue. Batchelor left having diverted almost all of the £400,000 received from a sponsorship deal with Persimmon to his racing team, and having failed to deliver on his promise of having ST members on the board. York failed to win any of their final 20 league fixtures in 2003–04 and finished bottom of the Third Division. This meant the club was relegated to the Football Conference, ending 75 years of Football League membership.|$|E
