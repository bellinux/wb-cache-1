The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, {{a dispute}} formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted {{a rule that}} made <b>any</b> <b>player</b> who had signed an NHL {{contract}} but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that <b>any</b> <b>player</b> contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, {{as long as they}} had not played in any NHL games. This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play. Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs. Murray Costello of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988, but let the individual sport federations decide if they wanted to allow professionals.|$|E

5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve <b>any</b> <b>player</b> who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E
5|$|Hammonds did {{not play}} professionally in 1992 as he competed for the United States {{national}} baseball team in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Hammonds struggled with the national team initially, but agreed to sign with the Orioles in July 1992, receiving a $975,000 signing bonus, the largest of <b>any</b> <b>player</b> chosen in that draft.
