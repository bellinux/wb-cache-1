5|$|<b>Amphetamine</b> is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} <b>amphetamine</b> test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for <b>amphetamine</b> are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription <b>amphetamine,</b> prescription <b>amphetamine</b> prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce <b>amphetamine</b> as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for <b>amphetamine</b> on drug tests. <b>Amphetamine</b> is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amphetamine</b> {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. <b>Amphetamine</b> also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of <b>amphetamine</b> on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, <b>amphetamine</b> may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, <b>amphetamine</b> may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. <b>Amphetamine</b> also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|Inhibitors of {{enzymes that}} {{directly}} metabolize <b>amphetamine</b> (particularly CYP2D6 and FMO3) will prolong {{the elimination of}} <b>amphetamine</b> and increase drug effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amphetamines,</b> due to {{the fact}} it {{increases}} the pH of the renal tubular urine, hence reducing the clearance of <b>amphetamines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cocaine, <b>amphetamines,</b> {{methylphenidate}} and ephedrine {{block the}} reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. With increasing doses, <b>amphetamines</b> also cause the direct release of these neurotransmitters.|$|R
5000|$|Statutory {{classification}} {{of a drug}} as a narcotic often increases the penalties for violation of drug control statutes. For example, although federal law classifies both cocaine and <b>amphetamines</b> as [...] "Schedule II" [...] drugs, the penalty for possession of cocaine {{is greater than the}} penalty for possession of <b>amphetamines</b> because cocaine, unlike <b>amphetamines,</b> is classified as a narcotic.|$|R
5|$|Several {{currently}} prescribed <b>amphetamine</b> formulations contain both enantiomers, including Adderall, AdderallXR, Mydayis, , DyanavelXR, and Evekeo, {{the last}} of which contains racemic <b>amphetamine</b> sulfate. <b>Amphetamine</b> is also prescribed in enantiopure and prodrug form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from <b>amphetamine,</b> and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of racemic <b>amphetamine</b> was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current <b>amphetamine</b> pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. However, oral suspension and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the free base were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>amphetamine</b> are varied, {{and the amount of}} <b>amphetamine</b> used is the primary factor in {{determining}} the likelihood and severity of side effects. <b>Amphetamine</b> products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of <b>amphetamine</b> generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amphetamine</b> {{has also}} been shown to produce a {{conditioned}} place preference in humans taking therapeutic doses, meaning that individuals acquire a preference for spending time in places where they have previously used <b>amphetamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{sympathomimetic}} {{effects may}} in turn {{be caused by}} 5-MeO-AMT's structural similarity to the <b>amphetamines.</b> As noted by Alexander Shulgin, the alpha-methylated tryptamines can be looked at as the tryptamine homologues of the <b>amphetamines</b> (alpha-methylated phenethylamines).|$|R
5000|$|Drugs in {{the class}} of <b>amphetamines,</b> or {{substituted}} <b>amphetamines,</b> are known to induce [...] "amphetamine psychosis" [...] typically when chronically abused or used in high doses. In an Australian study of 309 active methamphetamine users, 18% had experienced a clinical level psychosis in the past year. Common <b>amphetamines</b> include cathinone, DOM, ephedrine, MDMA, methamphetamine, and methcathinone though a large number of such compounds have been synthesized. Methylphenidate is sometimes incorrectly included in this class, although is nonetheless still capable of producing stimulant psychosis.|$|R
5|$|In South Korea, <b>amphetamines</b> are prohibited.|$|R
5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of <b>amphetamine</b> cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} <b>amphetamine</b> is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of <b>amphetamine</b> may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose <b>amphetamine</b> exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E
5|$|USFDA-commissioned {{studies from}} 2011 {{indicate}} that in children, young adults, and adults {{there is no}} association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of <b>amphetamine</b> or other ADHD stimulants. However, <b>amphetamine</b> pharmaceuticals are contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the use, production, {{and import}} of any {{medicine}} containing <b>amphetamine</b> are prohibited.|$|E
50|$|Substituted <b>amphetamines,</b> {{including}} but {{not limited}} to methamphetamine, as well as cocaine, are known to interact with VMAT2. Studies indicate that both <b>amphetamines</b> and cocaine act to increase non-exocytotic release of dopamine in specific regions of the brain by interacting directly with VMAT2 function.|$|R
30|$|Eventually, Professor David Sulzer of Columbia University Medical Center and I {{struck up}} a correspondence. The Sulzer lab studies the {{mechanism}} of action of <b>amphetamines.</b> Over the years, they observed multilamellar bodies in mouse brain cells treated with <b>amphetamines</b> (Larsen et al. 2002; Cubells et al. 1994), These multilamellar bodies resemble membranous structures in yeast cells treated with Zoloft. Sulzer and I wondered if <b>amphetamines</b> and antidepressants, which are both hydrophobic weak bases, might accumulate in multilamellar bodies. I proposed autoradiography as an experimental technique to test this hypothesis. Daniel Korostyshevsky, a technician in my former Princeton lab who mastered electron microscopy techniques required to investigate drug-membrane interactions, signed on as lead experimentalist. With a team in place, the <b>amphetamines</b> distribution project would proceed in the Sulzer lab.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-two {{patients}} with Parkinsonism {{were treated with}} levoamphetamine and 12 of these with dextroamphetamine. Levoamphetamine resulted in a significant improvement in disability from Parkinsonism, although the reduction in total disability, tremor, akinesia, and rigidity scores was slight (ca 20 percent). Dextroamphetamine in lower dosage also reduced disability by some 17 percent. The most disabled patients, including those also on levodopa, showed the greatest response to <b>amphetamines.</b> Previously, <b>amphetamines</b> {{have been reported to}} be a selective treatment for the oculogyric crises of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism. <b>Amphetamines</b> are thought to cause the release of catecholamines from central neurones. Their action in Parkinson's disease may be limited because of pre-existing striatal dopamine deficiency. Side-effects of <b>amphetamines,</b> anorexia, and CNS stimulation are different from those caused by levodopa in {{patients with}} Parkinson's disease...|$|R

5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, <b>amphetamine</b> causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of <b>amphetamine</b> may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E

5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug Obetrol following its mandatory {{withdrawal from the}} market in 1973 under the Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act due to the results of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program (which indicated a lack of efficacy). The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with dextroamphetamine and <b>amphetamine</b> components of the same weight (the other two original dextroamphetamine and <b>amphetamine</b> components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it utterly lacking FDA approval, it still made it onto the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|The coroner {{reported}} that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol {{were found in}} Smith's system {{at the time of}} his death but did find prescribed levels of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including Clonazepam, Mirtazapine, Atomoxetine, and <b>Amphetamine.</b> There were no hesitation wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E
5|$|Zoo or {{laboratory}} rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys. Non-primate mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs.
