5|$|Although the {{military}} conflict essentially {{ended with the}} 1764 expeditions, Native <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> called for resistance in the Illinois Country, where British troops had yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French. A Shawnee war chief named Charlot Kaské emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region, temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence. Kaské traveled {{as far south as}} New Orleans in an effort to enlist French aid against the British.|$|E
5|$|Tenaya's band {{fled the}} valley and sought refuge with the Mono, his mother's tribe. In mid-1853, the Ahwahneechee {{returned}} to the valley, but they subsequently betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing horses that the Mono had taken from non-indigenous ranchers. In return, the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya; Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief. Hostilities subsided and by the mid-1850s local European American residents started to befriend Native <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> living in the Yosemite area.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{state of}} Alabama has 67 counties. Each county {{serves as the}} local level of {{government}} within its borders. The land enclosed by the present state borders was joined to the United States of America gradually. Following the American Revolutionary War, West Florida was ceded to Spain by treaty while the remainder was organized primarily as the Mississippi Territory, and later the Alabama Territory. The territorial assembly established {{some of the earliest}} county divisions that have survived to the present, including the earliest county formation, that of Washington County, created on June 4, 1800. In 1814, the Treaty of Fort Jackson opened the territory to American settlers, which in turn led to a more rapid rate of county creation. Alabama was admitted to the Union as the 22nd state in 1819. The Alabama state legislature formed additional counties from former native lands as the Indian Removal Act took effect and settlers populated different areas of Alabama. In 1820, Alabama had 29 counties. By 1830 there were 36 and Native <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> occupied large areas of land in northeast and far western Alabama. By 1840, 49 counties had been created; 52 by 1850; 65 by 1870; and the present 67 counties by 1903. Houston County was the last county created in the state, on February 9, 1903.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} the HBC {{had over}} the Americans was that it could take such losses. As a vast corporation with {{a large amount of}} capital, the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into their hands and not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable—the HBC had captured the trade. But <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. As long as this continued, the HBC continued to have to pay high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American-Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions of the Alaska Panhandle. This proved to be the final blow for the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening night}} of the {{convention}} saw the keynote speech by Governor Stassen; he subsequently announced his support for Willkie {{and became one of}} the candidate's floor managers. The second night featured a speech by the only living former president, Herbert Hoover, who hoped to stampede the convention to a third nomination. His address went almost unheard in the hall because of problems with the sound system. In the meantime, the Dewey campaign, faced with the German announcement that with France taken, Hitler's forces would sail on Britain, did its best to stem the flow of delegates to Willkie. Negotiations among Dewey, Taft, and Vandenberg came to nothing because none would accept less than the presidential nomination. A blaze of publicity followed Willkie wherever he went, as he caucused with delegates and appeared at press conferences with supporters, including the entire Connecticut delegation. A strong minority of African <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> supported the Republicans, and Willkie met with a group of them, urging those delegates to visit him in the White House in 1941.|$|E

25|$|The {{monument}} {{has been}} the subject of controversy. In Ziółkowski's vision, the sculpted likeness of Crazy Horse is dedicated to the spirit of Crazy Horse and all Native Americans.

While Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear believed in the sincerity of the motives, many Native <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> oppose the intended meaning of the memorial.

25|$|The {{defenders}} of Biazza Ridge managed to capture two 75-mm pack howitzers, which they turned into direct fire weapons {{to defend the}} ridge. One managed to knock {{out one of the}} attacking Tiger tanks. By early evening, the situation had turned grim when six American M4 Sherman tanks suddenly appeared, eliciting cheers from the weary paratroopers, who had been joined by others, including some airborne engineers, infantry, clerks, cooks and truck drivers. With this scratch force and the Shermans, Gavin counterattacked and in so doing deterred the Germans from pressing their considerable advantage. The battle ended with the <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> in control of Biazza Ridge. For his feats of valor that day, Colonel Gavin was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E

25|$|When the Americans {{finally reached}} Valparaíso, Sheffield held a {{conversation}} with the British commodore in charge of the South America Station, Sir Thomas Hardy. Informed of their months of captivity and abuse by Benavides, Hardy agreed to aid the Americans. A ship would be sent to Arauco so as to retrieve the Hersilia and the remaining <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> there. The British warship HMS Conway was selected for the mission, with Sheffield sailing on board. When they reached Arauco however, the British and Americans found the settlement ablaze. Soldiers loyal to the Republic of Chile had fought Benavides and forced him to retreat into the countryside. Prior to leaving his troops set fire to the Hersilia and various buildings in town, including the storehouses containing the seal pelts previously gathered by Sheffield's men. The remaining Americans that didn't previously escape the Royalist camp were found and rejoined their compatriots. Once back at Valparaíso, the Americans arranged for passage back to the United States. Notably the British officers gave funds to make this possible.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{although}} {{the economic system}} became increasingly unfavorable for small farming and ranching, the region had continued economic growth and settlement through a burst of oil booms, and final agricultural wealth {{as a result of}} demands arising from World War I. The subsequent years were another period of demographic chaos, as Mexican bandit attacks once again became commonplace, reaching an apex into the 1920s {{as a result of the}} Mexican Revolution and resultant refugee crisis. The Great Depression caused additional economic losses, further rural population loss, and paradoxical increases in Mexican settlement, as the remaining large landowners sought to maintain their profits by exploiting Mexican cheap labor. This continuing socioeconomic trends resulted in the region having an even mix of Mexican American and American communities of the modern day. As a result of this historical development, many Mexican <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> have close family ties in Mexico. Of American settlers, during the frontier migration era, the vast majority were either East Texans or other Southerners going west for new opportunities. The far northern panhandle area of West Texas also has strong influences from the lower Midwest.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the insurgents were {{equipped}} with Soviet-made weaponry, including 37-mm antiaircraft guns, which {{were to take}} a toll of the U.S. and French aircraft trying to attack their forces, including with napalm, {{in an effort to}} repel them and thus relieve the besieged garrison, which eventually capitulated to Giap's troops on May 7, 1954. In total, the French lost sixty-two aircraft destroyed or severely damaged in the last major battle fought in French Indochina, which, as a colony, was consigned to history with the signing of an agreement in Geneva in July to carve up Vietnam into two countries along the 17th parallel. France, though, was permitted to maintain a small military presence in the new Republic of Vietnam, known to the West as South Vietnam, and the <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> present were also permitted to remain, servicing the Armée de l’Air’s contingent of B-26s and C-47s, plus the C-119s. They even packed parachutes for French airborne troops. The Americans left Vietnam eventually on September 6, 1954, albeit five days after the original leaving date promised by the French. Other Armée de l’Air units were meanwhile dedicating itself to the training of Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF) technical and flight personnel at Nha-Trang.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{passage to}} La Petite Chute {{included}} crossing the Atlantic from Rotterdam to New York City, a train trip {{from there to}} Albany, a train or Erie Canal-barge trip across New York state to Buffalo, steamship travel through the Great Lakes and Green Bay {{to the head of}} the Fox River at Green Bay and finally a 30-mile, ox-cart trip to the mission at La Petite Chute. The first group from Rotterdam arrived on May 22, 1848, led by a Franciscan missionary, Fr Adrianus D. Godthard. Father Van den Broek’s group, held up by an ice jam on Lake Michigan, arrived on June 10, 1848. The emigrants discovered not plowed fields and a village but forested land, being somewhat misled by wording of the De Tijd advertisements: the word “acres” was translated as akkers, meaning cultivated land. There was also not enough good land in Father Van den Broek’s holdings for all the emigrants. There was a resort to drawing straws, with the winners naturally picking the best lots. Many of the others - led by Cornelis van de Heij, a farmer from Zeeland, and Father Godthard - left to form the village of Holland (usually referred to locally as “Hollandtown”) rather than buying the remainder of Father Van den Broek’s land. There were other Europeans, mainly French and Irish emigrants, already established at La Petite Chute, now also known by its semi-anglicized name of “Little Chute.” A few Native <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> lived in the area.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} troubles {{faced by}} corn farmers {{can help to}} explain why so many farmers are losing their farms; with decreased profits, and increased production costs many cannot stay in business. These farmers {{have to move to}} find work elsewhere. Along with this, the preference for monocultural agriculture in producing commodity crops has contributed to the depopulation of many rural areas across the American farm belt. Farming used to include the cultivation of a diversity of crops and livestock on one plot of land. When agriculture revolutionized into an industry with the responsibility to produce as much of a certain commodity as possible, it became more efficient to move the animals and other crops off of the land and use the space to grow commodity crops exclusively. The large supply of corn and other grains that resulted from this change made it more efficient to feed and raise livestock in concentrated animal feeding operations indoors rather than in grass pastures; small scale livestock farmers could not compete with the output produced by factory farms using cheap corn-based feed. The simplified practice of cultivating one crop along with the introduction of the tractor and other mechanized farming equipment resulted in less of a need for labor. Therefore, the output of commodity crops from the industrialized farm increased, while the population of surrounding communities decreased. In the early 1900s one fourth of Americans lived on a farm. Currently, fewer than 2 million <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> farm. According to the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service, America lost 219,500 farms between 1981 and 1986. The remaining fields were merged to form larger operations. A sustainable rural community depends on the income from successful farms. If people are moving elsewhere to find work, either {{as a result of a}} failed farm or the decreased need for labor resulting from machines, the local economy suffers. With fewer people to support the economy and to provide a tax base, local businesses, churches, schools and clinics may have to close their doors.|$|E
500|$|American English {{is fairly}} {{homogeneous}} compared to British English. Today, American accent variation is often increasing {{at the regional}} level and decreasing at the very local level, though most <b>Americans</b> <b>still</b> speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents, known collectively as General American (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves (such as Midland and Western American English).
