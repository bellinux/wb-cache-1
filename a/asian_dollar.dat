40|$|January 2003 Before {{the crisis}} of 1997 - 98, the East Asian economies—except for Japan but {{including}} China— pegged their currencies to the US dollar. To avoid further turmoil, the IMF now argues that these currencies should float more freely. However, our econometric estimations show that the dollar’s predominant weight in East Asian currency baskets has returned to its pre-crisis levels. By 2002, the day-to-day volatility of each country’s exchange rate against the dollar has again become negligible. In addition, most governments are rapidly accumulating a “war chest” of official dollar reserves, which portends that this exchange rate stabilization will come to extend over months or quarters. From the doctrine of “original sin” applied to emerging-market economies, we argue that this fear of floating is entirely rational {{from the perspective of}} each individual country. And their joint pegging to the dollar benefits the East <b>Asian</b> <b>dollar</b> bloc as a whole, although Japan remains an important outlier. Working Papers Index...|$|E
40|$|Both {{before and}} after the <b>Asian</b> crisis, the <b>dollar</b> has been the {{dominant}} anchor and reserve currency in East Asia. Due to underdeveloped capital markets and the limited international role of their domestic currencies, the East Asian countries (except Japan) are likely to continue to stabilize exchange rates and to accumulate international reserves. Yet expectations of further dollar depreciation may trigger a re-orientation of exchange rate policies based on basket strategies. Rolling econometric estimations of the basket structures in East Asia suggest growing weights for the Japanese yen in most East Asian currency baskets.

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Dominican economy is the Free Trade Zone industry (FTZ), which made up U.S. $4.55 billion in Dominican exports for 2006 (70% of total exports). Reports show, however, that the FTZs lost approximately 60,000 between 2005 and 2007 and suffered a 4% decrease in total exports in 2006. The textiles sector experienced an approximate 17% drop in exports {{due in part to the}} appreciation of the Dominican peso against the <b>dollar,</b> <b>Asian</b> competition following expiration of the quotas of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, and a government-mandated increase in salaries, which should have occurred in 2005 but was postponed to January 2006. Lost Dominican business was captured by firms in Central America and Asia. The tobacco, jewelry, medical, and pharmaceutical sectors in the FTZs all reported increases for 2006, which somewhat offset textile and garment losses. Industry experts from the FTZs expected that entry into force of the CAFTA-DR agreement will promote substantial growth in the FTZ sector for 2007.|$|R
40|$|In the European discourse, {{opponents of}} {{monetary}} union argued that giving up one’s own currency signifies {{the loss of}} a forceful policy instrument. By analyzing monetary policy decisions of national central banks, the paper shows that member countries of the European Monetary System (except Germany) had already abandoned monetary and exchange rate autonomy long before entering European Monetary Union (EMU), and that Germany has in fact been the only country that actually lost sovereignty through EMU. Virtually all other euro countries have regained a voice in monetary policy decisions through EMU membership. Likewise, the paper argues that the current (informal) “East <b>Asian</b> <b>dollar</b> standard”, i. e. the common (soft) dollar pegging toward the US dollar, has created a situation in which East Asian countries (except Japan) have largely abandoned monetary policy autonomy. Through a process of multilateral monetary integration that could eventually culminate {{in the creation of a}} common regional currency, East Asian countries could potentially resume some degrees of shared monetary independence...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the debt markets in Singapore {{has been one of}} the key components of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s attempts to enhance Singapore’s role as an international financial centre. The debt markets in Singapore are made up of three major segments: the Singapore government securities (SGS) market, the <b>Asian</b> <b>dollar</b> bond market, and the Singapore dollar corporate bond market. Despite the fact that the government has run budget surpluses since the 1980 s and maintains huge reserves, the government securities market remains the biggest segment of the debt markets in Singapore. This paper describes the growth and structure of debt markets in Singapore and examines the factors that have hindered the {{development of}} these two markets. It also discusses the measures taken by the Monetary Authority to promote these markets and the challenges that lie ahead. Finally, it outlines the lessons from the Singapore experience.

40|$|For {{more than}} a decade before the great crisis of 1997 - 98, East Asian {{countries}} pegged "softly" to the U. S. dollar. In the period of currency chaos from mid 1997 through 1998 with exchange depreciations in eight East Asian countries, massive deflationary pressure in dollar terms which was unleashed in the whole East Asian region. Surprisingly, however, the post-crisis exchange rate regime in 1999 into 2000 again exhibits high frequency pegging to the dollar much like the pre-crisis regime. In 1999 - 2000, there was (is) a "honeymoon" effect where short-term rates of interest in the crisis economies remained unusually low so that hot money flows were temporarily muted. But this honeymoon will end as the crisis recedes in time. Finally, I explore how the informal "rules of the game" under which the East <b>Asian</b> <b>dollar</b> standard operates might be improved to (1) lengthen the term structure of finance-including exchange rate obligations-to make the system more resilient, and (2) tighten bank regulation so as to reduce moral hazard in international capital flows. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} countries, remittances play a {{key role}} as a source of external finance. Remittances are a form of aid that migrant workers send back to their families, located in their home countries, in order to support the needs of the household. In about 25 % of developing countries, remittances are larger than public and private capital flows combined (International Monetary Fund, 2009). In 2008, the Philippines economy was the 47 th largest economy in the world with a GDP of $ 322 billion <b>dollars</b> (<b>Asian</b> Development Bank, Fact Sheet). Remittances accounted for over 10 % of the Philippine economy, making the Philippines one of the world’s highest remittance receiving countries. Using a probit model and an OLS regression model focusing on the Philippines in 2003, this paper will focus on exploring what variables influence the decision to send a household member away for work, what factors contribute to whether or not a household receives a remittance and if they do, how these same characteristics affect the value of the remittance...|$|R
40|$|The European Community (EC) grain exports {{increased}} significantly {{over the last}} three decades. The EC's Project 1992 will abolish internal trade barriers to facilitate the movement of goods, persons, services, and capital between member countries. One aspect of the program is elimination of border taxes and subsidies (called MCAs) on agricultural commodities. Coupled with internal pressures to reduce agricultural budget expenditures, the EC- 1992 program has affected agricultural policy by weakening the role of the price intervention system. Baseline projections indicate that total EC 10 grain production will continue to increase as average yields increase 2 % to 2. 5 % a year. Eliminating MCAs and continuing stabilizers (scenario 1) would slightly increase grain production above baseline as member countries'exchange rate policies adjust. Total EC 10 grain production will increase 2 % a year over baseline in 1995 - 2000, but eliminating the CAP and returning to a pre-CAP growth path for yields (scenario 2) would produce a decline in grain production below baseline in 2000. Under scenario 1, developing countries'net import costs for grains fall slightly and imports rise. By 2000, the cost of grain imports for all developing countries fall US$ 153 (constant 1985 <b>dollars).</b> <b>Asian</b> and Middle Eastern countries save the most. Under scenario 2, the return to historical yields increases developing countries'cost for grain imports by an estimated US$ 906 million.

40|$|This paper scrutinises {{the state}} of RMB {{internationalisation}} and its likely progress over the coming years and discusses its implications for currency co-operation in East Asia. As part of its internationalisation, the RMB is gradually delinked from the dollar, which will effectively {{put an end to}} the East <b>Asian</b> <b>dollar</b> standard that has shaped the region's financial architecture over the last three decades and that has provided a relatively high degree of intra-regional exchange rate stability. Because of the close trade and investment ties that have developed across the region, the East Asian countries, especially the ASEAN countries which are striving to create an ASEAN Economic Community, will continue to manage their exchange rates and stabilise their currencies against one another to facilitate cross-border investment and commerce. But instead of a replacing of the dollar standard with an RMB standard we are likely to see some rather loose and informal exchange rate co-operation in East Asia based on currency baskets, with China herself moving towards a managed exchange rate system guided by a currency basket.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1960 s {{a number of}} {{international}} financial centers have emerged in Asia. These centers are major meeting places for internationally mobile funds. The rapid economic growth in many Asian countries combined with their various stages of economic development has increased the flow of funds across countries. This in turn has induced internationally renowned banks to establish branches in Asia to facilitate the cross-border flow of funds. Singa-pore has had {{a head start on}} other Asian centers as it was the first to allow a foreign bank to operate an offshore banking unit, as far back as 1968. ' This unit, also known as the Asian Currency Unit (ACU) or the <b>Asian</b> <b>Dollar</b> Mar-ket, was created by removing the withholding tax on interest paid to nonresi-dents for the placement of foreign currency deposits. * Since then, other banks in Singapore have followed suit by setting up their own ACUs. Like Singapore, Hong Kong has gradually evolved into an international financial center. The transformation of Hong Kong gained momentum after 1978 when the govern-ment lifted its moratorium on the issuance of new banking licenses. In 1986...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the rapid}} {{worldwide}} expansion of Chinese exports, particularly to the United States, many people have called for China to revalue the yuan or allow it to float upward against the dollar. But the analysis should {{not be limited to}} China. Floating exchange rates are not {{in the best interests of}} the ever more closely integrated East Asian economies, most of which are also rapidly accumulating dollar exchange reserves. Nor would a general exchange appreciation of East Asian currencies be a panacea for reducing the U. S. trade deficit. Instead, these countries would be better served by providing certainty for investors and businesses by pegging their currencies to the dollar in the near term, and possibly creating an “Asian Euro ” in the longer term. Before the 1997 - 98 crisis, the East Asian economies—except for Japan— informally pegged their currencies to the U. S. dollar. These soft dollar pegs made them vulnerable to fluctuations of the yen against the dollar, and the yen’s depreciation from mid- 1995 into 1997 - 98 aggravated the great Asian crisis. To limit future exchange rate misalignments and “hot ” money flows, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) argues that East Asian currencies should float more freely. Alternatively, several authors have proposed increasing the weight of the yen in the currency baskets of the smaller East Asian economies. However, I argue that the East <b>Asian</b> <b>dollar</b> pegs are entirely rational from the perspective of each country—both to facilitate hedging by merchants and banks against exchange rate risk, and to help central banks anchor their domestic price levels. Central bank behavior supports my position. In 2003, the day-to-day volatility of each country’s dollar exchange rate is not significantly different from its pre-crisis level...|$|E
