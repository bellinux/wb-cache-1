Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> a subject for open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> early as the 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E

Brittlegills, such as Russula heterophylla, R.aeruginea, and R.virescens, can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of both volva and ring. Other similar species include A.subjunquillea in eastern Asia and A.arocheae, which ranges from Andean Colombia north <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> far as central Mexico, both of which are also poisonous.|$|E

Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance.
