5|$|The {{complexity}} of an <b>appropriation</b> {{depends upon the}} city council's preferences; real-world appropriations can list hundreds of line item amounts. An <b>appropriation</b> is the legal authority for spending given by the city council to the various agencies of the city government. In the example above, the city can {{spend as much as}} $34 million, but smaller <b>appropriation</b> limits have also been established for individual programs and departments.|$|E

5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army <b>appropriation</b> bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the <b>appropriation.</b> The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an <b>appropriation</b> without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Robert C. Byrd {{allocated}} $8 {{million to}} federal <b>appropriation</b> bills for the Superblock project.

5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} <b>appropriation</b> and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the <b>appropriation</b> of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Senate <b>Appropriations</b> Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development is one {{of twelve}} {{subcommittees}} of the U.S. Senate Committee on <b>Appropriations.</b> The United States Senate Committee on <b>Appropriations</b> has joint jurisdiction with the United States House Committee on <b>Appropriations</b> over all <b>appropriations</b> bills in the United States Congress. Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees, {{each of which is}} tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular <b>appropriations</b> bills.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>appropriations</b> bills: regular <b>appropriations</b> bills, {{continuing}} resolutions, and supplemental <b>appropriations</b> bills. Regular <b>appropriations</b> bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding {{for the federal government}} for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1. If Congress has not enacted the regular <b>appropriations</b> bills by the time, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing <b>appropriations</b> at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. The third type of <b>appropriations</b> bills are supplemental <b>appropriations</b> bills, which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated {{at the beginning of the}} fiscal year. Supplemental <b>appropriations</b> bills can be used for things like disaster relief.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the costs}} for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been funded through regular <b>appropriations</b> bills, but through {{emergency}} supplemental <b>appropriations</b> bills. As such, most of these expenses {{were not included in}} the budget deficit calculation prior to FY2010. Some budget experts argue that emergency supplemental <b>appropriations</b> bills do not receive the same level of legislative care as regular <b>appropriations</b> bills. In addition, emergency supplemental <b>appropriations</b> are not subject to the same budget enforcement mechanisms imposed on regular <b>appropriations.</b> Funding for the first stages of the Vietnam War was provided by supplemental <b>appropriations,</b> although President Johnson eventually acceded to Congressional demands to fund that war through the regular <b>appropriations</b> process.|$|R
5|$|Prior to Whitlam's dismissal, the Labor {{leadership}} {{decided to}} introduce a motion that the Senate pass the <b>appropriation</b> bills. With ALP senators unaware of Whitlam's sacking, that plan went ahead. Senator Doug McClelland, manager of the ALP Government's business in the Senate, informed Coalition Senate leader Reg Withers of Labor's intent at about 1.30. Withers then attended a leadership meeting and learned of Fraser's appointment; he assured the new Prime Minister he could secure supply. When the Senate convened, the ALP Senate leader, Ken Wriedt, made the motion. Even as Wriedt did so, {{he was told that}} the government had been sacked, which he initially refused to believe. Authoritative word did not reach Wriedt until 2.15pm, by which time {{it was too late to}} withdraw the motion and instead obstruct his party's <b>appropriation</b> bill to hinder Fraser. At 2.24pm, Labor's <b>appropriation</b> bills passed the Senate, fulfilling Fraser's first promise of providing supply.|$|E
5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army <b>appropriation</b> bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the <b>appropriation.</b> The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an <b>appropriation</b> without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E

5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored research, with the 1943–1944 budget being the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state <b>appropriation).</b> Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the state had cut the station's <b>appropriation</b> by 40 percent, but increased support from industry and government eventually counteracted low state support. The electronics and communications research that Directors Gerald Rosselot and James E. Boyd attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were {{a study on the}} propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy-sponsored radar research.|$|E
5|$|A refined {{estimate}} of $1.1billion ($2.74 billion in 2007 dollars) was determined {{in a study}} by the International Trade Commission {{at the request of the}} United States Congress.

5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an <b>appropriation</b> was no different from allowing him to spend an <b>appropriation</b> at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E
