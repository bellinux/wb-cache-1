5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived him, and {{had no intention of}} making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> <b>that</b> he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{government}} announcement appeared on television, Kujau took {{his wife and}} mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the forger, and hearing that Stern had paid ninemillion DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor; the forger agreed to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use {{a variation of the}} story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of Sterns money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann knew <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.|$|E

5|$|The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed {{their enemy}} {{to have the}} {{battlefield}} of his choosing. Even then they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid knew <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until {{the last day of}} the battle, he conducted an essentially defensive campaign suited to his relatively limited resources. When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a numerically inferior force and needed all the men he could muster, he nevertheless had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat he anticipated for the enemy army.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the guilty}} pleas, Darrow {{was criticized for}} using {{deception}} {{to raise money for}} his clients' defense: allowing supporters to believe in their innocence, in order to raise a war chest of $200,000 from contributions by working men, and spend about $100,000 of it to mount an expensive effort, while knowing <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> the McNamara brothers were guilty. Darrow said that his first duty was to his clients, and that he did whatever needed to raise the funds for the best defense possible.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a {{non-profit}} group which {{assisted in the}} search for Caylee from July to December 2008 when she was believed to be missing, sued Anthony for fraud and unjust enrichment. TES estimates that it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead. TES founder and director Tim Miller estimates that the abortive search for Caylee expended 40% of the group's yearly resources which could have been spent looking for other missing children. It only learned that Anthony knew <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> Caylee was dead when the trial began. TES and Anthony eventually settled out of court on October 18, 2013. TES was listed as a creditor to Anthony and was entitled to $75,000.|$|E

25|$|Rose Tyler (Jennifer Ferrin) — Sam's mother. Struggling to {{make ends}} meet, she takes out a loan from a gangster, forcing Adult Sam {{to step in and}} protect her. Due to the situation, Sam uses the {{pseudonym}} Luke Skywalker instead of revealing his real last name to her. Her BBC counterpart is Ruth Tyler (Joanne Froggatt in 1973 & Judi Jones in 2006). Changing her name in the American version brought the name full-circle; Sam Tyler's surname was selected by writer Matthew Graham's daughter in homage to Doctor Who companion Rose Tyler. In the last episode, Sam finally reveals his real name to his mother, who smiles, having suspected <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> he was her son in an older incarnation.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed clear}} <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> the Republican {{dominance}} would render this a no-contest and the Republicans were {{just waiting for}} all of their votes to be present, but the Federalists had one last defense. A marathon session of debate, lasting from 11 A.M. to 10 P.M., was {{the order of the}} day on December 2, 1803. Most notably, Uriah Tracy of Connecticut argued in a similar vein as Adams when he invoked the federative principle of the Constitution. For Tracy, the original two-vote system was formulated in order to give the small states a chance to elect the Vice President, who would be a check on the President’s powers. In essence, the states balanced the power of the people. However, this only works if you make it partisan, as Georgia (for example) was a Republican small state.|$|E

500|$|After A. Bouchard's 1981 {{dismissal}} from Blue Öyster Cult, he and Pearlman {{worked on}} the material, having secured an advance from Columbia Records {{on the strength of}} the demos partially sung by Eric Bloom. The initial concept of a trilogy of double albums, largely based on music written during the band's many years of activity and on adapted and rewritten Pearlman [...] lyrics linked by the Imaginos storyline, is reflected in the working titles: Act I: Imaginos, Act II: Germany Minus Zero and Counting (also known as Bombs over Germany and Half-Life Time), and Act III: The Mutant Reformation. These were intended as Albert Bouchard solo albums, a spin-off of Blue Öyster Cult main discography, although some fan opinion holds that Columbia Records had intended <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> the recordings would result in a new Blue Öyster Cult album.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> <b>that</b> she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E
500|$|Taraborrelli {{commented that}} [...] "in the end, the events {{surrounding}} 'Like a Prayer' only served to enhance Madonna's reputation as a shrewd businesswoman, someone {{who knows how to}} sell a concept." [...] Before Madonna's deal with Pepsi, pop stars in general were not given much artistic freedom by sponsors. However, Madonna {{made it a point to}} have the commercial be dictated by her. While she said that it was never her intention for Pepsi to get entangled in the controversy of the music video, Taraborrelli observed that Madonna stayed true to herself. Although the commercial intended to promote Pepsi the soft drink, she did not bother to hold even a can of the product, leading the author to comment that [...] "Madonna the pop star was going to do it her way, no matter what Madonna the businesswoman had agreed to do". She maintained <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> the Pepsi commercial and the music video were two different commodities and she was right to stand her ground. Taraborrelli noted that after [...] "Like a Prayer", the recruitment of pop stars and athletes to sell soft drinks became commonplace. However, none of them generated the level of excitement on par with Pepsi's failed deal with Madonna.|$|E

500|$|Supporters of Rangel {{argued that}} by {{comparison}} with previous cases, a reprimand {{would be a more}} fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure. [...] Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> <b>that</b> nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. [...] It was to no avail. [...] On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. [...] Ethics committee chair Zoe Lofgren emphasized that it was Rangel's [...] "accumulation of actions" [...] that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. [...] A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi's allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down. [...] The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. Per custom, Rangel went to the well of the House to hear Speaker Pelosi solemnly read the formal measure of censure. It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the 23rd House member to be censured. Rangel asked to speak and said, [...] "I know in my heart I am not going to be judged by this Congress. I’ll be judged by my life in its entirety." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Psychology of Joss Whedon, two {{academic}} psychologists identify {{the source of}} Buffy's strength as her mother, paired with Giles' mentorship. Joyce did not know <b>all</b> <b>along</b> <b>that</b> Buffy was a Slayer and had difficulty accepting what her daughter was called to do. She was nonetheless always attentive and available when Buffy's confidence was shaken, and both Joyce's and Giles' devotion to her [...] "gave her the self-assurance to wield her power to its full potential". Joyce served as a parent figure to all of Buffy's friends, whose home lives were often unstable or unloving, thus making her death more poignant to all of them. Willow mentions her parents several times throughout the series, but her father is never seen. Her mother is portrayed only once in [...] "Gingerbread", at first as an academic so preoccupied with her career that she is unable to communicate with Willow, and then—with Joyce—under the spell of a demon and {{in the throes of}} moral panic, attempting to burn her own daughter at the stake for being involved in witchcraft. Xander's parents are described by him and those who have been to his house as alcoholic and verbally abusive. Even Anya, severely wanting in social graces, has lost someone she admires and trusts. Giles also grieves for the loss of a friend and—in one episode when the adults fall under a spell making them retreat into an adolescent state—a lover. Lorna Jowett in Sex and the Slayer writes that Joyce represents stability and normality. For the Scoobies, her death destroys the illusion that normal life is trouble-free; it is just as challenging as encountering supernatural forces.|$|E
