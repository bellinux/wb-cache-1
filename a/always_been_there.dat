500|$|To {{make the}} project ready for theaters, Lasseter {{would need to}} add 12 minutes or so of {{material}} and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since {{it could not be}} mere padding—it would have to feel as if it had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> an organic part of the film. With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, Joe Ranft, and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. [...] There, he hosted what he called a [...] "story summit", a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2002, Linkin Park {{released}} an album entitled Reanimation. It included {{the songs of}} Hybrid Theory remixed and reinterpreted by nu metal and underground hip hop artists. Contributors to the album included Black Thought, Pharoahe Monch, Jonathan Davis, Stephen Carpenter, and Aaron Lewis. The sound of later Linkin Park albums would involve experimentation with classical instruments such as strings and piano, both of which, along with the same elements of electronica from Hybrid Theory, are prominently included in the band's second studio album Meteora. As Shinoda explains {{the difference in the}} sound between Hybrid Theory and Meteora: [...] "That electronic element has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> in the band – it's just that sometimes we bring it closer to the front." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{although}} [...] "Keep It Together" [...] sonically {{pays tribute to}} Sly and the Family Stone, the lyrics talk about the realization of how important Madonna's family has been {{as a form of}} stability in her life, especially in the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They've <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for me, We have a connection, Home is where the heart should be". The lyrics follow the course of Madonna's rise from figuratively being a [...] "hungry sibling" [...] ("I'm gonna leave this place, So I can forget every single hungry face") to being a superstar ("I hit the big time but I still get the blues, Everyone's a stranger, City life can get to you").|$|E

500|$|Billington {{observes that}} [...] "The {{break-up}} with Vivien {{and the new}} life with Antonia {{was to have a}} profound effect on Pinter's personality and his work," [...] though he adds that Fraser herself did not claim to have influence over Pinter or his writing. In her own contemporaneous diary entry dated 15 January 1993, Fraser described herself more as Pinter's [...] literary midwife. Indeed, she told Billington that [...] "other people [...] had a shaping influence on [...] politics" [...] and attributed changes in his writing and political views to a change from [...] "an unhappy, complicated personal life... to a happy, uncomplicated personal life", so that [...] "a side of Harold which had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> was somehow released. [...] I think you can see that in his work after No Man's Land , which was a very bleak play." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't {{think they do}} have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience — {{one of those things}} that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E

He found her a new manager and they've remained close: [...] "Uncle Don and Auntie Shirl have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lila Acheson Wallace, {{co-founder of}} Reader's Digest, had at first {{anonymously}} provided the $50,000 donation {{to make the}} move and reconstruction possible. As Friends of Boscobel became Boscobel Restoration, Inc., she took a more public role as a director particularly in overseeing the landscaping and interior decoration. Richard K. Webel designed grounds for the new site that bore little resemblance to its original surroundings, instead taking the [...] "country house" [...] style popular in the early 20th century.

2500|$|On June 3, 2011, Against Me! {{announced}} that they started their own record label, Total Treble Music. [...] In November 2011, the band started working on [...] "new material" [...] for the next album. It {{turned out to be}} a false start, they scrapped it and went on tour. They started recording the album again in February 2012 at Total Treble Studio, with Grace taking complete creative control, acting as both recording engineer and record producer for the album. In May 2012, Grace publicly came out as transgender. Bowman recalled that [...] "he wasn't really surprised" [...] when Grace came out, because when he thought about it, [...] "the signs had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> especially if you listen to the lyrics". In June 2012, Bowman threw the first pitch at a Ray's baseball game. Weinberg left the band in December 2012. [...] He was eventually replaced by Atom Willard. Seward left the band in 2013, he was replaced by Inge Johansson.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{nothing else}} {{has changed from}} {{experimental}} configuration to experimental configuration, and since {{in the first case}} the photon is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a particle and in the second case it is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a wave, Wheeler wanted to know whether, experimentally, a time could be determined at which the photon made its [...] "decision." [...] Would it be possible to let a photon pass through the region of the first beam-splitter while there was no beam-splitter in the second position, thus causing it to [...] "decide" [...] to travel, and then quickly let the second beam-splitter pop up into its path? Having presumably traveled as a particle up to that moment, would the beam splitter let it pass through and manifest itself as would a particle were that second beam splitter not to be there? Or, would it behave as though the second beam-splitter had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there?</b> Would it manifest interference effects? And if it did manifest interference effects then to have done so it must have gone back in time and changed its decision about traveling as a particle to traveling as a wave. Note that Wheeler wanted to investigate several hypothetical statements by obtaining objective data.|$|E

2500|$|... "Wannabe", {{the most}} emblematic {{song of the}} Girl Power philosophy, {{was chosen as the}} first track and lead single of the album. It {{highlights}} the slogans the group tend to cite like the union and solidarity between friends and the power exercised by women over men. Despite negative reviews from critics who found the track as [...] "more a compendium of music styles than an actual song", and the group's image as a [...] "pro-woman posing that project lots of false confidence", it was commercially successful, topping the charts in 35 countries, and selling over six million copies worldwide. The second single [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] described the things the group had been through together and how they had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for each other. It received mixed reviews; some critics praised it as a catchy song, while others dubbed it as merely a bid for credibility, while others described the lyrics as [...] "confusing". The single was successful, debuting at number-one in the United Kingdom, and peaking at number three in the United States. The third single [...] "2 Become 1" [...] focused upon the bonding of lovers, and how the bond can become so strong that they practically become one entity, through the act of sex; in addition, the lyrics address the importance of contraception. The single received positive reviews from critics, it became the third number-one from the album in the United Kingdom, and peaked at four in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Although Mark {{was desperate}} for Tricia to have chemotherapy, she proved reluctant, {{deciding}} that her previous cycles {{had been too}} grueling. Terrified that he might lose her, Mark proposed that they remarry. [...] Initially, Tricia turned him down, with Sharon Maughan explaining: [...] "She doesn't like the thought of saying 'til death do us part', knowing she's dying. Tricia's still in denial and doesn't want to admit she hasn't got long. She feels everything is accelerating out of her control." [...] However, following an incident which saw the two characters taken hostage at work, Tricia rethought her decision. [...] "It scares her and makes her realise that Mark's <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for her; he offers a safe place away from the crazy world that's out there". The two remarried in the hospital peace garden in episode [...] "Now or Never", with Chrissie and colleague Lola Griffin as witnesses. Tricia then underwent experimental surgery to excise her cancer, and she and Mark were delighted when it {{appeared to have been}} successful. [...] They planned a second honeymoon in New York City, however, en route to the airport were involved in a road traffic accident. Tricia suffered serious injuries, and although she was stabilized in theatre by Diane Lloyd, her condition soon thereafter worsened, leaving Mark and Chrissie conflicted over how to continue with her treatment. [...] Maughan explained: [...] "Mark and Chrissie have completely opposing views. He's desperate to do anything he can and wants to put Tricia on a life support machine, but Chrissie is saying 'Stop, she's never going to be the same'." [...] Ultimately, the two agreed to let Tricia pass away in peace.|$|E
2500|$|Inside Soap Kate White later {{focused on}} Michael, {{saying that she}} could [...] "easily believe the worst of Michael Moon." [...] She said it seems [...] "unimaginable" [...] {{that he would have}} the time or energy for an affair, but she [...] "still wouldn't put it past the {{slippery}} eel." [...] She noted that Michael is the only suspect who has previously been involved with Kat, and that it was an emotional affair, rather than just a fling, so with Alfie being distant and Janine pushing Michael away, White said [...] "we don't reckon it would take much for these two to start seeing each other again." [...] She said that Michael has the means, unlike some of the others, as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement before they married, and the flat that Kat's lover obtained could be listed on the books of Janine's property management business, Butcher's Joints. However, White went on to say, [...] "something tells us Kat would find it very difficult to live with herself if she was sleeping with a man whose baby is in a bad way. It seems too cruel for a mother who went though the agony of thinking she'd lost her child, so we're not sure at could cause another mum that degree of heartache. Then again, that other woman is Kat's loathed enemy, Janine." [...] Shepherd said that Kat and Michael had [...] "nice chemistry" [...] and opined that Michael [...] "would have been very keen" [...] on a relationship with Kat, that [...] "the opportunity for Michael and Kat to team up has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> from the moment he arrived" [...] and that the writers are placed [...] "lots of little hints to insinuate that it could be Michael". Michael was the second suspect to be eliminated, on 14 September 2012.|$|E

2500|$|After {{they decided}} on the filming {{location}} of BBC Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, Smith and Holland set about creating the 23 characters needed, in just 14 days. They took a holiday in Playa de los Pocillos, Lanzarote, and started to create the characters. Holland created the Beale and Fowler family, drawing on his own background. His mother, Ethel Holland, {{was one of four}} sisters raised in Walthamstow. Her eldest sister, Lou, had married a man named Albert Beale and had two children, named Peter and Pauline. These family members were the basis for Lou Beale, Pete Beale and Pauline Fowler. Holland also created Pauline's unemployed husband Arthur Fowler, their children Mark Fowler and Michelle Fowler, Pete's wife Kathy Beale and their son Ian Beale. Smith used her personal memories of East End residents she met when researching Victorian squares. Ethel Skinner was based on an old woman she met in a pub, with ill-fitting false teeth, and a [...] "face to rival a neon sign", holding a Yorkshire Terrier {{in one hand and a}} pint of Guinness in the other. Other characters created included Jewish doctor Harold Legg, the Anglo-Cypriot Osman family, Ali Osman, Sue Osman and baby Hassan Osman, black father and son, Tony Carpenter and Kelvin Carpenter, single mother Mary Smith and Bangladeshi couple Saeed Jeffery and Naima Jeffery. Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring [...] "flash, trash, and melodrama" [...] to the Square (they were later renamed Den Watts, Angie Watts and Sharon Watts). The characters of Andy O'Brien and Debbie Wilkins were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and Lofty Holloway to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.|$|E
