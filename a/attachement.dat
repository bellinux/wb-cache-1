50|$|Ordonné prêtre en France en 1787, Jean Mandé SIGOGNE (né le 6 avril 1763) a aussitôt été nommé vicaire à Manthelan, dans le diocèse de Tours. Pendant quatre ans, il exerce le ministère sacerdotal dans cette paroisse. C'est surtout vers la fin de 1791 qu'ont commencé ses tracas avec les républicains et la Révolution française (voir aussi un sermon de Sigogne sur les maux de la Révolution française). Les convulsions politiques de cette Révolution se sont déclenchées à proprement parler en 1789, mais c'est plutôt à partir de l'été 1790 qu'ont débuté les {{complications}} pour le clergé en général et pour Sigogne en particulier.La Constitution civile du clergé fut le principal facteur conduisant aux graves conflits du clergé avec les républicains. Elle visait à subordonner étroitement l'Église catholique romaine à l'État et elle voulait appliquer résolument le principe de la souveraineté de la nation à la désignation des autorités religieuses. Cette Constitution provoquait des conséquences des plus sérieuses au clergé voulant demeurer fidèle à son sacerdoce et témoigner de son <b>attachement</b> à Rome. C'est le cas surtout de Sigogne qui voyait désintégrer les fondements même d'une société catholique où il avait cru jusque-là pouvoir exercer son sacerdoce. Liberté de conscience, droit du citoyen d'adhérer à la religion de son choix, déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen, toutes ces modifications fondamentales à la société française de l'Ancien Régime plongent Sigogne dans un profond conflit non seulement avec lui-même mais encore avec les autorités républicaines. Sur le plan de sa conscience religieuse et sacerdotale, le jeune prêtre ne pouvait plus tolérer l'affront fondamental que lui faisait la Révolution. Fort de ses ardentes convictions à l'endroit de l'Église catholique romaine, il demeure stoïque dans son engagement de baptisé et dans ses promesses sacerdotales de fidélité au pape. Cela lui coûte bien des sacrifices personnels. Il doit abandonner son ministère sacerdotal, sinon clandestinement, et il finit par s'exiler à l'été 1792 à Londres, Angleterre, refuge de quelque milliers d'émigrés français, la plupart ecclésiastiques échappant, comme lui, aux atrocités de la Révolution.|$|E

The products of streams are highly appropriate to be transported downstream than reaching the river bottom (Schönborn, 2003). Most of the organic matter available in streams is of allochthonious origin, as leaves from the riparian zones (99 %). After entering the stream, allochtonious material undergoes three phases of processing: leaching, microbial colonization (conditioning) and fragmentation by physical forces and invertebrate feeding (Fisher and Likens, 1973).

Those files are stored in the local filesystem and also in a number of remote data sources, such as network shares or as <b>attachements</b> to emails. To handle this heterogeneous and distributed mix of personal information, data processing logic is reinvented inside each application. This results in an unfortunate situation: most advanced data management functionality, such as complex queries, backup and recovery, versioning, provenance tracking, among others, is (at least partially) performed by endusers in tedious, manual tasks. To solve these problems we propose a software platform named iMeMex that brings physical and logical data independence to the desktop, freeing users from low-level data management considerations. Unlike in relational DBMSes, our platform does not assume full control of the data, but rather manages the complex dataspace [11] of one’s personal information. We discuss several research challenges encountered building such a platform: (i) the definition of a unified data model that allows the integration of information in distinct representations and locations without requiring semantic data integration, (ii) {{the development of a new}} search&query language over this data model along with algorithms for the efficient processing of complex queries and (iii) the need for soft update and recoverability techniques to provide durability and consistency of personal information. 1...|$|R

40|$|During {{the recent}} years the {{radiation}} of walking noise ("drum sound") of laminate floor coverings has become an important product property for marketing. Producers of floors are optimizing their products using attached underlays to attenuate drum sound, and the EPLF developed a measurement and evaluation procedure in cooperation with research institutes: A modified tapping machine is operating on the sample area laid in a test room with concrete floor and sufficient sound absorption. The stationary sound signal is recorded and post-processed using the Zwicker loudness analysis. The result is an overall loudness value (in Sone) and a diagram of specific loudness where the frequency components of the sound can be assessed. Today, very different types of underlay <b>attachements</b> for drum sound attenuation are in use. The range of materials comprises duroplastic or thermoplastic coatings, more or less stiff thermoplastic mats, recycled plastics, rubber mats, and soft fibre boards. Experiences from measurements for many floor and underlay products carried out at WKI show that the materials can perform very differently. But {{this is not only}} due to the type of underlay of floor material. Drum sound attenuation is a combined effect of laminate properties, thickness and stiffness of the underlay and the laying method. The difference of overall loudness values between "silent" and "loud" products can be up to 25 Sone. Typical for laminate floorings are a lower frequency peak (400 [...] . 1000 Hz) - probably caused by resonance effects between the areas mass of the laminate flooring and the stiffness and thickness of the underlay - and another peak at 2000 [...] . 3000 Hz corresponding to a "rattling" sound from the hard covering. Some products with underlays show a good attenuation of "rattling" sound components, others a shift of the low-frequency components in the spectra. The technical development of material combinations with improved performance is going on. There is still a need for modelling the process of drum sound generation and radiation so that further improvements can be expected...|$|R
