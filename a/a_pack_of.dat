40|$|AbstractLet G 1 and G 2 be two graphs on n {{vertices}} with Δ(G 1) =d 1 and Δ(G 2) =d 2. <b>A</b> <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> G 1 and G 2 {{is a set}} L={H 1, H 2 } {{such that}} H 1 ≅G 1, H 2 ≅G 2, and H 1 and H 2 are edge disjoint subgraphs of Kn. B. Bollobás and S. E. Eldridge (1978, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 25, 105 – 124) made the following conjecture. If (d 1 + 1) ·(d 1 + 1) ⩽n+ 1, then there is <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> G 1 and G 2. The degree condition stated in this conjecture could not be weakened, since there exist two such graphs for which (d 1 + 1) ·(d 2 + 1) =n+ 2, and no packing is possible. N. Sauer and J. Spencer (1978, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 25, 295 – 302) proved that if d 1 ·d 2 < 12 n then there is <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> G 1 and G 2. In this paper, a generalization and extension of the Sauer–Spencer result is proven. We define <b>a</b> near <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> degree d of two graphs of order n as <b>a</b> generalization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>packing.</b> In <b>a</b> near <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> degree d, the copies of the two graphs may overlap so that the maximum degree of the subgraph defined by the edges common to both copies is d. Thus <b>a</b> near <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> degree 0 is <b>a</b> <b>packing.</b> The result can then be stated as follows. Let a∈R+. If d 1 ·d 2 ⩽an, then there exists <b>a</b> near <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> degree d of G 1 and G 2 for some d< 2 a. Furthermore, if (d 1 + 1) ·(d 2 + 1) ⩽n+ 1, then the maximum degree d of the subgraph defined by the edges common to both the copy of G 1 and the copy of G 2 is at most 1 and its size is no larger than n 2 + 1 −d 1 −d 2...|$|R

50|$|Aristotle {{claimed that}} tetrahedra could fill space completely.
