5|$|Carbon was {{discovered}} in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations. Diamonds were known probably as early as 2500BCE in China, while carbon {{in the form of}} charcoal was made around Roman times by the same chemistry <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today,</b> by heating wood in a pyramid covered with clay to exclude air.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in {{the early}} nineteenth century, a storm washed away one of the legs leaving it much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today,</b> {{although}} erosion continues.

5|$|SH-8 {{was one of}} the {{original}} thirty-one state highways created on 1924-08-24. When it was created, it was a border-to-border highway, stretching from Texas to Kansas. It began at the Red River near Burkburnett, Texas. It then passed through Randlett and had a short concurrency with SH-5 west of Walters. The highway then ran through Lawton—concurring with {{the original}} SH-29—en route to Anadarko via Apache. In Anadarko, SH-8 linked up with the present highway. The remainder of the route was mostly the same <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows {{the church of the}} abbey much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today,</b> {{with the exception of the}} high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{marshes and}} meres {{surrounding}} the village supported fishing since Saxon times, {{at least until}} significant draining during the 17th century. Eels were plentiful in the waters {{in and around the}} Isle of Ely (Eel–ey). In 1086, Little Thetford was worth 3,250 eels to the nearby abbots. In one year, 1087, it was written that 52,000 eels were caught in and around the city. The islands in this landscape supported pastures; whilst reeds, peat, and rushes were harvested from the wetlands. As the land was drained, arable farming became the dominant activity, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

5|$|The University seal <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> is {{symbolic}} {{of hundreds of}} years of history. The seal combines attributes from the Bayley Coat of Arms and the Seton family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as 1216 and symbolizes Scottish nobility. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest, which is notable for its three crescents and three torteau. The motto on the seal Hazard Zet Forward (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) {{is a combination of}} Norman French and archaic English meaning at whatever risk, yet go forward. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal {{in the middle of the}} university green. It is said that students who step on the seal will not graduate on time.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the Sun's {{development}} suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun was only about 75% as bright <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> Such a weak star {{would not have been}} able to sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.|$|E
5|$|Trade in {{the region}} was {{negatively}} impacted {{by the development of}} an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India, and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century, Alanya failed to qualify as an urban center. In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus. The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya's port. Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671/1672, and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle, but also on the dilapidation of Alanya's suburbs. The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya, and in 1868 under Antalya, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> During the 18th and 19th centuries numerous villas were built in the city by Ottoman nobility, and civil construction continued under the local dynastic Karamanid authorities. Bandits again became common across Antalya Province in the mid-nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Following Wesley's death, the Methodist revival {{became a}} {{separate}} church and ordained its own ministers; {{it is called}} a nonconformist church {{because it does not}} conform to the rules of the established Church of England.
