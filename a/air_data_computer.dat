25|$|The Nimrod's navigational {{functions}} were computerised, {{and were}} managed from a central tactical compartment {{housed in the}} forward cabin; various aircraft functions such as weapons control and information from sensors such as the large forward doppler radar were displayed and controlled at the tactical station. The flight systems and autopilot could be directly controlled by navigator's stations in the tactical compartment, giving the navigator nearly complete aircraft control. The navigational systems comprised digital, analogue, and electro-mechanical elements; the computers were directly integrated {{with most of the}} Nimrod's guidance systems such as the <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer,</b> astrocompass, inertial guidance and doppler radar. Navigation information could also be manually input by the operators.|$|E
25|$|The {{avionics}} of the P version {{included the}} AN/ASN-91B armament control and navigation system, which consisted primarily of the Navigation/Weapon Delivery Computer (NWDC), <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer</b> (ADC), Flight Data Computer (FDC), AN/AVQ head-up display (HUD), ASCU/JBOX armament pylon station control unit, {{projected map display}} system (PMDS), and was equipped with the AN/ASN-90 inertial navigation system, AN/ASN-190 navigation Doppler radar, and the AN/APQ-126 terrain-following radar. This version was equipped with two Colt Mk 12 cannon that originally were used by the USN's A-7A and was capable of using newer missiles and bombs due to its modern avionics and sensors. All aircraft retained their in-flight refueling systems, making the A-7 the first aircraft operated by the PoAF with this capability.|$|E

25|$|The cockpit {{design of}} the TBM strives to be {{user-friendly}} and as uncomplicated to operate as possible. For pilot convenience, an automatic fuel selector automatically switches between fuel tanks periodically to effortlessly maintain fuel balance throughout flight; manual selection of fuel tanks is also possible, which remains overseen by a low fuel warning system. The ice protection system is as automated as possible, the windshield being electrically heated, the air inlet being kept warm by engine exhaust and the de-ice boots automatically cycling once activated. The electrically actuated flaps are monitored by a sophisticated split-flap protection system to prevent asymmetric deployment. An onboard <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer</b> calculates various values to support the pilot, such as the aircraft's true air speed, wind, and power advisory notices based upon current external temperature and altitude.|$|E
25|$|Saab and Honeywell co-developed an {{automatic}} digital {{flight control system}} for the JA 37 Viggen, which has been {{claimed to be the}} first such system in a production aircraft. To assist low altitude flight, a Honeywell radar altimeter with transmitter and receiver in the canard wings was used. The aircraft was also fitted with a Decca Type 72 Doppler navigation radar. TILS (Tactical Instrument Landing System), a landing-aid system made by Cutler-Hammer AIL, improved landing accuracy to 30m from the threshold on the short highway airbase system. In order to effectively enforce Sweden's air space, the Viggen was integrated with STRIL 60 national defence system. The JA 37 Viggen was also equipped with a Garrett AiResearch digital Central <b>Air</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Computer,</b> modified from the unit used upon the Grumman F-14 Tomcat.|$|E
500|$|The pitot-static system obtains {{pressures}} for interpretation by the pitot-static instruments. [...] While the explanations below explain traditional, mechanical instruments, many modern aircraft use an <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer</b> (ADC) to calculate airspeed, rate of climb, altitude and Mach number. In some aircraft, two ADCs receive total and static pressure from independent pitot tubes and static ports, and the aircraft's flight data computer compares {{the information from}} both computers and checks one against the other. There are also [...] "standby instruments", which are back-up pneumatic instruments employed {{in the case of}} problems with the primary instruments.|$|E
50|$|As {{aircraft}} displays have modernized, {{the sensors}} that feed them have modernized as well. Traditional gyroscopic flight instruments {{have been replaced}} by electronic attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS) and <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers</b> (ADCs), improving reliability and reducing cost and maintenance. GPS receivers are usually integrated into glass cockpits.|$|R
50|$|IS&S {{produces}} both <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers,</b> {{as well as}} {{the instruments}} necessary to display the information. Digital displays (LCDs) are incorporated within round dials, providing more information then traditional instruments. Another display option is to use a primary flight display (PFD). IS&S <b>air</b> <b>data</b> units comply with RVSM rules and the company is a major supporter of the new technology.|$|R

500|$|Much of {{the data}} {{generated}} from the onboard sensors and by cockpit activity is digitally recorded throughout the length of an entire mission. This information can be replayed in the cockpit or easily extracted for detailed post-mission analysis using a data transfer unit that {{can also be used}} to insert mission data to the aircraft. [...] The Gripen, like the Viggen, was designed to operate as one component of a networked national defence system, which allows for automatic exchange of information in real-time between Gripen aircraft and ground facilities. [...] According to Saab, the Gripen features [...] "the world's most highly developed data link". The Gripen's Ternav tactical navigation system combines information from multiple onboard systems such as the <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer,</b> radar altimeter, and GPS to continuously calculate the Gripen's location.|$|E
2500|$|The Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-64 engine, {{providing}} up to 700 shp (522kW). According to Flying Magazine, the PT6A-64 {{engine is}} [...] "the secret to the TBM 700's performance. At sea level, {{the engine is}} capable of generating a maximum 1,583 shp, which is intentionally limited to 700 shp on early TBM models; the limit allows the aircraft to maintain 700 shp up to 25,000 ft on a typical day. Engine reliability and expected lifespan are also enhanced by the limitation. While the typical engine overhaul life is set as 3,000 flight hours between overhauls, on-condition servicing can also be performed due to various engine parameters being automatically recorded by the engine trend monitoring (ETM) system. Data from the ETM can be reviewed by the engine manufacturer to determine the level of wear and therefore the need for inspection or overhaul. The ETM, which {{is connected to the}} aircraft's <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computer,</b> also provides information to enable easy power management by the pilot.|$|E

2500|$|Because a {{maintenance}} worker {{had failed to}} remove tape covering the static ports, the <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers</b> were unable to report the correct airspeed and altitude. The pilots struggled to navigate the aircraft as they were unaware of their true altitude and did not effectively use their alternative means; [...] being midnight, they also had no external visual references. The aircraft wing hit the water and it crashed shortly afterwards.|$|R
50|$|In aerospace, the {{mechanical}} stand-alone altimeters {{which are based}} on diaphragm bellows were replaced by integrated measurement systems which are called <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers</b> (ADC). This module measures altitude, speed of flight and outside temperature to provide more precise output data allowing automatic flight control and flight level division. Multiple altimeters can be used to design a pressure reference system to provide information about the airplane's position angles to further support inertial navigation system calculations.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 the {{standard}} vertical separation {{was set to}} 1,000 feet from the surface to FL290, and 2,000 feet above FL290.

50|$|A pitot-static {{system is}} a system of {{pressure-sensitive}} instruments that is most often used in aviation to determine an aircraft's airspeed, Mach number, altitude, and altitude trend. A pitot-static system generally consists of a pitot tube, a static port, and the pitot-static instruments. Other instruments that might be connected are <b>air</b> <b>data</b> <b>computers,</b> flight <b>data</b> recorders, altitude encoders, cabin pressurization controllers, and various airspeed switches. Errors in pitot-static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system, such as altitude, is potentially safety-critical.
