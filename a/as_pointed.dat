5|$|A form of {{the species}} found in Korea and Japan, A.hygrometricus var. koreanus, was named by V.J. Stanĕk in 1958; it was later (1976) {{published}} as a distinct species—A.koreanus—by Hanns Kreisel. <b>As</b> <b>pointed</b> out by Fangfuk and colleagues, clarification of the proper name for this taxon must await analysis of A.hygrometricus var. koreanus specimens from the type locality in North Korea.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>pointed</b> out by Paul Krugman, the Brander–Spencer model, {{due to the}} {{sensitivity}} of the results to its assumptions, does not establish a generally applicable policy prescription in favor of government subsidies. Rather, it provides an example for when such intervention may be justifiable and points to some conditions which may favor it.|$|E
5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation. <b>As</b> <b>pointed</b> out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards {{the center of the}} cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E

25|$|A {{shipyard}} started {{operating in}} 1873 at Point Hope on the Upper Harbour. Over {{the years the}} shipyard had traded hands several times and by 1938 was known <b>as</b> <b>Point</b> Hope Shipyards Limited. Today the yard continues to operate <b>as</b> <b>Point</b> Hope Maritime.|$|R
5|$|The RLM ordered seven A-0s initially, {{but then}} {{increased}} {{the order to}} 11. Early in 1937, the A-0 was tested with varied bomb loads. The underpowered Jumo 210A, <b>as</b> <b>pointed</b> out by von Richthofen, was insufficient, and was quickly replaced with the Jumo 210D power plant.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. <b>As</b> <b>pointed</b> out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>pointed</b> out by Jack Bailey (1997), {{the spines}} resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus {{might also have}} possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E

5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, <b>as</b> <b>pointed</b> out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|A form of {{decorated}} classical architecture {{peculiar to}} Sicily {{had begun to}} evolve from the 1530s. Inspired by the ruined Greek architecture and by the Norman cathedrals on the island, this often incorporated Greek architectural motifs such as the Greek key pattern into late Norman architecture with Gothic features such <b>as</b> <b>pointed</b> arches and window apertures. The Sicilian Norman architecture incorporated some Byzantine elements seldom found in Norman architecture elsewhere, and like other Romanesque architecture it went on to incorporate Gothic features. This early ornate architecture {{differs from that of}} mainland Europe in not having evolved from Renaissance architecture; instead, it was developed from Norman styles. Renaissance architecture hardly touched Sicily; in the capital city of Palermo, the only remnant of the High Renaissance is the Fontana Pretoria, a water fountain originally made for Don Pietro di Toleda by Florentine artists Franscesco Cammilliani and Michelangelo Naccerino and brought to Sicily when it was already 20 years old (Illustration 5).|$|E

25|$|Some {{exceptional}} practitioners such as Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra {{are held}} to have realized a higher type of rainbow body without dying.

25|$|When the biofilm, {{containing}} S. mutans {{and related}} oral streptococci, {{is subjected to}} acid stress, the competence regulon is induced, leading to resistance to being killed by acid. <b>As</b> <b>pointed</b> out by Michod et al., transformation in bacterial pathogens likely provides for effective and efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages. It appears that S. mutans can survive the frequent acid stress in oral biofilms, in part, through the recombinational repair provided by competence and transformation.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>pointed</b> out by Michael E. McIntyre, {{the mean}} {{horizontal}} mass transport will be (near) zero for a wave group approaching into still water, with also {{in deep water}} the mass transport caused by the waves balanced by an opposite mass transport in a return flow (undertow). This {{is due to the}} fact that a large mean force will be needed to accelerate the body of water into which the wave group is propagating.|$|E
25|$|These {{groups also}} have a direct {{physical}} interpretation: <b>As</b> <b>pointed</b> out by Harry Bateman, the Lie sphere transformations are identical with the spherical wave transformations that leave the form of Maxwell's equations invariant. In addition, Élie Cartan, Henri Poincaré and Wilhelm Blaschke {{pointed out that the}} Laguerre group is simply isomorphic to the Lorentz group of special relativity (see Laguerre group isomorphic to Lorentz group). Eventually, there is also an isomorphism between the Möbius group and the Lorentz group (see Möbius group#Lorentz transformation).|$|E
