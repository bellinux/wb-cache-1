And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E

2500|$|The Pakistani Taliban claimed {{responsibility}} for the attacks in a statement released later {{on the day of the}} attack. The group claimed it was a retaliation for the fatal US drone strike against Waliur Rehman, a Taliban commander, who was killed on 29 May 2013. The group's spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan said ″Through this killing we gave a message to international community to <b>ask</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> stop drone strikes″. Another militant group Jundallah, notorious for organising attacks on Pakistani Shi'ites, had also previously {{claimed responsibility}}. [...] Throughout the investigations and their aftermath, the Pakistani authorities were silent as to long-term promotion of terrorism and jihad by the Pakistani government itself, especially by various arms of the Pakistan Army such as the Inter-Services Intelligence, which have significantly contributed to the socio-cultural context in Pakistan within which terrorists are often seen as 'heroes' and 'patriots'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{necessity}} to telex story outlines and scripts to New York for approval caused further production delays.

2500|$|Chrétien's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} at Indian Affairs was the 1969 White Paper, {{a proposal to}} abolish the Indian Act. The paper was widely opposed by First Nations groups, and later abandoned. It was the 1969 White Paper that first brought Chrétien to widespread public attention in English Canada. At a press conference announcing the White Paper, Chrétien openly clashed with Indian activists with one First Nations women asking Chrétien [...] "When did we lose our identity?", to which the minister replied [...] "When you signed the treaties", which prompted boos and jeers. Another women from the Iroquois reserve at Brantford asked Chrétien [...] "How can you come here and <b>ask</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> become citizens, when we were here long before you?", noting the Crown had granted the Grand River valley to Joseph Brant in 1784, to which Chrétien had no reply. The Cree activist Harold Cardinal in his bestselling 1969 book The Unjust Society attacked Chrétien and Trudeau for the White Paper, accusing them of [...] "cultural genocide" [...] against the First Nations. To counteract such criticism, Chrétien during a 1970 visit to the Northwest Territories adopted from the local orphanage in Inuvik an Inuit boy, whom he named Michel, whose mother was an alcoholic prostitute and whose unknown father {{had been one of}} her johns. As Indian Affairs Minister, Chrétien {{fell in love with the}} far north of Canada, whose beauty moved him, and he vacationed in the north every summer during his time while holding the Indian Affairs portfolio.|$|E
