By late PIE, however, as the aspect system evolved, the need had arisen for verbs of a <b>different</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>than</b> that of the root. Several of the formations, which originally formed distinct verbs, gradually came {{to be used as}} [...] "aspect switching" [...] derivations, whose primary purpose was to create a verb of one aspect from a root of another aspect.|$|R

However, because digital images have a <b>different</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio <b>than</b> 35 mm film images, people have started to realize that 4x6 inch prints crop some of the image off the print. Some photofinishers have started offering prints with the same aspect ratio as the digital cameras record.|$|R
30|$|Most {{of these}} papers used {{multiple}} metrics but to evaluate <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> rather <b>than</b> just learning, such as usability and efficiency. Merriam [56] explains that all research designs can {{be discussed in}} terms of their relative strengths and limitations. She claims that their merits are related to select the most appropriate ones to address the research problem. Cohen et al. [12] argue that there are many advantages of using multimethod approach in social research. They highlight that (a) while single observation in fields such as physics usually yield sufficient and unambiguous information, it provides a limited view of the complexity of human behavior and interactions, and (b) exclusive reliance on one method may bias or distort the researcher’s picture of a particular reality.|$|R
40|$|Software design aims at {{a mapping}} from domain {{concepts}} to an implementation. Abstractions {{that are not}} highlighted in the implementation structure often exist only {{in the minds of}} the developers during development. While this works reasonably well for single-purpose systems, software product lines, i. e., systems built by reusing the same core functionality, require explicit presence of several types of abstractions. In particular, the relation between the implementation and underlying domain concepts, and product variance must both be mastered in parallel. In this paper, we will discuss these dimensions of concern, and introduce a way to manage them in software product lines with logical layers. The principal idea is to superimpose <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> rather <b>than</b> partition the system into straightforward implementation components in the specification phase...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} several {{characteristics of}} {{black-tailed prairie dog}} (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies in Phillips County, Montana, including slope, aspect, soils, land tenure, and distance from roads using a geographic information system (GIs). Colonies exhibited significantly smaller slopes, but not significantly <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> did randomly located polygons. In addition, colonies were more prevalent than expected on well drained clay-loam and loam soils and on U. S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land than on other soil types or on private land. Although prairie dogs commonly use roads for dispersal, distance to nearest road {{was not related to}} prairie dog density nor to colony area. These findings could be used to develop a cartographic model of preferred black-tailed prairie dog habitat useful for prairie dog monitoring and management, and for estimating prairie dog expansion potential for possible black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) reintroduction sites...|$|R
40|$|New {{approaches}} in health care, such as e. g. Integrated Delivery Systems, affect {{the role and}} tasks of medical suppliers. More and more, medical suppliers are incorporated into the process of guiding patients to medical specialists and hospitals and thus managing the course of disease. In this context, the role of medical gate-keepers and case managers may provide opportunities for undesirable behavior (from the network's point of view). Therefore, compensation-induced incentives for gatekeepers and case managers are in {{the main focus of}} the paper. Different health care payment systems and the impact of financial and non-financial incentives on case managers and gate-keepers in medical networks are analyzed. Another focus is laid on medical suppliers that are not involved in managing diseases and guiding patients. Due to their smaller margin of actions and possibilities to take advantage of it, reimbursement should emphasize <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> for case managers. ...|$|R

The style of Jack Spade reflects <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> the Kate Spade New York Company does, {{and not only}} because it is a male line. While Kate Spade is a clean cut line that represents a sleek, upper east side, preppy style, Jack Spade is more of a rugged style. The styles are completely different because they are based on what trends that specific gender is wearing in the upper east side. Jack Spade is composed more of darker colors rather than bright lively colors(Winters 36). Its founder and principal designer was Andy Spade. In recent years, Kate Spade has been featuring designs and special editions by guest designers and is no longer the sole artistic vision of the husband and wife team.All the Jack Spade stores were permanently closed in January 2015, but the brand continued to sell online and at Nordstrom.|$|R
40|$|The authors show, {{with real}} and {{hypothetical}} payoffs, {{that consumers are}} willing to pay substantially less for a risky prospect when it is called a “lottery ticket,” “raffle,” “coin flip,” or “gamble” than when it is labeled a “gift certificate” or “voucher. ” Willingness to accept, in contrast, is not affected by these frames. This differential framing effect is the result of an aversion to bad deals, which causes buyers to focus on <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> sellers. Buyers' willingness to pay is influenced by {{the extent to which a}} risky prospect's frame is associated with risk (Experiment 1) as well as the prospect's lowest (but not highest) possible outcome (Experiment 2). Sellers' willingness to accept, in contrast, is influenced by a prospect's lowest and highest possible outcomes but not by the risk associated with its frame (Experiments 2 and 3). The framing effect on willingness to pay is independent of the objective level of uncertainty (Experiment 4) and can lead to the uncertainty effect. The findings have important implications for research on risk preferences and marketing practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test {{competing}} theories from Pinsker’s (2007) new research framework in order to provide a better understanding of XBRL (as the continuous disclosure technology example) adoption intentions of managers who have low knowledge of XBRL, but work for firms who may adopt. A survey methodology was used with experienced business professionals and MBA students. Two of three research propositions were empirically supported. The results indicate that both the technology acceptance model (TAM) and absorptive capacity represent appropriate theories for studying XBRL adoption. However, future related TAM research should be conducted either with a modified ‘attitude’ variable or through eliminating this variable altogether. Results provide an empirical validation of part of Pinsker’s (2007) framework. The findings add to the existing practical and academic literature regarding perceived benefits of XBRL adoption for firms. The difference in significance between TAM variables represents a unique finding in the TAM literature, which suggests XBRL adoption has significantly <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> previous information technology adoption research in general.

40|$|Abstract Environmental {{limitations}} {{are about to}} cause increasing economic costs as human actions affect climatic conditions around the world. Those costs can be mitigated cost-efficiently within appropriate institutional framework. Deforestation in tropical rainforest regions can be a significant factor altering the climate in those particular regions. In Brazil it reduces rainfall, thus affecting hydrological conditions which are critical for hydropower generation. The country relies heavily on hydropower in its electricity production, and therefore this study considers a possibility of that hydroelectricity supply issues would negatively affect Brazil’s long-term economic growth. A literature review combines <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of development in Brazil in order to form a picture of how country’s institutional structure inflicts the transmission of issues in hydropower sector into the economy. The review is complemented by a sensitivity analysis to a growth projection which aptly reflects some characteristics of development in Brazil. Thereby the analysis demonstrates how more comprehensive evaluation of <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> what in general has been done so far could change the conception of country’s growth potential. If current state of institutional affairs persists, there is an obvious threat of that electricity supply side issues will have increasing economic costs. Historical factors and currently prevailing international political economy orientation may hamper realization of institutional change that is essential in mitigating these possible costs...|$|R

A well-concealed reshoot took place in late 2001 to film a different ending concluding that the villain in the film was Meany. In the original ending, the villain turned out to be Mrs. Stern, a teacher at Lexy's school who had known Mr. Walker while he was living in Arizona. This ending was shown on the DVD (though the viewer has the option to watch either ending when the movie reaches 61 minutes, with the Mrs. Stern ending shown in a <b>different</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio <b>than</b> the rest of the movie). The film was heavily promoted and frequently re-aired during its initial summer.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report an}} unusual fundus {{autofluorescence}} aspect {{in a patient}} with suspected hydroxychloroquine retinal toxicity. Method: Case report of an unusual presentation of a patient treated for 9 consecutive years with a therapeutically recommended dose of hydroxychloroquine. Result: We report {{the case of a}} 53 -year-old Caucasian female treated with 400 mg hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis over 9 years, currently on methotrexate and folinic acid, who stopped treatment 3 years ago. The cumulative dose is estimated at 1. 314 kg. She recently noticed a reduction of vision in both eyes to 0. 34 logMAR, with colour vision problems and major distortion in central vision. Fundus autofluorescence revealed minimal foveal pigmentary changes and more pronounced changes in the retina elsewhere. Foveal changes were confirmed by optical coherence tomography in both eyes. The patient did not report any colour perception difficulties or night vision problems and has no family history of any eye condition. Her visual field tested by an optician was full, with some central changes. Conclusion: Retinal toxicity from hydroxychloroquine can present in a <b>different</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>than</b> the commonly known retinal toxicity, and it happens even after years of cessation of the drug. The role of cumulative dose in toxicity is supported in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The more we {{know about}} {{software}} developers’ detailed navigation behavior for change tasks, the better {{we are able to}} provide effective tool support. Currently, most empirical studies on developers performing change tasks are, however, limited to very small code snippets or limited by the granularity and detail of the data collected on developer’s navigation behavior. In our research, we extend this work by combining user interaction monitoring to gather interaction context – the code elements a developer selects and edits – with eye-tracking to gather more detailed and fine-granular gaze context-code elements a developer looked at. In a study with 12 professional and 10 student developers we gathered interaction and gaze contexts from participants working on three change tasks of an open source system. Based on an analysis of the data we found, amongst other results, that gaze context captures <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>than</b> interaction context and that developers only read small portions of code elements. We further explore the potential of the more detailed and fine-granular data by examining the use of the captured change task context to predict perceived task difficulty and to provide better and more fine-grained navigation recommendations. We discuss our findings and their implications for better tool support...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} thirty years {{education}} researchers have developed models for judging the comparative performance of schools, in studies of what has become known as ‘differential school effectiveness’. A great deal of empirical research has been carried out to understand why differences between schools might emerge, with variable-based models being the preferred research tool. The use of more explanatory models such as agent-based models (ABM) has been limited. This paper describes an ABM that addresses this topic, using data from the London Educational Authority's Junior Project. To compare the results and performance with more traditional modelling techniques, the same data are also fitted to a multilevel model (MLM), one of the preferred variable-based models used in the field. The paper reports the results of both models and compares their performances in terms of predictive and explanatory power. Although the fitted MLM outperforms the proposed ABM, the latter still offers a reasonable fit and provides a causal mechanism to explain differences in the identified school performances that is absent in the MLM. Since MLM and ABM stress <b>different</b> <b>aspects,</b> rather <b>than</b> conflicting they are compatible methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to create an {{interactive}} educational video to expand the agricultural knowledge of children in third through fifth grade. The video features goats in effort to improve the next generation’s enthusiasm about agriculture. Consumer agricultural literacy has declined due to most people living {{at a distance from}} the farm. Specific objectives were to include interesting information about the terminology used and the tendencies of goats. The process involved researching this information, contacting the actor, professors, and goat herder, filming the goats multiple times for different animal tendencies, and editing the final video. The video turned out slightly <b>different</b> <b>than</b> planned. Animals are living beings who do not act on command which causes difficulties, but their tendencies also create new ideas which helped enhance the video. These educational videos could continue with the multitude of agricultural subject matter to add to the educational <b>aspect.</b> <b>Different</b> types of videos could also be created to reach a wider audience with the same general objective of progressing agricultural literacy...|$|R
40|$|While the {{literature}} has suggested {{the possibility of}} breach being composed of multiple facets, no previous study has investigated this possibility empirically. This study examined {{the factor structure of}} typical component forms in order to develop a multiple component form measure of breach. Two studies were conducted. In study 1 (N = 420) multi-item measures based on causal indicators representing promissory obligations were developed for the five potential component forms (delay, magnitude, type/form, inequity and reciprocal imbalance). Exploratory factor analysis showed that the five components loaded onto one higher order factor, namely psychological contract breach suggesting that breach is composed of <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> rather <b>than</b> types of breach. Confirmatory factor analysis provided further evidence for the proposed model. In addition, the model achieved high construct reliability and showed good construct, convergent, discriminant and predictive validity. Study 2 data (N = 189), used to validate study 1 results, compared the multiple-component measure with an established multiple item measure of breach (rather than a single item as in study 1) and also tested for discriminant validity with an established multiple item measure of violation. Findings replicated those in study 1. The findings have important implications for considering alternative, more comprehensive and elaborate ways of assessing breach...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The chapter {{builds on}} the {{literature}} of Agency and Signalling Theories to analyse the corporate governance factors associated with the voluntary decision to prepare an Integrated Report according to the International Framework promoted by the IIRC. Methodology/approach The chapter {{is based on the}} results of a probit regression run with regard to a sample of 35 companies that joined the Pilot Programme in 2011 and 137 similar companies that did not. Findings The analysis of two samples of European companies reveals that adhesion to the IR Pilot Programme is positively related to the gender diversity and size of the board. Research limitations Further research is required in order to study the differences between listed and non-listed companies in terms of variables affecting the adoption of the Framework and to increase the time range of our study. In addition, it would be interesting to include other variables capturing <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> other <b>than</b> corporate governance, since the decision to join the Programme, as the results of our analysis have shown, may also be influenced by other factors, such as strategy decisions and communication policies. Originality/value The chapter adds to the existing literature by showing the main governance characteristics that impact the decision to adhere to the IR Pilot Programme. It is also important to the existing literature regarding the role played by gender diversity in corporate governance mechanisms and CSR policies...|$|R
