The album was certified five-times Platinum in Canada and has sold 10 million copies, including 3.2million in the US. Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, and Kreviazuk's husband, Our Lady Peace front man Raine Maida, co-produced the album with Butch Walker and Don Gilmore. Lavigne said that Under My Skin proved her credentials as a songwriter, saying that [...] "each song comes from a personal experience of mine, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> much emotions in those songs". [...] "Don't Tell Me", the lead single off the album, reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia. [...] "My Happy Ending", the album's second single, was a top five hit in the UK and Australia. In the US, it was a top ten entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a number-one pop radio hit. The third single, [...] "Nobody's Home", did not manage to make the top 40 in the US and performed moderately elsewhere.|$|E

The French Revolution shaped {{the course of}} the conflict in Saint-Domingue and was at first widely welcomed in the island. Wealthy whites saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France, which would allow elite plantation-owners {{to take control of the}} island and create trade regulations that would further their own wealth <b>and</b> power. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many twists <b>and</b> turns in the leadership in France, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many complex events in Saint-Domingue, that various classes and parties changed their alignments many times. However, the Haitian Revolution quickly became a test of the ideology of the French Revolution, as it radicalized the slavery question and forced French leaders to recognize the full meaning of their revolution.|$|R
