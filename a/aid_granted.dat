500|$|Article 30 confers {{upon all}} {{religious}} and linguistic minorities {{the right to}} set up and administer educational institutions of their choice in order to preserve and develop their own culture, and prohibits the State, while granting aid, from discriminating against any institution {{on the basis of the}} fact that it is administered by a religious or cultural minority. The term [...] "minority", while not defined in the Constitution, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean any community which numerically forms less than 50% of the population of the state in which it seeks to avail the right under Article 30. In order to claim the right, it is essential that the educational institution must have been established as well as administered by a religious or linguistic minority. Further, the right under Article 30 can be availed of even if the educational institution established does not confine itself to the teaching of the religion or language of the minority concerned, or a majority of students in that institution do not belong to such minority. This right is subject to the power of the State to impose reasonable regulations regarding educational standards, conditions of service of employees, fee structure, and the utilisation of any <b>aid</b> <b>granted</b> by it.|$|E
6000|$|... 164. (K) [...] "Remunerative employment." [...] I cannot easily {{express the}} astonishment with which I {{find a man}} of your Lordship's {{intelligence}} taking up the common phrase of [...] "giving employment," [...] as if, indeed, labor were the best gift which the rich could bestow on the poor. Of course, every idle vagabond, be he rich or poor, [...] "gives employment" [...] to some otherwise enough burdened wretch, to provide his dinner and clothes for him; and every vicious vagabond, in the destructive power of his vice, gives sorrowful occupation to the energies of resisting and renovating virtue. The idle child who litters its nursery and tears its frock, gives employment to the housemaid and seamstress; the idle woman, who litters her drawing-room with trinkets, and is ashamed to be seen twice in the same dress, is, in your Lordship's view, the enlightened supporter {{of the arts and}} manufactures of her country. At the close of your letter, my Lord, you, though in measured terms, indignantly dissent from my statement of the power of great cities for evil, and indeed I have perhaps been led, by my prolonged study of the causes of the Fall of Venice, into clearer recognition of some of these urban influences than may have been possible to your Lordship {{in the center of the}} virtues and proprieties which have been blessed by Providence in the rise of Manchester. But the Scriptural symbol of the power of temptation in the hand of the spiritual Babylon--"all kings have been drunk with the wine of her Fornication"--is perfectly literal in its exposition of the special influence of cities over a vicious, that is to say, a declining, people. They are the foci of its fornication, and the practical meaning is that the lords of the soil take the food and labor of the peasants, who are their slaves, and spend them especially in forms of luxury perfected by the definitely so-called [...] "women of the town" [...] who, whether East-cheap Doll, or West--much the reverse of cheap--Nell, are, both in the color which they give to the Arts, and in the tone which they give to the Manners, of the State, a literal plague, pestilence and burden to it, quite otherwise malignant and maleficent than the poor country lassie who loses her snood among the heather. And when, at last, real political economy shall exhibit the exact sources and consequences of the expenditure of the great capitals of civilization on their own indulgences, your Lordship will be furnished, in the statistics of their most splendid and most impious pleasure, with record of precisely the largest existing source of [...] "remunerative employment"--(if that were all the poor had to ask for), next after the preparation and practice of war. I believe it is, indeed, probable that [...] "facility of intercourse" [...] gives the next largest quantity of occupation; and, as your Lordship rightly observes, to most respectable persons. And if the entire population of Manchester lost the use of its legs, your Lordship would similarly have the satisfaction of observing, and might share in the profits of providing, the needful machinery of porterage and stretchers. But observe, my Lord--and observe as a final and inevitable truth--that whether you lend your money to provide an invalided population with crutches, stretchers, hearses, or the railroad accommodation which is so often synonymous with the three, the tax on the use of these, which constitutes the shareholder's dividend, is a permanent burden upon them, exacted by avarice, and by no means an <b>aid</b> <b>granted</b> by benevolence.|$|E

In this paper there were presented construction fundamentals of a contract when one of the party to the contract is Managing Authority (support is given after the administrative proceedings in particular case but the agreement is the source of obligations, there are restrictions of freedom of contracting, and the civil courts are competent to settle disputes). These features point to the civil – legal nature of the agreement. The agreement used in Polish agricultural transactions are of an extremely varied character. This agreement is similar to a contract of donation and to a contract of <b>aid</b> <b>granting</b> by the structural funds. Therefore, it is helpful, to compare it to these agreement. The analysis of provisions of the Polish act allows to draw conclusions on a very complicated legal character of the agreement of <b>aid</b> <b>granting</b> by the European Agricultural Found for Rural Development.

The dependent variable measuring the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment to a town was developed from Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s major state education grant program.

Hypotheses One, Two and Three were examined through correlation analysis. Hypothesis One was rejected because a significant correlation existed between the change in total town property wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment provided to a town for 111 of the 14 change periods studied. Hypothesis Two was rejected, as a significant correlation existed between the change in town commercial and industrial property wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment to a town for 10 of the 14 change periods examined. Hypothesis Three was rejected because a significant correlation existed between a proportional change in commercial and industrial property wealth relative to total town wealth and the change in the state general fund equalization <b>aid</b> <b>grant</b> payment provided to a town for five of the 14 change periods.

50|$|State aid was {{formally}} introduced into European Union statute law by the Treaty of Rome where it classified state aid as being any state intervention that distorted competition law. The definition was later updated by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in 2007. It stated that any aid {{given to a}} company by a state within the EU would generally be incompatible with the EU's Common Market.

This paper presents an empirical analysis {{of the relationship between}} foreign aid and economic growth in the case of Fiji.

Components of total <b>aid,</b> such as <b>grant</b> <b>aid,</b> loan aid, technical cooperation, bilateral and multilateral aid flows are also utilized to estimate a disaggregated short-run and long-run relationship between foreign aid and economic growth. The results show that total aid flows and its various forms, i. e. bilateral <b>aid,</b> <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> and technical cooperation <b>grant</b> <b>aid,</b> has a significant impact on economic growth in Fiji.

50|$|The {{investigation}} was originally opened by the European Commissioner for Competition {{on behalf of}} the European Commission in June 2014. The Ireland case was opened in conjunction with two other similar cases; involving Starbucks (Netherlands) and Fiat (Luxembourg). The commissioner noted concerns that it believed discretion in transfer pricing rules had been used in the case of Apple to grant a selective advantage to the company. They believed that this violated Article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 107(1) states that <b>aid</b> <b>granted</b> by member states cannot threaten to distort competition. In particular they are addressing the Irish tax rulings from 1991 and 2007 by the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioner. Specifically, the Commission refers to taxable profit allocated to the Irish branches of AOE and ASI. The Commission claims the pricing arrangement between Apple and Ireland was not supported by an economic assessment and was in part supported by employment considerations.|$|E
5000|$|In an old baraita (Shab. 13b) the {{question}} as to the authorship of the work is answered as follows: [...] "Hananiah ben Hezekiah of the Garon family, together with a number of others who had assembled for a synod at his house, compiled Megillat Ta'anit." [...] According to an account in the Halakot Gedolot, Hilkot Soferim (ed. Vienna, p. 104; ed. Zolkiev, p. 82c), the members of this synod were the [...] "Ziḳne Bet Shammai" [...] and [...] "Ziḳne Bet Hillel," [...] the eldest pupils of Shammai and Hillel. Megillat Ta'anit must have been composed, therefore, about the year 7 CE, when Judea was made a Roman province to the great indignation of the Jews (comp. Schmilg, l.c. pp. 20-36). This calendar of victories was intended to fan the spark of liberty among the people and to fill them with confidence and courage by reminding them of the victories of the Maccabees and the divine <b>aid</b> <b>granted</b> to the Jewish nation against the heathen.|$|E
