50|$|The amidicity {{scale is}} a {{computational}} method for calculating {{the strength of}} an amide bond in an organic compound on a linear scale. It is analogous to aromaticity. It {{is based on the}} computed enthalpy of hydrogenation when compared to the reference compounds dimethylacetamide and azaadamantane-2-one. If an amidicity value is close to 100%, then the compound has very good <b>amidic</b> character (and is perfect at 100%); if the value is close to, or below, 0%, then the compound has a lack of <b>amidic</b> character. The scale is not restricted to these values; compounds with weaker amide bonds than azaadamantane-2-one will have amidicities below 0%, whilst compounds with stronger amide bonds than dimethylacetamide will have amidicities of above 100%. If the amidicity value is altered during an acylation, then this will act as a key thermodynamic component of the reaction.|$|E

Our results indicate that the <b>amidic</b> 15 N CSA tensor has sensitive responses to the introduction of the phosphate group and the phosphorylationpromoted rearrangement of solvent molecules and hydrogen bonding networks in the vicinity of the phosphorylated site. Yet, the calculated 15 N CSA tensors in phosphorylated model peptides were in range of values experimentally observed for non-phosphorylated proteins. The extent of the phosphorylation induced changes suggests that the <b>amidic</b> 15 NCSA tensor in phosphorylated proteins could be reasonably well approximated with averaged CSA tensor values experimentally determined for non-phosphorylated amino acids in practical NMR applications, where chemical surrounding of the phosphorylated site is not known a priori in majority of cases.

We have therefore studied a new prodrug of dopamine (DP) obtained by its <b>amidic</b> conjugation to an A 2 A antagonist (ANT) via succinic linker (LK). Pharmacokinetic studies of DP, ANT, DP –LK-ANT and its hydrolysis products DP-LK and LK-ANT have been performed in human whole blood and rat brain homogenates. DP-LK and LK-ANT were not degraded in the incubation media. DP was totally degraded in brain homogenates within 3 hours, whereas in human blood it was degraded with a slower rate. ANT was degraded in blood with a rate higher than in brain homogenates. In human blood, the prodrug DP-LK-ANT was hydrolyzed (half-life = 2. 73 ± 0. 23 h) mainly on the <b>amidic</b> bound coupling ANT, whereas in rat brain homogenates the DP-LK-ANT was hydrolyzed (half-life > eight hours) exclusively on the <b>amidic</b> bound coupling dopamine, allowing the controlled release of DP and increasing its poor stability as characterized by half-life = 22. 5 ± 1. 5 min. DP-LK-ANT and LK-ANT showed higher affinity toward A 2 A receptors than ANT. The prodrug DP-LK-ANT appears therefore a carrier of dopamine potentially able to increase its stability and antiparkinsonian effects in the CNS...|$|E

The affinity of 2 and its hydrolysis products 1, 3, dopamine-linker DP-L (4) and A 2 AANT-linker L-A 2 AANT (5) was evaluated for hA 1, hA 2 A, hA 2 B and hA 3 ARs and rat striatum A 2 AARs or D 2 receptors. The hydrolysis patterns of 2, 4 and 5 and the stabilities of 1 and 3 were evaluated by HPLC analysis in human whole blood and rat brain homogenates.
