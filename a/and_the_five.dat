5|$|An insect {{survey in}} September 2009 {{recorded}} 187 beetle species, including two new to Norfolk, the rove beetle Phytosus nigriventris and the fungus beetle Leiodes ciliaris, and two very rarely {{seen in the}} county, the sap beetle Nitidula carnaria and the clown beetle Gnathoncus nanus. There were also 24 types of spider, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined darter appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament. In 1643, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town, whose defences proved vulnerable to a landward attack. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, seizing Bayard's Cove Fort <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> iron artillery guns stationed there by the Royalists to protect the estuary.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded relationships quite different; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister {{to the two}} brown pelicans, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but {{was the first to}} diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.|$|E

Hamauzu was not involved in the creation of either the remixes or original tracks for these albums.

5|$|His parents' {{marriage}} {{dissolved in}} July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, {{and moved to}} America {{to start a new}} life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, {{but when it came to}} light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to Heaven, the main deities known as the Five Powers, and the spirits (shen 神) of mountains and rivers. It was believed that the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were linked by natural cycles of yin and yang <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> phases. If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts.|$|E

5|$|In ancient China, {{biological}} topics can {{be found}} dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and philosophers. The Taoist tradition of Chinese alchemy, for example, can be {{considered part of the}} life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the elixir of life). The system of classical Chinese medicine usually revolved around the theory of yin and yang, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> phases. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to evolution, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.|$|E
5|$|Nea Salamina's emblem {{incorporates}} the Olympic flame, the color red <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> rings of the Olympic Games. The club's colors {{during its first}} two years were yellow and crimson, when {{it was part of}} the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation. After 1950, the governing council changed its colors to red and white: red symbolizing power, and white symbolizing peace. Red-and-white striped jerseys were chosen because they resembled those worn by Olympiakos Piraeus.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 1944, Admiral Osterhaus and {{the other}} six {{members of the court}} deliberated for 80minutes and found all 50 {{defendants}} guilty of mutiny.

The men were held under guard while their sentences were passed to Admiral Wright for review. On November 15, Wright reduced the sentences for 40 of the men: 24 were given 12years, 11 were given 10years <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> youngest sailors were given eight-year sentences.
