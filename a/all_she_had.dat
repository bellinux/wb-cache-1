5|$|In 2010, Saran {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj. The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of Saran that <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to do was look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to do was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through {{in the setting of}} her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread {{that she was going to}} do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E

25|$|Katherine Chidley about August last came to Stepney, (where shee hath drawn {{away some}} persons to Brownisme) and was with Mr. Greenhill, where shee {{with a great}} deal of {{violence}} and bitternesse spake against all Ministers and people that meet in our Churches, and in places where any idolatrous services have been performed: Mr. Greenhill answered her by Scripture, and laboured to reduce to a short head <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> spoke, asking her if this were not the sum, namely, that it was unlawfull to worship God in a place which had been used or set apart to Idolatry, under the Names of Saints and Angels; she would not hold to the stating of the question, but running out, Mr. Greenhill to convince her, told her that all England in this way and manner had been set apart to St. George, and Scotland to Saint Andrew, and so other Kingdomes to other Saints; so that by her grounds it was unlawfull to worship God in these, and so by consequence any where in the world; but instead of being satisfied or giving any answer, shee was so talkative and clamorous, wearying him with her words, that he was glad to goe away, and so left her.|$|E
500|$|The Christmas Day episodes, {{written by}} Simon Ashdown, {{drew on the}} show's early history to mark the {{occasion}} of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasised {{by the use of}} flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for The Times, Tim Teeman, commented that [...] "Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl." [...] In addition, her parting scene with the other EastEnders long-serving [...] "grand dame" [...] Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: [...] "The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1975, {{when she}} was 15 years old, Balukas was already {{described}} as the [...] "best female pool player in the world". By 1987, Balukas's dominance of women's professional pool was so complete that it was described as [...] "breathtaking" [...] in its scope by The New York Times. Announcers had long since stopped calling Balukas [...] "the Little Princess," [...] but presented her as [...] "the Queen". By that time she had won the World Straight Pool Championship women's division eight of the prior nine years, and over the same time period, every single women's professional tournament in which she competed — 16 in <b>all.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> been honored as BCA Player of the Year five times. In 1985 became the second woman (after Dorothy Wise) to {{be inducted into the}} BCA Hall of Fame, with the additional honor of being its youngest inductee, at just under 27 years of age.

500|$|James was a {{dominant}} {{player in the}} OWHA. Women's hockey historian Elizabeth Etue attributed James' success to her skating strength and [...] "dynamic, bullet-like shot". [...] She was a physical player who helped the women's game overcome a reputation {{that it was not}} a sport where the players were willing to play a [...] "gritty", tough style. Opponents claimed running into James was like [...] "hitting steel". [...] Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commentator Robin Brown, who played against James in the OWHA, said of her: [...] "She could do it <b>all.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> end-to-end speed, she had finesse as a stick handler and her slap shot was harder and more accurate than any female player I have ever seen. [...] She was a pure goal scorer like Mike Bossy and aggressive like Mark Messier. [...] In her prime, she was referred to as the 'Wayne Gretzky of women's hockey'." [...] Capable of playing any position, James was primarily a centre during her senior career, but excelled on defence. [...] In one game where her team was without a goaltender, she played the position and recorded a shutout.|$|E
500|$|... 2001 {{marked a}} turning point year when Cruz starred in the feature films Vanilla Sky and Blow. In Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe's {{interpretation}} of Open Your Eyes, she played Sofia Serrano, the love interest of Tom Cruise's character. The film received mixed reviews but made $200million worldwide. Her performance was well received by critics, with BBC film critic Brandon Graydon saying that Cruz [...] "is an enchanting screen presence", and Ethan Alter of the Film Journal International noting that Cruz and her co-star Cruise were [...] "able to generate some actual chemistry". Her next film was Blow, adapted from Bruce Porter's 1993 book Blow: How a Small Town Boy Made $100million with the Medellín Cocaine Cartel and Lost It <b>All.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> a supporting role as Mirtha Jung, the wife of Johnny Depp's character. The film received mixed reviews, but made $80million worldwide. Nina Willdorf of the Boston Phoenix described Cruz as [...] "multi-talented" [...] and Mark Salvo of The Austin Chronicle wrote [...] "I {{may be one of}} the last male holdouts to join the Cruz-Rules camp, but her tour de force performance here sucks you right in." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." [...] She left in tears.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 August Rook, {{still on}} her way to Britain with despatches, had the misfortune (having dodged one threat) to meet with two French privateers off Cape St. Nicholas (San Domingo). The larger French {{schooner}} carried 12 guns and the smaller schooner [...] 10 guns. An unusually accurate shot by Lieutenant Lawrence killed the captain of the largest privateer. After an hour-and-a-half hard fighting, the two privateers succeeded in taking Rook by boarding her. In <b>all,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> three crew members killed, including Lawrence, killed by a musket shot, and 11 wounded (including the Master's Mate - the second in command). The French stripped the survivors naked, including the wounded, and put them into a boat. Before doing so, they kicked Lawrence's body, stabbed to death a wounded sergeant of the Royal Artillery, and threw some wounded overboard. Fortunately, the four unwounded men were able to bring the boat to land where they encountered hospitable natives.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the popular}} fictional work I, Claudius by Robert Graves—based on Tacitus' innuendo—Livia {{is portrayed as}} a {{thoroughly}} Machiavellian, scheming political mastermind. [...] Determined never to allow republican governance to flower again, as she felt they led to corruption and civil war, and devoted to bringing Tiberius to power and then maintaining him there, she is involved in nearly every death or disgrace in the Julio-Claudian family up {{to the time of}} her death. [...] In her deathbed she only fears divine punishment for <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done, and secures the promise of future deification by her grandson Claudius, an act which, she believes, will guarantee her a blissful afterlife. [...] However, this portrait of her is balanced by her intense devotion to the well-being of the Empire as a whole, and her machinations are justified as a necessarily cruel means to what she firmly considers a noble aspiration: the common good of the Romans, achievable only under strict imperial rule. [...] In the 1976 BBC television series based on the book, Livia was played by Siân Phillips. Phillips won a BAFTA for her portrayal of the role.|$|E
2500|$|Wall told Alison Gardner from What's on TV that Grace feels [...] "jittery" [...] in {{the days}} before her wedding because she is thinks Trevor is having an affair.

Wall explained that Grace opens up about her wedding day being <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ever dreamed of growing up. She also pleads with him to not ruin her day. British paparazzi had acquired photographs of on location filming which appeared to suggest a funeral for Trevor was imminent. The reports were accurate as Grace's wedding episode was broadcast. Trevor decides that he wants to be with Grace. Sienna's daughter Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson) discovered Trevor's affair. The murderess character is furious with Trevor for ruining her family unit with Ben. She approaches Trevor outside the church and stabs him before fleeing the scene. Trevor recalls his promise to not let Grace down on her wedding day. He gains composure, hides his stabbing wound and enters the church to complete the wedding ceremony. They manage to marry, but Trevor collapses and dies at the altar.|$|E
