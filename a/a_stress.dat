5|$|Chambers' American {{football}} {{career was}} brought to a standstill when <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture injury on his right foot ruled him out for the season. The situation worsened further when the NFL closed the European league on 29 June 2007 leaving Chambers jobless. He returned as a TV personality on reality television show Cirque de Celebrité in October but was unpopular with the public and subsequently voted off.|$|E
5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> response.

He {{was expected to be}} sidelined for 8–10 weeks, but be available for the team's August trip to play in Europe. Beilein announced on June 3 that Max Bielfeldt had undergone hip surgery and was expected to miss most of the summer. On August 6, D. J. Wilson was sidelined for 4–6 weeks following surgery on his pinky finger. This announcement came prior to the team's August 15 departure for its summer trip to Italy.|$|E

50|$|Stress is {{generally}} unimportant in Zarma. According to Abdou Hamani (1980), two-syllable words are stressed {{on their first}} syllable unless that syllable is just a short vowel: a-, i- or u-. Three-syllable words have stress on their second syllable. The first consonant of <b>a</b> <b>stressed</b> syllable is pronounced a bit more strongly, and the vowel in the preceding syllable is weakened.

5|$|The 2010–11 NBA season started {{badly for}} the Rockets, who lost {{the first five}} games. In the seventh, Yao Ming injured his left ankle in what was just his fifth game that season. After being examined, what {{was thought to be}} a mild sprain turned out to be <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> {{fracture}} which kept Yao off of the court for another season. In July 2011, Yao, only 30, retired after a series of unfortunate injuries cut his career short.|$|E
5|$|Accrington Stanley {{accepted}} an undisclosed bid from Wrexham in July 2005, {{which included a}} sell-on clause and a bonus if he returned to play international football. He scored on his debut in a friendly against UEFA Champions League winners Liverpool in the 4–3 defeat after he came on as a substitute. McEvilly suffered <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture in a metatarsus bone on his right foot in the 1–1 home draw with Notts County on 11 December, although he declared himself fit to play their following game against Carlisle United, he was substituted after 45 minutes after receiving a mouth injury which had required temporary dental surgery the same evening. His foot injury was later operated on and he received further dental treatment. His return to the Wrexham team following his injury was on 9 April 2006, in their 2–1 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town when he came on as a substitute replacing Matt Crowell in the 45th minute. He made a further three appearances scoring one goal, before breaking the same bone again in mid-April sidelining him {{until the end of}} the season. During the 2005–06 season, McEvilly made a total of 23 appearances for Wrexham, scoring seven goals in League Two.|$|E
5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected that this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E

5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left elbow and <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He {{was reported to have}} done so {{at the request of the}} Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} {{in the fall}} of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity {{basketball}} team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed {{a large part of the}} season after getting off to a 6–0 start because of <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 World Championships, Lysacek placed {{second in}} the short program. He then won the free skating segment to win the {{competition}} overall, becoming the first American man since Todd Eldredge in 1996 to win the World title. His placement, combined with that of Brandon Mroz, qualified the United States for three entries in the men's event at the 2010 Winter Olympics. At the World Championships, Lysacek competed with <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture in his left foot, which prevented him from trying a quadruple jump at the competition. During the off-season, Lysacek took two months off from skating to give the injury time to heal. He was called the frontrunner for the 2010 Olympic gold by some journalists.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1996 regular season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers boasted the No. 4 rushing offense in Division I-A college football, averaging 292 rushing yards per game and 422 overall yards per game. Despite those figures, the Cornhuskers' two leading rushers were hampered by injury and their participation was in doubt. Ahman Green, who led the Nebraska offense with 155 carries, 917 rushing yards, and seven touchdowns, suffered <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture in his foot during the second-to-last Nebraska regular-season game. The No. 2 rusher, DeAngelo Evans, had 776 rushing yards and a team-high 14 rushing touchdowns, but was limited by a groin injury. Because of the injuries, Damon Benning, who earned 465 yards and seven touchdowns during the regular seasons, was anticipated to see significant playing time. Wide receiver Brenden Holbein also suffered an ankle injury in practice, but was able to play.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{went on to}} tally 34 {{points during}} his first {{campaign}} with Florida in 2008–09. The following season, on November 30, 2009, Ballard was involved in an on-ice incident that injured his own teammate, goaltender Tomáš Vokoun. After being on the ice for a goal during {{a game against the}} Atlanta Thrashers, Ballard aimed to smash his stick in frustration against the post and mistakenly hit Vokoun in the mask. Vokoun was taken from the ice on a stretcher and suffered a cut on his ear that required stitches; he missed two games before returning to the lineup. Ballard, who apologized to Vokoun following the game, was not disciplined by the Panthers or NHL. He went on to match his career-high eight goals and added 20 assists for 28 points in his second season with the Panthers. He also ranked third in the league in blocked shots with 201. Ballard had played parts of the season with a hip injury. After completing the campaign, he underwent the second hip surgery of his career in May 2010 to repair <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture and remove a cyst.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010–11 season, the Rockets {{said they}} would limit Yao to 24 minutes a game, with no plan to play him on {{back-to-back}} nights. Their goal was to keep Yao healthy in the long term. On December 16, 2010, {{it was announced that}} Yao had developed <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture in his left ankle, related to an older injury, and would miss the rest of the season. In January 2011, he was voted as the Western Conference starting center for the 2011 All-Star Game for the eighth time in nine seasons. Injured All-Stars are usually required to attend the All-Star functions and to be introduced at the game, but Yao was not in Los Angeles because of his rehabilitation schedule after his surgery. Yao's contract with the Rockets expired {{at the end of the}} season, and he became a free agent.|$|E

5|$|Hawkins {{was officially}} {{selected}} by Geelong in the 2006 national draft under the father–son rule. Whilst many pundits lauded {{him as the}} best key position prospect within the draft, and felt Hawkins' junior performances warranted possible selection with the top overall pick, the father-son rules at the time only required Geelong to use a middle-tier third round pick to draft him. The subsequent controversy over what was widely acknowledged as a bargain gain for the Cats led to the AFL amending the father-son ruling for future use. With {{a reputation as one}} of the finest young tall forwards in the land, Hawkins was immediately billed as the successor to the legendary Gary Ablett, whose retirement ten years earlier had left a gaping hole in Geelongs forward line. <b>A</b> <b>stress</b> reaction injury to his right leg, however, halted Hawkins' pre-season, forcing his much-awaited debut in Geelong colours to take place in the Victorian Football League (VFL) side.|$|E
5|$|He re-signed for Mansfield on 5 June 2015, {{starting}} a third spell with the League Two club. His debut came after {{starting a}} 4–1 away defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup on 11 August 2015. He played regularly {{at the start}} of 2015–16, but had a spell out of the team with <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture in his shin. He suffered a broken nose on his return as an 89th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away win over Barnet on 28 November 2015, and continued to struggle with his shin injury. Beardsley's first Mansfield goal in over nine years came on 30 January 2016 with a header from Malvind Benning's corner on 60 minutes in a 1–0 away victory over Crawley. He finished 2015–16 with 16 appearances and one goal as Mansfield ranked in 12th-place in League Two. He was released by the club in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|On November 9, 2007, Yao {{played against}} fellow Chinese NBA and Milwaukee Bucks player Yi Jianlian {{for the first}} time. The game, which the Rockets won 104–88, was {{broadcast}} on 19networks in China, and was watched by over 200million people in China alone, {{making it one of}} the most-watched NBA games in history. In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference. Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win streak to 12games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with <b>a</b> <b>stress</b> fracture in his left foot. He missed the 2008 NBA Playoffs, but he did not miss the 2008 Summer Olympics at Beijing, China in August. After Yao's injury, the Rockets stretched their winning streak to 22 games, at the time the second-longest such streak in NBA history. Yao underwent a successful operation on March 3, which placed screws in his foot to strengthen the bone, and recovery time was estimated at four months. Yao's final averages in 55games were 22.0points, 10.8rebounds, and 2.0blocks a game.|$|E
