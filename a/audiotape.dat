5|$|WCSP-FM is {{the first}} radio station to {{broadcast}} <b>audiotape</b> of historical U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments, with announcers explaining the court decision {{at the end of}} the recording. The broadcasts of the Supreme Court arguments have provided listeners in the U.S. and Canada with the opportunity to hear spoken words during oral arguments for several of the Court's most influential cases, including the Texas v. Johnson argument over flag-burning in 1989, and the Miranda v. Arizona argument in 1966. In September 2010 the Supreme Court began releasing audio recordings of the week's oral arguments each Friday, thereby allowing C-SPAN Radio to broadcast a selection of current arguments. Prior to this arrangement, recordings of oral arguments were occasionally made available on a same-day basis, which C-SPAN would request in cases of high public interest.|$|E

He is heard to be whistling, and he asks for the air conditioning to be turned on (it was). Police allege these tapes prove that Jackson's claims are false; Jackson, along with his family, claim that what is being shown is merely a biased portion of what actually occurred. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer ordered an independent investigation into Jackson's complaints. After interviewing 163 witnesses, the complaints were rejected in August 2004.|$|E

25|$|In {{analogue}} {{audio recording}} a tachometer is {{a device that}} measures the speed of <b>audiotape</b> as it passes across the head. The reel-to-reel format {{was used in the}} very earliest magnetic tape sound recorders, including the pioneering German Magnetophon machines of the 1930s. Originally, this format had no name, since all forms of magnetic tape recorders used it. The name arose only with the need to distinguish it from the several kinds of tape cartridges or cassettes such as the endless loop cartridge, Fidelipac, developed for radio station commercials and spot announcements in 1954, the full size cassette, developed by RCA in 1958 for home use, as well as the compact cassette developed by Philips in 1962, originally for dictation. Reel-to-reel tape was also used in early tape drives for data storage on mainframe computers, video tape recorder (VTR) machines, and high quality analog audio recorders, which have been in use from the early 1940s, up until the present.|$|E

500|$|The Evil Dead is a 1981 American supernatural horror film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Sam Raimi and executive produced by Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who also stars alongside Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an <b>audiotape</b> that releases a legion of demons and spirits, members of the group suffer from demonic possession, leading to increasingly gory mayhem. Raimi and the cast produced the short film Within the Woods as a [...] "prototype" [...] to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US$90,000 to produce The Evil Dead. The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in Morristown, Tennessee, in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the cast and crew.|$|E
500|$|The moral panic was not {{confined}} {{solely to the}} gender of the murderers, but also the role played by so-called [...] "video nasties". The news media immediately made a connection between the Bulger murder trial and the Capper murder trial when the horror movie [...] was mentioned as part of the testimonies. D.I. Wall said [...] "throughout interviews with the accused there was no suggestion that the reason Suzanne was killed {{had anything to do with}} [...] "Child's Play" [...] but this was overlooked by more sensationalist headlines (Demonic doll Chucky links the horror crimes; The curse of Chucky). Neither Powell or McNeilly owned a video recorder, and the Child's Play–inspired music that had been used to torture Capper was a popular track at the time, taped direct from Manchester's Piccadilly Radio. Broadcaster David Elstein called the video connection [...] "a false story... branded into the consciousness of the media," [...] and questioned the news media's fascination with the film: [...] "There is no reason to believe that Suzanne Capper [...] would be alive today if the <b>audiotape</b> had instead contained the torture scene from King Lear, or a catchphrase from Bruce Forsyth... But the Child's Play hare has been running ever since the last day of the James Bulger murder trial." [...] Elstein argued that the film was simply a scapegoat which the press [...] "made a three-course meal out of." [...] The Guardian reported that 21,000 four–nine-year-olds watched each of BSkyB's two transmissions of Child's Play 3 – but Elstein explained the figure was [...] "simply a projection based on an average of just two actual viewers from BARB's reporting panel, and that the margin of error means even the two may have been just one. But why spoil a good running story by asking what the figures mean?" ...|$|E
