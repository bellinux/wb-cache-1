40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{utilizing}} the obtaineddata from four distributed locations known asAbarkuh, Behabad, Halvan and Yazd, the solar energy potential and its characteristics in Yazd province of Iran have been evaluated. For the data, daily horizontal global radiation (HGR) and clearness index alsotheir monthly, seasonal and yearly averaged values have been obtained. The {{results indicate that}} the four locationsenjoy from 300, 294, 289 and 311 sunny and very sunny days; their yearly <b>averaged</b> <b>daily</b> clearness indexes are 0. 66, 0. 66, 0. 64 and 0. 67 and theiryearly <b>averaged</b> <b>daily</b> global radiations are 20. 74, 20. 78, 19. 52 and 20. 60 MJ/m, respectively. 2 In overall, Yazd province enjoys from sunshine hours in almost 76 % of the whole day times and its annually <b>averaged</b> <b>daily</b> HGR and clearness index are 20. 41 MJ/m and 0. 66, respectively. Making comparison between 2 the four nominated locations of Yazd province and 7 other selected cities around the globe, but at the same latitude, except Arizona, revealed that, their monthly mean daily global radiation and clearness index are higher than those of othersix selected cities. Due to the great potential of Yazd province more funds and endeavors for solar energy development have to be devoted.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} neural network method for estimating daily global solar irradiation in the horizontal surface by meteorological data in Indonesia. The database consists of 1826 daily measured data, in term of sunshine duration, average temperature, average relative humidity and global solar irradiation. The data has been collected in Jakarta (altitude 6 ° 15 ’S, longitude 106 ° 45 ’E), a city as capital of Indonesia. The 1461 daily measured data between 2005 and 2008 are used to train the neural networks while the data for 365 days in 2009 are used as testing data. The estimation of global solar irradiation were made using four combinations of proposed model of data sets namely: (i) day of the year, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> relative humidity and <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> temperature as inputs, (ii) day of the year, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> relative humidity and sunshine duration as inputs, (iii) day of the year, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> temperature and sunshine duration as inputs, (iv) day of the year, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> relative humidity, <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> temperature and <b>daily</b> sunshine duration as inputs. The output for the four combinations proposed model is <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> global solar irradiation. The comparison result show that the best model to estimate global solar irradiation is performed by (iii) and (iv) that obtain the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) at below 10 %...|$|R
