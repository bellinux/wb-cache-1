In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I was a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|E
500|$|Kekal has {{acknowledged}} in interviews that the band members, {{at the time}} interviewed, subscribed to Christianity, and {{has been described as}} one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology, and has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. Although Christianity has comprised a part of the band's lyrics, the band has said that from The Painful Experience (3rd album) onward its lyrics have not been associated with religion or ideology at all. Mark Allan Powell commented on this in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, stating that [...] "on the band's first two albums the songs testified to their Christian faith in an upfront way", but that on their third album, the band pulled back from an overt approach that [...] "Jeff says tended to turn people against the band before they gave the music a chance." [...] According to Powell, [...] "they maintain that three-fourths of their albums are purchased by non-Christians." [...] In an interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: [...] "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band. But then we knew we were also accepted within the Christian metal scene as well, that's cool to know, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it still less than 50% of our general fan base." ...|$|E

Azerbaijanis needed an excuse to equate a place to Sumgait, but they can not be compared. Yes, in fact, was in Khojaly civilians, but along with the civilians were soldiers. hen a shell is flying through the air, it doesn't distinguish between a civilian resident and a soldier; it doesn't have eyes.
