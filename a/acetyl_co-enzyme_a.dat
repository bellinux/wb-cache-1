40|$|An {{increased}} intracellular {{availability of}} the <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> esters of long-chain fatty acids is thought to underlie {{many aspects of the}} insulin resistance syndrome. However, the cause of clustering of a hyperdynamic circulation, sympathetic activation. hypertension, hyperuricaemia, and a raised haematocrit in the insulin resistance syndrome remains to be elucidated. We propose a mechanism that expands the etiological role of long-chain fatty acids. By inhibiting adenine nucleotide translocators. elevated intracellular concentrations of the <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> esters of long-chain fatty acids impair mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This is expected to result in a chronic systemic increase in extracellular adenosine concentrations. As adenosine stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, induces systemic vasodilatation, stimulates erythropoiesis. and induces renal vasoconstriction with renal sodium retention, increased extracellular ADO concentrations: may be the common denominator explaining the above-mentioned and still unexplained phenomena associated with the insulin resistance syndrome. Along the same lines, hyperuricaemia {{can be explained by the}} fact that adenosine is broken down to urate and because of increased renal urate retention. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|N-acetyl-l-histidine (NAH) is a {{prominent}} biomolecule in brain, retina and lens of poikilothermic vertebrates. In fish lens, NAH exhibits an unusual compartmentalized metabolism. It is synthesized from L-histidine (His) and <b>acetyl</b> <b>Co-enzyme</b> <b>A.</b> However, NAH cannot be catabolized by lens cells. For its hydrolysis, NAH is exported to ocular fluid where a specific acylase cleaves His {{which is then}} actively taken up by lens and re-synthesized into NAH. This energy-dependent cycling suggested a pump mechanism operating at the lens/ocular fluid interface. Additional studies led to the hypothesis that NAH functioned as a molecular water pump (MWP) to maintain a highly dehydrated lens and avoid cataract formation. In this process, each NAH molecule released to ocular fluid down its gradient carries with it 33 molecules of bound water, effectively transporting the water against a water gradient. In ocular fluid the bound water is released for removal from the eye {{by the action of}} NAH acylase.

40|$|Certain tissues {{have long}} been {{recognized}} to exhibit apparently normal movements when isolated from the body. Originally this was attributed {{to the presence of}} nervous tissue, but Gaskell and Engelmann {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century established that cardiac muscle possessed the power of spontaneous rhythmic activity. It is now generally accepted that the heart beat is myogenic and not neurogenic in origin. Ciliary movement has always been regarded as autonomous and in 1924 Gray drew attention to the fact that the behaviour of cilia wider various conditions was similar to that of cardiac muscle. The natural occurrence and intense biological activity of the catechol amines and acetylcholine led to several workers to suggest that they might act as 'local hormones' controlling tissue activity at the site of production. Evidence has accumulated that acetylcholine, in addition to its function as a nervous transmitter, is responsible for the maintenance of spontaneous tissue movements. In 1952, Kordik, BÃ¼lbring and Burn made a comprehensive stody of the control of the ciliary activity on the epithelium which lined the frog's oesophagus and the rabbit's trachea. They reported the presence of the enzymes concerned with the synthesis and breakdown of acetylcholine, and they demonstrated that both acetylcholine and eserine in low concentrations stimulated activity, whereas in high concentrations these same drugs depressed the activity. Both atropine and tubocurarine were found to depress the activity. Recently Hill (1957) reported that she had been unable to repeat the observations of Kordik et al. on acetylcholine and tubocurarine, and she suggested that the previous re suite were due to artefacts arising out of the experimental procedure. As the earlier authors had stated that as a result of their observations they considered the ciliary activity to be controlled by acetylcholine it was thought necessary to undertake further experiments on the effect of tubocurarine and acetylcholine, and to try to account for the differences in the results obtained by Kordik et al. and those obtained by Hill. A preparation of the frog's oesophagus was a very strict experimental procedure was adhered to to avoid the possibility of artefacts arising. Under such conditions it was found that when the membrane was bathed with a bicarbonate Ringer's solution tubocurarine in a concentration of 10 - 6 g/ml caused a marked decrease in activity and acetylcholine in a concentration of 10 - 6 g/ml a marked increase. These results thus confirmed the previous findings of Kordik et al. On reinvestigating the methods which Hill had used it was noticed that in the majority of her experiments the membrane had been bathed with a Ringer's solution buffered with phosphate. Experiments were, therefore, carried out using this Ringer's solution to bathe the membrane and it was found that tubocurarine was in fact without significant effect. Further experiments showed that on the same preparation tubocurarine was without effect in the phosphate Ringer, and then caused a decrease in activity when the Ringer was changed to one containing bicarbonate instead of phosphate. Experiments showed that the effect was not due to changes in pH, but was probably due to a reduction in Ca ++ ions caused by the complexing of these ions with the phosphate. Further experiments were carried out on a ciliated epithelium by BÃ¼lbring, Burn and Shelley in 1953 using the gill plates of Mytilus edulis, an example of a nerve free tissue. They measured both the force and the rate of the ciliary beat and observed the effect of acetylcholine, eserine, atropine and tubocurarine on these two activities. They concluded from their results that these cilia were also controlled by acetylcholine. They were able to demonstrate the presence of a true cholinesterase in the tissue, but the one weak link in their chain of evidence concerned the formation of acetylcholine. Though they found quite large amounts of acetylcholine in the gill plates they were only able to find a very low choline acetylase activity which would have been quite unable to maintain the high tissue level of acetylcholine. The choline acetylase activity of the gill plates has now been reinvestigated. By the use of more accurate and reliable methods a far higher activity has been found. A partially purified preparation of the enzyme showed a twenty fold increase in activity over that previously observed. The production of acetylcholine was measured over a wide range of temperature. It was found that a steady rate of production occurred over the normal experimental temperature range. The experiments of BÃ¼lbring et al. were carried out at 37 Â°C and it was found that at this temperature the rate of synthesis was beginning to fall. Further experiments showed that whereas the enzyme was fairly stable at 20 Â°C it was rapidly inactivated at 37 Â°C. Gosselin (1959) has recently reported that both 5 -hydroxytryptamine and 5 -hydroxytryptophan stimulated the ciliary activity on the gill plates of Mytilus. He also reported the presence of a 5 -hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase. As Bleschko and Hope (1957) failed to detect any amine oxidase activity in the gill plates it was decided to repeat their observations using 5 -hydroxytryptamine as a substrate since this had not previously been used. The results showed that homogenates of Mytilus gill plates were able to oxidize 5 -hydroxytryptamine but not tryptamine, tyramine or Î²-phenylethylamine. The reaction was not affected by Mersilid, a potent amine oxidase inhibitor, but was completely stopped by cyanide. These observations suggested that the enzyme was not an amine oxidase but a phenolase. Further to this idea it was found that 5 -hydroxytryptophan was also oxidized. Experiments on the choline acetylase system and the synthesis of acetylcholine by acetone-dried powders prepared from rabbit atria were carried out in 1949 by BÃ¼lbring and Burn. They found that acetylcholine could be synthesized by the acetone powders in the presence of adenosinetriphosphate, citrate and 'boiled brain activator. ' They observed that if acetylcholine was added to the reagents at the beginning of the experiment a decreased rate of synthesis resulted. They carried out further experiments in which they used acetone-dried powders which had been prepared from rabbit atria which had ceased to beat after being suspended in an isolated organ bath for many hours. They found that these powders were only capable of synthesizing acetylcholine in very small amounts, and when acetylcholine was added at the start of the experiment an increase in the synthetic rate was observed. A further observation made by BÃ¼lbring and Burn was that if small amounts of acetylcholine were added to a bath containing an atria which had ceased to beat, then the beat was often restarted. A sequel to this observation was made by Burn and Rand (1958) who showed that if a rabbit atria preparation with the vagi intact was cooled until the beat stopped, then stimulation of the vagi restarted the beat. The experiments now carried out were designed to repeat the observations of BÃ¼lbring and Burn using more modern techniques and to attempt to explain the unusual observations that under some conditions acetylcholine depressed, and under other conditions augmented the rate of synthesis. Experiments were also carried out to measure the acetylcholine content of normal atria, and atria which had ceased to beat from exhaustion. Observations were made on the effect of temperature on the rate of synthesis of acetylcholine, and particular attention was paid to that temperature range at which atria ceased to beat when they were cooled. The results obtained showed that the synthesis of acetylcholine was dependent on the availability of <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A.</b> This emphasized the point that in any studies on choline acetylase it is essential that the availability of <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> does not become rate limiting. When acetylcholine was added to an incubation fully saturated with <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> no significant effect was observed. Further experiments showed, however, that if the <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> concentration was reduced then the addition of acetylcholine now caused a decrease in synthesis. Acetone-dried powders from exhausted atria were shown to have the same choline acetylase activity as acetone-dried powders from normal atria, and the addition of acetylcholine to the incubation mixture caused inhibition when the <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> concentration was low. The aceto-co-A-kinase activity of acetone powders from normal and exhausted atria was measured. The activity in the exhausted atria was found to be only 35 % of the normal. This was thought to account for the low rate of synthesis observed by BÃ¼lbring and Burn with exhausted atria as they had relied upon this enzyme to catalyse the formation of <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A.</b> Experiments were carried out in which the aceto-co-A-kinase present in the exhausted atria was relied upon to catalyse the formation of <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A,</b> the results showed only a very low rate of synthesis. Under these conditions the addition of acetylcholine to the incubation mixture resulted in an increased synthesis. If the reaction mixture was supplemented with aceto-co-A-kinase a greater rate of synthesis was observed and now the addition of acetylcholine caused a decrease in synthesis. Estimations of the acetylcholine content of both normal and exhausted atria were made and the results indicated a 50 % reduction in exhausted atria. Experiments on the choline acetylase activity over a wide range of temperature showed that the activity dropped very rapidly below 20 Â°C in the range where atria stopped beating when they were cooled. Experiments were carried out on rabbit hearts to record the incidence of ventricular fibrillation induced electrically and the relationship between fibrillation, the composition of the perfusing fluid and the temperature. Armitage, Burn and Gunning (1957) and KÃ¤rki (1958) made observations on isolated rabbit hearts perfused using a modified Langendorff apparatus. They induced fibrillation electrically and noted whether the fibrillation continued or whether normal rhythm was restored after the cessation of the electrical stimulus. They recorded the percentage of hearts which remained fibrillating at given ionic concentrations of the perfusing fluid. They showed that a reduction in the K + ion, and in the Na + ion concentration favoured fibrillation, whereas a decrease in the Ca ++ ion concentration made fibrillation less likely. The resulting curves plotting percentage fibrillation against ionic composition showed one or two unusual peaks especially when the Ca ++ ion concentration was varied. In 1958 Goodford found that hearts which remained fibrillating at 37 Â°C would often revert to a normal rhythm when cooled to 32 Â°C, and he suggested that at 37 Â°C, which was the temperature used by the previous workers, the heart was in a state of partial anoxia. Observations have now been made on the persistence of fibrillation at 32 Â°C and 27 Â°C. The results show the same trend as previously found, but the results show a more rational appearance. The results are discussed with a view to the fact that anoxia will affect both the length of the refractory period, and the rate of rise of the action potential. </p...|$|E

The optimization of such sensors may require multiple experiments to determine suitable experimental conditions for the immobilization and detection. In this study we employ molecular modeling techniques {{to assist in the}} design of nanobiosensors to detect herbicides. As a proof of principle, the properties of <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> carboxylase (ACC) were obtained with molecular dynamics simulations, from which the dimeric form in an aqueous solution was found to be more suitable for immobilization owing to a smaller structural fluctuation than the monomeric form. Upon solving the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation using a finite-difference procedure, we found that the active sites of ACC exhibited a positive surface potential while the remainder of the ACC surface was negatively charged. Therefore, optimized biosensors should be prepared with electrostatic adsorption of ACC onto an AFM tip functionalized with positively charged groups, leaving the active sites exposed to the analyte. The preferential orientation for the herbicides diclofop and atrazine with the ACC active site was determined by molecular docking calculations which displayed an inhibition coefficient of 0. 168 Î¼M for diclofop, and 44. 11 Î¼M for atrazine. This binding selectivity for the herbicide family of diclofop was confirmed by semiempirical PM 6 quantum chemical calculations which revealed that ACC interacts more strongly with the herbicide diclofop than with atrazine, showing binding energies of - 119. 04 and + 8. 40 kcal mol- 1, respectively.

40|$|Polyketides {{are natural}} {{products}} with complex chemical structures and immense pharmaceutical potential that are synthesized via secondary metabolic pathways. The in-vitro synthesis of these molecules requires high supply of building blocks such as <b>acetyl</b> <b>Co-enzyme</b> <b>A,</b> and cofactors (adenosine triphosphate (ATP). These precursor and cofactor are synthesized from respective soluble enzymes. Owing to the expensive {{nature of the}} enzymes, {{it is important to}} immobilize enzymes to improve the process economics by enabling multiple uses of catalyst and improving overall productivity and robustness. The polymer-based particles of nano and submicron size have become attractive material for their role in the life sciences. With the advances in synthetic protocols of the microgels and commercial availability of many of the monomers, it is feasible to tune the properties of the particles as per the process requirement. The core shell microgel with functional shell allows high loading of ligands onto the microgel particles due to increased availability of functional group on the outer surface. The aim of the thesis thus was to study biochemical reactions on the smart microgels support using single (acetyl CoA synthetase (Acs)) and dual (pyruvate kinase (Pk) and L-lactic dehydrogenase (Ldh)) enzyme/s systems. The study indicated that the enzyme immobilization significantly depends on the enzyme, conjugation strategy and the support. The covalent immobilization provides rigidity to the enzyme structure as in case of Acs immobilized on PNIPAm-AEMA microgels {{but at the same time}} leads to loss in enzyme activity. Whereas, in the case of covalent immobilization of Ldh on microgel showed improved in enzyme activity. On the other hand adsorption of the enzyme via ionic interaction provide better kinetic profile of enzymes hence the membrane reactor was prepared using PNIPAm-PEI conjugates for acetyl CoA synthesis. The better outcome of work with PNIPAm-PEI resulted in its further evaluation for dual enzyme system. This work is unique in the view that the immobilization strategies were well adapted to immobilize single and dual enzymes to achieve stable bioconjugates for their respective applications in precursor biosynthesis (Acetyl Co enzyme A) and co-factor dependent processes (ACoA and ATP).

40|$|Myostatin (Mstn), {{a member}} of the {{transforming}} growth factor-Î² super family, is a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. Studies delineating the function of Mstn have identified multiple signal transduction pathways that convey the Mstn signal. Mstn has been shown to influence canonical TGF-Î², mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the PI 3 K/AKT signal transduction cascades. The discovery in our laboratory of a novel splice variant of Mstn (MSV) that opposes Mstn and stimulates the proliferation of myoblasts provided the impetus for the investigations in this thesis. The splicing of MSV was restricted to the Cetartiodactyl clade of mammals, and MSV may represent an intragenic regulator of Mstn. Thus, the studies undertaken in this thesis were to delineate the signalling pathways used by Mstn and MSV in order to understand how their opposing roles in myoblasts regulate myogenesis. Initially, microarray analysis was used to investigate the transcriptional responses of ovine myoblasts following exposure to recombinant Mstn (eukaryotic) and MSV (prokaryotic) protein. Mstn treatment induced changes in number of transcripts, with changes consistent with previous investigations, for example increased interlukin- 6 (IL 6) and decreased MyoD. In addition, a novel transcriptional target of Mstn, the Î² 1 subunit of the Naâº-Kâº-ATPase was discovered. Treatment of ovine myoblasts with recombinant MSV induced a plethora of transcriptional responses. IPA analysis suggested a number of these were due to LPS (endotoxin) contamination, which could be attributed to the production of this protein in E. coli. This was confirmed using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Phase separation using Triton-X 114 proved an effective method for the removal of LPS from the MSV preparation. Western blot analysis was performed following the treatment of ovine myoblasts with Mstn and purified MSV. Consistent with previous myoblast studies Mstn stimulated canonical TGF-Î² (Smad) signalling and the p 38 and ERK components of the MAPK signalling cascade. In contrast to previous studies, Mstn also stimulated AKT signalling, with specific phosphorylation of serine 473 (AKTSâ´â·Â³). In addition, Mstn altered the abundance of multiple myogenic transcription factors (MyoD, Myf 5, MRF 4, Pax 7 and Mef 2) and the abundance and/or the phosphorylation of targets that have a metabolic role in skeletal muscle (rps 6, 4 EBP 1 and p 70 S 6 K). Treatment with MSV increased the abundance of Smad 3, Myf 5, 4 EBP 1 and stimulated AKTSâ´â·Â³and 4 EBP 1 phosphorylation. These data provided the foundation for confirmation of these pathways targeted by MSV in CâCââ myoblasts that stably expressed MSV. CâCââ cells expressing MSV had an increased proliferative capacity and showed increased mitochondrial activity (EZ 4 U assay) as compared to controls. These cells showed an increased abundance of the MRFs MyoD, MRF 4 and Myogenin and an increased abundance or phosphorylation of signalling targets involved in canonical TGF-Î², MAPK and PI 3 K/AKT signalling cascades. In addition, cells expressing MSV had an increased abundance and phosphorylation of <b>acetyl</b> <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> carboxylase (ACC) and 4 EBP 1, which have established roles in regulating metabolism and the synthesis of protein. The significant overlap of processes influenced by the Naâº, Kâº ATPase complex and Mstn prompted an investigation on how Mstn regulates the Î² 1 subunit of the Naâº, Kâº ATPase. This transcriptional response was found to be dependent on the Smad pathway. In addition, these studies also show that Naâº Kâº ATPase activity plays a role in proliferation and differentiation of ovine myoblasts and suggest that Mstn inhibits ion flow controlled through the function of this enzyme complex. In conclusion, these studies show that Mstn and MSV share a number of common signalling targets. In contrast to previous studies of Mstn, the stable expression MSV increases the activation of AKT signalling and increases the abundance of key myogenic transcription factors. In addition, MSV increases the abundance and phosphorylation of ACC and 4 EBP 1, molecules involved regulating the synthesis of protein and fatty acids. In addition, the Î² 1 subunit of the Naâº Kâº ATPase, was identified as a novel transcriptional target of Mstn, with this regulation controlled through a Smad dependant mechanism. These data confirm the postulate that Mstn and MSV have divergent signalling functions and suggest a role for MSV in the control of oxidative metabolism...|$|E

In the present study, we evaluated the anti-oxidative and anti-atherosclerotic potential of shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) using its solventâsolvent partitioned fractions {{that consisted of}} methanol:dichloromethane (M:DCM), hexane (HEX), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA) and aqueous residue (AQ). The hexane fraction (1 mg/mL) mostly scavenged (67. 38 %, IC 50 0. 55 mg/mL) the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, contained the highest reducing capacity (60. 16 mg gallic acid equivalents/g fraction), and most potently inhibited lipid peroxidation (67. 07 %), low density lipo-protein oxidation and the activity of 3 -hydroxy 3 -methyl glutaryl <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> reductase (HMGR). GCâMS analyses of the hexane fraction identified Î±-tocopherol (vitamin E), oleic acid, linoleic acid, ergosterol and butyric acid as the bio-functional components present in L. edodes. Our findings suggest that L. edodes possesses anti-atherosclerotic bio-functionality {{that can be applied}} as functional food-based therapeutics against cardiovascular diseases...|$|R

50|$|Fats {{stored in}} adipose tissue are {{released}} from the fat cells into the blood as free fatty acids and glycerol when insulin levels are low and glucagon and epinephrine levels in the blood are high. This occurs between meals, during fasting, starvation and strenuous exercise, when blood glucose levels are likely to fall. Fatty acids are very high energy fuels, and are taken up by all metabolizing cells which have mitochondria. This is because fatty acids can only be metabolized in the mitochondria. Red blood cells do not contain mitochondria and are therefore entirely dependent on glycolysis (the fermentation of glucose into lactic acid) for their energy requirements. Neurons of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) are also unable to uptake fatty acids because fatty acids cannot pass the blood-brain barrier. In all other tissues the fatty acids that enter the metabolizing cells are combined with <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> to form acyl-CoA chains. These are transferred into the mitochondria of the cells, where they are broken down into acetyl-CoA units by a sequence of reactions known as Î²-oxidation.|$|R
40|$|Statins are {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed lipid lowering agents because of their effectiveness, tolerability and ease of administration. Atorvastatin calcium is synthetic lipid lowering agent which inhibits 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> reductase, preventing theconversion of HMG-CoA to Mevolanate. Its absolute bioavailability is 14 % and coming under the class II of biopharmaceutical classificationsystem. To enhance the solubility of atorvastatin cyclodextrin complexation techniques was employed. Phase solubility studies were carried outto optimize the ratio of complexing agent with drug. Drug with MÎ²CD found to increase the solubility maximum extent evident from the higherKs value. Further formulation prepared by spray drying displayed maximum solubility and improved release rate. Characterization such as FTIR,SEM, DSC {{has been found to}} be satisfactory. Optimized formulation was directly compressed with superdisintegrnats into fast dispersibleformulations, which showed immediate disintegration and faster rate of drug release compared to marketed formulation with L-HPC beingoptimum. Thus a fast dispersible tablet of atorvatstatin was formulated using cyclodextrin complex resulted in enhanced solubility and fasterdisintegration and immediate release rate...|$|R

40|$|Carnitine is {{essential}} for muscle energy production and {{is required for the}} transport of long chain fatty acids and acyl <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> derivatives across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Recently, an absorptive transport mechanism was discovered at the small bowel level suggesting the possibility of a carnitine deficient state in patients with mucosal damage. Therefore, this study investigated carnitine concentrations in serum of patients with coeliac disease. Serum samples were obtained from 12 patients with active coeliac disease and seven with non-active disease, and compared with serum samples of 17 children with gastrointestinal symptoms but with a small bowel normal on biopsy examination and 33 normal controls. Total serum carnitine concentration was significantly lower in the patients with coeliac disease compared with the other two groups and to reference values. When the degree of atrophy of coeliac intestinal mucosa was numerically graded, serum carnitine concentrations did not correlate to the degree of the intestinal lesion but were significantly lower in the damaged intestine compared with the group with normal mucosa. It is suggested that coeliac disease should be considered as a potential cause of secondary carnitine deficiency...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the roles of the Acyl <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> oxidase (ACOX), carnitine acyl transferase I (CAT- 1) and activating protein 1 (AP- 1) in the reversal of hepatic steatosis with dietary change and n- 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n- 3 LCPUFA) supplementation. Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were given either a control diet (CD) or a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, and then continued with the CD or CD plus n- 3 LCPUFA for eight weeks. After this period, body and adipose visceral tissue weight were analyzed and liver samples were taken to measure ACOX, CAT- 1 and c-jun levels. The dietary change from HFD to a norm caloric diet plus n- 3 LCPUFA supplementation significantly reduced liver steatosis and adipose tissue: body weight ratio, along with an increase in the hepatic ACOX and CAT- 1 levels and normalization of AP- 1 expression that could favor the fatty acid beta-oxidation over lipogenesis and regulate inflammation. These results provide new data on the enzymatic metabolism underlying dietary change to a norm caloric diet plus n- 3 LCPUFA supplementation...|$|R
30|$|The third type of {{fuel source}} in cancer cells is fatty acids, which enter the TCA cycle after {{undergoing}} Î²-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is the substrate for both the fatty acid synthesis pathway and the TCA cycle, making lipogenesis an important convergence point for TCA cycle flux and cellular biosynthesis (Migita et al., 2008). In the process of Î²-oxidation, the acyl chain undergoes oxidation, introducing a double bond, followed by hydration to alcohol and oxidation to ketone. Finally, <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> cleaves the acyl tail to yield an acetyl-CoA and reduces the fatty acid chain length by two carbons. This process generates more acetyl-CoA per molecule than does either glucose or glutamine (Berg JM, 2002). De novo synthesis of fatty acids is critical to supply lipids for cell membrane formation in rapidly proliferating cells, and is regulated by fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes: adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FAS). ACLY converts citrate to oxaloacetate and cytosolic acetyl-CoA. This cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by ACC to form malonyl-CoA, which is then combined with additional acetyl-CoA until the 16 -carbon unsaturated fatty acid palmitate is formed. Palmitate can then be modified to form additional required components of cell membrane.|$|R

Clinical and laboratory studies suggest that 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (HRIs) may decrease the incidence of and pathophysiologic factors leading to chronic rejection. MethodsA number of clinical and laboratory investigations have been designed to evaluate the effect of HRIs on chronic rejection. ResultsClinical trials in heart transplant patients suggest that HRIs decrease the incidence of chronic rejection in a manner that may be independent of lipid lowering. Subsequent studies in animal transplant models confirm that HRIs reduce chronic rejection. In further studies to elucidate the possible mechanisms of this effect, it has been observed that HRIs have an inhibitory effect on an number of lymphoid cell lines and vascular smooth muscle cells. HRIs may also prevent chronic rejection by protecting the endothelium from injury and dysfunction, perhaps by up-regulating nitric oxide synthesis. ConclusionsHRIs may be the first agents to be effective in preventing chronic rejection. Although the mechanism behind this protective effect is unclear, it seems likely that HRIs may affect multiple factors that could lead to chronic rejection...|$|R

40|$|Sulfur is a {{necessary}} dietary component that can be toxic at excessive concentrations. Animal bodies are about 0. 15 % sulfur by weight ([NRC, 1988] and [NRC, 1998]). Sulfur is incorporated into many essential molecules, including biotin, chondroitin sulfate, cartilage mucopolysaccharides, <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A,</b> fibrinogen, glutathione, heparin, lipoic acid, mucins, and thiamine ([NRC, 1988], [NRC, 1996] and [NRC, 1998]). In addition to these biologically active compounds, sulfur is an intricate component of sulfur containing amino acids, such as methionine, cysteine, cystine, homocysteine, and taurine. With the exception of thiamine and biotin, all sulfur containing compounds in the body can be synthesized from methionine (NRC, 1996). Thus, thiamine, biotin, and methionine are essential nutrients in the diet of monogastric animals, but ruminant microbes can synthesize these compounds from inorganic sulfate in the diet (Block et. al., 1951). Species differences are such that cats cannot synthesize taurine from methionine, making it an essential nutrient in their diets. Recommended daily dietary intakes of sulfur are 0. 15 %, 0. 14 â 0. 26 %, 0. 15 â 0. 2 %, and 0. 2 â 0. 25 % of the diet for horses, sheep, beef cattle, and dairy cattle, respectively ([NRC, 1985], [NRC, 1988], [NRC, 1989] and [NRC, 1996]) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{illustrate}} the antihypercholesterolaemic mechanism of Lipovedic - a polyherbal formulation. Materials and Methods: The antihypercholesterolaemic mechanism of Lipovedic (180 mg/kg, p. o) was studied {{by measuring the}} serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C), Faecal cholesterol (FC) and bile acid excretion in triton induced hyperlipidaemic rats at 0 h, 18 h, 24 h, 40 h, and 48 h and in high cholesterol diet (HCD) induced hypercholesterolaemic rats on day 7, 14, 21 and 28. Hydroxy- 3 -Methyl Glutaryl <b>Co-Enzyme</b> <b>A</b> (HMG CoA) /mevalonate ratio was measured in the liver homogenate for the HMG-CoA reductase activity. Atorvastatin (7. 2 mg/kg p. o) was used as reference standard. One-way ANOVA, Post-hock analysis by Tukeyâ²s multiple comparison tests was done using GraphPad Prism 5. Results: Lipovedic (180 mg/kg, p. o) reduced the serum TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C and increased the serum HDL-C in triton treated and HCD fed rats. Lipovedic increased FC excretion. HMG CoA/Mevalonate ratio was significantly higher compared to vehicle control rats {{and the result was}} comparable with Atorvastatin (7. 2 mg/kg p. o).

Using a murine model of steatohepatitis (mice fed a diet deficient in methionine and choline-MCD diet), we tested the effects of the insulin-sensitising, PPARgamma agonist drug pioglitazone (PGZ) on systemic and intrahepatic insulin sensitivity and on liver pathology. Compared to controls, mice fed the MCD diet develop a significant steatohepatitis, have enhanced glucose tolerance and enhanced systemic response to insulin. PGZ did not affect the systemic insulin sensitivity in control or MCD-fed mice as assessed in vivo by intraperitoneal glucose or insulin dynamic tests. However, PGZ prevented hepatic fat accumulation and steatohepatitis induced by the MCD diet. This effect was associated with an increased mass of adipose tissue and increased expression and release of adiponectin, while hepatic acyl <b>co-enzyme</b> <b>A</b> oxidase and acyl-co-enzyme A carboxylase, regulating hepatic beta-oxidation of fatty acid, remained unchanged.

Methods We analyzed a cohort of 3, 386 patients receiving more than one fill of statin medications through an integrated, inner-city health care system between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2002. Our measure of adherence was days of drug acquisition divided by days in the study for each patient, with adequate adherence defined as â¥ 80 %. Log-binomial regression was used to determine the relative risk of various factors, including prescription size, on adherence. We also assessed the relationship between adherence and total cholesterol using multiple linear regression. Results After controlling for age, gender, race, co-payment, comorbidities, and insurance status, patients who obtained a majority of fills as 60 -day supply compared with 30 -day supply {{were more likely to be}} adherent to their statin medications (RR 1. 41, 95 % CI 1. 28 â 1. 55, P Conclusion In a healthcare system serving predominantly indigent patients, the provision of a greater quantity of statin medication at each prescription fill contributes to improved adherence and greater drug effectiveness. </p...|$|R
