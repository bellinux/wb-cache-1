5|$|The Action of 24 March 1811 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, fought {{as part of the}} Royal Navy blockade of the French English Channel ports. By 1811, Royal Navy control of the French coast was so entrenched that French ships were unable to travel safely even in French territorial waters. In late 1810, French frigates Elisa and <b>Amazone</b> sailed from Le Havre to join with a larger squadron at Cherbourg, but were intercepted by a British frigate squadron and forced to shelter at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. There they came under sustained attack and Elisa was destroyed, <b>Amazone</b> successfully slipping back to Le Havre under cover of darkness. To prevent <b>Amazone</b> from escaping once more, the British blockade squadron was reinforced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amazone</b> {{served in}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet during her peacetime career. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was deployed as a coastal defense ship. In 1916, she was disarmed and used as a training ship, and was converted into a barracks ship in 1917. She was retained by the Reichsmarine {{after the end of}} the war and served on active duty with the new German Navy through the 1920s. She was reduced to secondary duties after 1931, and remained in service as a barracks ship into the 1950s; <b>Amazone</b> was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1954.|$|E
5|$|<b>Amazone</b> {{served with}} the Reichsmarine from 1923 to 1930. Korvettenkapitän Alfred Saalwächter took command of the ship in 1926; he later {{went on to become}} a senior admiral during World War II. <b>Amazone</b> was {{stricken}} from the naval register on 31 March 1931. The ship was then used as a floating barracks for the Submarine Acceptance Commission in Kiel, and later as an auxiliary for the Warship Construction Test Office, submarine group. She survived World War II and after 1945, she was again used as a barracks ship in Bremen. The old cruiser was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1954 in Hamburg.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Medusa and Arcona were converted into floating anti-aircraft batteries and defended German ports from 1940 {{to the end of}} the war, when they were scuttled by their crews on 3 May 1945. <b>Amazone</b> meanwhile remained in service as a barracks ship through the end of the war. Dalmacija was captured by the Italians after the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, renamed Cattaro, and pressed into service with the Italian Navy. She was then captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in September 1943, and returned to her original name, Niobe. The ship ran aground in the Adriatic in December 1943 and was destroyed by a pair of British Motor Torpedo Boats. Niobe, Medusa, and Arcona were broken up for scrap in the late 1940s, but <b>Amazone</b> lingered on as a barracks ship until 1954, when she too was sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Rosseau gave {{orders for}} the French frigates to sail once more, {{slipping}} away from the British ships which had drifted {{to the north and}} anchoring safely between the batteries at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and the island of Tatihou. Observing the strong position the French frigates had taken up, Grant sent messages to Malcolm's force at Cherbourg requesting reinforcements. Malcolm brought Donegal and Revenge to support the frigates on 14 November, maintaining position off the anchorage despite a strong gale which caused Elisa to drag her anchors. Captain Fraycinet-Saulce was forced to throw much of the ship's stores overboard to prevent his frigate from being wrecked on the shore. The following day, Diana took advantage of the rising tide to attack the anchored <b>Amazone,</b> Captain Rosseau withdrawing deeper into the sheltered anchorage under protection from the batteries. Twice more Grant launched probing attacks on the French frigate, each time beaten off by heavy fire from the batteries. Joined by Malcolm and the remainder of the British force, four successive attacks were launched against <b>Amazone,</b> each one driven back by cannon fire. At 13:00, with the tide falling, the British squadron was compelled to retreat to deeper water, out of range of the French. All four British ships had suffered under fire, with two killed and five wounded on Revenge, three wounded on Donegal and one wounded on Diana. French losses were a single man killed on <b>Amazone.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{nearly two}} weeks the French frigates {{remained}} at anchor, Malcolm and Grant drawing up plans for an attack with fireships, when <b>Amazone</b> successfully slipped out of harbour on 27 November, returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day. With <b>Amazone</b> gone, Grant maintained a closer watch on Elisa, calling up a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December. This proved no more accurate than the rockets, but Elisa was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack, this time becoming irretrievably grounded on a shoal. Over {{the next two weeks}} Elisa remained grounded, the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck. On 23 December Grant sent his boats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe, into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate's stores could not be salvaged.|$|E

5|$|Navigation {{through the}} rocks {{of the bay}} had been difficult, and {{as she entered the}} bay Amazones rudder had been torn away, {{rendering}} the ship unmanoeuverable. With <b>Amazone</b> trapped, Macnamara called {{up the rest of the}} Cherbourg squadron, the frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and the brig-sloops HMS Goshawk under Commander James Lilburn and HMS Hawk under Commander Henry Bourchier. This force was required to remain a substantial distance offshore as the rocky coastline posed a considerable danger to the British ships. Macnamara's plan was to wait for high tide and then bring the squadron closer inshore to bombard the French frigate into surrender. As they waited, the squadron was joined by Niobe from the Le Havre under Captain John Wentworth Loring. At 16:00 the tides were optimal for the attack and Niobe, Amelia and Berwick sailed into the bay. However, Rosseau had situated <b>Amazone</b> in a strong position, protected from close attack by rocks and shoals and in consequence the British ships could only fire as they wore around, resulting in scattered and inaccurate fire. As they advanced, the British ships came under fire from <b>Amazone,</b> which killed one sailor on Berwick and killed one and wounded another on Amelia, while the British fire had no effect on the French ship. At 18:00, Macnamara withdrew his ships from the bay, all three vessels having suffered considerable damage to their rigging and sails from Amazones shot.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{surviving}} {{ships were}} withdrawn from front-line service in 1916 {{and used for}} auxiliary purposes. They went on {{to serve in the}} new Reichsmarine, with the exception of Gazelle, which was broken up for scrap in 1920. Niobe was sold to Yugoslavia in 1925 and renamed Dalmacija, while Nymphe and Thetis were scrapped in the early 1930s. Arcona, Medusa, and <b>Amazone</b> were used as barracks hulks {{for the rest of the}} 1930s. After the outbreak of World War II, Medusa and Arcona were converted into floating anti-aircraft batteries and defended German ports from 1940 to the end of the war, when they were scuttled by their crews on 3 May 1945. <b>Amazone</b> meanwhile remained in service as a barracks ship through the end of the war. Dalmacija eventually returned to German control in 1943, and she was destroyed in December of that year by British Motor Torpedo Boats.|$|E
5|$|With the {{destruction}} of Elisa, the British squadrons returned to their blockade duties off Cherbourg and Le Havre. The blockade remained in place throughout {{the remainder of the}} Napoleonic Wars; Rosseau in <b>Amazone</b> made another attempt to join the squadron in Cherbourg in March 1811, only to be run down and destroyed by a squadron led by the ship of the line HMS Berwick. The new Iphigénie survived a little longer, being intercepted and captured in the Atlantic during a raiding mission in January 1814.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} this British force on 2 January 1794 was {{initially}} a success, the squadron over-running and capturing two large and well-armed privateers on the on 22 January, {{not long after}} the French vessels had been beaten off during an attack on the British trading post at Bencoolen. On 24 January an action against a larger French squadron was fought in the Strait itself, but ended inconclusively and the squadrons divided, the British receiving the Dutch frigate <b>Amazone</b> as reinforcements. The French subsequently turned southwards out of the Strait and attacked Bencoolen again on 9 February, capturing an East Indiaman in the harbour before returning to Île de France with their prize.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{surviving}} {{ships were}} withdrawn from front-line service in 1916 and disarmed, {{with the exception}} of Medusa, which retained six of her guns, and Thetis, which was rearmed with nine 10.5cm U-boat guns for use as a gunnery training ship. The remaining seven cruisers survived the war and went on to serve in the new Reichsmarine, except for Gazelle, which was broken up for scrap in 1920. The ships remained in service throughout the 1920s, but were all withdrawn by the early 1930s. Niobe was sold to Yugoslavia in 1925 and renamed Dalmacija, while Nymphe and Thetis were scrapped in the early 1930s. Arcona, Medusa, and <b>Amazone</b> were used as barracks hulks {{for the rest of the}} 1930s.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November <b>Amazone</b> and Elisa sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore {{in an attempt to}} cut off the French line of advance. With the wind in the northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.|$|E

5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1810 the Napoleonic Wars had lasted for seven years and the French Navy, {{over the course of}} the conflict, had been {{successively}} driven from the Atlantic until every French port was watched by a Royal Navy close blockade, ready to attack any French ship which emerged from harbour. In 1809, the main French fleet at Brest had attempted to break out into open water, only to be driven back and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads. Much of the French effort at sea subsequently fell on commerce raiders, including privateers and frigate squadrons, often operating from smaller harbours such as those on the Northern coast of France in the English Channel. The two principal raiding ports were Cherbourg and Le Havre in Normandy, each of which maintained squadrons. In 1810, Cherbourg's anchorage held two ships of the line and a large, newly built frigate Iphigénie, while the frigates Elisa and <b>Amazone</b> were stationed at Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|By 1810 the French Navy fleet {{based in}} the Atlantic ports had been {{prevented}} from launching any major operations for four years, penned into harbour by the British strategy of close blockade. A failed attempt by a French fleet to sail had been defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809, and the main operations still {{carried out by the}} Navy were undertaken by privateers and frigate squadrons operating commerce raiders operating from smaller ports, such as those on the English Channel. In November 1810 squadrons were based at Cherbourg, with two ships of the line and the newly built frigate Iphigénie, and Le Havre, with the frigates Elisa and <b>Amazone,</b> commanded by Captains Louis-Henri Fraycinet-Saulce and Bernard-Louis Rosseau respectively. To blockade these squadrons, the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet had assigned the ships of the line HMS Donegal under Captain Pulteney Malcolm and HMS Revenge under Captain Charles Paget to patrol the entrance to Cherbourg, while frigates HMS Diana under Captain Charles Grant and HMS Niobe under Captain John Wentworth Loring kept watch on Le Havre. The blockade had achieved some minor successes; in October 1810 Revenge had captured the privateer Vengeur from Dieppe, and on 6 November Donegal ran down and seized the privateer Surcouf from Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|The French ships took shelter at {{the heavily}} {{fortified}} Iles Saint-Marcouf, sailing {{the following morning}} for the anchorage at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. For two days the British frigates kept watch, until two ships of the line from the blockade of Cherbourg, HMS Donegal and HMS Revenge, arrived. On 15 November, the British squadron attacked the anchored French ships, which were defended by shore batteries at La Hougue and Tatihou. After four attempts to close with the French the British squadron, under heavy fire, withdrew. During the night, the British commander, Captain Pulteney Malcolm, sent his ship's boats close inshore to attack the French ships with Congreve rockets, a newly issued weapon. None are recorded as landing on target, but by morning both frigates {{had been forced to}} change position, becoming grounded on the shore. The French ships were later refloated, and Malcolm's squadron maintained the blockade until 27 November when <b>Amazone</b> successfully escaped back to Le Havre. The damaged Elisa remained at anchor until 6 December, when an attack by a British bomb vessel forced the frigate to move further inshore, becoming grounded once more. Elisa remained in this position until 23 December, when the boats of Diana entered the anchorage at night and set the beached ship on fire, destroying her.|$|E
