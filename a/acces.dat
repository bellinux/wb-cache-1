In 2009, she was discovered by Romanian producers and songwriters Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi at a karaoke bar. They offered her a record deal with their own label, Maan Records, through which she also released a promotional single called [...] "Show Me The Way". During one of Stan's televised performances on Romanian TV show <b>Acces</b> Direct, she explained that [...] "Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)" [...] was produced [...] "just for fun" [...] after she arrived from a club one night. When interviewed by Urban.ro at her release party of Saxobeats, Stan confessed that she expected positive and negative reception for the song, also saying that it emphasized more her image than her vocal abilities.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1940 anti-Semitic laws started to come into force in both the {{occupied}} and unoccupied zones. On 3 October 1940 Vichy introduced the statut des Juifs, requiring all Jews in France to register with the authorities and banned Jews from professions such as the law, the universities, medicine and the public service. Jewish businesses were [...] "Aryanized" [...] by being placed in the hands of [...] "Aryan" [...] trustees who engaged in the most blatant corruption while Jews were banned from cinemas, music halls, fairs, museums, libraries, public parks, cafes, theatres, concerts, restaurants, swimming pools and markets. Jews could not move unless informing the police first, own radios or bicycles, were denied phone service, could only use phone booths marked <b>Accès</b> interdit aux Juifs and were only allowed to ride the last carriage on the Paris Metro. The French people at the time distinguished between the Israélites (a polite term in French) who were [...] "properly" [...] assimilated French Jews and the Juifs (a derogatory term in French) who were the [...] "foreign" [...] and [...] "unassimilated" [...] Jews who were widely seen as criminals from abroad living in slums in the inner cities of France. All through the 1930s, the number of illegal Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe was vastly exaggerated, and popular opinion believed that the majority of Jews living in France were illegal immigrants who were causing all sorts of social problems. In a context where the number of Jews in France, and even more so the number of illegal Jewish immigrants were much exaggerated, Ousby noted about the introduction of the first anti-Semitic laws in 1940: [...] "There was no sigh of public opposition to what was happening, or even widespread unease at the direction in which events were heading [...] [...] [...] Many people, perhaps even most people, were indifferent. In the autumn of 1940 they had other things to think about; later they could find little room for fellow-feeling or concern for the public good in their own struggle to survive. What happened to the Jews were a secondary matter; it was beyond their immediate affairs, it belonged to that realm of the 'political' which they could not longer control or even bring themselves to follow with much interest".|$|E

6000|$|But {{besides the}} delights of domesticity which the Japanese enjoys daily in Nature's company, {{he has his}} <b>acces</b> de tendresse, too. When he feels thus {{specially}} stirred, he invites a chosen few of his friends, equally infatuated, and together they repair to some spot noted for its scenery. It may be a waterfall, or some dreamy pond overhung by trees, or the distant glimpse of a mountain peak framed in picture-wise between the nearer hills; or, at their appropriate seasons, the blossoming of the many tree flowers, which in eastern Asia are beautiful beyond description. For he appreciates not only places, but times. One spot is to be seen at sunrise, another by moonlight; one to be visited in the spring-time, another in the fall. But wherever or whenever it be, a tea-house, placed to command the best view of the sight, stands ready to receive him. For nature's beauties are too well recognized to remain the exclusive property of the first chance lover. People flock to view nature as we do to see a play, and privacy is as impossible as it is unsought. Indeed, the aversion to publicity is simply {{a result of the}} sense of self, and therefore necessarily not a feature of so impersonal a civilization. Aesthetic guidebooks are written for the nature-enamoured, descriptive of these views which the Japanese translator quaintly calls [...] "Sceneries," [...] and which visitors come not only from near but from far to gaze upon. In front of the tea-house proper are rows of summer pavilions, in one of which the party make themselves at home, while gentle little tea-house girls toddle forth to serve them the invariable preliminary tea and confections. Each man then produces from up his sleeve, or from out his girdle, paper, ink, and brush, and proceeds to compose a poem on the beauty of the spot and the feelings it calls up, which he subsequently reads to his admiring companions. Hot sake is next served, which is to them what beer is to a German or absinthe to a blouse; and there they sit, sip, and poetize, passing their couplets, as they do their cups, in honor to one another. At last, after drinking in an hour or two of scenery and sake combined, the symposium of poets breaks up.|$|E
5000|$|<b>ACCES</b> (African Canadian Continuing Education Society) is a Canadian {{non-profit}} {{that provides}} a suite of programs to foster social and economic improvements among {{the poorest of the}} poor, both in rural areas and the slums of Kibera in Nairobi. The flagship program of <b>ACCES</b> is providing post-secondary scholarships to bright and needy students from poor families. More than 2,000 students have graduated with an <b>ACCES</b> scholarship since 1993, and many are now {{at the top of their}} professions. The alumni have started an association (<b>ACCES</b> Alumni Association - AAA) which now sponsors secondary students through donations from its members. As of 2013, more than two million shillings has been raised and an endowment fund started with more than one million shillings to continue helping poor students to access higher education. <b>ACCES</b> also partners with the Ministry of Education to enhance primary schools in poor rural areas, including teacher training, learning and teaching materials, construction of classrooms and subsidies for poor families who cannot afford to access education for their children. <b>ACCES</b> also provides community development activities through its network of partnerships, such as the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Ministry of Agriculture, Kenya Environmental Research Program and many others. Using an integrated approach, <b>ACCES</b> brings income generation, agri-busimness, health, hygiene, clean water, gender equity, child rights, and governance to help communities become self-sufficient and sustainable. <b>ACCES</b> has as its chief operating principle the idea of “Kenyanization” whereby all of its programs are initiated, designed and implemented by a staff of Kenyans, working with local partners, government and institutions. Not only is the aim of <b>ACCES</b> to have Kenyans helping each other, but to have as the final outcome, self-sufficient, sustainable and independent communities. <b>ACCES</b> impacts more than 20,000 people annually.|$|E

These new definitions reflect the types of adversaries that a protocol might be designed to resist.

40|$|Real-world {{cryptographic}} protocols such as {{the widely}} used Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol support many different combinations of cryptographic algorithms (called ciphersuites) and simultaneously support different versions.

In this paper we extend the <b>ACCE</b> model to cover protocols with many different sub-protocols, capturing both multiple ciphersuites and multiple versions, and define a security notion for secure negotiation of the optimal sub-protocol. We give a generic theorem that shows how secure negotiation follows, with some additional conditions, from the authentication property of secure <b>ACCE</b> protocols.
