40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{considerable}} interest in {{the integration of the}} corporate and personal income taxes. Full integration, under which corporate-source income would be taxed only to shareholders, has significant economic advantages, but it suffers from severe practical difficulties. Some but not all of its advantages could be realized through dividend relief. Alternative means of providing dividend relief include a deduction for dividends paid, application of a lower corporate rate to distributed income than to retained earnings, and allowing shareholders a dividend-received credit for corporate taxes imputed to have been paid on their behalf. The proper treatment of tax preferences and international flows of corporate-source income raise important issues of tax administration and public policy. It is necessary, for example, to decide whether tax preferences are to be passed through to shareholders or nullified when preference income is distributed. Beyond that, "stacking rules" are required for the presumptive <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> between preference and taxable income. Further research on both economic effects and administrative feasibility is necessary for an adequate appraisal of integration. ...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the wide}} field of {{creative}} accounting, the main preoccupation of researchers surrounded earnings management. The current study comes {{to acknowledge that}} creative cash flow may distort the assessment of financial performance and should therefore, become a subject of the same interest for analysts and investors, as earnings management is. In order to reach the objective proposed, there are two hypotheses formulated, to be validated within the research: H 1 : Creative accounting distorts cash flow reporting {{within the boundaries of}} current regulations. H 2 : Real activity manipulation alters significantly the operating cash flow. The steps followed were analyzing the accounting standard related to cash flow statement, IAS 7, in order to uncover issues not taken into account, or options of allocation provided for accountants, which could lead to opportunistic choices and lack of comparability. The relevant literature was reviewed, so as to identify the opinions of accounting and finance specialists related to this subject, the results of their scientific process. The final step was a synthesis of relevant results and observations, which lead to the acceptance of the hypothesis of the research. Moreover, several techniques were identified, both related to creative accounting and to real activity manipulation, influencing mainly the figure reflecting operating cash flow, and thus the image on the potential of business continuity. Main conclusions were that the techniques applied were within the limits set by the standard: opportunistic <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> and interest collected or paid misallocation of certain activities like sale of receivables, but mainly recording non-recurring events into the operating cash flow, without separate notes of information or adjustments. Real activity manipulation should also be considered as it is even more difficult to detect, unless analysis is also performed on notes to financial reports and the figures within the profit and loss account. The contribution of the current study is providing a synthetic arrgumentation to why cash flow should be analysed in the context of creative accounting, reviewing methods and techniques that distort significantly the results of operating activity, providing basis for further study related to the impact of such practices on forecasts of cash flow and predictability of bankruptcy. operating cash flow, creative accounting, non-recurring activity, IAS 7, financial performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper tests several {{competing}} {{hypotheses about}} the economic effects <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> taxation.

We compare three different views <b>of</b> how <b>dividend</b> taxes affect decisions by firms and their shareholders. We reject the"tax capitalization" view that dividend taxes are non-distortionary lump sum taxes on the owners of corporate capital. We also reject the hypothes is that firms pay dividends because marginal investors are effectively untaxed.

25|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{financial}} management is to maximize or to continually increase shareholder value. Maximizing shareholder value requires managers {{to be able to}} balance capital funding between investments in projects that increase the firm's long term profitability and sustainability, along with paying excess cash in the form <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> to shareholders. Managers of growth companies (i.e. firms that earn high rates of return on invested capital) will use most of the firm's capital resources and surplus cash on investments and projects so the company can continue to expand its business operations into the future. When companies reach maturity levels within their industry (i.e. companies that earn approximately average or lower returns on invested capital), managers of these companies will use surplus cash to payout dividends to shareholders.

40|$|The {{literature}} survey on dividends shows that more explanation is needed though existing theories contribute considerably {{to the understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> including the rationale <b>of</b> paying <b>dividends,</b> smoothing <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> and greater frequency <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments compared to stock repurchases. The purpose of this thesis is to explain the dividend phenomena using a reputation model {{in the world of}} imperfect information. In a two-period version of the model, the rationale <b>of</b> paying <b>dividends</b> and smoothing is analyzed. However, the reputation effect and the time pattern <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> cannot be easily accommodated. We extend the model into a three-period model in which the behavior <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> through time, and the market response on the change in dividends are analyzed. The reputation effect is incorporated such that the reliability of signalling improves with the passage of time. ^ New empirical results which support the reputation model are presented. The market response to the initial dividend announcement is analyzed using all the cases <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> initiation recorded on the CRSP daily stock files from July 2, 1962, to December 31, 1987. For firms which announce dividends during their first year on a major exchange, the abnormal return on the announcement date <b>of</b> initial <b>dividends</b> is not significant. Also, the change in the magnitude of the market response to the change in dividends through time is analyzed. We group the announcements <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> increases according to the number of years passed after the initiation <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The market 2 ̆ 7 s response to unexpected dividend increases in earlier periods is smaller than the case <b>of</b> unexpected <b>dividend</b> increases in later periods. ^ The reputation model adds a new perspective to the analysis of dividends: the time aspect <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> that is, the effect of a consistent stream <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments on the value of a firm. This model has direct applicability to all areas <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> to better explain the dividend phenomena. ...|$|R

40|$|More {{recently}} {{researchers have}} turned to analyze how the tax structure, rather than the overall tax level, affects economic performance. For instance, several papers have investigated how taxation on corporate and individual (labor) income influences growth.

This paper adds to existing evidence by examining the role <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in a market where the corporate ownership structure is notably different from the U. S. and the U.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a {{generalized}} friction model {{to test the}} information effect <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The proposed model resolves the problem <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> stickiness in the time-series data and provides a more reliable estimate for the relation between unexpected changes in dividends and earnings. Unlike previous studies, we specifically consider the dynamic partial adjustment <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in estimating the expected dividend component. Our results contain several important findings. First, the results support the contention that dividend changes reflect both expected and unexpected permanent earnings changes. Since Miller and Modigliani (1961) proposed the information hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> financial {{researchers have sought to}} answer questions concerning whether dividends convey information and, if they do, what types of information are contained in dividends. The results in this study show that dividends are strongly related to a firm 2 ̆ 7 s permanent earnings estimates. Our results also show that dividend changes signal changes in management 2 ̆ 7 s views of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s future earnings prospects. The abnormal (unexpected) dividend, which is the difference between the current dividend and the conditional expectation <b>of</b> the current <b>dividend,</b> has on average a significant positive relation with the unexpected changes in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s permanent earnings. Second, there is evidence that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signaling depends on firm-specific characteristics. Consistent with the existing dividend signaling theory, the strength <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signaling is negatively related to the firm 2 ̆ 7 s systematic risk, external equity financing, and size and positively related to net investments and the degree <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> smoothing. Third, our results suggest that the generalized friction model is a more suitable framework for examining the information content <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> Watts (1973) took an approach similar to this study to examine the information effect <b>of</b> <b>dividends...</b>|$|R

The major objective of this dissertation is to identify the determinants <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy in UK market. All for the period of 1988 - 1997 are considered as the sample of this study. Ordinary Fixed-effect model models are employed to identify the determinants <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy in the target market. The results indicate that ROA, turnover, firm size and long term liability in the whole debt are positively related to dividend payout; while current liability as while as the whole debt are negatively related to dividend payout. However, growth rate does not show significance with dividend payout as previous literature. All of these coefficients are in the predicted direction and quite consistent with previous empirical evidence except growth rate. These results support transaction cost on dividend policy, but do not deny clientele effect <b>of</b> <b>dividend,</b> the influence <b>of</b> both agency cost and residual theory <b>of</b> <b>dividend.</b> Finally, the results suggest that ROA, turnover, leverage and firm size are the major determinants <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy in UK market. This study may help in understanding the inherent characteristics and the determinants <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method {{to measure the}} unexpected component <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> announcements. While measures used previously were based on various arbitrary models <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> expectations, the authors' suggested method compares the reaction of stock and option prices to dividend announcements. Their measure is compared to commonly used model-based measures, to a Box-Jenkins time-series-based measure, and to a Value-Line Investor Survey-based measure <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> surprises. The new measure is more highly correlated with the market's reaction to the announcements than are alternative measures <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> surprises. The new measure is also shown to be insensitive {{to the extent to}} which the options used to identify unexpected dividend announcements are in- or out-of-the-money.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the determinants <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy in GCC market based on sample firms in UAE market. An {{analysis was conducted}} to understand the dividend trends among different industry sectors in UAE market. The analysis of approximately 120 listed companies reveal that 80 per cent of the companies paid cash dividends during the three year period 2011 - 2013. The paper also {{examines the}} various theoretical attributes used in financial literature to understand the determinants <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy. The partial least squares structural equations modeling (PLS-SEM) {{was used to test}} the alternate explanations <b>of</b> corporate <b>dividend</b> payout policy in the gulf market. The study finds support for residual theory and pecking order argument <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> Investment policy influences dividend policy. The results support the theory that firms with high growth rate in income requires higher capital expenditure and establish lower dividend payout on account of costly external financing. Liquidity is an important determinant <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> decision. Stability <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments is not a critical factor considered by financial markets in the region...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} cooperative environments with externalities (games in partition function form) {{and provide}} a recursive definition <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> for each coalition and any partition of the players it belongs to. We show that with this definition and equal sharing <b>of</b> these <b>dividends</b> the averaged sum <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> for each player, over all the coalitions that contain the player, coincides with the corresponding average value of the player. We then construct weighted Shapley values by departing from equal division <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> and finally, for each such value, provide a bidding mechanism implementing it. Shapley value, dividends,  games with externalities, implementation...|$|R
40|$|This study revisits prior {{research}} on the valuation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in an accounting-based valuation framework. Using a battery of tests, we show that market value deflation is essential in market-based tests <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> displacement and signalling because it controls for ‘stale’ information in addition to scale (size) differences across firms. For US firms, we show that after controlling for ‘stale’ information, the empirical association between dividends and market values switches from positive to negative. This switch is not explained by scale differences across firms. Further, we show that after controlling for staleness, the valuation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> remains positive for European firms. This result is explained by the relatively stronger association <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> with future earnings in these settings (i. e. signalling). Lastly, our country-specific estimates <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> valuation provide a potentially valuable index for studies aimed at examining the effects of accounting and securities regulation on information asymmetries in an international context...|$|R
