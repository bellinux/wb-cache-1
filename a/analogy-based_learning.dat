40|$|We {{propose a}} {{practical}} defect prediction approach {{for companies that}} do not track defect related data. Specifically, we investigate the applicability of cross-company (CC) data for building localized defect predictors using static code features. Firstly, we analyze the conditions, where CC data {{can be used as}} is. These conditions turn out to be quite few. Then we apply principles of <b>analogy-based</b> <b>learning</b> (i. e. nearest neighbor (NN) filtering) to CC data, in order to fine tune these models for localization. We compare the performance of these models with that of defect predictors learned from within-company (WC) data. As expected, we observe that defect predictors learned from WC data outperform the ones learned from CC data. However, our analyses also yield defect predictors learned from NN-filtered CC data, with performance close to, but still not better than, WC data. Therefore, we perform a final analysis for determining the minimum number of local defect reports in order to learn WC defect predictors. We demonstrate in this paper that the minimum number of data samples required to build effective defect predictors can be quite small and can be collected quickly within a few months. Hence, for companies with no local defect data, we recommend a two-phase approac...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: POP-I. B. {{barriers}} to programming, POPIV. B. teaching design This paper discusses {{some of the}} fundamental problems encountered by students on first year computer programming courses at Irish Institutes of Technology. It’s content {{is based on the}} author’s practical experience in the classroom and programming laboratories which will be supported in the near future by empirical data gathering. The reasons for many difficulties experienced by students are discussed. The objective of the proposed research is to use the <b>analogy-based</b> approach to <b>learning.</b> A structure called an analogy tree will be built and implemented in a learning tool which will use animation to simulate the relevant analogies. Finally, the future work required, and, potential problems for this project will be discussed. Problems Encountered When embarking on the delivery of a first year programming course, lecturers are faced with a number of problems. Firstly, programming students are a product of the primary and secondary educational systems that do not have a logic/problem-solving module in any of their subjects. This puts Irish students at a disadvantage compared to many of their counterparts in other countries wher...|$|R
