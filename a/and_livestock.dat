40|$|Based on {{historical}} data, wolf {{is one of}} the large carnivores which suffers from human-wildlife conflicts especially in the animal husbandry field. In this research we tried to model wolf attacks to the humans <b>and</b> <b>livestocks</b> in Ardabil Province, and give some relevant recommendations. Focusing on the wolf attacks data (both human <b>and</b> <b>livestocks),</b> recorded during 10 years (2004 – 2014), we carried out risk zoning by MaxEnt modelling approach. The results indicated that both models had an excellent performance for predicting the pattern of wolf attacks on human (AUC = 0. 91) <b>and</b> <b>livestocks</b> (AUC = 0. 89). Also, I found that 28 and 12 percent of the province face with the highest probability of wolf attacks on human <b>and</b> <b>livestocks,</b> respectively. MaxEnt model showed that variables including distance to irrigated farms, distance to human settlements and human density are the most important factors affecting the incidence of human-wolf conflicts in the study area. The results indicated that the areas of attack to the human are completely overlapped by areas where attacks to the livestock were recorded. The risk maps obtained in this study can be considered as a useful tool in the management of the human-wolf conflicts in the study area...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the rapid}} rate of human {{expansion}} throughout the range of this species, bites are relatively common. Domestic animals <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> are frequent victims.

At least eight different antivenoms are available against bites from this species.|$|E

The decrease in production were attributed to the following factors: high cost of feeds, feed supplements <b>and</b> biologics; <b>livestock</b> <b>and</b> poultry diseases; increasing price of chicks; and, high cost of labor.|$|R

To {{the north in}} New England, many churches endured {{significant}} damage, and shipwrecks led to 15deaths, with one other death owing to a building collapse. Due to intense gusts, hundreds of trees were uprooted and many buildings were unroofed. Agriculture, shipping, timber, <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> industries also suffered substantial impairment, with considerable injury experienced by barns, crops, watercraft, timber, <b>and</b> <b>livestock.</b> Farther north, entire swaths of forest were leveled, and heavy snow blocked roads, paths, and turnpikes. Fruit orchards and sugar groves endured {{the worst of the}} storm, reducing the season's harvests. Private properties generally suffered damage to roofs, windows, and chimneys; several buildings throughout the region were reported to have collapsed.

Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures.
