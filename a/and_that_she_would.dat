5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has {{committed}} itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution {{in a number of}} German Länder. Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 2011, presidential {{spokesman}} Alfredo Scoccimaro {{announced that}} Kirchner {{had been diagnosed}} with thyroid cancer on 22 December <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist can take a sample, analyze it looking for carcinogenic cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from under a membrane covering her brain.|$|E

5|$|The king of gods, Indra, was {{infatuated}} with her beauty and comes disguised as Gautama, when the sage was away and requests or orders sexual intercourse. In the Ramayana (the earliest full {{narrative of the}} tale), Ahalya falls prey to Indra's trickery and does not recognize him or is raped. In all narratives, Ahalya and (her lover or rapist) Indra are cursed by Gautama. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible {{to the world and}} how she is purified by offering Rama (an avatar of god Vishnu and hero of Ramayana) hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama's foot. Some versions also mention that she was turned into a dry stream <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be condoned of her guilt when eventually the stream starts flowing and joins the river Gautami(Godavari). Indra was cursed to be castrated or be covered by a thousand vulvae that ultimately turn into a thousand eyes.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E
