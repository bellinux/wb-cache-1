We analyzed 200 pornographic images randomly selected from 4 websites (2 <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> women and 2 <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> men). The criteria for comparison were based on concepts of sexual inequality and sexual objectification that have been commonly used in the literature on analyses of pornography content. The findings showed that websites containing pornography <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> men were more likely than the websites <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> women to include content with elements of sexual inequality, whereas websites <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> women were more likely than the websites <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> men to include content with elements of sexual objectification." ...|$|R
