Tilly, a lesbian, hopes {{that one of}} the gang leaders, Pussy Galore (leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her, but she is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the mafia bosses all escape in the melee. Bond is drugged before his flight back to England and wakes to find he has been {{captured}} by Goldfinger, who has managed to hijack a BOAC jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership.|$|E

25|$|Though some {{of their}} amplitudes have {{opposite}} phases, both quarks and anti-quarks have positive energy, and hence acquire the same phase as they move in space-time. This phase also depends on their mass, which is identical but depends both on flavor and on the Higgs VEV which changes along the domain wall. Thus certain sums of amplitudes for quarks have different absolute values compared to those of anti-quarks. In all, quarks and anti-quarks may have different reflection and transmission probabilities through the domain wall, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> more quarks coming from the unbroken phase are transmitted compared to anti-quarks.|$|E

500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / {{you make}} me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, if only for a moment, that Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E

Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her."

To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst.

2500|$|An ant-based {{computer}} simulation using only six interaction rules {{has also been}} used to evaluate aircraft boarding behaviour. Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by Douglas A. Lawson uses swarm theory, or swarm intelligence—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. [...] "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> that's the best solution for the airline," [...] Lawson explains.

Thomas now revives briefly, and before passing out again, makes a delirious comment that implies that he is of noble birth. Carboy unfastens his patient's jacket, and the crowd are shocked to find that Thomas is a Knight of the Garter. Thomas revives, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> he is the Duke of Islington (a joke reference, since Islington was then a working-class Cockney neighbourhood).

He then creates a costume out of rotten fish like Aquaman, but it does not go so well due to the awful smell from the costume.

2500|$|Were {{the issue}} treated {{as one of}} {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, the simple equitable principle to be applied {{would be that the}} contract is voidable unless third party rights have intervened. The defrauded party (Alice, in the example) has a right to rescind the contract, until the point where Claire's rights had intervened. Claire could be considered a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any pre-existing interest, and should take full title to the property. This was essentially the approach advocated in Lewis v Averay. However, it is not the stance English law is currently taking. In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson the House of Lords by three to two decided to uphold an older line of authority which declares a contract void from the start. If there was never any contract between the seller and the fraudster, the fraudster cannot sell any property right to the third party, because they never had a good property right in the first place. This follows the Latin maxim, nemo dat quod non habet, that one cannot give what one does not have. So the present law is that if a person deals with another by distance (and not face to face, in which case there is deemed to be no [...] "mistake" [...] about identity), that person's presumed identity is recorded in a document, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> that person is in fact an uncreditworthy [...] "rogue" [...] then the third party cannot acquire good title and the good must be returned to the original person who is defrauded. The minority of the House of Lords (Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett) preferred to follow Lewis v Averay, which is in line with the law across Europe, in the United States and {{most of the rest of}} the world.|$|E
