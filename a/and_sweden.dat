5|$|With the {{declaration}} of war against Sweden on 2 September 1675, Denmark saw a chance to regain its recently lost eastern provinces.

As war broke out between Denmark <b>and</b> <b>Sweden</b> a strong naval presence also became essential for Sweden to secure its interests at home and overseas.|$|E
