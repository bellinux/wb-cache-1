5|$|The <b>albatrosses</b> {{comprise}} between 13 and 24 species (the {{number of}} species is still {{a matter of some}} debate, 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in four genera. These genera are the great <b>albatrosses</b> (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> (Phoebastria), and the sooty <b>albatrosses</b> or sooties (Phoebetria). The North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> are considered to be a sister taxon to the great <b>albatrosses,</b> while the sooty <b>albatrosses</b> are considered closer to the mollymawks.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History (1996) {{and other researchers}} around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species, finding four, not two, monophyletic groups within the <b>albatrosses.</b> They proposed the resurrection {{of two of the}} old genus names, Phoebastria for the North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> and Thalassarche for the mollymawks, with the great <b>albatrosses</b> retaining Diomedea and the sooty <b>albatrosses</b> staying in Phoebetria. Both the British Ornithologists' Union and the South African authorities split the <b>albatrosses</b> into four genera as Nunn suggested, and the change has been accepted by the majority of researchers.|$|E

50|$|The light-mantled <b>albatross</b> (Phoebetria palpebrata) {{also known}} as the grey-mantled <b>albatross</b> or the light-mantled sooty <b>albatross,</b> is a small <b>albatross</b> in the genus Phoebetria, which it shares with the sooty <b>albatross.</b> The light-mantled <b>albatross</b> was first {{described}} as Phoebetria palpebrata by Johann Reinhold Forster, in 1785, based on a specimen from south of the Cape of Good Hope.|$|R
50|$|The Amsterdam <b>albatross</b> or Amsterdam Island <b>albatross,</b> Diomedea amsterdamensis, {{is a huge}} <b>albatross</b> which breeds only on Amsterdam Island in the {{southern}} Indian Ocean. It was only described in 1983, and was thought by some researchers to be a sub-species of the wandering <b>albatross,</b> D. exulans. BirdLife International and the IOC recognize it as a species, James Clements does not, and the SACC has a proposal {{on the table to}} split the species. More recently, mitchondrial DNA comparisons between the Amsterdam <b>albatross,</b> the wandering <b>albatross</b> Diomedea exulans, the Antipodean <b>albatross</b> D. antipodensis and the Tristan <b>albatross</b> D. dabbenena, provide clear genetic evidence that the Amsterdam <b>albatross</b> is a separate species.|$|R
5|$|<b>Albatrosses</b> {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: <b>albatrosses</b> in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. <b>Albatrosses</b> are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that <b>albatrosses</b> must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Another {{threat to}} <b>albatrosses</b> is {{introduced}} species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack <b>albatrosses</b> or their chicks and eggs. <b>Albatrosses</b> {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan <b>albatrosses</b> are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>albatrosses</b> {{are among}} the largest of flying birds, and the great <b>albatrosses</b> from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} royal <b>albatross</b> (Diomedea epomophora) {{is a large}} seabird {{from the}} <b>albatross</b> family. At an average wingspan of above 3 m, {{it is one of}} the two largest species of <b>albatross,</b> together with the wandering <b>albatross.</b> Recent studies indicate that the southern royal <b>albatross</b> may, on average, be somewhat larger than the wandering <b>albatross</b> in mass and wingspan, although other sources indicate roughly similar size for the two species.|$|R
50|$|The sooty <b>albatross,</b> dark-mantled sooty <b>albatross</b> or dark-mantled <b>albatross,</b> (Phoebetria fusca), is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>albatross</b> family. They breed on sub-Antarctic islands and range at sea across the Southern Ocean from South America to Australia.|$|R
50|$|It is {{practically}} {{indistinguishable from the}} wandering <b>albatross</b> at sea; the Tristan <b>albatross</b> is smaller and has a slightly darker back. The Tristan <b>albatross</b> is 110 cm and has a wingspan of up to 3.05 m. The Tristan <b>albatross</b> also never attains the full white plumage of the wandering <b>albatross,</b> and its bill is about 25 mm shorter.|$|R

50|$|The {{islands are}} an {{important}} nesting site {{for a number of}} southern seabirds, including the black-browed <b>albatross,</b> shy <b>albatross,</b> grey-headed <b>albatross,</b> rockhopper penguin and southern giant-petrel.|$|R
50|$|Salvin's <b>albatross,</b> or Salvin's mollymawk, Thalassarche salvini, {{is a large}} seabird that breeds only in {{islands in}} New Zealand's realm. A {{medium-sized}} mollymawk in the <b>albatross</b> family, it was long {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the shy <b>albatross.</b> It is a medium-sized black and white <b>albatross.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} royal <b>albatross</b> or toroa, Diomedea sanfordi, {{is a large}} seabird {{from the}} <b>albatross</b> family. It was split from the closely related southern royal <b>albatross</b> as recently as 1998, though not all scientists support that conclusion and consider both {{of them to be}} subspecies of the royal <b>albatross.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding <b>albatrosses,</b> {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 <b>albatrosses</b> are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed <b>albatrosses</b> are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E
5|$|The adult plumage {{of most of}} the <b>albatrosses</b> {{is usually}} some {{variation}} of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. The extent of colouration varies: the southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges of the wings in fully mature males, while the Amsterdam albatross has an almost juvenile-like breeding plumage {{with a great deal of}} brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest. Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape. Three albatross species, the black-footed albatross and the two sooty <b>albatrosses,</b> vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown (or dark grey in places in the case of the light-mantled albatross). <b>Albatrosses</b> take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the <b>albatrosses</b> in the Northern Hemisphere is more {{complete}} {{than that of the}} southern, and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North Atlantic, which today has no <b>albatrosses.</b> The remains of a colony of short-tailed <b>albatrosses</b> have been uncovered on the island of Bermuda, and the majority of fossil <b>albatrosses</b> from the North Atlantic have been of the genus Phoebastria (the North Pacific albatrosses); one, Phoebastria anglica, has been found in deposits in both North Carolina and England. Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may be such a case, and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early Pleistocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa, Japan, actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds. For more data on fossil species of the living albatross genera, see the genus articles.|$|E
50|$|The Laysan <b>albatross</b> {{is usually}} easy to identify. In the North Pacific, it is simple to {{separate}} from the other relatively common <b>albatross,</b> the all black black-footed <b>albatross.</b> It can be distinguished from the very rare short-tailed <b>albatross</b> by its all-dark back and smaller size. The Laysan <b>albatross's</b> plumage {{has been compared to}} that of a gull, two-toned with a dark gray mantle and wings and a white underside and head.|$|R

5|$|Most <b>albatrosses</b> {{range in}} the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The {{exceptions}} to this are the four North Pacific <b>albatrosses,</b> of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the waved albatross, breeds in the Galápagos Islands and feeds {{off the coast of}} South America. The need for wind to enable gliding is the reason <b>albatrosses</b> are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the waved albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around the Galápagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} step towards protecting <b>albatrosses</b> and other seabirds is the 2001 treaty, the Agreement on the Conservation of <b>Albatrosses</b> and Petrels, which came into force in 2004 {{and has been}} ratified by thirteen countries, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, France, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce bycatch, pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.|$|E
5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{molecular}} {{study of}} the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period (35–30 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the <b>albatrosses</b> next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil <b>albatrosses</b> were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when the split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show that the split between the great <b>albatrosses</b> and the North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> occurred by 15 mya. Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks at 10 mya.|$|E

50|$|The Salvin's <b>albatross,</b> white-capped <b>albatross,</b> shy <b>albatross</b> and Chatham <b>albatross</b> {{were all}} {{considered}} {{the same species}} until a 1998 article by Robertson and Nunn. Other experts followed suit, with BirdLife International in 2000, Brooke in 2004, ACAP in 2006, and SACC in 2008. Some, however, like James Clements (at {{the time of his}} death) didn't agree, nor has Cornell University since (which is responsible for his book). Molecular analysis has shown that it and the closely related Chatham <b>albatross</b> (also considered to be a subspecies of the shy <b>albatross)</b> are sister taxa, and more distantly related to the shy.|$|R

5|$|This {{efficient}} long-distance travelling {{underlies the}} albatross's {{success as a}} long-distance forager, covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources. Their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves, however, as their long wings are ill-suited to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight. <b>Albatrosses</b> in calm seas are forced {{to rest on the}} ocean's surface until the wind picks up again. The North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> can use a flight style known as flap-gliding, where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding. When taking off, <b>albatrosses</b> need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide lift.|$|E
5|$|<b>Albatrosses</b> {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are {{taken out of}} many coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. <b>Albatrosses</b> are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the greater}} {{investment}} in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for the young, and pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate for life. <b>Albatrosses</b> and procellariids, which mate for life, take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the <b>albatrosses</b> have an elaborate breeding dance {{that is part of}} pair-bond formation.|$|E

50|$|The {{entirety}} {{of the final}} scene is described from the crowd's point of view. The <b>Albatross</b> begins circling the Go-ahead; the Go-ahead drops ballast and rises to fourteen thousand feet. The <b>Albatross</b> follows, still a circling menace. The Go-ahead is {{at the mercy of}} the <b>Albatross</b> because the <b>Albatross</b> is both faster and more maneuverable. Finally, the Go-ahead exceeds her pressure height, where her gas bags rupture. Losing her buoyancy gas, the Go-ahead drops out of the sky like a rapidly descending kite. The <b>Albatross</b> stays alongside of the Go-ahead as she falls, signalling the pilot and passengers of the Go-ahead to come on board the <b>Albatross.</b> They refuse, but then the crew of the <b>Albatross</b> again seizes them and brings them aboard.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{large numbers of}} {{breeding}} penguins and other seabirds, including {{almost half of the}} world's species of <b>albatross,</b> especially the world's only breeding colonies of the Antipodean <b>albatross</b> (Diomedea exulans antipodensis), southern royal <b>albatross</b> (Diomedea epomophora epomophora), Campbell <b>albatross</b> (Thalassarche impavida), white-capped <b>albatross</b> (Thalassarche steadi), and Salvin's <b>albatross</b> (Thalassarche salvini). The large colonies of Salvin's <b>albatross</b> on the Bounty Islands build nests of feathers as there is no vegetation to use. There are also isolated populations of land birds that have presumably settled here, having been blown off course by ocean winds. Many of these have since evolved into unique species, including two endemic parakeets on Antipodes Island; the Antipodes parakeet (Cyanoramphus unicolor) and Reischek's parakeet (Cyanoramphus hochstetteri).|$|R
