5|$|During her directorship, Cosima opposed {{theatrical}} innovations and adhered {{closely to}} Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed {{her death in}} 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.|$|E
5|$|Plasma {{temperature}} is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is, informally, {{a measure of}} the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the Saha equation. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{religions}} in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents {{to renounce}} all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant {{they were unable}} to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which {{is not unusual for}} Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{traditional}} Khitan {{social and political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> the dynasty. This tension led {{to a series of}} succession crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, while {{much of the rest of}} the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E

40|$|Underlying {{mechanisms}} {{leading to}} pituitary plasticity {{by which the}} gland adapts the number of hormone-producing cell to the continuously changing physiological requirements, are still poorly understood. Adult stem cells were shown to direct homeostatic cell maintenance, regeneration and functional plasticity in several organs and tissues. Only recently potential stem cells were identified and phenotypically characterized in adult pituitary. Multiple possible stem/progenitor cell candidates were proposed but different studies have been only partially reconciled. Here, we critically analyzed the reports addressing the identification of adult pituitary stem cells, trying, when possible, to reunite {{the results of the}} different studies. Nonetheless, in light of the still non-complete characterization of these cells, some discrepancies among the published studies are still apparent. Importantly, long-term in vitro self-renewal, <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> stem cells, remains to be unequivocally demonstrated. Finally, the potential role of adult pituitary stem (or progenitor) cells in pituitary adenoma development will be discussed...|$|R

25|$|In Argentina, writer Alejandro Dolina, in {{his book}} Crónicas del Ángel Gris ("Chronicles of the Gray Angel"), tells the legend of a massive jacarandá tree planted in Plaza Flores (Flores Square) in Buenos Aires, which was able to whistle tango songs on demand.

From the 1760s Palladianism was slowly superseded by Neoclassicism. <b>A</b> <b>defining</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> the Neoclassical house was the absence of the first floor piano nobile. This was in part due to the picturesque values then coming into vogue. During this—the era of Humphrey Repton's idyllic landscapes—it became desirable to step from any of the main rooms directly into the landscape. It was also desirable for all four sides of a house to enjoy this luxury.|$|E

A cooperative mode of work consists in “demarcated tasking on distinct problems and objects, with occasional if regular exchange.” Cooperation does not entail either a common definition of problems or shared techniques of remediation. A collaborative mode of work, by contrast, proceeds from an interdependent division of labor on shared problems. It entails a common definition of problems (or acceptance of a problem-space).|$|E

As it is probable that the development of this sound shift spanned a considerable time (several centuries), Proto-Germanic cannot adequately be reconstructed as a simple node in a tree model but rather represents a phase of development that may span close to a thousand years. The end of the Common Germanic period is reached with the beginning of the Migration Period in the fourth century.|$|E
