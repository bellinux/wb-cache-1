5|$|Following the {{successful}} use of superheating on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie experimentally fitted a superheated boiler to No.126 in December 1920, {{together with an}} extended smokebox and larger cylinders. The additional weight of the new boiler raised the centre of gravity of the locomotive, thereby adding to problems of instability on faster main line trains, whilst simultaneously preventing its use on many branch lines. As a result, no further examples were fitted, and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was experimentally fitted with the Strowger-Hudd <b>Automatic</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>System,</b> but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed <b>Automatic</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>System</b> (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E

When an autopsy revealed significant arterial blockage {{in the heart of}} the Piper's pilot, public speculation existed that Kramer had suffered a heart attack, causing incapacitation and contributing to the collision; further forensic evidence discounted this, and error on Kramer's part was determined to be the main contributing factor to the collision.|$|R
5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class. Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>System</b> (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke deflector plates from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid saw no reason to make such drastic alterations to the N1class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum snifting valves and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard Nclass chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>System</b> (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the Nclass.|$|E

25|$|Britain's Great Western Railway {{introduced}} the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This {{system is the}} forerunner of today's <b>Automatic</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>System</b> (AWS) and consists of an electrical system that sounded a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup {{on the underside of}} the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the electrical voltage on the ramp caused a warning horn to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. Where this was implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver could tell the state of the distant signal regardless of his ability to see it.|$|E
500|$|The {{first phase}} of {{construction}} involved building 18 new platforms with two track bays to handle parcels above this, along with a signal and communications building and various staff offices. The parcel deck was reinforced by 5,500 tons of structural steelwork. The signalling on the main routes leading {{out of the station}} was completely reworked along with the electrification of the lines, including the British Rail <b>Automatic</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>System.</b> Fifteen platforms had been complete by 1966, and the full electric service began on 3 January. A fully automated parcel depot, sited above platforms 3 to 18, opened on 7 August 1966. The new station was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 14 October 1968.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel <b>automatic</b> early <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> to remotely monitor areas of archaeological and cultural interest from {{the risk of}} fire. Since these areas have been treasured and tended for very long periods of time, they are usually surrounded by old and valuable vegetation or situated close to forest regions, which exposes them to {{an increased risk of}} fire. The proposed system takes advantage of recent advances in multi-sensor surveillance technologies, using optical and infrared cameras, wireless sensor networks capable of monitoring different modalities (e. g. temperature and humidity) as well as local weather stations on the deployment site. The signals collected from these sensors are transmitted to a monitoring centre, which employs intelligent computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms as well as data fusion techniques to automatically analyze sensor information. The system is capable of generating <b>automatic</b> <b>warning</b> signals for local authorities whenever a dangerous situation arises, as well as estimating the propagation of the fire based on the fuel model of the area and other important parameters such as wind speed, slope, and aspect of the ground surface. © 2011 EURASIP...|$|R
40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for {{protection}} against airborne threats require a high detection probability at long ranges. Infrared Search and Track (IRST) systems which are designed as monocular and passive systems {{are able to}} fulfil this requirement. However, due to clutter and distortions by other objects, like birds or clouds, these systems do not achieve the required low false alarm rate. For a reduction of the false alarm rate the exploitation of features like shape, size, texture and intensity is not reliable, because objects at long ranges appear as points. Range and velocity are more robust features of the point like objects. These features {{can be obtained by}} stereo vision from image sequences of multi-ocular systems. In this paper we describe investigations about the accuracy and reliability concerning the three-dimensional position and velocity of the objects. Unavoidable uncertainties in the measurement of the two-dimensional object position in the sensor focal plane lead to large errors in the estimated distance. We present a quantitative analysis of this issue, which results in fundamental restrictions for velocity estimation of objects. These considerations of accuracy and reliability are important for the design of multi-ocular IRST systems. The theoretical analysis is compared with the result of a processed IR stereo image sequence recorded at a measurement campaign with real objects. It is shown that data processing considering the fundamental restrictions lead to robust results for estimation of the spatial position and velocity. This information can be effectively used to reduce the false alarm rate. KURZFASSUNG...|$|R
