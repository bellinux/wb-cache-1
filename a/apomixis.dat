5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and {{giving rise to}} clonal populations genetically identical to the parent. This {{is one of several}} types of <b>apomixis</b> that occur in plants. <b>Apomixis</b> can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Stebbins {{was offered}} a {{genetics}} research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with geneticist E. B. Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project characterizing the genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus Crepis and was interested in developing Crepis into a model plant, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, Crepis commonly hybridized, displayed polyploidy (chromosome doubling), and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as <b>apomixis).</b> The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic Crepis species into the genus Youngia. The second, published in 1938, was titled The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and <b>apomixis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed <b>apomixis,</b> forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of <b>apomixis</b> allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and Potentilla.|$|E
25|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} {{exhibit a}} range of reproductive modes, including sexuality (amphimixis), facultative sexuality, meiotic parthenogenesis (automixis) and mitotic parthenogenesis (<b>apomixis).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Apomixis</b> can {{apparently}} {{occur in}} Phytophthora, an oomycete. Oospores from an experimental cross were germinated, {{and some of}} the progeny were genetically identical to one or other parent, implying that meiosis did not occur and the oospores developed by parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of sexual reproduction describes how sexually reproducing animals, plants, fungi and protists {{evolved from a}} common ancestor that was a single celled eukaryotic species. There are a few species which have secondarily {{lost the ability to}} reproduce sexually, such as Bdelloidea, and some plants and animals that routinely reproduce asexually (by <b>apomixis</b> and parthenogenesis) without entirely losing sex. The {{evolution of}} sex contains two related, yet distinct, themes: its origin and its maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Many trees, shrubs, vines, {{ferns and}} other {{herbaceous}} perennials form clonal colonies naturally. Parts {{of an individual}} plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed <b>apomixis,</b> resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.|$|E
25|$|Initially, M. smithii {{was thought}} to only {{reproduce}} asexually because no evidence of male individuals had been found. This led to M. smithii being recognized as the first fungus-growing ant species to reproduce via thelytokous parthenogenesis, where females, the workers and reproductive queens, are produced asexually. The cytogenetic mechanism of thelytoky is either <b>apomixis</b> (mitotic parthenogenesis) or automixis with central fusion and low recombination rates. Automixis with central fusion is the cytogenetic mechanism that was recorded in other asexual ant species.|$|E
25|$|When meiosis is involved, {{the sex of}} the {{offspring}} will depend on the type of sex determination system and the type of <b>apomixis.</b> In species that use the XY sex-determination system, parthenogenetic offspring will have two X chromosomes and are female. In species that use the ZW sex-determination system {{the offspring}} genotype may be one of ZW (female), ZZ (male), or WW (non-viable in most species but a fertile, viable female in a few (e.g., boas)). ZW offspring are produced by endoreplication before meiosis or by central fusion. ZZ and WW offspring occur either by terminal fusion or by endomitosis in the egg cell.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{composition}} of the offspring depends on what type of <b>apomixis</b> takes place. When endomitosis occurs before meiosis or when central fusion occurs (restitutional meiosis of anaphase I or the fusion of its products), the offspring get all to {{more than half of}} the mother's genetic material and heterozygosity is mostly preserved (if the mother has two alleles for a locus, it is likely that the offspring will get both). This is because in anaphase I the homologous chromosomes are separated. Heterozygosity is not completely preserved when crossing over occurs in central fusion. In the case of pre-meiotic doubling, recombination -if it happens- occurs between identical sister chromatids.|$|E
25|$|The term clone {{is used in}} {{horticulture}} {{to refer}} to descendants of a single plant which were produced by vegetative reproduction or <b>apomixis.</b> Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction. As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are potato and banana. Grafting {{can be regarded as}} cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.|$|E
25|$|Clonal {{derivation}} {{exists in}} nature in some animal species and {{is referred to}} as parthenogenesis (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes, fish (for example the hammerhead shark), the Komodo dragon and lizards. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of <b>apomixis.</b> In species that use the XY sex-determination system, the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata), which is native to Central and South America but has spread throughout many tropical environments.|$|E
2500|$|The orange is {{the fruit}} of the citrus species Citrus × sinensis in the family Rutaceae. It is also called [...] sweet orange, to {{distinguish}} it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (<b>apomixis</b> through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.|$|E
2500|$|Parthenogenesis ( [...] ; {{from the}} Greek παρθένος parthenos, [...] "virgin", + γένεσις genesis, [...] "creation") {{is a natural}} form of asexual {{reproduction}} in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. In animals, parthenogenesis means development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell. In plants parthenogenesis is a component process of <b>apomixis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Other ways of asexual {{reproduction}} include parthenogenesis, fragmentation and spore formation that involves only mitosis. Parthenogenesis is {{the growth and}} development of embryo or seed without fertilization by a male. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower plants (where it is called <b>apomixis),</b> invertebrates (e.g. water fleas, aphids, some bees and parasitic wasps), and vertebrates (e.g. some ...|$|E
2500|$|Crops such as maize {{reproduce}} sexually each year. This randomizes which genes get propagated to {{the next}} generation, meaning that desirable traits can be lost. To maintain a high-quality crop, some farmers purchase seeds every year. Typically, the seed company maintains two inbred varieties and crosses them into a hybrid strain that is then sold. [...] Related plants like sorghum and gamma grass are able to perform <b>apomixis,</b> a form of asexual reproduction that keeps the plant's DNA intact. [...] This trait is apparently controlled by a single dominant gene, but traditional breeding has been unsuccessful in creating asexually-reproducing maize. Genetic engineering offers another route to this goal. Successful modification would allow farmers to replant harvested seeds that retain desirable traits, {{rather than relying on}} purchased seed.|$|E
2500|$|Crustacean {{reproduction}} varies both {{across and}} within species. The water flea Daphnia pulex alternates between sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction. [...] Among the better-known large decapod crustaceans, some crayfish reproduce by parthenogensis. [...] "Marmorkrebs" [...] are parthenogenetic crayfish that {{were discovered in}} the pet trade in the 1990s. [...] Offspring are genetically identical to the parent, indicating it reproduces by <b>apomixis,</b> i.e. parthenogenesis in which the eggs did not undergo meiosis. Spinycheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus) can reproduce both sexually and by parthenogenesis. The Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), which normally reproduces sexually, has also been suggested to reproduce by parthenogenesis, although no individuals of this species have been reared this way in the lab. Artemia parthenogenetica is a species or series of populations of parthenogenetic brine shrimps.|$|E
2500|$|Cleistogamy: is {{self-pollination}} {{that occurs}} before the flower opens. [...] The pollen is {{released from the}} anther within the flower or the pollen on the anther grows a tube down the style to the ovules. It {{is a type of}} sexual breeding, in contrast to asexual systems such as <b>apomixis.</b> [...] Some cleistogamous flowers never open, in contrast to chasmogamous flowers that open and are then pollinated. Cleistogamous flowers are by necessity found on self-compatible or self-fertile plants. Although certain orchids and grasses are entirely cleistogamous, other plants resort to this strategy under adverse conditions. Often there may be a mixture of both cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers, sometimes on different parts of the plant and sometimes in mixed inflorescences. The ground bean produces cleistogamous flowers below ground, and mixed cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers above.|$|E
5000|$|Facultative <b>apomixis</b> {{means that}} <b>apomixis</b> {{does not always}} occur, i.e. sexual {{reproduction}} can also happen. It appears likely that all <b>apomixis</b> in plants is facultative; in other words, that [...] "obligate apomixis" [...] is an artifact of insufficient observation (missing uncommon sexual reproduction).|$|E

5000|$|Gametophytic <b>apomixis</b> in {{flowering}} plants develops {{in several different}} ways. A megagametophyte develops with an egg cell within it that develops into an embryo through parthenogenesis. The central cell of the megagametophyte may require fertilization to form the endosperm, pseudogamous gametophytic <b>apomixis,</b> or in autonomous gametophytic <b>apomixis</b> fertilization is not required.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apomixis</b> in {{flowering}} plants (angiosperms) includes {{some types of}} vegetative reproduction and also agamospermy, which is asexual reproduction through seeds (see <b>apomixis</b> for more information). Agamospermy can occur through many different mechanisms, some of which require pollination (pseudogamy), and some of which do not (autonomous <b>apomixis).</b> Many {{flowering plants}} with pseudogamous <b>apomixis</b> require fertilization to produce the endosperm of the seed. However, {{it has been shown}} that pollination with compatible pollen can be required even in some species where endosperm development is autonomous.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Apomixis</b> (reproduction via asexually formed seeds) {{is found}} {{naturally}} in about 2.2% of angiosperm genera [...] One type of <b>apomixis,</b> gametophytic <b>apomixis</b> {{found in a}} dandelion species [...] involves formation of an unreduced embryo sac due to incomplete meiosis (apomeiosis) and development of an embryo from the unreduced egg inside the embryo sac, without fertilization (parthenogenesis).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Apomixis,</b> the {{development}} of an embryo without the occurrence of fertilization, is particularly common among ferns. <b>Apomixis</b> evolved several times independently in three different clades of polystichoid ferns.|$|E
50|$|Pseudogamous <b>apomixis</b> {{occurs in}} many families. It is {{particularly}} common in Rosaceae and Poaceae, where {{it occurs in}} many different genera and species. Examples of species with pseudogamous <b>apomixis</b> include the Himalayan blackberry Rubus armeniacus and gamagrass Tripsacum dactyloides. By contrast, autonomous <b>apomixis</b> is the rule among the many apomictic species of Asteraceae including the common dandelion Taraxacum officinale, and also occurs in several genera of Poaceae.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{have two}} main types of asexual {{reproduction}} in which new plants are produced that are genetically identical clones {{of the parent}} individual. Vegetative reproduction involves a vegetative piece of the original plant (budding, tillering, etc.) and is distinguished from <b>apomixis,</b> which is a replacement for sexual reproduction, {{and in some cases}} involves seeds. <b>Apomixis</b> occurs in many plant species and also in some non-plant organisms. For <b>apomixis</b> and similar processes in non-plant organisms, see parthenogenesis.|$|E
50|$|In {{collaboration}} with O. Rosenberg, {{he was one}} of the first to confirm that some plants could form asexual seeds, now called (<b>apomixis).</b> Their experiments repeated those of Gregor Mendel with Hieracium hybrids, showing that Mendel had observed a mixture of sexual recombination and <b>apomixis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In botany, <b>apomixis</b> {{was defined}} by Hans Winkler as {{replacement}} of the normal sexual reproduction by asexual reproduction, without fertilization. Its etymology is Greek for [...] "away from" [...] + [...] "mixing". This definition notably does not mention meiosis. Thus [...] "normal asexual reproduction" [...] of plants, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, has never been considered to be <b>apomixis,</b> but replacement of the seed by a plantlet or replacement of the flower by bulbils were categorized as types of <b>apomixis.</b> Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent plant.|$|E

50|$|Agamospermy occurs {{mainly in}} two forms: In gametophytic <b>apomixis,</b> the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg cell (i.e. by parthenogenesis) in a {{gametophyte}} that was produced from a cell {{that did not}} complete meiosis. In adventitious embryony (sporophytic <b>apomixis),</b> an embryo is formed directly (not from a gametophyte) from nucellus or integument tissue (see nucellar embryony).|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{evolutionary}} advantages of sexual reproduction are lost, <b>apomixis</b> can pass along traits fortuitous for evolutionary fitness.
