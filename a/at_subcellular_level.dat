40|$|AbstractDetoxification of Cr(VI) under {{alkaline}} pH requires attention {{due to the}} alkaline {{nature of}} many effluents. An alkaliphilic gram-positive Bacillus subtilis isolated from tannery effluent contaminated soil was found to grow and reduce Cr(VI) up to 100 % at an alkaline pH 9. Decrease in pH to acidic range with growth of the bacterium signified {{the role played by}} metabolites (organic acids) in chromium resistance and reduction mechanism. The XPS and FT-IR spectra confirmed the reduction of Cr(VI) by bacteria into + 3 oxidation state. Chromate reductase assay indicated that the reduction was mediated by constitutive membrane bound enzymes. The kinetics of Cr(VI) reduction activity derived using the monod equation proved (Ks= 0. 00032) high affinity of the organism to the metal. This study thus helped to localize the reduction activity <b>at</b> <b>subcellular</b> <b>level</b> in a chromium resistant alkaliphilic Bacillus sp...|$|E

In particular, active forces, generated <b>at</b> <b>subcellular</b> <b>level,</b> have important macroscopic effects. Moreover, the structural composition of the organ changes both residual stresses and the microscopic behavior of the activated single cell. Starting from a viscoelastic rheological model of the tissue we use minimal requirements coming from thermodynamics, namely the fulfillment of first and second law, to derive a multiscale description of the system. The force-length and force-velocity relationships of isolated cardiomyocytes are enforced in the equations, while the force-Calcium relationship is supposed to derive from a mean-field crossbridge model. Any definition of strain used in the viscoelastic model leads to a particular characterization of the evolution laws of active deformations showing that zero dimensional models cannot be directly translated in a three dimensional framework...|$|E
40|$|We {{described}} a new ensemble-approach-based chemosensor, NCH-Cu²⁺, for highly selective and reversible detection of histidine (His) {{in aqueous solution}} and live cells. The ligand NCH exhibited specific binding with Cu²⁺ ions over other metal ions, accompanied with a 92. 2 [*]% fluorescence quenching. The decomplexation of NCH-Cu²⁺ ensemble by His led to the liberation of the fluorophore, NCH, and thus the fluorescence was recovered. The specific fluorescence enhancement of NCH-Cu²⁺ towards His showed a good linearity with a detection of limit at 70  nM. Quantification of intracellular His at the single cell level was achieved by microscopy and flow cytometry. Besides the UV/Vis and emission titration, reversibility of the NCH-Cu²⁺ towards His was further confirmed by imaging and cytometry analysis. In addition, microscopy studies revealed that NCH-Cu²⁺ was distributed in the lysosome of live cells, where it could be employed as a fluorescent biosensor for imaging of His <b>at</b> <b>subcellular</b> <b>level.</b> 8 page(s...|$|E

30|$|Cells sense their {{mechanical}} environment, which, in turn, regulates their functions. Various {{theoretical models}} are proposed to understand mechanical regulation of cell functions, which provide differential mathematical solutions. <b>At</b> <b>subcellular</b> <b>level,</b> most models {{are attempting to}} predict the force or stress distribution of cytoskeletal network and mimic the remodeling of mechanically sensitive cytoskeletal proteins (Ingber, 1997; Li, 2008; Geiger et al., 2009). At cellular level, a cell is usually modeled as an encapsulated lipid membrane containing stress-supported structures to support its deformation, adhesion, and spreading (Evans and Yeung, 1989; Stamenovic and Ingber, 2002; Murrell et al., 2011). At tissue level, mathematically models are developed to predict the dynamics of tumor growth (Chaplain et al., 2006) and osteogenic differentiation (Carter et al., 1998) under mechanical stimuli. These models also help to elucidate the mechanisms how cells resist shape distortion and maintain their structural stability and how they convert mechanical signals into biochemical responses. Regardless of their advantages in theoretical prediction, these models are still required to compare with the relevant experimental measurements.|$|E

We develop a method which is based on an extended version of pseudo-amino acid composition to predict the protein localization within mitochondria. This work goes one step further than predicting protein subcellular location. We also try to predict the membrane protein type for mitochondrial inner membrane proteins. Results By using leave-one-out cross validation, the prediction accuracy is 85. 5 % for inner membrane, 94. 5 % for matrix and 51. 2 % for outer membrane. The overall prediction accuracy for submitochondria location prediction is 85. 2 %. For proteins predicted to localize at inner membrane, the accuracy is 94. 6 % for membrane protein type prediction. Conclusion Our method is an effective method for predicting protein submitochondria location. But even with our method or the methods <b>at</b> <b>subcellular</b> <b>level,</b> the prediction of protein submitochondria location is still a challenging problem.

The application of methods of molecular biology has yielded protein-based genetically targetable indicators of neural activity, possessing performance comparable to the traditional organic dyes. Moreover, heterologous expression of microbial opsins proved capable of light-induced neural excitation or silencing in a single-component manner. The combination of these optogenetic tools offers two-way control over neuronal populations with single cell resolution.

A further stimulus to the investigation of the distribution of this element is the report by workers using lead in the treatment of malignant disease that there is a higher concentration of lead in neoplastic tissue than in adjacent normal tissues (Dilling and Haworth, 1929; Bargen, Horton and Osterberg, 1935).

On mitochondria in vivo located in neuronal soma (somatic) and on mitochondria of synapses (synaptic), the catalytic activities of regulatory enzymes of mitochondrial energy-yielding metabolic pathways were assayed. Antidepressants in vivo treatment modified the activities of selected enzymes of different mitochondria, leading to metabolic modifications in the energy metabolism of brain cortex: (a) the enhancement of cytochrome oxidase activity on somatic mitochondria; (b) the decrease of malate, succinate dehydrogenase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities of synaptic mitochondria; (c) the selective effect of fluoxetine on enzymes related to glutamate metabolism.

Nanowell volumes down to 0. 3 attolitres and nanowell densities as high as ∼ 109 wells per cm 2 could also be demonstrated. The present paper investigates the main features of protein trapping processes within the obtained nanowell arrays. Selective protein trapping, also involving orientation and biofunctionality changes, appears to be induced by the nanoconfinement. Nanomorphology measurements and antibody preferential linkages are demonstrated for human serum albumin versus lysozyme, the first being efficiently trapped within the nanocavities and the second being preferentially deposited outside them. The selective protein-dependent trapping/untrapping within the nanowells is discussed in terms of the variation in the out-diffusion coefficients of the biomolecules entering the nanowells, either {{as a function of the}} matching/mismatching of the biomolecules and nanocavity dimensions, or, alternatively, owing to the drastic conformational changes due to nanoconfinement. In this case, the trapping of large and soft human serum albumin is privileged with respect to the small and hard lysozyme. Furthermore, the observed peculiar antibody response to the confined proteins is accounted for in terms of the enhancement of their biological response following the modified accessibility of the key epitopes, which in turn suggests drastic conformational changes...|$|E

In this study, the effects of 21 -day treatment with desipramine (15  mg/kg) and fluoxetine (10  mg/kg) were examined on the energy metabolism of rat hippocampus, evaluating the catalytic activity of regulatory enzymes of mitochondrial energy-yielding metabolic pathways. Because of the micro-heterogeneity of brain mitochondria, we have distinguished between (a) non-synaptic mitochondria (FM) of neuronal perikaryon (post-synaptic compartment) and (b) intra-synaptic light (LM) and heavy (HM) mitochondria (pre-synaptic compartment). Desipramine and fluoxetine changed the catalytic activity of specific enzymes in the different types of mitochondria: (a) in FM, both drugs enhanced cytochrome oxidase and glutamate dehydrogenase, (b) in LM, the overall bioenergetics was unaffected and (c) in HM only desipramine increased malate dehydrogenase and decreased the activities of Electron Transport Chain Complexes.
