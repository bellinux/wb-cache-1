40|$|Abstract — Standardized {{investigations}} on resting {{heart rate}} variability (HRV) should provide more information on acamprosate's human pharmacodynamic properties because acamprosate interacts with several neurotransmitter systems which are also involved in maintaining autonomic neurocardiac balance. We performed HRV measurements prospectively in 69 healthy controls and 19 chronic alcoholics to prove the hypotheses that: (1) compared to healthy controls, chronic alcoholics show disturbances in neurocardiac vagal function; and (2) in <b>alcoholics,</b> acamprosate <b>treatment</b> (6 - 8 days) should further decrease parasympathetic activity if acamprosate interacts with central y-aminobutyric acidA receptors in vivo.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the validity of the Personal Orientation Dimensions (POD) for measuring changes following an inpatient <b>alcoholic</b> <b>treatment</b> program and to describe these changes in terms of concepts of the actualizing person. Differences between pretest and posttest raw scores were significant for 9 of 13 POD scales. Eight of the changes were in the direction of greater actualiz-ing and one in the direction of greater social conformity. It was concluded that the POD was sensitive to changes resulting from the present <b>alcoholic</b> <b>treatment</b> program and that these changes were generally in the direction of greater actualizing. EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT 1976, 36, 505 - 507. SHOSTROM (1975) has recently introduced the Personal Orientation Dimensions (POD) as a further development in measuring concepts related to the actualizing person. The POD represents a refinement and an extension of those concepts first published in the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) (Shostrom, 1963). A major finding resulting from use of the POI {{in a variety of settings}} has been that it is sensitive to changes resulting from various treat-ments such as individual and group therapy and from the effects of encounter, sensitivity, and/or marathon group experience. Also rele-vant to the present research is the number of studies in which concepts of actualizing have been shown to be related to the problems of alcoholism and its treatment.

40|$|The neuropsychological deficits {{which are}} found in a {{significant}} number of alcoholics participating in the rehabilitation process have been well documented. Recent concern has also been voiced that cognitive impairments present in alcoholics receiving treatment are more severe than what has been perceived through clinical observations. Unfamiliarity with these important findings may result in the formulation of an alcohol and other drug use evaluation and treatment plan which are not designed to address cognitive impairments present in clients. If a person is to benefit from an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>treatment</b> regimen which incorporates various educational and counseling formats, it is essential that the client be able to assimilate and accommodate new information designed to effect prosocial behavioral change. A review of ease studies and research findings also indicated that various neuropsychological tests are sensitive to measuring cognitive deficits present in alcoholics receiving treatment. The utilization and careful analysis of these tests may allow for: (1) a more accurate assessment of alcoholism; (2) a descriptive evaluation of the specific cognitive deficits; (3) prescriptive suggestions for treatment; and (4) a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of these deficits on the client's performance in treatment, the outcome of the rehabilitation process, subsequent employment, and driving a motor vehicle.

40|$|MANY sociologists are {{attempting}} to apply sociology to the solution of numerous problem areas. Today one finds applied sociologists doing extensive research on such deviant behaviour as criminality, juvenile delinquency, mental illness, alcoholism, suicide, marriage and family maladjustments, and racial and ethnic discrimination. An increasing number of sociologists, for example, are even on the research staffs of correctional institutions, psychiatric departments, mental hospitals, and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>treatment</b> centres in the United States. Out of this applied and other sociological research come a number of sociological theories and concepts which appear useful. These concepts include the relation of deviant behaviour to social norms, sub-cultures and social groups, class structure, role theory and self-conceptions, typological classifications and urbanism. Social Norms A major interest of sociologists {{is the definition of}} the norms in-volved and the differences in society's tolerance of various types of norm violations. All deviations from social norms are by no means always disapproved. Inventions, for example, represent violations of norms which may be strongly approved. Other violations may be tolerated, and still others may be mildly disapproved. Deviant behaviour consists of those violations of norms which are of a sufficient degree to exceed the general tolerance limit of a society (Clinard, 1957). This means, of course, that the norms which constitute deviant behaviour are not necessarily the same in various cultures, nor are they the same in a given culture over a period of time.

Alcohol-dependent patients are responsible for two-thirds of motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol. Studies carried out on the general population have shown a relation between alcohol dependence and traffic accidents. The aim of the study is to analyse the effect on traffic accidents of treatment of patients with alcohol-related problems. To do so, the prevalence of traffic problems in a sample of patients with a diagnosed dependence on alcohol was assessed for three periods: during their lifetime, in the year preceding the start of treatment and over the year of treatment. A prospective study was carried out of 176 patients (147 males, 29 females; mean age 42. 9 years) diagnosed as alcohol dependent according to the DSM-IV criteria in three <b>alcoholic</b> <b>treatment</b> centres in Castilla y León, Spain. 36. 9 % of the alcohol-dependent patients had had some kind of traffic problem during their life and 8. 5 % in the year prior to starting treatment.

40|$|America is aging, older {{alcoholic}} numbers rise. Disagreement {{has long}} existed {{as to whether}} elderly should be treated within traditional programs or in special age-specific modalities. Few studies measure variables selected to show either need or efficacy of elderly specific programs. This {{study was designed to}} answer the question: What is the perception of certified alcohol and other drug abuse counselors regarding the best way to treat the elderly, mainstream or elderly specific? The study is based on a bias that addiction counselors have been delivering services to elderly for years in both program types and offer valuable perceptions on the question of treatment effectiveness. A random sample of 788 counselors from a nationwide population of over 25, 000 was persistently solicited to participate in a survey addressing the treatment of alcoholics 55 years and older. The most common education level was a master degree; length of experience 9 - 15 years; age 46. The study analyzed data from the 574 returns, a 72. 8 % response rate, of a lengthy questionnaire previously validated by gerontology and alcoholism experts. Items selected as variables were clustered into three domains which indicated tendencies toward (a) choice of either traditional or special age-specific programming as most effective, (b) cognizance of elderly and alcohol treatment issues, and (c) willingness to counsel the elderly. On the main research question, according to domain scores, there was no statistical significance in counselor-perceived efficacy of either mainstream or elderly specific treatment of elderly alcoholics. The literature body also is ambiguous on the question. Amount of education predicted degree of gerontology knowledge. Greater gerontological acumen predicted preference (perceived greater effectiveness) for elderly specific programming. Females had more gerontologic knowledge than males. Gender predicted willingness to counsel the elderly; males were more willing than females. Counselor training should include more gerontology studies. Foci and loci for future research were identified with suggestions for treatment planning.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of the relationships between alcoholics' and nonalcoholics' attributions and their emotions of anxiety and depression. The research design is an ex post facto/causal comparative analysis. Subjects were 150 white males. The treatment factor is separated into three levels: no treatment for alcoholism (50 nonalcoholics), two or three day treatment for alcoholism (50 alcoholics in detoxification units), and three to six months of treatment for alcoholism (50 alcoholics in a supportive living situation, halfway house, three-quarterway house). The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) was used to separate nonalcoholics from alcoholics. The variables measured for the three populations are: attributional style (as measured by the Attributional Style Questionnaire-revised for drinking practices) and emotional state (as measured by the Profile of Mood State). One-way MANOVA analysis was used to examine the data because there are three attributional areas measured by the ASQ (internality, stability, and globality) and two emotional areas measured by the POMS (tension-anxiety, depression-dejection). MANOVA analysis resulted in a significant F. The three groups were significantly different at the multivariate level in terms of attributional and emotional states. Discriminate analysis was used to determine if the groups were reliably different. Both synthetic variables analyzed resulted in significant results. The first synthetic variable was labeled "emotional stability," and the second was labeled "specific causal attribution. "Univariate analysis showed: (1) no significant difference between groups on the internal/external dimension or the stable/unstable dimension, (2) significant difference at the. 01 level on the global/specific dimension when comparing alcoholics in recovery and nonalcoholics, and (3) significant difference at the. 01 level on anxiety and depression levels of each of the three group comparisons. Pearson Product Correlations were examined to understand the relationships between attributions and emotional states for alcoholics and nonalcoholics. The stable/unstable and global/specific dimensions are positively correlated with depression and the global/specific dimension is positively correlated with anxiety. All the hypotheses were supported: 1. Alcoholics in detoxification make different attributions and have different mood states than alcoholics in recovery. 2. Nonalcoholics make different attributions and have different mood states than alcoholics in treatment and in recovery. 3. There are correlational relationships between the attributions and emotional states for alcoholics and nonalcoholics. Some <b>alcoholic</b> <b>treatment</b> recommendations were made.
