Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals. Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks. After <b>amputation,</b> <b>stump</b> cells form a blastema formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body. New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells. Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration. In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.|$|E

40|$|Morphological {{changes in}} the <b>amputation</b> <b>stump</b> may have serious {{implications}} regarding the suspension and fit of the prosthetic socket. In an earlier study (Lilja and Öberg, 1997) the authors {{have shown that the}} volume of the trans-tibial <b>amputation</b> <b>stump</b> decreases according to a negative power function after amputation, and that the stump volume does not stabilise until four months after the operation. In the present study, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique was used to examine morphological {{changes in the}} <b>amputation</b> <b>stump</b> after trans-tibial amputation in a small number of cases. The authors expected to find a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the stump and of the separate muscles similar to the findings in earlier studies. However, two different patterns were found. The cross-sectional area of the entire stump {{as well as that of}} the medial muscle group changed according to the authors ' hypothesis, i. e. an initial fast decrease, followed by a more moderate decrease of the area. In the lateral muscle group another pattern was found. After an initial rapid decrease the area increased, sometimes to a magnitude larger than the initial value. After the amputation the lateral muscle group may acquire a new function, contributing to the suspension of the socket. Despite the limited number of patients, this study presents findings which may be important in the clinical fitting of trans-tibial prostheses...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the {{efficacy}} of a single 60 min application of capsaicin 8 % patch in reducing chronic <b>amputation</b> <b>stump</b> and phantom limb pain, associated hypersensitivity with quantitative sensory testing, and changes in brain cortical maps using functional MRI (fMRI) scans. Methods: A capsaicin 8 % patch (Qutenza) treatment study was conducted on 14 patients with single limb amputation, who reported pain intensity on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale ≥ 4 / 10 for chronic stump or phantom limb pain. Pain assessments, quantitative sensory testing, and fMRI (for the lip pursing task) were performed at baseline and 4 weeks after application of capsaicin 8 % patch to the <b>amputation</b> <b>stump.</b> The shift into the hand representation area of the cerebral cortex with the lip pursing task has been correlated with phantom limb pain intensity in previous studies, and was the fMRI clinical model for cortical plasticity used in this study. Results: The mean reduction in spontaneous <b>amputation</b> <b>stump</b> pain, phantom limb pain, and evoked stump pain were − 1. 007 (p= 0. 028), − 1. 414 (p= 0. 018), and − 2. 029 (p= 0. 007), respectively. The areas of brush allodynia and pinprick hypersensitivity in the <b>amputation</b> <b>stump</b> showed marked decreases: − 165 cm 2, − 80 % (p= 0. 001) and − 132 cm 2, − 72 % (p= 0. 001), respectively. fMRI analyses provided objective evidence of the restoration of the brain map, that is, reversal of the shift into the hand representation of the cerebral cortex with the lip pursing task (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results show that capsaicin 8 % patch treatment leads to significant reduction in chronic pain and, particularly, in the area of stump hypersensitivity, which may enable patients to wear prostheses, thereby improving mobility and rehabilitation. Phantom limb pain (“central” pain) and associated brain plasticity may be modulated by peripheral inputs, as they can be ameliorated by the peripherally restricted effect of the capsaicin 8 % patch...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{problem of}} changes in {{pathogenic}} microbiological flora {{and the emergence of}} bacterial resistance has created major problems in the management of orthopaedic diseases and fractures. Due to the use of implants for open reduction and internal fixation, which are foreign bodies to the body, orthopaedic trauma surgery is at grave risk of microbiological contamination and infection. Methodology: With new microbiological agents in vogue, we have conducted a retrospective study to determine the pattern of bacterial infection, sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents, and their relations to various orthopaedic illnesses and procedures. Results: Gram negative (E. coli and Pseudomonas spp.) infections have emerged as the major threat (74. 37 %) in orthopaedic cases in contrast to Staphylococcus aureus (23. 31 %). These bacteria infected patients with open fractures (34. 3 %), spinal instrumentation with bedsores (23. 31 %), osteomyelitis of bone (24. 42 %) and guillotine <b>amputation</b> <b>stumps</b> (14. 43 %).

40|$|Objective: Verrucous skin lesions on {{the feet}} in {{diabetic}} neuropathy {{is a condition}} usually induced by chronic mechanical stimulation of the feet of patients with dia-betic neuropathy and usually occurs at weight-bearing sites. We here present a rare case involving a man with verrucous skin lesions on the feet in diabetic neuropathy at an unusual, non–weight-bearing site. Methods: A 58 -year-old man with diabetic neu-ropathy presented with a verrucous skin lesion overlaying residual skin staples and an <b>amputation</b> <b>stump</b> of the second metatarsal bone on the dorsal foot. Results: The biopsy findings were inconclusive and suggested the necessity of distinguishing the lesion from verrucous carcinoma. The lesion was resected, and the residual skin staples were simul-taneously removed. Investigation of the excisional biopsy confirmed our diagnosis of verrucous skin lesions on the feet in diabetic neuropathy. Conclusions: Verrucous skin lesions on the feet in diabetic neuropathy {{is often difficult to}} distinguish from verrucous carcinoma; in this case, the unusual location of the lesion could be attributed not only to sensory loss but also to the presence of an <b>amputation</b> <b>stump</b> and the persistence of the residual skin staples...|$|E
40|$|Cross {{transposition}} {{of digital}} rays {{is illustrated by}} a case of amputation of the thumb and the middle finger. A remnant of the stump of. the middle finger was mobilised and brought {{on top of the}} first metacarpal, in order to restore a functional length to the amputated thumb. A cross transposition of the second digital ray to the third was also carded out, closing the gap left by the resection of the third metacarpal. Transposition of a digit for reconstruction of an amputated thumb, theso-called pollicisation, has been advocated for years. In posttraumatie cases in distinction from pollicisation in congenital aplasia of the thumb, the procedure isperformed mostly in adults and the pollicised finger although functionally adequate, has a less atisfactory appearance.
