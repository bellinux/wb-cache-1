40|$|The wall static {{pressure}} of confined air jet, impinging normally onto a flat plate has been experimentally investigated. The mean velocities, and wall {{static pressure}}s were measured for Reynolds numbers ranging from 18, 000 to 40, 000 and the nozzle-to-plate spacing’s in range of 0. 25 – 4. The effects of Reynolds number, nozzle-to-plate spacing and flow confinement on the pressure coefficient are reported. The pressure distributions {{are independent of}} the Reynolds number and depend on nozzle-to-plate spacing only. The maximum pressure occurs at the stagnation point (r/d= 0) for the all nozzle-to-plate spacing’s studied and as r/d increases, the pressure decreases. At very low spacing (z/d= 0. 25) stagnation pressure is rather larger {{than those of the}} other spacing’s due to rapidly decreasing of axial velocity in the deflection zone. It is concluded that a sub <b>atmospheric</b> <b>region</b> occurs on the impingement plate for the nozzle-to-plate spacing’s up to one for all the Reynolds number; however, {{there is no evidence of}} the sub <b>atmospheric</b> <b>region</b> in confined jet For the nozzle-to-plate spacing’s greater than one...|$|E

30|$|The {{change in}} {{temperature}} {{can also cause}} changes in pressure over the totality footprint. The sudden change in the stratospheric pressure during the solar eclipse may also {{be responsible for the}} generation of gravity waves in the stratosphere (Zerefos et al., 2007). Thus, these variations throughout the middle atmosphere, in turn, can result in variations in neutral winds and wind shears which, in turn, give rise to short-scale fluctuations. The horizontal wind measurements throughout the middle <b>atmospheric</b> <b>region</b> over the equatorial station Thumba during the annular eclipse event of 15 January, 2010, are used to study the dynamical processes during the eclipse which are associated with wave motions produced in the region of local temperature changes of the atmosphere as the Moon’s shadow advances at supersonic speeds. Eclipse-induced perturbations could be found in the vertical profiles of the zonal and meridional winds throughout the middle <b>atmospheric</b> <b>region</b> over Thumba. The MLT region zonal wind showed a reversal at 98 km during the maximum phase of the eclipse and the reversal is further strengthened after the maximum phase. The meridional wind in the MLT region showed noticeable changes only after the maximum phase of the eclipse. These observed changes in the wind system are attributed to eclipse-induced cooling and subsequent changes in the pressure in the middle atmosphere over Thumba. Winkler et al. (2001) have argued that factors such as the cooling rate, the inversion strength and height, and the pressure gradient could induce strong wind shear and turbulent mixing, thus substantiating the wind variations associated with the eclipse.|$|E
50|$|It is {{convenient}} {{to separate the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>regions</b> according to the two temperature minima at about 12 km altitude (the tropopause) and at about 85 km (the mesopause) (Figure 1). The thermosphere (or the upper atmosphere) is the height region above 85 km, while the region between the tropopause and the mesopause is the middle atmosphere (stratosphere and mesosphere) where absorption of solar UV radiation generates the temperature maximum near 45 km altitude and causes the ozone layer. The density of the Earth's atmosphere decreases nearly exponentially with altitude. The total mass of the atmosphere is M = ρA H ≃ 1 kg/cm2 within a column of one square centimeter above the ground (with ρA = 1.29 kg/m3 the atmospheric density {{on the ground at}} z = 0 m altitude, and H ≃ 8 km the average atmospheric scale height). 80% of that mass is concentrated within the troposphere. The mass of the thermosphere above about 85 km is only 0.002% of the total mass. Therefore, no significant energetic feedback from the thermosphere to the lower <b>atmospheric</b> <b>regions</b> can be expected.|$|R

The gas-liquid interface {{is assumed to be}} at equilibrium, and interfacial resistance is negligible. Raindrops are simulated as falling from a 2 km height through an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>region</b> containing SO 2. The droplets decrease in size from evaporation and cooling, and their slightly basic pH aids SO 2 absorption. The simulation indicates higher SO 2 absorption at higher altitudes, and desorption may occur at ground level.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{effect of}} breaking internal gravity waves on the circulation {{in the middle}} atmosphere of Mars was investigated using a quasi-geostrophic delta-plane dynamical model of the zonal-mean flow. The results of model simulations show that breaking gravity waves of intermediate horizontal scales (100 - 1000 km wavelengths) could act to 'close off' the winter westerly circumpolar jet in the 40 - 80 km altitude region and induce strong high-latitude warming at these levels, in accordance with recent thermal measurements indicating that Martian winter polar latitudes may be very warm in this middle <b>atmospheric</b> <b>region.</b> It was also found that, below about 40 km, wave breaking does not induce much warming, consistent with available data showing that winter high altitudes are normally very cold at lower levels...|$|E

Accordingly, the stratospheric ozone layer is expected to recover. However, short data records and atmospheric variability confound the search for early signs of recovery, and climate change is masking ozone recovery from ozone-depleting substances in some regions and will increasingly affect the extent of recovery.
