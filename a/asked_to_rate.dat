25|$|One {{experiment}} that {{was conducted to}} test the mere-exposure effect used fertile chicken eggs for the test subjects. Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks {{while they were still}} unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it. Zajonc tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen. In a similar experiment, the individuals were not <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> the connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment. Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive {{than those who did not}} receive repeated exposure.|$|E

Unlike the overall feedback rating, these ratings are anonymous; neither sellers nor other users learn how individual buyers rated the seller.

25|$|The results {{indicated}} that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based {{on his or her}} attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The {{results indicated}} a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.|$|E
25|$|In the oft-cited and oft-criticized Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), by Alfred C. Kinsey et al., {{people were}} <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> {{themselves}} {{on a scale from}} completely heterosexual to completely homosexual. Kinsey reported that when the individuals' behavior as well as their identity are analyzed, most people appeared to be at least somewhat bisexual — i.e., most people have some attraction to either sex, although usually one sex is preferred. According to Kinsey, only a minority (5–10%) can be considered fully heterosexual or homosexual. Conversely, only an even smaller minority can be considered fully bisexual (with an equal attraction to both sexes). Kinsey's methods have been criticized as flawed, particularly with regard to the randomness of his sample population, which included prison inmates, male prostitutes and those who willingly participated in discussion of previously taboo sexual topics. Nevertheless, Paul Gebhard, subsequent director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, reexamined the data in the Kinsey Reports and concluded that removing the prison inmates and prostitutes barely affected the results.|$|E

25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed {{picture of the}} perception of identity inside the country. The participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> {{the relationship between the}} identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the entire sample, which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital Chișinău, for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), {{people are more likely to}} perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if they are young (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).|$|E
25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E

Outcome measures included: (1) The Emotional Overeating Questionnaire (EOQ) (Masheb and Grilo 2006), a 9 -item scale that <b>asks</b> respondents <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> how likely they were to overeat over the past 1 month in response to nine different emotions (e.g., anxiety, sadness) on a 7 -point Likert scale (0 not likely at all; 6 extremely likely).

In addition, attendance was collected and general questions on demographic information were collected at baseline. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ 8) (Larsen et al. 1979), an 8 -item measure that evaluates satisfaction along a 4 -point Likert scale, was administered at week 8; patients were also asked two additional qualitative questions, including what they liked best about the group and what they would change to make it better.|$|R

Interestingly, participants wanted to be friends with the Caucasian model most when she was wearing a plain sweatshirt and the African American model most when she was wearing either the plain or K-Mart sweatshirt.

40|$|A common {{approach}} to designing Recommender Systems (RS) consists of <b>asking</b> users <b>to</b> explicitly <b>rate</b> items {{in order to}} collect feedback about their preferences. However, users {{have been shown to}} be inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of natural noise in their ratings that affects the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy by reducing the natural noise in the input data via a preprocessing step. In order to quantitatively understand the impact of natural noise, we first analyze the response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise. Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise existing datasets by means of re-rating: i. e. by <b>asking</b> users <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> previously rated items again. This denoising step yields very significant accuracy improvements. However, re-rating all items in the original dataset is unpractical. Therefore, we study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only some of the ratings. In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies: data and user-dependent denoising. Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data and hence their accuracy: <b>asking</b> users <b>to</b> re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than <b>asking</b> users <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> unseen items...|$|R

The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: [...] "I told someone that the task was interesting." [...] and [...] "I actually found it boring." [...] Moreover, the subjects paid one-dollar were induced to comply; compelled to internalize the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, thus, they experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.|$|E

2500|$|Implicit memory tests, in {{contrast}} with explicit memory tests, measure the recall value of a particular stimulus based on later performance on stimulus-related tasks. During these tasks, the subject does not explicitly recall the stimulus, but the previous stimulus still affects performance.

The levels-of-processing effect is only found for explicit memory tests. One study found that word completion tasks were unaffected by levels of semantic encodings achieved using three words with various levels of meaning in common. Another found that typical level-of-processing effects are reversed in word completion tasks; subjects recalled pictures pairs more completely if they were shown a word representing a picture rather than <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> a picture for pleasantness (semantic encoding).
