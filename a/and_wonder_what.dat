Nick and Rance are {{discussing}} Johnson <b>and</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> Minnie sees in him when Ashby arrives in triumph: Johnson has been captured. Rance and the miners all want Johnson to be hanged. Johnson accepts the sentence and only asks the miners not to tell Minnie about his capture and his fate ("Ch'ella mi creda"). Minnie arrives, armed with a pistol, just before the execution and throws herself in front of Johnson to protect him. While Rance tries to proceed, she convinces the miners that they owe her too much to kill the man she loves, and asks them to forgive him ("Ah! Ah! E Minnie!").

Youkilis's foundation focuses on raising support and awareness for the health, advocacy, safety, and medical healing of children across Massachusetts, {{in his hometown}} of Cincinnati, and beyond.

500|$|George W. Bush {{took office}} in January 2001, and changed the American policy towards {{countries}} in financial crises. The Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, a critic of financial aids, said, [...] "We're working {{to find a way}} to create a sustainable Argentina, not just one that continues to consume the money of the plumbers and carpenters in the United States who make $50,000 a year <b>and</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> in the world we're doing with their money". The September 11 attacks occurred a few months later, and the U.S. focused its foreign policy on the War on Terror against countries suspected of harboring terrorist organizations. As a result, the U.S. gave no further financial aid to Argentina. This policy was confirmed after an interview of Bush with the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who confirmed Brazil would not be affected by the Argentine crisis.|$|E

"When I got it, I {{was pretty}} shocked – I must say it's not {{something}} I'd ever expected – {{and so you}} have to sit down <b>and</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> the hell you're going to do.

Yesterday, I was in Alice Springs, talking to people about the difficulties that they're having with Aboriginal alcoholism and violence – the kind of problems that it's bringing – and then you're back into discussions on – race back to Cabinet for discussions on migration and what kind of social security benefits people might get, and then you're talking about age pensions, this morning, on another program about some people's concerns. It's just so big. I'll get interested, don't worry." ...|$|E
