5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E

If the player chooses <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{does not make sense}} {{in the context of the}} play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (<b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E

25|$|Logograms are {{sometimes}} called ideograms, <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> refers to symbols which graphically represent abstract ideas, but linguists avoid this use, as Chinese characters are often semantic–phonetic compounds, symbols which include an element {{that represents the}} meaning and a phonetic complement element that represents the pronunciation. Some nonlinguists distinguish between lexigraphy and ideography, where symbols in lexigraphies represent words and symbols in ideographies represent words or morphemes.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>word,</b> <b>that</b> is a {{form with}} meaning, is {{eligible}} for the Interlingua vocabulary if it is verified by {{at least three of}} the four primary control languages.

In some cases, the archaic or potential presence of a word can contribute to its eligibility.|$|E

25|$|The {{acquisition}} of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{always has a}} particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects {{are attached to the}} word but don’t have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.|$|E
25|$|The hyphens {{and lack}} of {{projection}} lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on {{the left of the}} clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (He'll, There's), whereas a hyphen that appears {{on the right side of}} the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (He'll, There's) or on its head (would've). At other times, it can depend prosodically on <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (Florida's).|$|E
25|$|In Sanskrit, grantha is {{literally}} 'a knot'. It is <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{was used for}} books, and the script used to write them. This stems from the practice of binding inscribed palm leaves using a length of thread held by knots. Although Sanskrit is now mostly written with Devanagari, Grantha was widely used to write Sanskrit in the Tamil-speaking parts of South Asia until the 19th century. Scholars believe that the Grantha script was used when the Vedas were first put into writing around the 5th century CE. In the early 20th century, it began {{to be replaced by}} Devanagari in religious and scholarly texts and the Tamil script (with the use of diacritics) in popular texts.|$|E
