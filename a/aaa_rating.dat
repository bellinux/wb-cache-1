Vannevar was the next foal, and was AQHA Champion Racing Gelding in 1956 and 1957. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1954 foal was Vandy's Flash, who was the first gelding named World Champion Quarter Running Horse, in 1960. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1955 foal was Vansarita, who was never raced. A number of miscarriages followed, but in 1958 Garrett's Miss Pawhuska produced Miss Vanity, another AAA-rated racehorse. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska slipped, or lost, her next two foals, but produced Vansarita Too in 1961, who also earned an AAA on the race track. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal by Vandy was Vandy's Flash, a stallion, who was never raced but sired 107 foals. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal was not by Vandy, but was by a son of Three Bars named The Ole Man, but the gelding was never raced.|$|E

40|$|Analyzing 916 CDOs {{issued from}} January 1997 to December 2007, {{we find that}} direct outputs from a rating agency model are more {{straightforward}} and accurate than actual ratings assigned to CDOs. Actual sizes of <b>AAA</b> <b>rated</b> tranches are on average 12. 1 % larger than implied by the rating agency model. These adjustments to the rating agency model are difficult to explain by possible determinants but exhibit a clear pattern of low model-implied AAA CDOs receiving larger adjustments. CDOs with larger adjustments experience worse subsequent performance. Moreover, prior to April 1, 2007, 91. 2 % of <b>AAA</b> <b>rated</b> notes only comply with the credit rating agency’s own AA default rate standard.

40|$|The {{revaluation}} of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) plays {{a significant}} role in the ongoing 2007 - 2009 credit crisis. Starting in August 2007, a large amount of initially <b>AAA</b> <b>rated</b> CDO securities are substantially downgraded, some directly to junk grade. This paper explores two structural sources of CDO mispricing: modeling difficulty and data limitation. Simulating the frailty correlated default model of Duffie, Eckner, Horel, and Saita (2008), we show that CDO mis-pricing can be partly attributed to model misspecifications, as well as limited availability of historical data on CDO collateral assets. This simulation result is consistent with empirical evidence on historical performance of a sample of 279 CDOs. The frailty model estimated with adequate historical data would have reduced the amount of <b>AAA</b> <b>rated</b> CDO securities by 12 % on average. The frailty model has predictive power for the subsequent downgrading of <b>AAA</b> <b>rated</b> CDO tranches.

40|$|Although {{the federal}} funds rate started rising from mid- 2004 US long term rates {{continued}} to fall. A likely contributory factor to this ‘conundrum’ was the contemporaneous increase in US bond demand. Using ARDL based models, which accommodate structural breaks, this paper estimates the impact of foreign and domestic demand on <b>AAA</b> <b>rated</b> US bond yields in the ‘conundrum’ period. This impact is shown to have been everywhere significantly negative. The fact that our model fully explains the ‘bond yield conundrum’ gives support to {{the hypothesis that the}} US CDO market was rapidly expanded before 2007 chiefly to absorb the overspill of global demand for safe assets. Moreover, our models demonstrate that there are strong linkages between the 10 -year Treasury yield and the long term yields of <b>AAA</b> <b>rated</b> non-Treasury bonds...|$|R
