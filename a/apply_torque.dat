40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe motion of an unbalanced rotor during acceleration through its critical speed is studied by numerical solutions obtained {{with a digital}} computer. The rotor is laterally restrained in two orthogonal directions by linear springs and is accelerated by a constant <b>applied</b> <b>torque.</b> It is found that, for a fixed combination of rotor unbalance and lateral stiffnesses, the <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> must exceed a limiting value in order to accelerate successfully through the critical speed region. With smaller <b>applied</b> <b>torques,</b> after initial acceleration from rest the speed oscillates ontinually about the critical speed and the lateral excursions grow steadily. The conditions necessary for a successful acceleration are established and the maximum lateral ex­cursions during successful accelerations are determined. The effects of small amounts of viscous damping in the lateral directions are also obtained.

40|$|Background: Screw {{loosening}} of implant restorations {{continues to}} be a complication in implant prosthodontics. Screw joints are subjected to a loss of initially <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> because of friction and component misfit. It has been suggested that the loss of <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> is less in machined metal abutments than in cast plastic abutments. Purpose: This study compared the loss of <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> (detorque) values in machined titanium and in cast UCLA-type abutments for external hex abutment/implant interface. Materials and Methods: Four groups of 12 samples each were evaluated: (1) machined titanium abutments, (2) premachined palladium abutments cast with palladium, (3) plastic abutments cast with nickel-chromium, and (4) plastic abutments cast with cobalt-chromium. Each abutment was torqued to 30 Ncm according to the manufacturer’s instructions and detorqued three times. The mean loss of <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> (detorque) was recorded {{as a percentage of the}} <b>torque</b> <b>applied.</b> Group means were calculated and compared using ANOVA and Tukey’s LSD test. Results: Mean detorque values were (1) 92. 3 ± 2. 9 %, (2) 81. 6 ± 5. 0 %, (3) 86. 4 ± 4. 6 %, and (4) 84. 0 ± 7. 0 %. Machined abutments demonstrated significantly greater detorque values compared with all cast groups (p < 0. 05). No significant differences were found among cast groups...|$|R

When the traction difference exceeds the TBR, the slower output side of the differential receives the tractive torque of the faster wheel multiplied by the TBR; any extra <b>torque</b> remaining from <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> contributes to the angular acceleration of the faster output side of the differential.|$|R

Caltech's Swerdlow disputes Hipparchus's knowledge of precession because Hipparchus apparently did not necessarily indicate anything like a motion of the entire sphere of the fixed stars with respect to the equinoxes. The precession of Earth's axis was later explained by Newtonian physics. Being an oblate spheroid, Earth has a non-spherical shape, bulging outward at the equator. The gravitational tidal forces of the Moon and Sun <b>apply</b> <b>torque</b> to the equator, attempting to pull the equatorial bulge into the plane of the ecliptic, but instead causing it to precess.

50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} typically employ an {{epicyclic gear}} train having {{one or more}} stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied.

The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the planet gear teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the planet gears to orbit around the sun gear. The planet gears are held in a ‘planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft. As the planet gears orbit around the sun gear, the carrier and the output shaft rotate together. Without the reaction arm to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot <b>apply</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{basin wrench}} {{consists}} of a long shaft {{with a pair of}} asymmetrical jaws at one end and a transverse handle at the other end.

When the shaft is turned in the direction that causes the curved jaw to trail the pivot pin, the jaws will increase their grip on the fastener as shaft torque increases, thereby allowing the operator to <b>apply</b> <b>torque</b> to the fastener without slippage.
