The British Library brought together the four existing copies of the 1215 manuscript in February 2015 for a special exhibition. British artist Cornelia Parker was commissioned {{to create a new}} artwork, Magna Carta (An Embroidery), which was shown at the British Library between May and July 2015.

25|$|Koester adds insight when he {{concluded}} that Thomas did not evolve from the editing of Synoptic parables but from an independent oral source. From “careful analysis of {{the parable of the}} Sower in the Synoptics and Thomas, John Homan concludes not only that the version in Thomas is independent, but that it does indeed permit us to recover <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> parable.” These examples provide evidence that Crossan’s theory may be accurate when he discusses an early dating of Thomas and the independent oral source.|$|E

2500|$|Several Israeli {{newspapers}} accused {{news outlets}} such as MSNBC, CNN, the BBC of having omitted key {{facts about the}} story, such as the Palestinian identity of the perpetrators and some were accused for having given credence to arguments justifying the attack.

CNN later changed the report and apologized, saying [...] "As a result of an editing mistake, <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> story appeared to call into question whether the Tel Aviv attack was an act of terrorism.
