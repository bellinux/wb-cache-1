40|$|Dynamometer {{performance}} of a South Coast Technology electric conversion of a Volkswagen (VW) Rabbit designated SCT- 8 was tested. The SCT- 8 vehicle was fitted with a transistorized chopper in the motor armature circuit to supplement the standard motor speed control via field weakening. The <b>armature</b> <b>chopper</b> allowed speed control below the motor base speed. This low speed control was intended to reduce energy loss at idle during stop-and-go traffic; to {{eliminate the need for}} using the clutch below base motor speed; and to improve the drivability. Test results indicate an improvement of about 3. 5 % in battery energy economy for the SAE J 227 a-D driving cycle and 6 % for the C-cycle with only a minor reduction in acceleration performance. A further reduction of about 6 % would be possible if provision were made for shutting down field power during the idle phases of the driving cycles. Drivability of the vehicle equipped with the <b>armature</b> <b>chopper</b> was significantly improved compared with the standard SCT Electric Rabbit...|$|E
40|$|The {{steady state}} test results on a {{breadboard}} {{version of the}} General Electric Near Term Electric Vehicle (ETV- 1) are discussed. The breadboard was built using exact duplicate vehicle propulsion system components with few exceptions. Full instrumentation was provided to measure individual component efficiencies. Tests were conducted on a 50 hp dynamometer in a road load simulator facility. Characterization of the propulsion system over {{the lower half of}} the speed-torque operating range has shown the system efficiency to be composed of a predominant motor loss plus a speed dependent transaxle loss. At the lower speeds with normal road loads the <b>armature</b> <b>chopper</b> loss is also a significant factor. At the conditions corresponding to a cycle for which the vehicle system was specifically designed, the efficiencies are near optimum...|$|E
40|$|The {{speed control}} of {{separately}} excited dc motor {{is carried out}} by varying the armature voltage for below rated speed and by varying field flux to achieve speed above the rated speed. This thesis presents the speed control methodology by varying <b>armature</b> voltage using <b>chopper</b> by providing control signal to the switches. Speed can be controlled from below and up to rated speed. The firing circuit of chopper receives signal from controller and variable voltage {{is given to the}} armature of dc motor according to the desired speed. There are two controllers we are using here one is speed controller and other is current controller. Both controllers are of proportional -integral type. The reason behind using PI type controller is it removes the delay and provide fast control. Now the simulation of model is done and analyzed in MATLAB (Simulink) under varying speed and torque condition...|$|R
