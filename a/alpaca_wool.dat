2500|$|Due to the {{successful}} manufacture of various alpaca cloths by Sir Titus Salt and other Bradford manufacturers, a great demand for <b>alpaca</b> <b>wool</b> arose, {{which could not be}} met by the native product. Apparently, the number of alpacas available never increased appreciably. Unsuccessful attempts were made to acclimatize alpaca in England, on the European continent and in Australia, and even to cross English breeds of sheep with alpaca. There is a cross between alpaca and llama—a true hybrid in every sense—producing a material placed upon the Liverpool market under the name [...] "Huarizo". Crosses between the alpaca and vicuña have not proved satisfactory, as the crosses that have produced offspring have a very short fleece, more characteristic of the vicuña. [...] Current attempts to cross these two breeds are underway at farms in the US. Alpacas are now being bred in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Germany and numerous other places.|$|E

40|$|Softness is {{a unique}} selling point for luxury fibres such as alpaca. However, {{there is very little}} {{objective}} data on the softness of animal fibres. This study first establishes that the resistance to compression (RtC) behaviour of <b>alpaca</b> and <b>wool</b> fibres is quite different, and that the RtC method {{can not be used to}} examine the softness of different animal fibres. It then reports a new method for evaluating fibre softness. This method is based on the measurement of the force required to pull a fibre bundle through a series of parallel pins. This force, reflecting the combined effect of fibre surface properties, fibre diameter and rigidity, can achieve reasonable discrimination between fibres of varying levels of softness, such as <b>alpaca</b> and <b>wool.</b> Mechanisms responsible for the superior softness of alpaca fibres are discussed also. <br /...|$|R

5000|$|It {{is during}} his trips {{in the north}} of Chile and Peru that Octavio Pizarro got {{interested}} in <b>Alpaca</b> <b>wool</b> and its blending with other material. This traditional material in link with his cultural roots will then be the object of his aesthetic researches. He {{is one of the first}} fashion designers to use it for his creations. He discovered two ways to work the wool: handmade in order to enhance the authentic aspect of traditional work around wool; and using Jacquard and incrustation to skilfully sculpt the body with perfect finishing touches. He likes playing around with the contrast between material and techniques. He is looking for « mixing the extremes ». Thus, we can see <b>Alpaca</b> <b>wool</b> incrusted with Swarovski crystals, the mix between leather and fur.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} latest {{research}} into <b>alpaca</b> and <b>wool</b> fibres. In particular, those properties that have received little attention in research literature have been examined. They include single fibre abrasion and bending fatigue, single fibre tensile properties, as well as resistance to compression behaviour. These properties are important because they affect the softness and pilling propensity of these fibres and the resultant fabrics. Clean <b>wool</b> and <b>alpaca</b> fibres were used in this study. Fibre abrasion/bending fatigue measurements were carried out using a Textechno FIBRESTRESS instrument. The resistance to compression (RtC) tests were carried out according to Australian Standard AS 3535 - 1988. The results indicate that <b>wool</b> and <b>alpaca</b> fibres behave quite differently, even though both fibre types are of animal origin. Wool fibre resistance to compression decreases as fibre diameter increases while the opposite appears to occur for alpaca fibres. For both <b>wool</b> and <b>alpaca</b> the number of abrasion/bending cycles at fibre break increases {{with an increase in}} fibre diameter, it takes longer to break the alpaca fibres. Reasons for these differences have been postulated based on differences in fibre surface and structure between <b>alpaca</b> and <b>wool.</b> <br /...|$|R
40|$|Softness is an {{important}} property of textile fibers, and animal fibers in particular. At present, there is no reliable method for objectively evaluating fiber softness. This paper examines a simple technique of such evaluations by pulling a bundle of parallel fibers {{through a series of}} pins.

Yet for wool fibers, the correlation between resistance to compression and curvature is very strong and positive. The differences in fiber curvature and scale profiles of <b>alpaca</b> and <b>wool,</b> together with the test method for resistance to compression, may explain their different resistances to compression...|$|R

5000|$|He {{became an}} expert in <b>alpaca</b> <b>wool,</b> and in 1842 began {{business}} as a dealer in South American products. In 1847 he was grazing sheep and cattle half-way between Tacna and La Paz, and in 1852 went to Sydney to inquire into the possibility of introducing the alpaca into Australia. He returned to South America and by 1859 had brought several hundred alpacas to Sydney. This was a hazardous and difficult business as the export of alpacas was forbidden. Ledger was paid £15,000 for his alpacas and given a position in charge of them. The attempt to acclimatize alpacas in Australia ended in failure, but Ledger was not at fault.|$|E

Once they had amassed 5 kg of white wool, they could proceed to the automation line and hand it over to a staff member. After a brief walking tour of the factory, teams would pick up a spool of thread made from <b>alpaca</b> <b>wool.</b> They would have to stand together and wrap the wool around themselves continually until all of the wool was off of the spool, revealing an image of a race flag.

5000|$|Originally the {{car coat}} was more usually termed 'motoring dress'. It {{emerged in the}} early 1900s, when driving was {{considered}} an outdoor sport (most cars were open top) and required protective clothing. Clothing {{for men and women}} and for driver and passenger was relatively similar, comprising a long heavy coat. This was often in fur or lined with fur, although sometimes it was in heavy cloth. In summer, women would wear a duster coat, sometimes called a dust coat, to cover their garments, in a cloth such as linen or <b>alpaca</b> <b>wool.</b> This would be accessorised with gloves, goggles and a hat - women often wore elaborate hats and veils, while men would wear a cap. These accessories were worn year round. Motoring was still an activity for the elite, however the privations of driving in a vehicle that broke down frequently and provided no retreat from the elements, meant clothing had to be functional and warm. Sports motorist Dorothy Levitt - author of the 1909 handbook The Woman and the Car and dubbed 'the fastest woman on earth' for her 'scorching' (speeding) antics round tracks such as Brooklands - provided useful tips for women drivers on what to wear, along with guidance about the mechanical aspects of driving. On choosing the right coat, she said: [...] "Under no circumstance wear lace or fluffy adjuncts to your toilet. There is nothing like a thick frieze, homespun or tweed coat lined with fur. Do not heed the cry, 'nothing like leather.' Leather coats do not wear gracefully." ...|$|E

For a high ratio of alpaca component in the blend, a high-crimp wool should be used to achieve good sliver cohesion. <br /...|$|R
