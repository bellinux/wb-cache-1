5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), <b>allogeneic</b> stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 and 2008, a man (Timothy Ray Brown) was {{cured of}} HIV by {{repeated}} {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (see also <b>allogeneic</b> stem cell transplantation, <b>allogeneic</b> bone marrow transplantation, allotransplantation) with double-delta-32 mutation which disables the CCR5 receptor. This cure was accepted by the medical community in 2011. It required complete ablation of existing bone marrow, which is very debilitating.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, <b>allogeneic</b> {{bone marrow}} {{transplantation}} may be appropriate for high-risk or relapsed patients.|$|E
25|$|Transfusion of <b>allogeneic</b> whole blood, or of its {{constituents}} of red cells, white cells, platelets or plasma.|$|E
25|$|Graft versus host disease after <b>allogeneic</b> {{bone marrow}} {{transplantation}} may manifest as dry mouth and many small mucoceles.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{donation}} {{strictly for}} purpose of further fractionation of red cells, white cells, platelets or plasma for either <b>allogeneic</b> or autologous transfusion.|$|E
25|$|Mortality for <b>allogeneic</b> {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} {{can be estimated}} using the prediction model created by Sorror et al., using the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI). The HCT-CI was derived and validated by investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA). The HCT-CI modifies and adds to a well-validated comorbidity index, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (Charlson et al.) The CCI was previously applied to patients undergoing <b>allogeneic</b> HCT but appears to provide less survival prediction and discrimination than the HCT-CI scoring system.|$|E
25|$|High-dose (10mg/day) NET {{has been}} {{associated}} with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and because of this adverse effect, NET should not be given to patients undergoing <b>allogeneic</b> bone marrow transplantation, as it {{has been associated}} with substantially lower one-year survival post-transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Bone marrow transplants {{have proven}} {{effective}} in children. Bone marrow transplants {{are the only}} known cure for SCD. However, bone marrow transplants are difficult to obtain because of the specific HLA typing necessary. Ideally, a close relative (<b>allogeneic)</b> would donate the bone marrow necessary for transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other organs, {{bone marrow}} cells can be frozen (cryopreserved) for {{prolonged}} periods without damaging too many cells. This {{is a necessity}} with autologous HSC because the cells must be harvested from the recipient months {{in advance of the}} transplant treatment. In the case of <b>allogeneic</b> transplants, fresh HSC are preferred in order to avoid cell loss that might occur during the freezing and thawing process. <b>Allogeneic</b> cord blood is stored frozen at a cord blood bank because it is only obtainable at the time of childbirth. To cryopreserve HSC, a preservative, DMSO, must be added, and the cells must be cooled very slowly in a controlled-rate freezer to prevent osmotic cellular injury during ice crystal formation. HSC may be stored for years in a cryofreezer, which typically uses liquid nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{graft-versus-host disease}} may also develop after <b>allogeneic</b> transplant. It {{is the major}} source of late treatment-related complications, {{although}} it less often results in death. In addition to inflammation, chronic graft-versus-host disease may lead to the development of fibrosis, or scar tissue, similar to scleroderma; it may cause functional disability and require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Allogeneic</b> cells {{come from}} the body of a donor of the same species. While there are some ethical {{constraints}} to the use of human cells for in vitro studies, the employment of dermal fibroblasts from human foreskin has been demonstrated to be immunologically safe and thus a viable choice for tissue engineering of skin.|$|E
25|$|In a more advanced, {{uncontrolled}} state, {{when the}} patient cannot tolerate imatinib, or if the patient wishes to attempt a permanent cure, then an <b>allogeneic</b> bone marrow transplantation may be performed. This procedure involves high-dose chemotherapy and radiation followed by infusion of bone marrow from a compatible donor. Approximately 30% of patients die from this procedure.|$|E
25|$|Patient-side {{autologous}} {{therapy in}} the US {{is subject to}} change. New guidance issued (FDA#218 Guidance for Industry - Cell-Based Products for Animal Use) will likely require stem cell therapy to be produced via cGMP. Resources required to implement these changes may change the US veterinary stem cell industry more towards a hub and spoke approach or towards <b>allogeneic</b> therapy, and away from patient-side therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Allogeneic</b> {{bone marrow}} {{transplantation}} is the only cure, but has significant rates of additional medical problems and death. The monoclonal antibody eculizumab reduces the need for blood transfusions and improves {{quality of life for}} those affected by PNH. Treatment with eculizumab does not appear to change the risk of death or the incidence of blood clots and is very costly. Eculizumab costs at least $440,000 for a single year of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis in HSCT {{varies widely}} {{dependent}} upon disease type, stage, stem cell source, HLA-matched status (for <b>allogeneic</b> HSCT) and conditioning regimen. A transplant offers {{a chance for}} cure or long-term remission if the inherent complications of graft versus host disease, immuno-suppressive treatments and the spectrum of opportunistic infections can be survived. In recent years, survival rates have been gradually improving across almost all populations and sub-populations receiving transplants.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} gentler {{conditioning}} regimens, these transplants {{are associated with}} a lower risk of transplant-related mortality and therefore allow patients who are considered too high-risk for conventional <b>allogeneic</b> HSCT to undergo potentially curative therapy for their disease. The optimal conditioning strategy for each disease and recipient has not been fully established, but RIC can be used in elderly patients unfit for myeloablative regimens, for whom a higher risk of cancer relapse may be acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The assays for ROTEM {{analysis}} {{help to get}} a rapid {{differentiation between}} various potential haemostasis defects or anticoagulant drug effects and allow for a rapid differential diagnosis. They form the base for selecting a therapeutic strategy. Several diagnostic algorithms have been proposed and were clinically validated. Application of this strategy helps to minimize the exposure of patients to <b>allogeneic</b> blood products which have certain risks; and it saves costs. Numerous research applications have used the technique as well.|$|E
25|$|The only {{curative}} treatment for CML is {{a bone marrow}} transplant or an <b>allogeneic</b> stem cell transplant. Other than this there are four major mainstays of treatment in CML: treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, myelosuppressive or leukopheresis therapy (to counteract the leukocytosis during early treatment), splenectomy and interferon alfa-2b treatment. Due to the high median age of patients with CML it is relatively rare for CML to be seen in pregnant women, despite this, however, chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with Interferon-alpha hormones.|$|E
25|$|This {{condition}} is either inherited {{or it is}} acquired through the infusion of <b>allogeneic</b> hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel anastomoses. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via in vitro fertilisation. Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line {{gave rise to the}} ovaries or testes; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.|$|E
25|$|A newer {{treatment}} approach, non-myeloablative <b>allogeneic</b> transplantation, also termed reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), uses {{doses of}} chemotherapy and radiation {{too low to}} eradicate all the bone marrow cells of the recipient. Instead, non-myeloablative transplants run lower risks of serious infections and transplant-related mortality while relying upon the graft versus tumor effect to resist the inherent increased risk of cancer relapse. Also significantly, while requiring high doses of immunosuppressive agents {{in the early stages}} of treatment, these doses are less than for conventional transplants. This leads to a state of mixed chimerism early after transplant where both recipient and donor HSC coexist in the bone marrow space.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with CLL, it is incurable by present {{treatment}}s, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than totally and permanently eliminating it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone. The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier patients may choose <b>allogeneic</b> or autologous bone marrow transplantation {{in the hope of}} a permanent cure.|$|E
25|$|Blood transfusions {{typically}} use {{sources of}} blood: one's own (autologous transfusion), or someone else's (<b>allogeneic</b> or homologous transfusion). The latter {{is much more}} common than the former. Using another's blood must first start with donation of blood. Blood is most commonly donated as whole blood intravenously and collecting it with an anticoagulant. In developed countries, donations are usually anonymous to the recipient, but products in a blood bank are always individually traceable through the whole cycle of donation, testing, separation into components, storage, and administration to the recipient. This enables management and investigation of any suspected transfusion related disease transmission or transfusion reaction. In developing countries the donor is sometimes specifically recruited by or for the recipient, typically a family member, and the donation occurs immediately before the transfusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemotherapy}} or irradiation given immediately {{prior to}} a transplant is called the conditioning regimen, the purpose {{of which is to}} help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ablated (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In <b>allogeneic</b> transplants a combination of cyclophosphamide with total body irradiation is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an immunosuppressive effect that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's immune system. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease that may be life-threatening. However, in certain leukemias this can coincide with protection against cancer relapse owing to the graft-versus-tumor effect. Autologous transplants may also use similar conditioning regimens, but many other chemotherapy combinations can be used {{depending on the type of}} disease.|$|E
25|$|A known {{relationship}} between intra-operative blood transfusion and cancer recurrence {{has been established}} in colorectal cancer. In lung cancer intra-operative blood transfusion has been associated with earlier recurrence of cancer, worse survival rates and poorer outcomes after lung resection. Also studies shown to us, failure of the immune system caused by blood transfusion can be categorized as one of the main factors leading to more than 10 different cancer types that are fully associated with blood transfusion and the innate and adaptive immune system. <b>Allogeneic</b> blood transfusion, through five major mechanisms including the lymphocyte-T set, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), natural killer cells (NKCs), and dendritic cells (DCs) can help the recipient’s defense mechanisms. On the other hand, the role for each of the listed items includes activation of the antitumor CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+/CTL), temporal inactivation of Tregs, inactivation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, the use of bacteria to enhance the antitumor immune response and cellular Immunotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation). Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment) patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of herpetic infection in seropositive patients. The immunosuppressive agents employed in <b>allogeneic</b> transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E
25|$|The first living related renal {{transplant}} {{was performed}} in China in 1972; the first <b>allogeneic</b> bone marrow transplantation was successfully executed in an acute leukaemia patient. The first recorded clinical liver transplant from a living donor in China took place in 1995, seven years after the world's first {{was performed in}} Sao Paulo, Brazil. Between January 2001 and October 2003, 45 patients received living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) at five different hospitals. In 2002, doctors at Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University described three cases of living related liver transplantation. In 2003 a landmark brain-death case involving switched off ventilation {{came to the attention}} of the public and made a big impact on medical ethics and legislation. The first successful brain-death organ donation soon followed. From October 2003 to July 2006, 52 LDLT operations were conducted at the West China Hospital, West China Medical Center of Sichuan University. In October 2004, Peking University People's Hospital Liver Transplantation Center executed two cases of living related liver transplantation involving complex blood vessel anatomy. In 2002, the Chinese media reported surgeon Dr Zheng Wei successfully transplanted a whole ovary at the Zhejiang Medical Science University to a 34-year-old patient, Tang Fangfang, from her sister. In April 2006, the Xijing military hospital in Xian carried out a face transplant operation covering the cheek, upper lip, and nose of Li Guoxing, who was mauled by an Asiatic black bear while protecting his sheep.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{for other}} cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia, the reduced {{mortality}} of the autogenous relative to <b>allogeneic</b> HSCT may be outweighed by an increased likelihood of cancer relapse and related mortality, {{and therefore the}} <b>allogeneic</b> treatment may be preferred for those conditions.|$|E
2500|$|... {{there were}} at least two commercialized <b>allogeneic</b> cell therapies, Prochymal and Cartistem.|$|E
2500|$|Graft-versus-tumor effect (GVT) or [...] "graft versus leukemia" [...] {{effect is}} the {{beneficial}} {{aspect of the}} Graft-versus-Host phenomenon. For example, HSCT patients with either acute, or in particular chronic, graft-versus-host disease after an <b>allogeneic</b> transplant {{tend to have a}} lower risk of cancer relapse. This is due to a therapeutic immune reaction of the grafted donor T lymphocytes against the diseased bone marrow of the recipient. This lower rate of relapse accounts for the increased success rate of <b>allogeneic</b> transplants, compared to transplants from identical twins, and indicates that <b>allogeneic</b> HSCT is a form of immunotherapy. GVT is the major benefit of transplants that do not employ the highest immuno-suppressive regimens.|$|E
2500|$|To {{limit the}} risks of transplanted stem cell {{rejection}} or of severe graft-versus-host disease in <b>allogeneic</b> HSCT, the donor should preferably have the same human leukocyte antigens (HLA) as the recipient. About 25 to 30 percent of <b>allogeneic</b> HSCT recipients have an HLA-identical sibling. Even so-called [...] "perfect matches" [...] may have mismatched minor alleles that contribute to graft-versus-host disease.|$|E

2500|$|Voriconazole is used {{to treat}} {{invasive}} aspergillosis and candidiasis and fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients, including people undergoing <b>allogeneic</b> bone marrow transplant (BMT), who have [...] hematologic cancers or who undergo organ transplants.|$|E
2500|$|Allogeneics HSCT {{involves}} two people: the (healthy) donor and the (patient) recipient. <b>Allogeneic</b> HSC donors {{must have}} a tissue (HLA) type that matches the recipient. Matching is performed {{on the basis of}} variability at three or more loci of the HLA gene, and a perfect match at these loci is preferred. Even if there is a good match at these critical alleles, the recipient will require immunosuppressive medications to mitigate graft-versus-host disease. <b>Allogeneic</b> transplant donors may be related (usually a closely HLA matched sibling), syngeneic (a monozygotic or 'identical' twin of the patient - necessarily extremely rare since few patients have an identical twin, but offering a source of perfectly HLA matched stem cells) or [...] unrelated (donor who is not related and found to have [...] very close degree of HLA matching). Unrelated donors may be found through a registry of bone marrow donors such as the National Marrow Donor Program. People who would like to be tested for a specific family member or friend without joining any of the bone marrow registry data banks may contact a private HLA testing laboratory and be tested with a mouth swab to see if they are a potential match. [...] A [...] "savior sibling" [...] may be intentionally selected by preimplantation genetic diagnosis in order to match a child both regarding HLA type and being free of any obvious inheritable disorder. <b>Allogeneic</b> transplants are also performed using umbilical cord blood as the source of stem cells. [...] In general, by transfusing healthy stem cells to the recipient's bloodstream to reform a healthy immune system, <b>allogeneic</b> HSCTs appear to improve chances for cure or long-term remission once the immediate transplant-related complications are resolved.|$|E
2500|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) is the transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. It may be autologous (the patient's own {{stem cells are}} used), <b>allogeneic</b> (the stem cells come from a donor) or syngeneic (from an identical twin).|$|E
2500|$|An event where donors come {{to donate}} <b>allogeneic</b> blood is {{sometimes}} called a '' or a 'blood donor session'. [...] These can occur at a blood bank, but they are often set up at a location in the community such as a shopping center, workplace, school, or house of worship.|$|E
