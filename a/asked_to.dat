5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought. Multiple {{studies have shown that}} thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> answer without thinking, but no effects in those <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> think. This points to the effect being the result of {{an automatic}} process.|$|E
