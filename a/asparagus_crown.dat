40|$|We {{analyzed}} <b>Asparagus</b> <b>crown</b> gall tissues transformed with A. tumefaciens C 58 and C 58 C 1 (pTiB 6 S 3) {{and selected}} for hormone autotrophic growth. No increased IAA levels {{were observed in}} the Asparagus tumor lines notwithstanding the presence of all three T-DNA one genes. The en-dogenous cytokinin levels indicate that <b>Asparagus</b> <b>crown</b> gall is dependent on enhanced zeatin riboside equivalent levels for its growth. We conclude that phytohormone autotrophic growth of <b>Asparagus</b> <b>crown</b> gall tissue seems only to be dependent upon an active gene 4, inducing enhanced cytokinin levels. Moreover, {{the presence of an}} active gene 1 seems to be lethal as was indicated by the absence of tryptophan- 2 -mono-oxygenase activity in transformed tissues and the toxicity of exogenously supplied indole- 3 -acetamide (IAM) or naphthalene- 1 -acetamide (NAM) as a substitute for an active gene 1.

40|$|Considering the {{economic}} importance of asparagus as a crop {{and the historical}} association of Fusarium spp. as a principal cause of stand decline of this crop, a study was conducted from 1995 - 1997 in Southern California and Northern Mexico. The main objectives were to determine the causal agent of <b>asparagus</b> <b>crown</b> rot and the study the etiology of the causal agents which affects asparagus spears in these two important growing regions. Asparagus crowns exhibiting symptoms of crown decay were selected {{from each of the}} above production regions and processed in the laboratory. Based on morphological characteristics, F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum were the dominant species isolated from crowns. F. proliferatum produced mono and polyphialides and conidia in long chains. F. oxysporum was distinguished by the production of chlamydospore and conidia not produced in chains. Both species were recovered from marketable spears with an incidence ranged from 20 - 90 %. Pathogenicity test on asparagus seedlings with isolates of F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum obtained from spears were positive. To determine the source of spear infection in commercial asparagus plantings, crowns and spears were collected from two fields in the Imperial Valley of California. Both F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum were recovered from crown tissues and from spears. However, F. proliferatum was the most prevalent species of Fusarium isolated from both spears and crowns. Evaluation of the influence of Fusarium species on quality characters of marketable asparagus was also studied. The quality of marketable spears infected with F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum was found to decrease significantly as the length of storage increased from five to ten days and as temperature of storage was increased from 5 C to 26 C. Since some species of Fusarium are known to produce fumonisins (a mycotoxin), and investigation of the possible presence of fumonisins in commercial asparagus spears was conducted. Spears were obtained from two different geographic regions of Mexico and two in California. Spear samples naturally colonized by Fusarium spp. were analyzed for fumonisin B 1, B 2 and B 3. No detectable levels of fumonisin, regardless of geographic location of samples, were founded...|$|E

40|$|Objectives of {{our study}} were to {{quantify}} the effects of apical dominance and bud cluster activity on asparagus yield patterns and to collect data for process-oriented modeling of the asparagus crop. Plants were grown in 40 L containers. After four years the soil above the <b>asparagus</b> <b>crowns</b> was removed and the containers were placed in a growth chamber at 20 °C for three months. During this time, spear length was measured daily except at weekends, and spears were cut when longer than 25 cm. Each spear was assigned to a bud cluster, defined as a dense group of buds clearly distinct from other bud groups on the crown. Although temperature was constant, several properties measured in this study changed during the experiment. The number of active bud clusters first increased then decreased, the lag time between spears growing at the same cluster increased, and the relative growth rate of spears decreased. The constant increase of harvested spears per plant stopped abruptly when the plants ran out of viable buds. At the crop level, i. e. the average for all plants, which is normally monitored in field trials, the transition from linear yield increase to zero increase was less abrupt since plants stopped growing spears on different dates. In our study asparagus yield, i. e. the number of harvested spears, was not limited by low carbohydrate in storage roots, but {{by a lack of}} viable buds. This was concluded from the abrupt halt in spear production observed in all plants despite the fact that some plants still had considerable carbohydrate content...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a forcing culture system for <b>asparagus</b> using one-year-old <b>crowns,</b> the influences of cultivar, seed germination, crown size, soil temperature, male and female plants and the period of cold storage {{in relation to the}} date of bud sprouting and yield of spears were investigated. 'Hidel' spear yield was the highest among the five clutivars examined. Seed germination with sulphuric acid or polyethylene glycol treatment was rapid. The difference between yield from big crowns (mean weight: 800 g) and medium crowns (600 g) was not significant;however,small crowns(400 g) were not suitable for forced culture. The ratio of unmarketable spears was higher at a soil temperature of 25 ℃ than 20 ℃. Neither the ratio {{of the total number of}} spears to crown weight nor of spear yield to crown weight was significantly different between male and female plants. The number and yield of spears were not significantly affected by the length of the crown storage periods. 1987 年 4 月、著者は京都大学農学部を卒業し、京都大学農学部附属農場に助手として赴任した。農場では蔬菜部に配属され、蔬菜園芸学の研究を中心に行ってきた。 1993 年 11 月、岡山大学農学部に転任するまでに農場では’メロン果実の単為的結果に及ぼす植物生長調節物質の影響’、’大果系イチゴの奇形果発生に関する研究’、’合成サイトカイニンによるトマトの空洞果抑制に関する研究’、’アスパラガスの 1 年生株を用いた促成栽培に関する研究’等の研究を行ってきた。その中から私が特に興味を示し、力を入れ研究を行ってきたアスパラガスに関する研究について紹介しようと思う。現在、岡山大学では作物発育調節学研究室（旧花卉研究室）にて、種子系、栄養系花卉のセル成型苗の苗生産に関する研究という大きな研究テーマを与えられ奮闘努力している毎日である。花卉園芸学の分野ではまだ 1 年生であるため、現在の進行状況と今後の研究目的について簡略に紹介しようと思う...|$|R
40|$|In North America, {{asparagus}} (Asparagus officinalis) production {{suffers from}} a crown and root rot disease mainly caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi and F. proliferatum. Many other Fusarium species are also found in asparagus fields, whereas accurate detection and identification of these organisms, especially when processing numerous samples, is usually difficult and time consuming. In this study, a PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method was developed to assess Fusarium species diversity in asparagus plant samples. Fusarium-specific PCR primers targeting a partial region of the translation elongation factor- 1 alpha (EF- 1 alpha) gene were designed, and their specificity was tested against genomic DNA extracted from a large collection of closely and distantly related organisms isolated from multiple environments. Amplicons of 450 bp were obtained from all Fusarium isolates, while no PCR product was obtained from non-Fusarium organisms. The ability of DGGE to discriminate between Fusarium taxa was tested over 19 different Fusarium species represented by 39 isolates, including most species previously reported from asparagus fields worldwide. The technique was effective to visually discriminate between the majority of Fusarium species and/or isolates tested in pure culture, while a further sequencing step permitted {{to distinguish between the}} few species showing similar migration patterns. Total genomic DNA was extracted from field-grown asparagus plants naturally infested with different Fusarium species, submitted to PCR amplification, DGGE analysis and sequencing. The two to four bands observed for each plant sample were all affiliated with F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum or F. solani, clearly supporting the reliability, sensitivity and specificity of this approach for the study of Fusarium diversity from asparagus plants samples.

40|$|Fusarium oxysporum (Fo), F. proliferatum (Fp) and F. solani (Fs) are causal agents {{associated}} with roots of <b>asparagus</b> affected by <b>crown</b> and root rot, a disease inflicting serious losses worldwide. The propagule viability of Fusarium spp. was determined on substrate artificially infested with Fo 5, Fp 3 or Fs 2 isolates, amended with either poultry manure (PM), its pellet (PPM), or olive residue compost (ORC) and, thereafter, incubated at 30 or 35 °C for different periods. Inoculum viability was significantly affected by these organic amendments (OAs) {{in combination with}} temperature and incubation period. The greatest reduction in viability of Fo 5 and Fs 2 occurred with PPM and loss of viability achieved was higher at 35 °C than at 30 ºC, and longer incubation period (45 days). However, the viability of Fp 3 did not decrease greatly {{in most of the}} treatments, as compared to the infested and un-amended control, when incubated at 30 ºC. After incubation, seedlings of asparagus `Grande´ were transplanted into pots containing substrates infested with the different species of Fusarium. After three months in greenhouse, symptoms severity in roots showed highly significant decreases, but Fp 3 caused lower severity than Fo 5 and Fs 2. Severity reduction was particularly high at 30 ºC (by 15 days incubation for Fs 2 and by 30 - 45 days for Fo 5), after PPM treatment, as well as PM- 2 % for Fo 5 and Fs 2 incubated during 30 and 45 days at both temperatures, and with ORC (15 - 30 days incubation). Moreover, assessment of plants fresh weight showed significantly high increases in Fo 5 and Fs 2, with some rates of the three OAs tested, depending on incubation period and temperature. </p...|$|R
