40|$|Inadvertent {{exposure}} of sensitive data {{is a major}} concern for potential cloud customers. Much focus has been on other data leakage vectors, such as side channel attacks, while issues of data disposal and <b>assured</b> deletion have not received enough attention to date. However, data that is not properly destroyed may lead to unintended disclosures, in turn, resulting in heavy financial penalties and reputational damage. In non-cloud contexts, issues of incomplete deletion are well understood. To the best of our knowledge, to date, there has been no systematic analysis of <b>assured</b> deletion challenges in public clouds. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by analysing <b>assured</b> deletion requirements for the cloud, identifying cloud features that pose a threat to <b>assured</b> deletion, and describing various <b>assured</b> deletion challenges. Based on this discussion, we identify future challenges for research in this area and propose an initial <b>assured</b> deletion architecture for cloud settings. Altogether, our work offers a systematization of requirements and challenges of <b>assured</b> deletion in the cloud, and a well-founded reference point for future research in developing new solutions to <b>assured</b> deletion...|$|R

40|$|By juxtaposing five western states’ {{existing}} <b>assured</b> supply laws, this Article {{provides a}} preliminary assessment of whether, and how, <b>assured</b> supply laws can best promote sustainability—and, by extension, {{make at least}} one area of environmental law more like sustainability law. The Article reaches three principal conclusions. First, it finds that, as they appear to, <b>assured</b> supply laws in fact promote sustainability. Second, {{the extent to which}} <b>assured</b> supply laws likely promote sustainability greatly varies by state, because these laws’ policy designs also depend on the state of enactment. Finally, additional work is needed to provide a more concrete assessment of how effective <b>assured</b> supply laws are, both in general and in the context of sustainability. The Article proceeds in three parts. Part I briefly introduces <b>assured</b> supply laws, including how they function, rationales offered for their adoption, and their apparent benefits and costs. Part II places these laws in a sustainability context, attempting to reformulate how we think of <b>assured</b> supply laws from a sustainability, rather than a traditional environmental, vantage. Part III concludes by contrasting five state regimes through the lens of a possible model for sustainability law. Part III shows that <b>assured</b> supply design very much matters for how well the laws promote sustainability...|$|R
