He looked like Rupert of Hentzau, and had all of that worthy's cold, sinister resolution about everything that he did." ...|$|E
500|$|The 20th Party Congress {{opened on}} 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates {{to rise in}} honor of the {{communist}} leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda. In {{the early morning hours of}} 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the [...] "Secret Speech" [...] to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the [...] "congress listened to me in silence. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> you could have heard a pin drop.

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of modern science, the main obstacle {{to the evolution of}} speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is that symbols— arbitrary associations of sounds with corresponding meanings— are unreliable and may well be false. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> [...] "words are cheap". The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.|$|E

"Having labored now twenty years, {{the best}} ones of my life, in {{dispensing}} at retail, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> at the demand of everyone, that little talent in my profession that God and my own efforts have given me, my desires would truly be to obtain enough leisure and quiet as would enable me before I die to complete three great works that I have in hand {{in order to be}} able to publish them, perhaps with some praise for me and for whoever has helped me in the business. ... It is not possible to receive a salary from a Republic, however splendid and generous, without serving the public, because to get something from the public one must satisfy it and not just one particular person; and while I remain able to teach and to serve, no one can exempt me from the burden while leaving me the income; and in sum I cannot hope for such a benefit from anyone but an absolute prince." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{propensity}} {{theory of}} probability was given by Charles Sanders Peirce. A later propensity theory was proposed by philosopher Karl Popper, who had only slight acquaintance with the writings of C.S. Peirce, however. Popper noted that {{the outcome of a}} physical experiment is produced by a certain set of [...] "generating conditions". [...] When we repeat an experiment, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions. [...] To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity p of producing the outcome E means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which E occurred with limiting relative frequency p. [...] For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. [...] In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely indeterministic experiments.|$|E
5000|$|Girls {{also had}} a form of state {{education}} involving dance, gymnastics and other sports; together with other subjects such as music and poetry, including writing and war education. Traits such as grace and culture were frowned upon in favor of high physical fitness and moral integrity. The girls were also encouraged to help the males by humiliating them in public and by criticizing their exercising. Just as Spartan males were raised to become warriors, the females of Sparta were trained for their primary task: giving birth to warriors; <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>went,</b> [...] "only Spartan women could give birth to men." [...] Encouraged {{to be strong and}} healthy, girls participated in athletic competitions, running footraces in off-the-shoulder chitons.|$|R

Dirk complied, though with an ill grace, but so pleasant did Montalvo make himself during those few minutes, that before he ushered {{him back to the}} company in some way Dirk found himself convinced that this particular Spaniard was not, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>went,</b> [...] "as black as his mustachios." [...] He felt almost sure too, although he had not yet found time to tell him the details of it, that there was some excellent reason to account for his having carried off the adorable Lysbeth during an entire afternoon and evening.|$|R
5000|$|Tony Travers of the London School of Economics {{commented on}} the policy debacle:What remains to be {{explained}} is why a politician who had hitherto shown such brilliant populist sensitivity should destroy herself with a tax reform which inflicted terrible damage on {{millions of people who}} had been in the front line of the Thatcher Revolution ... Either the government failed to understand what most research and many commentators were saying, or they did understand it and believed that they could, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>went,</b> [...] "tough it out". A third possibility is that ministers came to understand the electoral damage ahead, but were afraid to put the case strongly enough to a Prime Minister at the helm of her [...] "flagship".|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Ui Fidgenti circa 377 a.d., there were few significant changes in political control until the arrival of the Vikings in the 9th century, which ultimately brought about {{the establishment}} of the city on an island on the River Shannon in 922. The death of Domnall Mór Ua Briain, King of Munster in 1194 resulted in the invading Normans taking control of Limerick, and in 1210, the County of Limerick was formally established as Ui Fidgenti lands were granted to what would become the Fitzgerald dynasty. [...] Over time, the Normans became [...] "more Irish than the Irish themselves" [...] <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>goes.</b> The Tudors in England wanted to curb the power of these Gaelicised Norman Rulers and centralise all power in their hands, so they established colonies of English in the county. Distrust by England of the leading Fitzgerald families, and the execution of the several of the Fitzgeralds of Kildare, precipitated a revolt against English Rule in 1569. Th resultant savage war in Munster, known as the Desmond Rebellions, laid waste to the province, and ended with confiscation of the vast estates of the Geraldines and other Irish families that had participated in the ten years of war.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the Great Depression, the {{fortunes}} of the theater seriously declined. The number of new plays on the traveling theater tryout circuit was reduced dramatically. There were not enough plays to keep the theater running full time. Empty seats in thee theater and an increasing number of nights without a show to present forced the theater managers to book other sorts of entertainment unlike those they had run before. As a result, Boxing matches and appearances by marginal entertainers such as Busty Russell and Ding Dong Bell, that suggested their talents were more physical than strictly theatrical, were considered all it was good for. Prize fights and burlesque strip shows {{may not have been the}} most decorous forms of entertainment, but they “filled <b>the</b> hall,” <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> <b>went,</b> and paid <b>the</b> rent. However, by the end of World War II, it seemed that the Lyric Theater had its best days behind it.|$|R

5000|$|Bassal {{was named}} with Jacques Garnier de Saintes {{on the first}} mission in the Jura, the Ain, the Côte d'Or and Doubs by decree of 18 June 1793, to quell unrest and purify the authorities.

6000|$|He {{was not a}} hypocrite--in that Britt was mistaken. He was {{by nature}} deeply religious. His soul aspired, at times, to high things. He was {{sympathetic}} to actual pain, and had always been morbidly in awe of death. The sight of any poor, lost, and suffering man threw him into instant, profound, and melancholy pity. A dead beetle in the road, a fly caught in a spider's web, a young robin water-soaked and bedraggled, appalled him, even as a boy, and he pondered them with sad and questioning eyes long after his young companions had forgotten them. Where had the light of their eyes fled? he asked himself. He found no sport in killing any creature, and more than once he used all his slender force to defend a cat from stoning; and yet {{he was known to}} have joined the worst youths of his native town in secret drinking-bouts, thereby acquiring the reputation of a liar and sneak, {{as well as that of}} licentiate.
