25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not {{know what was going on}} with their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley.

What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

The officer refused, saying that Daho Mona's hands were soiled with blood from the slaughtered animals. Daho Mona attempted to take hold of the officer, insisting he participate, and the officer struck him with his stick. Fighting ensued, and the officer was injured. Chief Mona Rudao attempted to apologize by presenting a flagon of wine at the officer's house, but was rejected.

25|$|Wassail is a hot, mulled punch often {{associated}} with Yuletide drunk from a 'wassailing bowl'. The earliest versions were warmed mead into which roasted crab apples were dropped and burst to create a drink called 'lambswool' drunk on Lammas day, still known in Shakespeare's time. Later, the drink evolved to become a mulled cider made with sugar, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, topped with slices of toast as sops <b>and</b> <b>drunk</b> from a large communal bowl. Modern recipes begin with a base of wine, fruit juice or mulled ale, sometimes with brandy or sherry added. Apples or oranges are often added to the mix, and some recipes also call for beaten eggs to be tempered into the drink. Great bowls turned from wood, pottery or tin often had many handles for shared drinking and highly decorated lids; antique examples can still be found in traditional pubs. Hence the first stanza of the traditional carol the Gloucestershire Wassail {{dating back to the}} Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Drops {{were not}} {{originally}} part of shogi. In the 13th century, shogi underwent an expansion, creating {{the game of}} dai shogi, played on a 15×15 board with many new pieces, including the independently invented rook, bishop and queen of modern Western chess, the drunk elephant that promotes to a second king, and also the even more powerful lion, which among other idiosyncracies {{has the power to}} move or capture twice per turn. Around the 14th or 15th centuries, the popularity of dai shogi then waned in favour of the smaller chu shogi, played on a smaller 12×12 board which removed the weakest pieces from dai shogi, similarly to the development of Courier chess in the West. In the meantime, the original 9×9 shogi, now termed sho shogi, continued to be played, but was regarded as less prestigious than chu shogi and dai shogi. Chu shogi was very popular in Japan, and the rook, bishop, <b>and</b> <b>drunk</b> elephant from it were added to sho shogi, where the first two remain today.|$|E
25|$|Six months later, when Genie was 20 months old, her {{paternal}} grandmother {{died in a}} hit-and-run traffic accident. Her death affected Genie's father far beyond normal levels of grief, and because his son had been walking with her he held his son responsible, further heightening his anger. When the truck's driver received only a probationary sentence for both manslaughter <b>and</b> <b>drunk</b> driving, he became delusional with rage. Scientists believed these events made him feel society had failed him and convinced him {{he would need to}} protect his family from the outside world, and that in doing so he lacked the self-awareness to recognize the destruction his actions caused. Because Genie's father believed Genie was severely mentally retarded he thought she needed additional protection from society, and therefore decided he needed to entirely hide her existence. He immediately quit his job and moved his family into his mother's two-bedroom house, where he insisted on leaving his mother's car and bedroom completely untouched as shrines to her, and further increased the family's isolation.|$|E
