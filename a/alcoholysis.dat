25|$|Si–C {{bonds are}} {{commonly}} formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often {{carried out in}} small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium, Grignard, or organoaluminium reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic copper as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, <b>alcoholysis,</b> and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.|$|E

5000|$|Sulfonic acids can be {{converted}} to esters. This class of organic compounds has the general formula R−SO2−OR.

50|$|Base-catalyzed {{transesterification}} {{is characterized}} by a negative activation volume (approx. −12 cm3/mol) and therefore it proceeds faster under high-pressure conditions. It has been shown that amine-catalyzed <b>alcoholysis</b> of sterically hindered esters (e.g. protecting groups, chiral auxiliaries) proceeds rapidly at room temperature under 10 kbar pressure, giving quantitative yields.|$|E
50|$|By {{controlling}} the stoichiometry and steric {{properties of the}} alkoxide, such reactions can be arrested leading to metal-oxy-alkoxides, which usually are oligonuclear complexes. Other alcohols can be employed in place of water. In this way one alkoxide {{can be converted to}} another, and the process is properly referred to as <b>alcoholysis</b> (unfortunately, there is an issue of terminology confusion with transesterification, a different process - see below). The position of the equilibrium can be controlled by the acidity of the alcohol; for example phenols typically react with alkoxides to release alcohols, giving the corresponding phenoxide. More simply, the <b>alcoholysis</b> can be controlled by selectively evaporating the more volatile component. In this way, ethoxides can be converted to butoxides, since ethanol (b.p. 78 °C) is more volatile than butanol (b.p. 118 °C).|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{production}} pathways {{can be used}} to create sarin. The final reaction typically involves attachment of the isopropoxy group to the phosphorus with an <b>alcoholysis</b> with isopropyl alcohol. Two variants of this process are common.

50|$|The nickel tetracarbonyl-catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of {{acetylene}} {{with carbon}} monoxide {{in the presence}} of methanol also yields methyl acrylate.

Both, the <b>alcoholysis</b> of propiolactone with methanol as well as the methanolysis of acrylonitrile via intermediately formed acrylamide sulfate are also proven but obsolete processes.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with other}} anhydrides, the <b>alcoholysis</b> {{reaction}} {{is the basis}} of the manufacture of phthalate esters, which are widely used (and controversial - see endocrine disruptor) plasticizers. [...] In the 1980s, approximately 6.5×109 kg of these esters were produced annually, and the scale of production was increasing each year, all from phthalic anhydride. The process begins with the reaction of phthalic anhydride with alcohols, giving the monoesters: ...|$|E
50|$|Alkyd {{coatings}} {{are produced}} in two processes; fatty acid {{process and the}} <b>alcoholysis</b> or mono-glyceride process. Higher quality, higher performance alkyds are produced in the fatty acid process where {{the composition of the}} resulting resin can be more precisely controlled. In this process an acid anhydride, a polyol, and an unsaturated fatty acid are combined and cooked together until the product has achieved a predetermined level of viscosity. Penta alkyds are made this way. More economical alkyd resins are produced from the <b>alcoholysis</b> or glyceride process where end product quality control is not as paramount. In this process raw vegetable oil, high in unsaturated component, is combined with additional polyol and heated to cause transesterification of the triglycerides into a mixture of mono- and diglyceride oils. To this resulting mixture acid anhydride is added to build the molecular weight of the resin into roughly the same product as in the fatty acid process. However, the <b>alcoholysis</b> process, also known as the glyceride process, produces a more randomly oriented structure. To remove the water produced as a by-product and to increase the reaction rate, surplus phthalic anhydride was added. Water was thus removed with the unreacted acid by heating the bulk to a temperature needed to do this. It meant that the reaction was not as controllable as would be desired. A new process was introduced, in which Xylene was added to produce an azeotrope with the water. This gave greater control at a lower temperature, this also produced resins at a lower viscosity, useful in making high solids paints; this process was known as the AZO process. In both cases the resulting product is a polyester resin to which pendant drying oil groups are attached. At the conclusion of both processes the resin is purified, diluted in solvent and sold to paint and varnish makers.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{transesterification}} process, metal alkoxides {{react with}} esters {{to bring about}} an exchange of alkyl groups between metal alkoxide and ester. With the metal alkoxide complex in focus, {{the result is the}} same as for <b>alcoholysis,</b> namely the replacement of alkoxide ligands, {{but at the same time}} the alkyl groups of the ester are changed, which can also be the primary goal of the reaction. Sodium methoxide, for example, is commonly used for this purpose, a reaction that is relevant to the production of [...] "bio-diesel." ...|$|E

50|$|Phosphate esters {{have the}} general {{structure}} P(=O)(OR)3 feature P(V). Such species are of technological importance as flame retardant agents, and plasticizers.

Phosphate ester are synthesized by <b>alcoholysis</b> of phosphorus oxychloride. A variety of mixed amido-alkoxo derivatives are known, one medically significant example being the anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide.
