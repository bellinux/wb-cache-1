40|$|Paddy {{fields are}} a major global {{anthropogenic}} source of methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O), which are very potent greenhouse gases. China has the second largest area under rice cultivation, so developing valid and reliable methods for reducing {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} while sustaining crop productivity in paddy fields is of paramount importance. We examined the effects of applying straw, a residual product of rice cultivation containing high amounts of carbon and nutrients, to rice crops during both an early crop season (5 April – 25 July 2012) and <b>a</b> <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> season (1 August – 6 November 2012) on CH₄ and N₂O emissions in a subtropical paddy field in southeastern China. CH₄ fluxes had two seasonal peaks, on 5 May and 28 June, in the early crop but only one peak, on 13 August, in the <b>late</b> <b>crop,</b> which could be attributed to the lower temperatures after the final tillering stage in the <b>late</b> <b>crop.</b> Straw application significantly increased mean CH₄ cumulative production (g m־²) relative to the control in the <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> (37. 3 vs. 8. 34 mg m⁻² P 0. 05). The application of straw significantly increased N₂O cumulative production relative to the control in the <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> (75. 9 vs. 43. 4 μg m⁻² h⁻¹) but decreased N₂O cumulative production by over 43 % in the early crop (15. 60 vs. 27. 27 μg m⁻² h⁻¹) (P < 0. 05). Straw application increased rice yield by 9. 63 % and 12. 58 % in early and <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> respectively. Straw incorporation decreased global warming potential in the early season, but increased it in the late season. Thus, despite straw application enhances emissions of greenhouse gases in some situations, its application in the adequate season (here early crop) may be an effective soil amendment that can increase soil fertility without enhancing or even mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases and thus climate change...|$|R

Published data show that the activity period of seed predators {{is directly related to}} canopy cover.

We hypothesised that there would be better temporal overlap in sugar beet, <b>a</b> phenologically <b>late</b> <b>crop.</b> The pattern of predation of Chenopodium album L. seeds was consistent over fields and years, low in July and August and gradually increasing until harvest in September/November.

The proportion of annual seed losses by predators calculated from these measurements ranged from 0. 26 to 0. 83, depending on the duration of seed exposure on the soil surface.

We studied densities of three pollinator groups on sunflower fields as <b>a</b> <b>late</b> mass-flowering <b>crop</b> in 16 landscapes that differed in the relative cover of oil-seed rape as an early mass-flowering crop, in the relative cover of sunflowers and in the relative cover of semi-natural habitats. Our aim was to evaluate dynamics between two crops with non-overlapping flowering periods. Densities of bumble bees in late-flowering sunflower fields were enhanced by early-flowering oil-seed rape. Highest bumble bee densities in the late-flowering crop were reached in landscapes that combined high relative covers of oil-seed rape and semi-natural habitats. Further, low relative covers of oil-seed rape in spring led to decreased bumble bee densities in late-flowering sunflower fields in landscapes with high relative covers of sunflower fields (dilution effect), whereas in landscapes with high relative covers of oil-seed rape, no dilution of bumble bees was found. Thus, our results indicate that early mass-flowering crops can mitigate pollinator dilution in crops flowering later in the season. We conclude that the management of landscape-scale patterns of early and <b>late</b> mass-flowering <b>crops</b> together with semi-natural habitats {{could be used to}} ensure crop pollination services.

30|$|Both {{rice and}} millet agriculturalists were {{responsible}} for the transmission of important agricultural technology across Southwest China and they must be considered in any linguistic or population history model for this region. Millet agriculture with its short growing season and tolerance to aridity is well adapted to the upland environments and mountainous foothills which characterize much of the landscape in Southwest China. The large flat expanse of the Chengdu Plain with its ample water sources presented an ideal environment for wetland rice production. The combination of rice and foxtail millet agriculture in this region formed a formidable package. In areas with challenging vertical topography, requiring extensive landscaping for the creation of paddies such as the foothills of Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces and possibly the Three Gorges region, foxtail millet could have substituted rice agriculture {{in the early days of}} agricultural expansion. In low-lying regions such as the Chengdu Plain, where the creation of paddies and water management technology is relatively simple, rice agriculture could be easily intensified. By adding foxtail millet, either as a fallback or <b>a</b> <b>late</b> season <b>crop,</b> this agricultural system gained in both risk reduction and yield, possibly spurring population growth and the development of social complexity. Because of its binary, interchangeable nature, this agricultural system also facilitated expansion into new territories.|$|R

The survival of top shoot cuttings was more than 97. 8 % irrespective of the planting time and plant spacing. Significant variations were found among the treatment combinations for plant height at 45 and 60 days after planting (DAP), foliage coverage at 45 and 60 DAP, number of branches per plant, number of tubers per plant, individual tuber weight, tuber yields per plant and per hectare yield.

40|$|The main factors {{affecting}} cocksfoot panicle production negatively in Finland were divided in three categories. Firstly, the juvenile stage of cocksfoot {{and a short}} favourable for floral evocation in the fall caused inadequate floral evocation. Therefore the panicle production in the first harvest year remained small when the stand was sown late in the previous season or was established with <b>a</b> <b>late</b> maturing cover <b>crop.</b> Secondly, damages due to low temperatures {{in the absence of}} snow cover and/or ice cover during winter decreased panicle and seed production. Thirdly, frosts during panicle growth stage destroyed panicles and decreased the seed yield. In addition, a long snow cover period may have decreased the seed yield since d tended to be higher when the snow cover period iin the previous winter was shorter than 120. The cultivar strongly affected the ability of a stand to produce panicles in Finnish conditions. The choice of cultivar is important for abundant panicle production. The average seed yield of the standard cv. Haka was 258 kg ha- 1 (range from 0 eltivar trials at the Agricultural Research Centre [...] The average yield per hectare could be raised by establishing the stands without a cover crop early in the growing season. The present situation in Finland with obligatory fallow makes this kind of establishment recommendable. If the stands established with <b>a</b> <b>late</b> maturing cover <b>crop,</b> the yield of first year stand should be taken for fodder and the second year harvest for seed. Fodder and seed production of cocksfoot should be combined since a seed production stand can give a fodder yield in addition to a seed yield. Combination of fodder and seed production would be important because the fodder yield of the stand can still be high although panicle production, and consequently, seed production fails. Seed production areas where the risk of late spring frost is high should be astised on areas where the risk of ice cover and low temperatures in absence of snow cover is small. However, a long snow cover period is also detrimental for the panicle production. The southern Lake District area in Eastern Finland may have favourable climatic conditions for seed production of cocksfoot, therefore seed production should be tried that area.

6000|$|This plant, the scarlet-runner of English gardeners and the Phaseolus coccineus of Lamarck, {{originally}} {{came from}} Mexico, as I am informed by Mr. Bentham. The flowers are so constructed that hive and humble-bees, which visit them incessantly, almost always alight {{on the left}} wing-petal, as they can best suck the nectar from this side. Their weight and movements depress the petal, and this causes the stigma to protrude from the spirally-wound keel, and a brush of hairs round the stigma pushes out the pollen before it. The pollen adheres to the head or proboscis of the bee which is at work, and is thus placed either on the stigma of the same flower, or is carried to another flower. (5/4. The flowers have been described by Delpino, and in an admirable manner by Mr. Farrer in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 2 4th series October 1868 page 256. My son Francis has explained 'Nature' January 8, 1874 page 189, the use of one peculiarity in their structure, namely, a little vertical projection on the single free stamen near its base, which seems placed as if to guard the entrance into the two nectar-holes in the staminal sheath. He shows that this projection prevents the bees reaching the nectar, unless {{they go to the}} left side of the flower, and it is absolutely necessary for cross-fertilisation that they should alight on the left wing-petal.) Several years ago I covered some plants under a large net, and these produced on one occasion about one-third, and on another occasion about one-eighth, of the number of pods which the same number of uncovered plants growing close alongside produced. (5/5. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 725 and more especially ibid 1858 page 828. Also 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462.) This lessened fertility was not caused by any injury from the net, as I moved the wing-petals of several protected flowers, in the same manner as bees do, and these produced remarkably fine pods. When the net was taken off, the flowers were immediately visited by bees, and it was interesting to observe how quickly the plants became covered with young pods. As the flowers are much frequented by Thrips, the self-fertilisation of most of the flowers under the net may have been due to the action of these minute insects. Dr. Ogle likewise covered up a large portion of a plant, and [...] "out of a vast number of blossoms thus protected not a single one produced a pod, while the unprotected blossoms were for the most part fruitful." [...] Mr. Belt gives a more curious case; this plant grows well and flowers in Nicaragua; but as none of the native bees visit the flowers, not a single pod is ever produced. (5/6. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review' 1870 page 168. Mr. Belt 'The Naturalist in Nicaragua' 1874 page 70. The latter author gives a case 'Nature' 1875 page 26, of <b>a</b> <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> of Phaseolus multiflorus near London which [...] "was rendered barren" [...] by the humble-bees cutting, as they frequently do, holes at the bases of the flowers instead of entering them in the proper manner.) ...|$|R

Compared with the other table food plants, potatoes ranks second only to wheat. Almost 81 % of the potatoes produced are used for food consumption, 5 % of the crop are used for seed and the remaining 14 % of the crop, which are the surplus consisting mostly of poor grade potatoes, go for non-food uses, such as livestock feed and industrial products, starch and alcohol. At the same time potatoes {{are one of the most}} widely grown crops in the United States. They are grown in every state and harvested during every month of the year in some sections of the country. During recent years, there has been a tendency toward more specialization in potato production. The total acreage trended downward but the yields per acre have increased rapidly. Production of potatoes is becoming concentrated in the high-yielding areas and on large commercial farms. This high specializing and commercializing tendency makes potato price analysis more important. Potato price analysis in this study is centered on Chicago and St. Louis, the two big wholesale markets of midwest potatoes, and is devoted largely to the <b>late</b> <b>crop.</b> Since the data we have cover a period of only seven years, the study will be emphasized with respect to short-time price analysis, i. e., annual and short-term cyclic price fluctuations and seasonal price variations.

This study investigated the impact of two dates of destruction and burial of a rye (Secale cereale L.) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) cover crop on runoff and erosion, focusing on a continuous silage maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system. Thirty erosion plots with various intercrop management options were monitored for 3 yr at two sites. During the intercropping period, cover crops reduced runoff and erosion by more than 94 % compared with untilled, post-maize harvest plots. Rough tillage after maize harvest proved equally effective as <b>a</b> <b>late</b> sown cover <b>crop.</b> There was no effect of cover crop destruction and burial dates on runoff and erosion during the intercropping period, probably because rough tillage for cover crop burial compensates {{for the lack of}} soil cover.

Seven planting dates were used in 2002 and 2006 early cropping seasons. All plantings were done at a weekly interval. Data were obtained on grain yield and yield components. Grain yield and yield components decreased as planting was delayed in the late seasons while in the early seasons they showed contrasting trend. To obtain optimum yield for the maturity classes evaluated, the varieties must be planted about the end of August or first week of September for the late season and about the middle of April in the early season. At the optimum planting date TZEE- WSRBCs and ACR 90 POOL 16 -DT with grain yield of 3. 8 tons ha- 1 and 6. 4 tons ha- 1 were the highest yielding varieties in 2001 and 2002 respectively. In 2005 <b>late</b> <b>cropping</b> season, TZECOMP 3 DT (1. 7 tons/ha) was the highest yielding while in 2006 early cropping seasons, ACR 95 TZECOMP 4 C 3 (4. 37 tons/ha) was the highest yielding variety...|$|R
50|$|Botvinik (2008) {{found that}} all {{existing}} models of hierarchically structured behavior share at least one general assumption - that the hierarchical, part-whole organization of human action is mirrored in the internal or neural representations underlying it. Specifically, {{the assumption is that}} there exist representations not only of low-level motor behaviors, but also separable representations of higher-level behavioral units. The <b>latest</b> <b>crop</b> of models provides new insights, but also poses new or refined questions for empirical research, including how abstract action representations emerge through learning, how they interact with different modes of action control, and how they sort out within the prefrontal cortex (PFC).|$|R
