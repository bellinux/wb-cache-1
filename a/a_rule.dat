Kittler et al. focused on classifier combination and developed a theoretical framework for classifier combination [12]. They used <b>a</b> sum <b>rule,</b> <b>a</b> product <b>rule,</b> <b>a</b> minimum <b>rule,</b> <b>a</b> maximum <b>rule,</b> <b>a</b> median <b>rule,</b> and majority voting {{as the basis for}} the classifier combination scheme.|$|R

5|$|Before the 1975 season, the CFL {{implemented}} <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> change {{allowing the}} return team to block on punts. Allison was used {{on special teams}} as a blocker under this new rule.

Allison also continued to contribute defensively, playing in all 16 regular season games and recording an interception and fumble recovery.|$|E

5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> for updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an assignment of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|A {{collectible}} {{card game}} {{based on the}} film called The Nightmare Before Christmas TCG was released in 2005 by NECA. The game was designed by Quixotic Games founder Andrew Parks and Kez Shlasnger. It consists of a Premiere set and 4 Starter Decks based on four characters, Jack Skellington, the Mayor, Oogie Boogie, and Doctor Finklestein. Each Starter Deck contains <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> book, a Pumpkin King card, a Pumpkin Points card, and a 48-card deck. The game has four card types: Characters, Locales, Creations, and Surprises. The Cards' rarities are separated into four categories: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra Rare.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with <b>a</b> <b>rule</b> for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E
