30|$|In {{addition}} to {{the answers to the}} questions, some respondents provided additional comments regarding difficulties in <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> <b>renewal</b> of CDE qualification. To become a CDEJ, medical personnel in mentioned professions need to work continuously {{for at least two years}} in medical institutions, have diabetes education experience for at least 1, 000  h, participate in two day workshops organized by the Certification Board, submit a report of 10 cases of diabetes education they have conducted, and pass the required examinations. To apply for renewal of certification every five years, CDEs must participate in scientific meetings and trainings to obtain re-certification credits (Kawaguchi 2007). Some CDEs and CDE candidates consider that meeting certification requirements are too strict and can be costly and time-consuming. Therefore, some CDEs have given up qualification renewal. To supply enough CDEs in clinical settings, reconsideration of the system of CDE <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> <b>renewal</b> will be necessary. In addition, providing higher salaries to CDEs could be one of the strategies to increase CDEs; employers can demonstrate that they value the certification and special knowledge of CDEs by paying more (Langelier et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} an original, quantitative approach to examining the use of library electronic resources by demographic (or 2 ̆ 7 market segment 2 ̆ 7). In turn it provides an innovative way to demonstrate and explore the value of libraries and importantly, electronic collections. Methodology: University of Wollongong 2 ̆ 7 s Performance Indicator Unit (PIU), in partnership with the University of Wollongong Library (UWL), has built a data warehouse - the 2 ̆ 7 Marketing Cube 2 ̆ 7 that links real time usage of electronic resources (eresources) at a title level, to student demographic data. Findings: The Marketing Cube design provides a robust analytics framework for examining pictures of use of eresources by student demographic. For views explored, the cube reveals rich data for demographical context against number of student logins and engagement with resources in hours. Findings give rise to further questions or hypotheses, requiring further interrogation of the cube or triangulation with other available quantitative data or qualitative inquiry with faculty. Practical Implications: An ongoing commitment to continuous improvement at a university and library executive level is critical. UWL is fortunate to have secured the support of the enterprise Performance Indicator Unit (PIU), for this second UWL performance measurement project. The Marketing Cube also exploits tested system design created for UWL 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 Value Cube 2 ̆ 7 (Jantti 2 ̆ 6 Cox, 2012). Considerable time has been invested anew to select priority resources and to configure them within the cube. Significant time was also spent on user acceptance testing by both the Library and PIU. Originality / Value: Existing research and literature has more often achieved to demonstrate the value of library collections on a qualitative basis. In contrast, the Marketing Cube offers a quantitative perspective and is focussed solely on student use of resources - the library 2 ̆ 7 s broadest client base. Real time use capture and weekly reporting provides UWL with a granular picture of who is using a resource and when; on demand. This contextual insight has strategic value to <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> <b>renewal</b> decisions; but most innovatively, such analytics data can inform marketing strategy and provide a method to pre and post-test impact of promotional activity...|$|E

40|$|Unlike in fear conditioning, little {{attention}} has been devoted to extinction <b>and</b> <b>renewal</b> in appetitive conditioning, despite its relevance for extinction-based addiction treatments. We developed a paradigm, using a specific tray as a conditioned stimulus (CS) for eating chocolate (unconditioned stimulus, US), to investigate the effects of context change on <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> extinction of conditioned chocolate craving using an ABA renewal design. In Study 1 (n ¼ 32), participants successfully acquired chocolate craving, but unlike what is commonly observed in fear conditioning, craving did not extinguish. In Study 2, we separately assessed craving and US expectancy in a between-subjects design (n ¼ 64). US-expectancy data showed <b>acquisition,</b> extinction <b>and</b> <b>renewal</b> in the ABA group. The craving data did not follow this pattern, suggesting different mechanisms for craving and US expectancy. Similarities and differences between craving and US expectancy, as well as practical implications, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Future specialists’ {{professional}} training at universities is {{realized in the}} educational process which is an open, dynamic and self-developing system. For effective training results the principles of continuity and continuing education has an essential importance. The implementation of these principles is the most expedient in the College-University system. This system {{is characterized by the}} ability to reproduction, <b>acquisition,</b> augmentation <b>and</b> <b>renewal</b> of students’ knowledge on the basis of interdisciplinary connections with previously studied disciplines. This article deals with an analysis of continuity in studying professional disciplines in the {{professional training}} of future specialists in physical culture and sports in the College-University system. Existing standards of higher education for training junior specialists, bachelors, and masters are not enough agreed among themselves and do not provide full opportunities for full integration. There is some contradiction between the available capacity of the College-University system in the implementation highly efficient and economic system of training specialists and not flexible standards of the professional education. The development of special mechanisms of combination of existing educational standards at various levels helps to overcome this contradiction. While analyzing the curriculum, we have discovered that there are some differences both in the list of most of subjects and in their hour division. Studying in college is more oriented on the learning of basic general subjects and at university it focuses on special professional disciplines. The construction of the quality model, which includes the coordination of educational standards, curricula and programs, would help to achieve the optimal number of hours of the cycle of future specialists’ professional training in physical culture and sports in the College-University system. The interpretation of existing differences significantly affects the educational process and makes the educational direction of College-University system optimal and efficient, based on the continuity and fundamental relations...|$|R

We also find that the probability of a patent being traded depends on a number of factors—the age of the patent, the number of citations received by a given age, the patent generality, and whether the patent has been previously traded or not. These findings are consistent with the predictions of a model of patent transfers <b>and</b> <b>renewals.</b> 1...|$|R
