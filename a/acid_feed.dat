40|$|The {{development}} of an artificial neural network model used to predict the mole fraction of biodiesel obtained from the reactive distillation process involving a reaction between palmitic acid and methanol {{has been carried out}} in this work. The data used for the neural network model development were generated with the aid of the parametric utility of Aspen HYSYS prototype of the process developed using Distillation Column Sub-Flowsheet and Wilson model as the fluid package. Six parameters (palmitic <b>acid</b> <b>feed</b> temperature, palmitic <b>acid</b> <b>feed</b> pressure, methanol feed temperature, methanol feed pressure, reboiler heat duty and reflux ratio) were used as the input variables to predict the biodiesel mole fraction. In the training of the neural network model, multiplicative lagged Fibonacci generator with the obtained optimized seed number of 47 was used. The results obtained from the training of the artificial neural network model developed revealed that the model was able to represent the process very well because the mean of squared error estimated from the simulation of the model was found to be approximately zero (that is, 3. 93 E- 09). Furthermore, very good performance was recorded when the developed neural network model was used to predict the mole fraction of biodiesel produced from the bottom section of the reactive distillation column considered owing to the fact the mean of squared error was found, in this case, to be 6. 92 E- 10. It has, thus, been discovered that the developed neural network model was able to perform very well in simulating and predicting the mole fraction of biodiesel produced from the reactive distillation process.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} bile acids on receptor-dependent and receptor-independent low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake {{in the liver}} and intestine was investigated. When fed at the 0. 1 % level for three weeks, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid suppressed hepatic cholesterol synthesis in the rat by 80 % and 50 %, respectively, while ursodeoxycholic acid had no effect. In contrast, hepatic cholesteryl ester levels, rates of hepatic LDL transport, and concentrations of plasma LDL-cholesterol were not affected by bile <b>acid</b> <b>feeding</b> in this species. Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid also suppressed hepatic cholesterol synthesis in the hamster. However, since basal rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis in this species, as in man, are very low, the absolute reduction in hepatic synthesis could not compensate for the change in hepatic sterol balance induced by bile <b>acid</b> <b>feeding.</b> Hence, in the hamster the <b>feeding</b> of cholic <b>acid</b> and chenodeoxycholic acid increased hepatic cholesteryl ester levels 660 % and 39 %, respectively, reduced hepatic receptor-dependent LDL uptake by 50 % and 32 %, respectively, and elevated plasma LDL-cholesterol levels by 160 % and 50 %, respectively. Ursodeoxycholic <b>acid</b> <b>feeding</b> did not alter any of these processes, {{and none of the}} bile acids changed the rate of hepatic receptor-independent LDL transport. In the intestine, none of the bile acids altered rates of cholesterol synthesis or LDL uptake. When cholic acids, chenodeoxycholic acid, or ursodeoxycholic acid was infused continuously for 8 hr in supranormal amounts into control hamsters or rats or into animals pretreated with cholestyramine, there were no changes in LDL transport or any other parameter of hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Thus, these studies indicated that cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid have no acute, direct effect on rates of receptor-dependent LDL transport or cholesterol synthesis but do alter these processes indirectly by inducing changes in cholesterol balance across the liver. Ursodeoxycholic acid, in contrast, does not affect these processes either directly or indirectly and so causes no change in plasma LDL levels...|$|R

The amount of AMP remained constant through the acid-feeding and the recovery periods. The activity of adenylosuccinate synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the purine nucleotide cycle, paralleled {{the rise and fall}} in NH 3 excretion.

It {{was identified as}} a cytochrome P 450 family 3 protein, by sequence homology, and named CYP 3 A 10. The activity of CYP 3 A 10 was determined by transient expression of its cDNA in transfected COS cells and was found to hydroxylate lithocholic acid at position 6 beta. CYP 3 A 10 RNA is 50 -fold higher in males than in female hamsters. In males, it appears to be regulated by age with expression highest after puberty. Shortly after weaning (28 days), cholic <b>acid</b> <b>feeding</b> of male hamsters elevates the level of message over that of hamsters fed with normal laboratory chow. Females do not exhibit regulation by cholic acid. In hamster liver, murideoxycholic acid, the 6 beta-metabolite of lithocholic acid, is the major hydroxylated product of lithocholic acid. Lithocholic acid 6 beta-hydroxylase (6 beta-hydroxylase) activity is greatly diminished in hamster female liver microsomes as would be expected {{due to the lack of}} CYP 3 A 10 mRNA in females.

Flask culture {{revealed that the}} time and concentration of propionic acid addition had significant effects on cell growth, P(3 HB-co- 3 HV) synthesis, and HV fraction in the copolymer. In fed-batch culture, a low ratio of propionic acid to glucose (P/G) led to high dry cell weight (DCW), P(3 HB-co- 3 HV) content and productivity, but low HV unit fraction. A high P/G ratio led to, on the other hand, high HV unit fraction but the low P(3 HB-co- 3 HV) content and productivity. The specific P(3 HB-co- 3 HV) synthetic rate and the specific HV synthetic rate declined in fed-batch cultures, which deteriorated with high P/G feeding due to the inhibitory effect of propionic acid accumulated in the culture broth. According to the non-steady state synthesis of P(3 HB-co- 3 HV) by R. eutropha, an optimal feeding strategy to control the propionic acid accumulation was developed and demonstrated. The propionic <b>acid</b> <b>feeding</b> rate was reduced with time, and DCW, P(3 HB-co- 3 HV) concentration, P(3 HB-co- 3 HV) content and RV fraction in P(3 HB-co- 3 HV) reached 52. 1 gl(- 1), 40. 8 gl(- 1), 78. 3 % and 16. 2 mol%, respectively.

However, uric acid also functions as an antioxidant with possible beneficial effects. Methods We investigated the influence of hyperuricemia on mesenteric arterial tone (main and second order branch) and morphology in experimental CRI. Forty-four Sprague–Dawley rats were 5 / 6 nephrectomized (NX) or Sham-operated and fed 2. 0 % oxonic acid or control diet for 9  weeks. Results Oxonic <b>acid</b> <b>feeding</b> elevated plasma uric acid levels 2. 4 and 3. 6 -fold in the NX and Sham groups, respectively. Plasma creatinine and urea were elevated 2 -fold and blood pressure increased by 10  mmHg in NX rats, while hyperuricemia did not significantly influence these variables. Right and left ventricular weight, and atrial and B-type natriuretic peptide mRNA content were increased in NX rats, but were not affected by hyperuricemia. In the mesenteric artery, hyperuricemia did not influence vasoconstrictor responses in vitro to norepinephrine or potassium chloride. The small arteries of NX rats featured hypertrophic remodeling independent of uric acid levels: wall to lumen ratio, wall thickness and cross-sectional area were increased without changes in lumen diameter. In the main branch, vasorelaxations to acetylcholine were impaired in NX rats, but were not affected by hyperuricemia. In contrast, relaxations to the large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+-channel (BKCa) opener NS- 1619 were reduced by oxonic <b>acid</b> <b>feeding,</b> whereas responses to nitroprusside were not affected.

The effect of the feed concentration and temperature on diffusivity and permeability was studied and the partition coefficient for each PPSU membranes was obtained. From the results, it was observed that water established strong hydrogen bonds with the membrane surface, which consequently allowed a faster sorption and diffusion of water molecules. In addition, a plasticizing effect resulted in increased water permeation, leading to a higher separation factor.

40|$|The PUREX {{process has}} become the {{reprocessing}} procedure quite generally used for all fuel types containing natural, slightly or highly enriched uranium together with lower or higher contents of plutonium. The THOREX process {{on the other hand}} has been developed for reprocessing uranium and thorium from thorium-based fuel. When the fuel being irradiated contains appreciable amounts of $^{ 238 }$U, the plutonium thus formed requires that a combination of the THOREX and PUREX processes must be applied. The THOREX process is technically less advanced and principally incriminated with the drawback that thorium nitrate exhibits a much lower distribution coefficient than uranium and plutonium. To drive thorium into the organic TBP phase, a strong salting agent is required. Aluminium nitrate, which formerly has been recommended is now replaced by nitric acid {{in order to reduce the}} amount of radioactive waste. However, high acid concentrations are counter-effective in achieving high fission product decontamination. Therefore, several flowsheet variants with acid and acid deficient feed solutions, respectively, have been investigated in the past. In order to achieve high decontamination factors, a dual cycle THOREX process was developed. This process uses an <b>acid</b> <b>feed</b> solution in the first cycle and an acid deficient one in the second cycle. According to recent investigations, a single cycle process with <b>acid</b> <b>feed</b> solution should provide the necessary decontamination factors. An immediate separation of thorium and uranium appears advisable in view of both fuel cycle strategy and process feasibility. Pulse columns should be preferentially used as extraction apparatus, at least for the xtraction step. Reprocessing of HTR-LEU fuel in existing PUREX plants is bothered with problems of criticality prevention due to the residual total fissile isotope content in the feed of greater than 2 %. Special precaution must therefore be taken in several processingunits. The addition of soluble poison to the feed proved to be an unfavourable measure. A more suitable method to overcome criticality difficulties may be the application of a flow sheet with lower TBP concentrations in the range of less than 10 %. Beyond it, there are no further problems to consider with LEU fuel reprocessing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Biodiesels are {{biofuels}} {{made from}} renewable {{sources such as}} vegetable oils originating from plants and animal fats. Transesterification reaction is carried out by reacting triglycerides in oil/fat with an alcohol in presence of a catalyst. Important process variables are reaction temperature, time, reactant concentration and the catalyst. Catalysts can be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous catalysts are liquid phase ionic acid and base, enzymes, and non-ionic organic base compounds. Heterogeneous catalysts are acid and base type. Examples of acid heterogeneous catalysts are ion-exchange resins, tungstated and sulphated zirconia, metal complexes and zeolite. Base heterogeneous catalysts consist of metal oxides in pure form or over support, zeolites, clays and non-oxides. Paper gives a brief introduction of catalytic transesterification process and a detailed review of solid basic catalysts. It is found that these catalysts are selective to feed and preparation method.

The permit contained compliance schedules that provided SRS with only {{three to five years}} to select and implement projects that would enable outfall compliance. Discharges from a few outfalls were eliminated or routed into other locations relatively inexpensively. However, some outfall problems were much more difficult to correct. SRS personnel implemented several innovative projects in order to meet compliance schedule deadlines as inexpensively as possible. These innovations included (1) connecting several outfall discharges to the site's Central Sanitary Wastewater Treatment Facility (CSWTF), (2) constructing a treatment wetlands and completing a water-effects ratio (WER) on its effluent, (3) installing a stannous chloride feed system to remove mercury in an existing air stripper, and (4) constructing a humic <b>acid</b> <b>feed</b> system to increase effluent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and take advantage of biotic ligand modeling to raise effluent limits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The renal {{cortical}} collecting duct (CCD) {{consists of}} principal and intercalated cells. Two forms of intercalated cells, those cells involved in H÷/HCO 3 -transport, {{have recently been}} described. H÷-secreting cells are capable of apical endocytosis and have H÷ATPase on the apical membrane and a basolateral CI-/HCO 3 - exchanger. HCO 3 [...] secreting cells bind peanut agglutinin (PNA) to apical membrane receptors and have diffuse or basolateral distribution of H÷ATPase; their CI-/HCO 3 - exchanger is on the apical membrane. We found that 20 h after <b>acid</b> <b>feeding</b> of rabbits, there was a fourfold increase in number of cells showing apical endocytosis and a numerically similar reduction of cells binding PNA. Incubation of CCDs at pH 7. 1 for 3 - 5 h in vitro led to similar, al...|$|R
40|$|<b>Feeding</b> oleic <b>acid</b> to rabbits {{resulted}} in a progressive rise in bile concentration of allodeoxycholic acid, expansion of the bile salt pool, and depression of de novo hepatic bile acid synthesis. There was also an increase in cholesterol saturation in bile. The gallstones that formed contained traces of cholesterol but were composed mainly of salts of allodeoxycholic acid. The data suggest that oleic <b>acid</b> <b>feeding</b> results in increased rate of cholestanol and allodeoxycholic acid metabolism. Morphologically, these biochemical events were accompanied by early reactive changes in the gallbladder epithelium characterized by marked increase in cell proliferation and mucus hypersecretion. In addition, there was the early formation of interepithelial cell vacuoles and, later, Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. These cellular reactions reflect the dramatic and important changes {{that take place in}} the gallbladder before gallstone formation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMonoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) terminates the {{signaling}} {{function of the}} endocannabinoid, 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG). During 2 -AG hydrolysis, MAGL liberates arachidonic <b>acid,</b> <b>feeding</b> the principal substrate for the neuroinflammatory prostaglandins. In cancer cells, MAGL redirects lipid stores toward protumorigenic signaling lipids. Thus MAGL inhibitors may have great therapeutic potential. Although potent and increasingly selective MAGL inhibitors have been described, their number is still limited. Here, we have characterized piperazine and piperidine triazole ureas that combine the high potency attributable to the triazole leaving group together with the bulky aromatic benzodioxolyl moiety required for selectivity, culminating in compound JJKK- 048 that potently (IC 50  < 0. 4  nM) inhibited human and rodent MAGL. JJKK- 048 displayed low cross-reactivity with other endocannabinoid targets. Activity-based protein profiling of mouse brain and human melanoma cell proteomes suggested high specificity also among the metabolic serine hydrolases...|$|R
