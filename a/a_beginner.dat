5|$|The {{attacker}} consciously stops {{just short}} of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power. The attacker has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other. This is normally the practice when one training partner is <b>a</b> <b>beginner.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his ability}} to {{translate}} what is a complicated treatise into an easily readable and understandable prose for <b>a</b> <b>beginner,</b> Khoo's Sun Tzu series were well received and continue to grow in scope and depth in later years. He additionally manages to add realism by injecting real-life situations culled from his 15 years in management, that provoke much thought and encourage readers to assess their own performance, and take positive measures to become more effective in their workplace and interpersonal relationships.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi fonts, commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very different to his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and ligatures to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for every word. Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs that are either a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his slanted Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is clearly not the work of <b>a</b> <b>beginner.</b> Earlier fonts that may have been cut by Garamond have been suggested but the attribution is less certain.|$|E

5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was <b>a</b> <b>beginner,</b> but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E

25|$|The {{calling card}} of this delivery, for the batsman {{to read it}} in advance, is the typical wobble in the seam after ball release with the seam {{slanting}} predominantly towards the batsman.

25|$|The Tuckerbrook Quad Chair serves {{beginner}} trails (Bear Paw, Deer Run, Fleitmanm and Coyote Crossing) {{that are}} segregated {{from the upper}} mountain. The bottom half of Cannon has four long runs suitable for beginners (Lower Cannon, Parkway, Gremlin and Turnpike). This area is most easily accessed via the Eagle Triple Chair, from the Peabody Base Area. The Brookside learning area, <b>a</b> <b>beginner</b> skiing area, is segregated {{from the rest of}} the mountain. It is serviced by its own triple chairlift as well as two surface lifts. Its location allows novices to progress to the nearby short beginner trails off the Tuckerbrook quad chair.|$|E
25|$|Having {{training}} aids {{may make it}} easier to become comfortable with riding a unicycle. One method for training is using a spotter to make riding easier. One other easy way to learn is to find a narrow hallway {{that can be used to}} help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing <b>a</b> <b>beginner</b> to focus on forward and backward balance. If a hallway cannot be found, a fence or clothes line is suitable. Equally, riding back and forth between two chairs, faced back to back, whilst holding on to the chair backs allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.|$|E
25|$|Kun'yomi are {{characterized}} by the strict (C)V syllable structure of yamato kotoba. Most noun or adjective kun'yomi are two to three syllables long, while verb kun'yomi are usually between one and three syllables in length, not counting trailing hiragana called okurigana. Okurigana are {{not considered to be}} part of the internal reading of the character, although they are part of the reading of the word. <b>A</b> <b>beginner</b> in the language will rarely come across characters with long readings, but readings of three or even four syllables are not uncommon. This contrasts with on'yomi, which are monosyllabic, and is unusual in the Chinese family of scripts, which generally use one character per syllable – not only in Chinese, but also in Korean, Vietnamese, and Zhuang; polysyllabic Chinese characters are rare and considered non-standard.|$|E

25|$|Motor {{planning}} {{is an important}} component of becoming a fluent semantic compaction user. Icon sequencing should be the initial focus of learning to use semantic compaction devices. <b>A</b> <b>beginner</b> needs to be fluent in a given icon set before progressing to a more advanced level. The Language Acquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) strategy aids individuals in developing motor plans for sequencing icons for messages. Minspeak relies upon the motor-based learning principles that when motor patterns are repeated, these processes become automatic and simplified. Common automated motor patterns include typing on a keyboard without looking, riding a bicycle, or swallowing food and drink. Increased automaticity and simplification with the production of language allows experienced Minspeak users to delegate cognitive attention to their intended message (language) instead of to the formulation of their message. This allows users to focus on communicating a specific message rather than focus on how to build the message by searching for icons across different pages and or screens. The use of LAMP strategies has been associated with increased natural expression through unique combinations of words in non-verbal children with autism. Ideally, once the system of Minspeak is mastered, productions of communication should take less time and effort across communication contexts.|$|E

500|$|Writing for TouchArcade, Karl Burnett {{said the}} {{restricted}} set of environments made the game {{a bit of}} grind to play.

He concluded that it was a satisfactory game that was ultimately held back by the limited amount of content in the package. VideoGamer.com writer Pete Worth considered the game to be too difficult, highlighting that it had [...] "limited appeal" [...] amongst players who were not rally fans or dedicated to racing games. Slide to Play also agreed that the challenge posed by the game would by enjoyed by hardcore players but might be off-putting for <b>a</b> <b>beginner.</b> They identified some performance issues but ultimately thought that Codemasters had effectively transitioned the series from console to mobile devices.|$|E
