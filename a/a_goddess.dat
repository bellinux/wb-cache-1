5|$|Early Jainism was {{dismissive of}} Chamunda, <b>a</b> <b>goddess</b> who demands blood sacrifice, which {{is against the}} {{principle}} of Jain vegetarianism. Some Jain legends portray Chamunda as <b>a</b> <b>goddess</b> defeated by monks like Jinadattasuri and Jinaprabhasuri.|$|E

5|$|Author Raven Grimassi {{has written}} {{extensively}} about Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria, presenting what he admits is his own personal rendering of her story. He differs from Leland in many ways, particularly in portraying her as a witch who lived and taught in 14th-century Italy, rather than <b>a</b> <b>goddess.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other Wiccans {{have adopted}} the {{original}} Gardnerian God/Goddess duotheistic structure but have adopted deity forms other {{than that of the}} Horned God and Mother Goddess. For instance, the God has been interpreted as the Oak King and the Holly King, as well as the Sun God, Son/Lover God, and Vegetation God. He has also been seen in the roles of the Leader of the Wild Hunt and the Lord of Death. The Goddess is often portrayed as <b>a</b> Triple <b>Goddess,</b> thereby being <b>a</b> triadic deity comprising <b>a</b> Maiden <b>goddess,</b> <b>a</b> Mother <b>goddess,</b> and <b>a</b> Crone <b>goddess,</b> each of whom has different associations, namely virginity, fertility and wisdom. Other Wiccan conceptualisations have portrayed her as <b>a</b> Moon <b>Goddess</b> and as <b>a</b> Menstruating <b>Goddess.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dhumavati hardly has an {{independent}} existence outside the Mahavidya group. There is no historical mention of {{her before she}} is included among the Mahavidyas. As <b>a</b> <b>goddess</b> of poverty, frustration, and despair, Daniélou associates Dhumavati with Nirriti, the goddess of disease and misery, and Alakshmi, the goddess of misfortune and poverty. Kinsley adds another goddess to the list: Jyestha.|$|E
5|$|Kali– Sati's {{twin sister}} who was {{separated}} from her after birth, due to their father denouncing her. Kali was born with two extra functioning appendages, hence she was ostracized from society and declared a Naga. A very hot-tempered woman, Kali assists and helps Shiva in his journey to destroy Evil. Kali is later renowned as <b>a</b> <b>Goddess.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{comments}} that the episode in Gylfaginning detailing Loki's antics with a goat may have associations with castration and a ritual involving making <b>a</b> <b>goddess</b> laugh. Lindow notes that Loki and Skaði {{appear to have}} had a special relationship, an example being Skaði's placement of the snake over Loki's face in Lokasenna and Gylfaginning.|$|E

25|$|At Lanuvium {{the goddess}} is known under the epithet Seispes Mater Regina. The titles {{themselves}} are a theological definition: she was <b>a</b> sovereign <b>goddess,</b> <b>a</b> martial <b>goddess</b> and <b>a</b> fertility <b>goddess.</b> Hence her flamen {{was chosen by}} the highest local magistrate, the dictator, and since 388 BC the Roman consuls were required to offer sacrifices to her. Her sanctuary was famous, rich and powerful.|$|R

5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that Sól, as <b>a</b> <b>goddess,</b> may represent an extension of an earlier Proto-Indo-European deity due to Indo-European linguistic connections between Norse Sól, Sanskrit Surya, Common Brittonic Sulis, Lithuanian Saulė, Latin Sol, and Slavic Tsar Solnitse.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, <b>a</b> <b>goddess</b> balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities.|$|E
5|$|Animal Sacrifice of {{a buffalo}} or goat, {{particularly}} during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced {{in parts of}} South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to <b>a</b> <b>goddess,</b> and is probably related to the myth of goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is Renuka. According to Alf Hiltebeitel – a professor of Religions, History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess-related ritual animal sacrifice found in Gilgamesh epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.|$|E

5|$|Chhinnamasta is <b>a</b> <b>goddess</b> of contradictions. She symbolises both {{aspects of}} Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She is {{considered}} both {{a symbol of}} sexual self-control and an embodiment of sexual energy, depending upon interpretation. She represents death, temporality, and destruction as well as life, immortality, and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the kundalini– spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her self-sacrifice– sometimes coupled with a maternal element– sexual dominance, and self-destructive fury.|$|E
5|$|Her myths emphasise her bad {{temper and}} unhappiness, due to {{rejection}} {{by her father}} Shiva and her husband, and the hatred of her stepmother, Chandi (Shiva's wife, identified with Parvati in this context). In the Puranas, sage Kashyapa {{is considered to be}} her father, and not Shiva, although Lord Shiva is a father figure to her. Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa's aim was to fully establish her authority as <b>a</b> <b>goddess</b> and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E

5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about Hel's potential connections to figures appearing in the 11th century Old English Gospel of Nicodemus and Old Norse Bartholomeus saga postola, {{that she may have}} been considered <b>a</b> <b>goddess</b> with potential Indo-European parallels in Bhavani, Kali, and Mahakali or that Hel may have become a being only as a late personification of the location of the same name.|$|E
