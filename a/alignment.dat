5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence <b>alignment</b> (MSA) is {{a sequence}} <b>alignment</b> {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, sequence homology can be inferred and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of the <b>alignment</b> as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing characters in a single <b>alignment</b> column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens {{in one or more}} of the sequences in the <b>alignment.</b> Multiple sequence <b>alignment</b> is often used to assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|A {{road in the}} {{location}} of PA284 first shows on maps as early as 1873. PA284 was first designated along its current <b>alignment</b> during the 1928 renumbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. The designation was done as a spur to the <b>alignment</b> of PA84, which was designated from Piatt Township to the New York state line. The entire <b>alignment</b> of PA284 was paved by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1932, including the bridge over Flooks Run and Blacks Creek. However, the <b>alignment</b> has remained relatively unchanged since. In 1961, with the designation of Interstate 84, the <b>alignment</b> of PA84 was re-designated as PA287 to avoid duplication.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{progressive}} <b>alignment</b> method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more accurate alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct <b>alignment</b> of the pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local <b>alignment</b> program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local <b>alignment</b> between two sequences. The resulting <b>alignment</b> and phylogenetic tree are used {{as a guide to}} produce new and more accurate weighting factors.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, MD 97 was {{extended}} {{north to the}} Pennsylvania border northwest of Emmitsburg, Frederick County. The route ran north from Cooksville to Fenby, replacing both sections of MD 570, before it replaced MD 32 from Fenby north to Westminster and northwest through Taneytown and Emmitsburg. In 1960, MD 97 was {{moved to a new}} <b>alignment</b> that bypassed Westminster along newly constructed New Washington Road between Fenby and US 140 and the Westminster Bypass to the northwest side of the city. MD 32 was designated onto the former <b>alignment</b> of MD 97 that passed through Westminster on Washington Road and Main Street. In 1961, MD 97 was shifted to a new <b>alignment</b> to the east between MD 26 and MD 32; the former <b>alignment</b> became MD 854. The intersection with MD 26 was replaced with an interchange in 1962. In 1964, construction began on a new <b>alignment</b> of MD 97 slightly to the north between Westminster and Taneytown. This <b>alignment</b> was completed in 1965, and the former <b>alignment</b> became a part of MD 32 (now MD 832). In 1966, the divided highway portion of MD 97 {{was extended}} north from Glenmont to MD 28 in Norbeck.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 10 was renumbered to Route 5. Plans {{at the time}} were to build a new <b>alignment</b> from east of Ridgefield to Little Ferry {{southeast}} of Hackensack and form Route S5 (now Route 93) along the old road from Little Ferry to Ridgefield. The new Route 6 would share the <b>alignment</b> of Route 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, where it would turn southeast onto a new <b>alignment</b> to Little Ferry, then run with Route 5 again to east of Ridgefield and split onto its own <b>alignment</b> to the George Washington Bridge.|$|E

40|$|Preordering of {{a source}} {{language}} sentence to match target word order {{has proved to}} be useful for improving machine translation systems. Previous work has shown that a reordering model can be learned from high quality manual word <b>alignments</b> to improve machine translation performance. In this paper, we focus on further improving the performance of the reordering model (and thereby machine translation) by using a larger corpus of sentence aligned data for which manual word <b>alignments</b> are not available but automatic machine generated <b>alignments</b> are available. The main challenge we tackle is to generate quality data for training the reordering model in spite of the machine <b>alignments</b> being noisy. To mitigate the effect of noisy machine <b>alignments,</b> we propose a novel approach that improves reorderings produced given noisy <b>alignments</b> and also improves word <b>alignments</b> using information from the reordering model. This approach generates <b>alignments</b> that are 2. 6 f-Measure points better than a baseline supervised aligner. The data generated allows us to train a reordering model that gives an improvement of 1. 8 BLEU points on the NIST MT- 08 Urdu-English evaluation set over a reordering model that only uses manual word <b>alignments,</b> and a gain of 5. 2 BLEU points over a standard phrase-based baseline. ...|$|R

5|$|Many astronomical {{alignments}} {{have been}} claimed for Stonehenge, {{a complex of}} megaliths and earthworks in the Salisbury Plain of England. The most famous {{of these is the}} midsummer <b>alignment,</b> where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter <b>alignment,</b> where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant <b>alignment,</b> and the midsummer <b>alignment</b> may be a coincidence due to local topography.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} <b>alignment</b> also {{refers to}} the process of aligning such a sequence set. Because three or more sequences of biologically relevant length can be difficult and are almost always time-consuming to align by hand, computational algorithms are used to produce and analyze the alignments. MSAs require more sophisticated methodologies than pairwise <b>alignment</b> because they are more computationally complex. Most multiple sequence <b>alignment</b> programs use heuristic methods rather than global optimization because identifying the optimal <b>alignment</b> between more than a few sequences of moderate length is prohibitively computationally expensive.|$|E
5|$|PA 563 {{was first}} created in 1928 to connect Bergey to Harrow, {{following}} its current <b>alignment</b> to PA313 before continuing straight along Ridge Road {{and continuing to}} PA412. By 1940, construction of the road into a state highway was completed. In the early 1970s, PA563 was moved to its current <b>alignment</b> north of PA313 {{as a result of}} the creation of Lake Nockamixon, which severed the original <b>alignment.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{database}} of multiple <b>alignments</b> for protein structures (DMAPS) provides instant access to pre-computed multiple structure <b>alignments</b> for all protein structure {{families in the}} Protein Data Bank (PDB).

40|$|Abstract. Correspondences in {{ontology}} <b>alignments</b> relate two ontology entities with a relation. Typical {{relations are}} equivalence or subsumption. However, different systems may need {{different kinds of}} relations. We propose to use the concepts of algebra of relations in order to express the relations between ontology entities in a general way. We show the benefits in doing so in expressing disjunctive relations, merging <b>alignments</b> in different ways, amalgamating <b>alignments</b> with relations of different granularity, and composing <b>alignments.</b> ...|$|R

The original routing of SH-58's southern section began at US-277 in Cyril, continued west through Apache, and turned north at the present-day western intersection of with SH-19. SH-58 continued north along its present <b>alignment</b> to Hydro, where it ended at US-66/SH-1.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} <b>alignment</b> means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, {{there is always}} a good chance that an <b>alignment</b> will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading <b>alignment</b> programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made simply because of the heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence <b>alignment</b> viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of <b>alignment</b> for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the <b>alignment</b> to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' <b>alignment</b> suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E

5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments.

5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal <b>alignment</b> solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the <b>alignment</b> of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global <b>alignment,</b> but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local <b>alignment.</b>|$|E

On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely.
