The Kirkus Reviews noted that the book emphasizes the [...] "chilling account of the murderous growth of Mexican drug cartels", and concluded that El Narco is a [...] "valuable contribution to {{the literature of the}} Drug War". The weekly television show known as Dan Rather Reports, that airs on HDNet, noted that El Narco is [...] "riveting, authoritative reporting from {{the front lines of the}} Mexican drug wars". It argued that the book shows how the Mexican drug war has [...] "explosive potential consequences for every American, and Ioan Grillo's book shows you why".

Does the impact of outward investment differ by the level of development of the destination country of the FDI? Using a difference-in-difference approach, we assess the impact of starting to invest in less <b>advanced</b> <b>countries,</b> of investing in more <b>advanced</b> <b>countries,</b> and of changing the direction of one’s investment from more to less advanced nations. To obtain suitable control groups in each case, we use the propensity score method to select national firms that ex post did not make investment decisions even though ex ante they would have been equally likely to each multinational. We find that moving to less <b>advanced</b> <b>countries</b> (as an initial foreign investment or as a redirection of previous investment) decreases a company’s employment growth rate. On the other hand, moving to more <b>advanced</b> <b>countries</b> does not affect employment growth in any significant way. multinationals...|$|R

6000|$|The reader {{may depend}} on it that I laughed heartily at this rhapsody; for I could hardly enter into my uncle's feelings. Albany is {{certainly}} a very good sort of a place, and relatively a more respectable-looking town than the [...] "commercial emporium," [...] which, after all, externally, is a mere huge expansion of a very marked mediocrity, with the pretension of a capital in its estimate of itself. But Albany lays no claim to be {{anything more than a}} provincial town, and in that class it is highly placed. By the way, there is nothing in which [...] "our people," [...] to speak idiomatically, more deceive themselves, than in their estimate of what composes a capital. It would be ridiculous to suppose that the representatives of such a government as this could impart to any place the tone, opinions, habits and manners of a capital, for, if they did, they would impart it on the novel principle of communicating that which they do not possess in their own persons. Congress itself, though tolerably free from most shackles, including those of the Constitution, is not up to that. In my opinion, a man accustomed to the world might be placed blindfolded in the most finished quarter of New York, and the place has new quarters in which the incongruities I have already mentioned do not exist, and, my life on it, he could pronounce, as soon as the bandage was removed, that he was not in a town were the tone of a capital exists. The last thing to make a capital is trade. Indeed, the man who hears the words [...] "business" [...] and [...] "the merchants" [...] ringing in his ears, may safely conclude, de facto, that he is not in a capital. Now a New York village is often much less rustic than the villages of the most <b>advanced</b> <b>country</b> of Europe; but a New York town is many degrees below any capital of a large state in the old world.|$|E

Drawing upon previous work, we show that developing country agricultural exports increase substantially from the liberalization of agricultural trade, {{that the effects of}} reform impact countries differentially because of differences in world trade patterns, and that the dynamic gains from trade can greatly dominate the static gains from trade. These gains also spillover to the <b>advance</b> <b>countries.</b> We conclude that removing market distortions in <b>advanced</b> <b>countries</b> {{is in the interest of}} all countries.
