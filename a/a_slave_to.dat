5|$|Vortigaunts are {{a fictional}} extra-dimensional {{species in the}} Half-Life series of video games by Valve Corporation. In Half-Life and its three expansions, Vortigaunts are {{frequently}} encountered by the player as hostile non-player characters in Half-Life and later as allies in Half-Life 2. The Vortigaunts are depicted in Half-Life as being an enslaved race in an alternative dimension called Xen, subservient to a large creature called the Nihilanth, which itself is <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> undisclosed masters. In Half-Life 2, the Vortigaunts have broken free of their slavery, and actively assist the player and other humans in resisting the Combine occupation of Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1511 the Spanish caravel Santa María de la Barca sailed {{along the}} Central American coast {{under the command}} of Pedro de Valdivia. The ship foundered upon a reef somewhere off Jamaica. There were just twenty {{survivors}} from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero. They set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats and after thirteen days, during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán. There they were seized by Halach Uinik, a Maya lord. Captain Vildivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing, together with five or six of their shipmates. Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord, who took them prisoner and kept them as slaves. After a time, Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal. Guerrero became completely Mayanised and by 1514 Guerrero had achieved the rank of nacom, a war leader who served against Nachan Chan's enemies.|$|E
5|$|Vortigaunts {{are very}} {{intelligent}} and social creatures. In Half-Life, {{they serve as}} basic ground units for the Xen forces, often supporting heavier troops fighting the player and the humans in the Black Mesa Research Facility. They are capable of developing intelligent strategies and tactics to take on their enemies. Initially, Vortigaunts are enslaved to the Nihilanth, a large creature on Xen, who, in turn, claims it is <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> unknown superiors. On Xen, the Vortigaunts are used as factory workers and drones. In Half-Life 2, Vortigaunts indicate that this slavery has lasted for generations. Despite this, Vortigaunts are shown to have developed an intellectual culture, valuing poetry, music and philosophy. In addition, Vortigaunts practise the husbandry of antlions, large insectoids that live in underground hives, as an ancestral tradition. The death of the Nihilanth {{at the hands of}} Gordon Freeman at the end of Half-Life frees the Vortigaunts from their slavery; consequently the Vortigaunts see Freeman as a messianic figure.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy VI {{features}} fourteen permanent playable characters, {{the most}} of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The starting character, Terra Branford, is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love. Other primary characters include Locke Cole, a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; Celes Chere, a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; Edgar Roni Figaro, a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners; Sabin Rene Figaro, Edgar's brother, who fled the royal court in order to pursue his own path and hone his martial arts skills; Cyan Garamonde, a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends as a result of Kefka poisoning the kingdom's water supply; Setzer Gabbiani, a habitual gambler and thrill seeker and owner of the world's only airship; Shadow, a ninja mercenary, who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners at various stages throughout the game; Relm Arrowny, a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; Strago Magus, Relm's elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage; Gau, a feral child surviving since infancy in the harsh wilderness known as the Veldt; Mog, a Moogle from the mines of Narshe; Umaro, a savage but loyal sasquatch also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog's persuasion; and Gogo, a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry.|$|E
5|$|In 1511 the Spanish caravel Santa María de la Barca {{set sail}} along the Central American coast {{under the command}} of Pedro de Valdivia. The ship was sailing to Santo Domingo from Darién to inform the colonial {{authorities}} there of ongoing conflict between conquistadors Diego de Nicuesa and Vasco Nuñez de Balboa in Darién. The ship foundered upon a reef known as Las Víboras ("The Vipers") or, alternatively, Los Alacranes ("The Scorpions"), somewhere off Jamaica. There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero. They set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats, with bad oars and no sail; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán. There they were seized by Halach Uinik, a Maya lord. Captain Vildivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing, together with five or six of their shipmates. Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord who was an enemy of Halach Uinik; he took them prisoner and kept them as slaves. After a time, Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal. Guerrero became completely Mayanised and served his new lord with such loyalty that he was married to one of Nachan Chan's daughters, Zazil Ha, by whom he had three children. By 1514, Guerrero had achieved the rank of nacom, a war leader who served against Nachan Chan's enemies.|$|E

25|$|During the High Renaissance, {{concepts}} {{derived from}} classical antiquity were developed and used with greater surety. The most representative architect is Bramante (1444–1514) who expanded {{the applicability of}} classical architecture to contemporary buildings. His San Pietro in Montorio (1503) was directly inspired by circular Roman temples. He was, however, hardly <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> the classical forms {{and it was his}} style that was to dominate Italian architecture in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|One tradition, {{going back}} to Aristotle, holds that Alcman came to Sparta as <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> the family of Agesidas (= Hagesidamus?), by whom he was {{eventually}} emancipated because of his great skill. Aristotle reported that it was believed Alcman died from a pustulant infestation of lice (phthiriasis), but {{he may have been}} mistaken for the philosopher Alcmaeon of Croton. According to Pausanias, he is buried in Sparta next to the tomb of Helen of Troy.|$|E
25|$|Carpenters Thomas South and Thomas Davis, {{who were}} tried separately, had been conscripted by Bellamy – {{forced to choose}} between a life of piracy or death. Therefore, they were acquitted of all charges and spared the gallows. The last {{survivor}} was a 16-year-old Miskito Indian named John Julian – who was a skilled navigator, and also Whydah's pilot. He was not tried, but instead was sold as <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> (<b>to</b> John Quincy Adams's great grandfather) after his capture, and finally hanged 16 years later.|$|E

Dabney, the father of the chief engineer of that railroad, in 1850. Since 2007, the city of Leeds has honored John Henry's legend during an annual September festival, held on the third weekend in September, called the Leeds Downtown Folk Festival & John Henry Celebration.|$|E
25|$|While {{each state}} {{had its own}} slave code, many {{concepts}} were shared throughout the slave states. According to the slave codes, {{some of which were}} passed in reaction to slave rebellions, teaching <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> read or write was illegal. This prohibition was unique to American slavery, believed to reduce slaves forming aspirations that could lead to escape or rebellion. Informal education occurred when white children taught slave companions what they were learning; in other cases, adult slaves learned from free artisan workers, especially if located in cities, where there was more freedom of movement.|$|E
25|$|According to the Confessio of Patrick, when he {{was about}} 16, he was {{captured}} by Irish pirates from his home in Britain and taken as <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> Ireland, looking after animals; he lived there for six years before escaping and returning to his family. After becoming a cleric, he returned to northern and western Ireland. In later life, he served as a bishop, but {{little is known about the}} places where he worked. By the seventh century, he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.|$|E

According to one report {{he was involved in}} the design of a vertical-axis windmill. His master allowed him to live in his own household in the Islamic capital of Medina (although according to Ibn Sa'd, Mughira ibn Shu'ba, his owner who was also the governor of Basra, had written to 'Umar from Kufa; and then 'Umar had given Mughira special permission to send Pirūz to Medina, since captives were not permitted to live in Medina).|$|E
25|$|Valerius Gratus, {{the fourth}} Roman prefect of Judaea, passes by Judah's house. As Judah watches the {{procession}} from his rooftop, a loose roof tile happens {{to fall and}} hit the governor. Messala betrays Judah, who is quickly captured and accused of attempting to murder Gratus. There is no trial; Judah's entire family is secretly imprisoned in the Antonia Fortress and all their property is seized. As he is taken away, Judah vows vengeance against the Romans. He is sent as <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> <b>to</b> work aboard a Roman warship. On the journey to the ship, he meets a young carpenter named Jesus, who offers him water, which deeply moves Judah and strengthens his resolve to survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of a}} trafficker is to turn a {{human being}} into <b>a</b> <b>slave.</b> <b>To</b> do this, {{perpetrators}} employ tactics {{that can lead to}} the psychological consequence of learned helplessness for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives. Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.|$|E
