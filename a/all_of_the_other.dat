5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the golden jackal form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals from <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, which indicates that India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant golden jackal lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia provided a refuge when compared with the surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum {{and the beginning of the}} warming cycles, the golden jackal lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.|$|E

The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for {{a certain amount of}} time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time.

5|$|As the Australians boasted {{the three}} fastest {{swimmers}} {{in the individual}} 100-metre freestyle event, they were clear favourites for the corresponding relay, especially as Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> swimmers. Leech was not assured of {{a place in the}} final quartet. In the heats, Fraser and Crapp were rested and the remaining four swimmers, Sandra Morgan, Elizabeth Fraser, Gibson and Leech qualified the team. Leech swam the second leg in 1 minute 5.9 seconds, the second fastest of the Australians, thereby securing her position in the final along with Sandra Morgan, who recorded a time of 1 minute 5.4 seconds. Australia won the second heat by 3.1 seconds to qualify quickest for the final. They were 1.8 and 2.3 seconds faster than South Africa and the United States, respectively, both of whom swam in the first heat. The selection of Leech and Morgan generated controversy. They were Australia's youngest swimmers and lacked experience at open level competition: Morgan had false started twice at the Australian Championships, and both had competed at national level only once.|$|E

The British destroyers attempted to withdraw to the west, but were pursued by the German ships.

More hits to the ship's bridge and superstructure set her on fire, mortally wounded Captain Warburton-Lee and killed or wounded <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> officers on the bridge except Paymaster Lieutenant G.H.

Some of the crew delayed doing so until the last torpedo was fruitlessly fired at a German ship and No. 4 gun fired until it was out of ammunition.|$|E
