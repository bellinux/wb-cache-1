5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E
25|$|I {{think back}} to Poirot’s last words in the scene before he dies. That second ‘Cher ami’ was for someone other than Hastings. It was for my dear, dear friend Poirot. I was saying goodbye to him as well — <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it with all my heart.|$|E
60|$|As {{we looked}} full at one another, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> my breath come quicker in my {{strong desire to}} get {{something}} out of him. <b>And</b> as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that it came quicker, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that he saw that it came quicker, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> pain, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> ire; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a {{determination}} to subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered {{them back to their}} source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: <b>I</b> sat down <b>and</b> leaned over the pillow.|$|R
60|$|Ham {{glanced at}} me, <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a shock {{that struck me}} back.|$|R
25|$|In her 1973 book To Take Arms: My Life With the IRA Provisionals, former IRA member Maria McGuire {{described}} her sentiments following the Donegall Street bombing,"I admit {{at the time}} I did not connect {{with the people who}} were killed or injured in such explosions. I always judged such deaths in terms of the effect they would have on our support - <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that this in turn depended on how many people accepted our explanation".|$|E
25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Grace, [...] "I liked you! <b>I</b> {{was young}} <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was {{entitled}} to love a man who loved me, if I wanted, but couldn't use my right. Then, not long since, when you were so grave <b>and</b> just, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had been cheated worse." ...|$|R
60|$|She hesitated, muffled {{from head}} to foot, shadowy <b>and</b> bashful. <b>I</b> {{advanced}} another pace, <b>and</b> how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> is nobody's business.|$|R
60|$|The routing of Sam {{had left}} me alert <b>and</b> self-confident. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> no embarrassment. <b>I</b> greeted her briskly.|$|R
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the outcome, Rosolie {{explained}} that the anaconda [...] " [...] my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm. I started to feel the blood drain out of my hand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the bone flex. And when I {{got to the point}} where I felt like it was going to snap, I had to tap out." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Elson, an English support official, {{commented on}} the large {{swimming}} crowds [...] " [...] For many, {{this must have been}} a first introduction to swimming by the paralysed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that many were wondering whether paralysed persons could swim 50 metres– how many would fail to make the distance and it was all just a stunt to enlist their sympathies and raise money". [...] The crowd's thunderous applause made the official more comfortable about the event.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like a cur! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> {{so every}} time the thing had recurred to my mind, I may as well confess. <b>I</b> flushed hotly <b>and</b> said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{his strong}} hands close over {{my fingers and}} remove them one by one. His head was quite close to mine, <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> his mustache brush my cheek.|$|R
60|$|Instinctively <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that he {{was both}} unscrupulous <b>and</b> untrustworthy. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{that he was}} seeking me for ends of his own, {{and all the time}} I was half afraid of him.|$|R
500|$|In October, 2010, CNN {{employee}} Rosemary Fitzpatrick {{was subject}} to a personal search after her underwire bra set off a metal detector. The TSA security official applied an invasive [...] "hand-sliding inspection" [...] during which she [...] "ran her hands around her breasts, over her stomach, buttocks and her inner thighs, and even touched her most private areas." [...] Fitzpatrick said that she cried during the experience. [...] "I felt helpless, I felt violated, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> humiliated." ...|$|E
500|$|Relegation changed Gunn's {{mind about}} taking the Norwich job. He {{had decided not to}} {{continue}} in the role if Norwich had remained in The Championship, and would have tried to land a job with Norwich that would have allowed more time to be spent with his family. However, [...] "Relegation was a failure <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> I couldn’t quit then. I felt I had to do everything I could to put things right, if I was given the chance. And I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next thing}} I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> {{already had a}} powder-horn <b>and</b> bullets, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself well {{supplied}} with arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{could there}} be to tell," [...] she asked, [...] "except {{that it was all}} horrible, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> things--felt dangers--which <b>I</b> couldn't describe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed!" [...] <b>I</b> exclaimed earnestly. <b>And</b> indeed <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> as if {{one could}} not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice.|$|R
500|$|As most of {{the main}} cast was not from the Orthodox community, Burshtein {{instructed}} them to attend {{all of the major}} events that take place within the film, including a wedding and a circumcision. Yaron commented, [...] " [...] it was so intense and [...] was crying and she was really in it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like she was my sister because I'm going to be like her in a while. So it was really helpful to experience all these things and to see how it is and to feel a part of it actually." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarke first {{developed}} {{the idea for}} Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell while she was teaching in Bilbao: [...] "I {{had a kind of}} waking dream...about a man in 18th-century clothes in a place rather like Venice, talking to some English tourists. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> strongly that he had some sort of magical background– he'd been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong." [...] She had also recently reread J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and afterward was inspired to [...] " [...] writing a novel of magic and fantasy".|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they took}} me and led me forth. With bowed head I went, looking not up, <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> their eyes burn upon my face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, lady, you do {{not know}} the grief <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> when <b>I</b> was made acquainted with your terrible loss. I knew your dear husband in Rome, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> for him a most {{profound}} affection and esteem.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland's {{grasp of}} her hand grew tighter. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "there are times when one must talk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> that; but <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> too, that, if I could wait, {{there would be a}} change." ...|$|R
500|$|During the {{production}} of THX 1138 (1971), producer Francis Ford Coppola challenged co-writer/director George Lucas to write a script that would appeal to mainstream audiences. Lucas embraced the idea, using his early 1960s teenage experiences cruising in Modesto, California. [...] "Cruising was gone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> compelled to document the whole experience and what my generation used {{as a way of}} meeting girls," [...] Lucas explained. As he developed the story in his mind, Lucas included his fascination with Wolfman Jack. Lucas had considered doing a documentary about the Wolfman when he attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts, but dropped the idea.|$|E
500|$|Clarke first {{developed}} {{the idea for}} Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell during a year spent teaching English in Bilbao, Spain: [...] "I {{had a kind of}} waking dream...about a man in 18th-century clothes in a place rather like Venice, talking to some English tourists. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> strongly that he had some sort of magical background– he'd been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong."

500|$|Although Al Pacino was Beatty's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Alphonse [...] "Big Boy" [...] Caprice, Robert De Niro was under consideration. Madonna pursued the part of Breathless Mahoney, {{offering}} to work for scale. Her resulting paycheck for the film was just $35,000. Sean Young claims she was forced out of the role of Tess Truehart (which eventually went to Glenne Headly) after rebuffing sexual advances from Beatty. In a 1989 statement, Beatty said, [...] "I made a mistake casting Sean Young in the part <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very badly about it." [...] Mike Mazurki, who had appeared in Dick Tracy (1945) had a cameo.|$|E
60|$|My spirit quailed {{under those}} last words; <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> an immense relief {{at the same}} time, as if some {{overwhelming}} burden had been lifted from me.|$|R
60|$|On, on! I groaned {{with the}} {{violence}} of my effort. <b>I</b> staggered again <b>and</b> swore. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the concussions of great guns tear past me through the murk.|$|R
60|$|You see I am {{a pretty}} well-sized man myself, <b>and,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{confidence}} in my strength, my stick, and the goodness of my cause, I was bold.|$|R
