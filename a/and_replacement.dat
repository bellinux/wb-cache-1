40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} compare the {{clinical}} profile and outcomes of operations for aortic valve disease and ascending aortic aneurysm in patients treated with aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta or composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta (Bentall operation). MethodsFrom 1990 through 2001, 133 patients had aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta, and 452 patients had Bentall operations. Aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta was performed in patients who had aortic valve disease and dilation of the ascending aorta, whereas the Bentall operation was performed in patients with aortic root abnormality and ascending aortic aneurysm. Mean follow-up was 4. 6 ± 3. 1 years and was 100 % complete. ResultsPatients who had aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta were older (61 ± 13 vs 52 ± 16 years, P <. 001) {{and more likely to}} have aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and mitral valve disease than those who had Bentall operations. The use of mechanical valves was equal in both groups (42 % for aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta and 43 % for the Bentall operation). Operative mortality was 5 % for patients undergoing aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta and 4 % for patients undergoing the Bentall operation (P =. 45). Survival at 10 years was 57 % ± 8 % for patients undergoing aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta and 74 % ± 4 % for patients undergoing the Bentall operation (P =. 04), but the type of operation had no effect on survival. Older age, moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction, active endocarditis, previous cardiac surgery, and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of death. The freedom from reoperation at 10 years was 95 % ± 5 % for patients undergoing aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta and 94 % ± 3 % for patients undergoing the Bentall operation (P =. 18). Reoperations were mostly because of tissue valve failure or endocarditis. The risk of valve-related complications was the same in both groups. No patient required reoperation for aortic root aneurysm after having aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta. ConclusionsAortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta and the Bentall operation provide comparable long-term results. The Bentall operation is more appropriate for patients with aortic root abnormality and a dilated ascending aorta, whereas aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>and</b> supracoronary <b>replacement</b> of the ascending aorta is a perfectly acceptable operation for patients with aortic valve disease, normal or mildly dilated aortic sinuses, and a dilated ascending aorta...|$|R

5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did, and UN superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks.
