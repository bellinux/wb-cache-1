5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{the sources}} and the {{influencing}} factors for indoor bioaerosols, corresponding remedial actions {{can be taken}} to control related contamination. Potentially effective strategies include: 1) limiting entrance of outdoor aerosols; 2) keeping the relative humidity level below high levels (<60%); 3) installing appropriate filtration devices to <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> to inlet filtered outdoor air into indoor environment; 4) reducing/removing contaminant sources (i.e., indoor organic waste). As in the U.S., due to the increase in tuberculosis in the mid-1980s, indoor air treatment has developed substantially during the past two decades. Current or developing indoor air purification technologies include filtration, aerosol ultraviolet irradiation, electrostatic precipitation, unipolar ion emission, and photocatalytic oxidation.|$|E

50|$|According to {{previous}} studies, major indoor environmental factors influencing bioaerosol concentration include relative humidity, characteristics of air ventilation systems, seasonal variation, temperature, and chemical {{composition of the}} air. Other factors, such as the type of home, building material, geographical factors, {{do not seem to}} have significant impacts on respirable fungi and bacteria (important constituents of bioaerosols). Relative humidity {{is one of the most}} widely studied influencing factors for indoor bioaerosols. Concentrations of two categories of bioaerosols, endotoxin and airborne fungi, are both positively related to indoor relative humidity (higher concentration associated with higher relative humidity). Relative humidity also affects the infectivity of airborne viruses. Regarding the characterization of <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> <b>system,</b> increased use of central air conditioning is found to be associated with lower fungal bioaerosol concentration.|$|E

These experiments cover aerosol particles with sizes ranging from 2 to 12 micron and airflow rates of 0. 41 mm 3 /s (Re= 1950) and 1. 7 mm 3 /s (Re= 8050).
