25|$|My {{sister was}} slim and {{beautiful}} and friendly, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E

500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I think he would have loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> came, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Đurić {{was drafted}} into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{at the age of}} 17, and became an officer during his service. With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. Đurić recalls: [...] "My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it hit my home directly. A really big bomb <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died instantly [...] So many people like me lost mothers and fathers in this bloody civil war but for me I hold no grudges. I don’t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child." [...] With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, Đurić left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The breakup of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He wandered through the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league.|$|E

500|$|The jingle {{was first}} sung {{in the early}} 1930s on the Goodie Reeve radio show by three-year-old Jennifer Paykel. As the {{commercials}} were broadcast live, Paykel {{was taken to the}} studio two or three times per week to sing the jingle. Paykel's mother did not renew her contract because, according to Paykel, [...] "Shirley Temple was all the rage <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was terrified I might become a public figure like her". Aeroplane Jelly held a talent quest in Sydney to find a new singer and the competition was won by five-year-old Joy King. King recorded the jingle in 1937.|$|E
500|$|In June 1873, however, when Owen was 16, {{his father}} died a financially ruined man, due to the Panic of 1873, which struck the {{consolidating}} railroads especially hard. Writing in 1934, Owen described the family's hard times: [...] "the value of my father's property was completely destroyed, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> from a life of abundance, was suddenly compelled to earn her living by teaching music." [...] With support from scholarships, initially obtained via his mother's contacts, but subsequently including the 1876 merit-based President's scholarship, Owen graduated in 1877 as valedictorian from Washington and Lee University. He also received the University's gold medal for debating prowess. His older brother, William Otway Owen Jr. (1854–1924), meanwhile, attended the Virginia Military Institute and the University of Virginia, {{and went on to}} a medical career with the U.S. Army, eventually retiring with the rank of Colonel.|$|E
500|$|Work on Hooper's next film, The King's Speech, {{began in}} the same year. Hooper explained: [...] "It was a stage play, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> who's Australian was invited to a fringe [...] reading in London because she's part of the Australian community. The play's about the {{relationship}} between King George the Sixth and his Australian speech therapist. She came back and said 'you've got to read this play,' and I read it and it was brilliant ...". Hooper cast Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and spent three weeks with the actors reading the script and rehearsing. Principal photography took place on location around the UK from November 2009 to January 2010. During editing, Hooper continued to consult with Firth and Rush by sending them cuts of the film and listening to their feedback.|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: [...] "I am a Christian, and I am {{a devout}} Christian. I {{believe in the}} redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be {{cleansed}} of sin and have eternal life." [...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me." ...|$|E
500|$|Her death traumatised {{the teenage}} Lennon and, {{for the next}} two years, he drank heavily and {{frequently}} got into fights, consumed by a [...] "blind rage". It contributed to the emotional difficulties that haunted him for much of his life, but also served to draw him closer to McCartney, who had also lost his mother at an early age. Julia's memory inspired songs such as the 1968 Beatles song [...] "Julia", with its dreamlike imagery of [...] "hair of floating sky glimmering", recalling Lennon's boyhood memories of his mother. Lennon remarked that the song [...] "was sort of a combination of Yoko [...] <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> blended into one". [...] "Mother" [...] and [...] "My Mummy's Dead" [...] were both written under the influence of Arthur Janov's [...] "Primal Scream" [...] therapy, and released on his solo album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band in 1970. Lennon's first son, Julian, born in 1963, was named after her.|$|E
500|$|Al Williamson {{was born}} in Manhattan, New York City, New York, one of two {{children}} of Sally and Alfonso Williamson, who was of Scottish descent and a Colombian citizen. The family relocated to Bogotá, Colombia, when Al was two years old. [...] "My father was Colombian <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was American," [...] Williamson said in 1997. [...] "They met in the States, got married and went down there. I grew up down there so I learned both English and Spanish at the same time. It was comic books that taught me to read both languages." [...] At age nine, Williamson {{took an interest in}} comic strips via the Mexican magazine Paquin, which featured American strips as well as Underwater Empire by Argentine cartoonist Carlos Clemen. Later, Williamson was attracted to Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon strip after his mother took him to see the Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe movie serial. While living in Bogotá he met future cartoonist Adolfo Buylla, who befriended him and gave him artistic advice. At age 12, in 1943, Williamson moved with his mother to San Francisco, California; they later moved to New York.|$|E

500|$|Brooks {{was born}} James Lawrence Brooks on May 9, 1940 in Brooklyn, New York, United States, {{and raised in}} North Bergen, New Jersey. His parents, Dorothy Helen (née Sheinheit) and Edward M. Brooks, were both {{salespeople}} (his mother sold children's clothes; his father furniture). The Brooks family was Jewish; Edward Brooks changed his surname from Bernstein and claimed to be Irish. Brooks' father abandoned his mother {{when he found out}} she was pregnant with him, and lost contact with his son when Brooks was twelve. During the pregnancy, Brooks' father sent his wife a postcard stating that [...] "If it's a boy, name him Jim." [...] His mother died when he was 22. He has described his early life as [...] "tough" [...] with a [...] "broken home, [...] poor and sort of lonely, that sort of stuff", later adding: [...] "My father was sort of in-and-out <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> worked long hours, so there was no choice but for me to be alone in the apartment a lot." [...] He has an older sister, Diane, who helped look after him as a child and to whom he dedicated As Good As It Gets.|$|E
500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Sevigny became rebellious: [...] "I was very well-mannered, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was very strict. But I did {{hang out at}} the Mobil station and smoke cigarettes." [...] Between her junior and {{senior year of high}} school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing better to do, so I made my own clothes." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Oxford University in 1995, Beckinsale starred in Cold Comfort Farm as Flora Poste, a newly {{orphaned}} 1930s socialite sent {{to live with}} distant family members in rural England. The John Schlesinger-directed film was an adaptation of Stella Gibbons's novel and also featured Joanna Lumley, Eileen Atkins, Ian McKellen, Rufus Sewell and Stephen Fry. Beckinsale was initially considered too young, but was cast after she wrote a pleading letter to the director. Emanuel Levy of Variety was reminded of [...] "the strength of a young Glenda Jackson and the charm of a young Julie Christie." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times classed the actress as [...] "yet another of those effortlessly skilled British beauties who light up the screen." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times felt she played the role [...] "with the perfect snippy aplomb." [...] The film grossed over $5 million at the US box office. Also in 1995, she appeared in Haunted, a ghost story in which Derek Elley of Variety felt she [...] "holds the screen, with both physical looks and verbal poise." [...] 1995 also saw Beckinsale's first professional stage appearance as Nina in The Seagull at Theatre Royal, Bath. She became romantically involved with co-star Michael Sheen after meeting during play rehearsals. [...] "He was the young lion of the theatre." [...] "I was all revved up to feel very intimidated. It was my first-ever play <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had cut out reviews of him in previous productions. And then he walked in ... It was almost like, 'God, well, I'm finished now. That's it, then.'... He's the most outrageously talented person I've ever met." [...] Irving Wardle of The Independent felt that [...] "the casting, including Michael Sheen's volcanic Kostya and Kate Beckinsale's steadily freezing Nina, is mainly spot-on." [...] In early 1996, she starred in two further plays; Sweetheart at the Royal Court Theatre and Clocks and Whistles at the Bush Theatre.|$|E

50|$|Nathalie Roussel (born 14 September 1956) is a French actress of stage, {{television}} and film. She {{is best known}} for her role in the 1991 films <b>My</b> Father's Glory <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother's</b> Castle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Bounce," [...] said he, as he {{lay down}} and pulled his blanket over his shoulder, [...] "are the horses hobbled and the rifles loaded, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> hump out o' the way of wolves?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Espuelas said to The Industry Standard, [...] "As a kid I had {{to leave}} my home country, Uruguay, when my parents got {{divorced}} <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> couldn't support herself. We lost everything overnight, so {{we came to the}} United States. For 10 years we lived in a one-bedroom apartment, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> worked 12 hours a day. It is not that these types of experiences make you a better person, but they give you a different perspective on failure. I've seen people older than I go into panic mode and lose confidence in themselves because of tough market conditions, thinking that it's the end of the world. Personally, I always know I'll be able to survive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oglala Sioux Black Elk {{recounted the}} exodus this way: [...] "We fled all night, {{following}} the Greasy Grass.

6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was to explain poor Frank's conduct at the races. Perhaps, as the {{servants}} at Revelrig {{had no knowledge of}} you, it may have been returned, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> letter have been left untouched. I will see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} are not rich; but {{we are not}} poor, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> family {{is one of the oldest}} in Kentucky." [...] She uttered this with a touch of her mother's quiet dignity. [...] "Your father need not despise us." ...|$|R
