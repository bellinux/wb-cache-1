50|$|In 1902, Falmouth School of Art was {{a wholly}} private venture and offered classes such as Freehand Drawing, Model Drawing, Painting from Still Life, <b>Drawing</b> from the <b>Antique,</b> <b>Drawing</b> in Light & Shade, and Memory Drawing of Plant Form.

50|$|The series {{takes its}} name from a {{causeway}} on the Isle of Skye, utilising a selection of historical processes to depict the landscape and highlight early artistic depictions and distortions of the Scottish landscape. Boyd used a series of <b>antique</b> <b>drawing</b> devices such as a black mirror and a camera lucida to make sketches, as well as drawing from memory. These drawings were then used as a basis from which to edit and manipulate photographic images also made at each location, exploring ideas of phenomenology, and questioning perception and authenticity in Scottish Art.|$|R
25|$|The {{technique}} of heating and <b>drawing</b> <b>glass</b> into fine fibers {{has been used}} for millennia. The use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent.

A very minor industry in blown glass beads also existed in 19th-century Venice and France.|$|R

50|$|Eugène Siberdt was {{a typical}} {{representative}} of the late-Romantic style as developed in Belgium by pupils and teachers of the Antwerp Academy. In particular, the influence of Henri Leys remained paramount at the Academy throughout {{the second half of}} the 19th century in style as well as subject matter. The teachers at the Academy encouraged their students to study the <b>antique,</b> <b>draw</b> precisely and stick to the sober and somber palette typical of 19th century academic painting. The conflict between Siberdt and van Gogh is best seen as a conflict between van Gogh's unconventional view of art and the academic view represented by Siberdt.|$|R

50|$|Glass {{of lower}} quality, <b>drawn</b> <b>glass,</b> {{was made by}} drawing upwards {{from a pool of}} molten glass a thin sheet, held at the edges by rollers.

5000|$|The base of {{the ribbon}} is {{shielded}} from heat radiation from the fused glass so that it continues to hold the shape imparted to it by the Debiteuse. This cooling preserves the rectangular {{cross section of the}} <b>drawn</b> <b>glass</b> by cooling the ribbon glass below the temperature where it would collapse into a column or break back into the melted glass. It is especially important to shield the outside edges of the ribbon from heat so that they are firmer and will hold the rest of the ribbon in a proper shape. In some cases manufacturers will allow the edges to form thicker [...] "bulbs", which are removed after final cutting.|$|R

40|$|The {{silylation}} of {{the surface}} of sodium borosilicate glass was investigated under conditions that might {{be applied to the}} fabrication of ion-selective microelectrodes of the liquid membrane type such as are used in physiology, Silylation was carried out for 15 min at different temperatures and with six different silanes.
