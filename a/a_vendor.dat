5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to <b>a</b> <b>vendor</b> of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E

5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from <b>a</b> <b>vendor.</b> Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{important}} {{locations are}} {{located within the}} world: these include Terminals that give access to a fast travel system; the Junk Shop, which acts as <b>a</b> <b>vendor</b> for buying and selling items; Rag's Jewelry, where gems collected during gameplay can be traded for rare items and unique demons; and the Fountain of Life, where the Protagonist and other party members can receive treatment for ailments, heal them of damage, or revive characters knocked out in battle. An optional location separate from the Vortex World is the Amala Labyrinth, accessed after the Protagonist has reached {{a certain point in}} the story. The Labyrinth is a dungeon divided into multiple floors or Kalpa, each housing both demon enemies and brokers which sell demons to the Protagonist. Each Kalpa is connected by a Warp Zone, in which the Protagonist can collect currency and items while avoiding or destroying obstacles. Proceeding through the levels of the Labyrinth requires the protagonist to find and fight Fiends carrying Candelabra, which unlock barriers. The Candelabra also act as a means of locating and either engaging or avoiding Fiends.|$|E
5|$|The {{works are}} {{typically}} installed in listening booths with headphones, {{though they were}} also installed in the public streets of Cologne and Helsinki as a commentary on globalization.

The 40-minute installation was exhibited at Cologne's Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum in 2010, and the booth was painted yellow with black stripes and stickers to imitate the hallmarks of the danfo. An outdoor installation at the Cologne Public Library piped the streets of Lagos to those of Cologne. A similar installation took place at Helsinki's Kiasma contemporary art museum.|$|E

At the time of his death, he was walking across London's financial district in an effort to reach the Lindsey Hotel, his way hampered at several points by police lines. The route he took was his usual way home from a newspaper stand on Fish Street Hill outside Monument tube station, where he worked with a friend, Barry Smith.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the tactics}} used by these {{companies}} to [...] "capture" [...] their customers was their proprietary databases. Each had special features {{that the others}} did not.

To move from <b>vendor</b> <b>A's</b> to <b>vendor</b> B's systems usually meant a very expensive re-entry of almost all design data by hand into the new system. This expense of [...] "migration" [...] was the main factor that locked design engineers into using <b>a</b> single <b>vendor.</b>|$|R
