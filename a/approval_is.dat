5|$|Before a {{bill passed}} by the {{legislative}} Houses can become law, the royal assent (the monarch's <b>approval)</b> <b>is</b> required. In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.|$|E
5|$|In the past, a Deshastha widow {{was never}} allowed to remarry, while it was {{acceptable}} for Deshastha widowers to remarry, and the widows had to lead a very austere life with little joy. Divorces were non-existent. All of these practices have gradually fallen by the wayside over the last hundred years, and modern Deshastha widows lead better lives and younger widows also remarry. Divorce takes place by mutual consent and legal <b>approval</b> <b>is</b> sought.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{has been}} {{promoted}} to Assistant Regional Manager {{and as a result}} is inspired to find ways to be more productive, for himself and the office. However, his ideas for the office are ignored by Andy, leading to a discussion with Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him a possible position. However, as Jim has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her <b>approval,</b> <b>is</b> upset that Jim did not consult her beforehand.|$|E

5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing <b>approval</b> <b>is</b> the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Prohibition on {{titles of}} nobility: The state may not confer titles of nobility, and no citizen may accept such a title without the {{permission}} of the Government (Article 40.2). In practice, governmental <b>approval</b> <b>is</b> usually a formality.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{enacting}} parliamentary bills, {{as a rule}} {{all government}} bills also have to have formal approval by the sovereign and a minister before introduction to parliament. <b>Approval</b> <b>is</b> also given by the council {{to all of the}} sovereign's actions as head of state.|$|E
25|$|Regulations {{regarding}} the commercialisation {{of genetically modified}} crops are mostly conducted by individual countries. For cultivation, environmental approval determines whether a crop can be legally grown.

25|$|In Chile, {{families}} or individuals interested in adopting must apply and {{be approved by}} Sename (National Service for Minors), which keeps the registry of children eligible for adoption.

25|$|Sirens {{must also}} be {{approved}} by local agencies, in some cases. For example, the California Highway Patrol approves specific models for use on emergency vehicles in the state. The <b>approval</b> <b>is</b> important because it ensures the devices perform adequately. Moreover, using unapproved devices could {{be a factor in}} determining fault if a collision occurs.|$|E
25|$|Membership of a co-op is {{typically}} obtained by buying shares {{on the open}} market, most often through a real estate agent. No board <b>approval</b> <b>is</b> needed to buy shares.

25|$|While {{landline}} {{and mobile}} telephone providers {{must also be}} majority-owned by Canadians under the federal Telecommunications Act, the CRTC is not responsible for enforcement of this provision. In fact, the commission does not require licences at all for telephone companies, and CRTC <b>approval</b> <b>is</b> therefore not generally required {{for the sale of}} a telephone company, unless said company also owns a broadcast licence.|$|E
25|$|Dual hormone insulin pumps that infuse either insulin or {{glucagon}}. In {{event of}} hypoglycemia, the glucagon could be triggered {{to increase the}} blood glucose.

The Bionic Pancreas, currently in clinical trials for FDA <b>approval,</b> <b>is</b> a recently developed device designed with this technology in mind.|$|E
25|$|In essence, the {{government}} is promising to protect lenders against 80% of their potential loss, and legitimatizes the investment by first having the DOE review their applications. Moreover, because they are only guarantees, they are not considered government appropriations; no taxpayer dollars are spent unless the loans fall through in a failed investment. Therefore, Congressional <b>approval</b> <b>is</b> thus easier to get.|$|E
