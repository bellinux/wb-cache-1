5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard <b>addition</b> <b>instruction,</b> then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E
50|$|In more {{traditional}} processor architectures, a processor is usually programmed by defining the executed operations and their operands. For example, an <b>addition</b> <b>instruction</b> in a RISC architecture could {{look like the}} following.|$|E
50|$|The {{execution}} {{time for an}} <b>addition</b> <b>instruction</b> ("add the contents of store location x to register y") ranged from 2.5 μs for a 1906 or 1907 with 1.1 μs core store, to 34 μs for a 1901 with 6 μs core store.|$|E
50|$|So, {{users of}} macros {{have to be}} careful because without attention, errors can easily appear (in <b>addition,</b> <b>{{instructions}}</b> like '++x' in imbricated instructions are not very recommended either).|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} simple example {{demonstrates the}} advantage of using SSE. Consider an operation like vector addition, which is used very often in computer graphics applications. To add two single precision, four-component vectors together using x86 requires four floating-point <b>addition</b> <b>instructions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{corresponds}} to four x86 FADD instructions in the object code. On the other hand, {{as the following}} pseudo-code shows, a single 128-bit 'packed-add' instruction can replace the four scalar <b>addition</b> <b>instructions.</b> movaps xmm0, v1xmm0 = v1.w | v1.z | v1.y | v1.x [...] addps xmm0, v2xmm0 = v1.w+v2.w | v1.z+v2.z | v1.y+v2.y | v1.x+v2.x [...] movaps vec_res, xmm0 ...|$|R
50|$|Arithmetic {{instructions}} available include addition, bitwise AND, and bitwise NOT, {{with the}} first two of these able to use both registers and sign-extended immediate values as operands. These operations are sufficient to implement a number of basic arithmetic operations, including subtraction (by negating values) and bitwise left shift (by using the <b>addition</b> <b>instruction</b> to multiply values by two). The LC-3 can also implement any bitwise logical function, because NOT and AND together are logically complete.|$|E
50|$|For example, if an <b>addition</b> <b>instruction</b> {{is to be}} executed, the {{arithmetic}} logic unit (ALU) inputs are connected {{to a pair of}} operand sources (numbers to be summed), the ALU is configured to perform an addition operation so that the sum of its operand inputs will appear at its output, and the ALU output is connected to storage (e.g., a register or memory) that will receive the sum. When the clock pulse occurs, the sum will be transferred to storage and, if the resulting sum is too large (i.e., it is larger than the ALU's output word size), an arithmetic overflow flag will be set.|$|E
50|$|The Bolognese masters whose treatises {{have survived}} shared a greater {{consistency}} of style, terminology and pedagogy {{with each other}} than with fencing masters of the period {{from other parts of}} Italy, thus justifying their treatment as a single school. The Dardi school focused primarily the single-handed side-sword still used for both cutting and thrusting. The side-sword was used in combination with various defensive weapons, including a shield (brocchiero, rotella or targa), a dagger, a gauntlet or a cape. The two-handed sword or spadone was also still taught, although losing its prominence. In <b>addition,</b> <b>instruction</b> on fighting with the poleaxe and other polearms was given.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal <b>addition</b> <b>instructions</b> adds {{adjacent}} {{values in}} the input vector to each other. The output size in the instructions below describes how wide the horizontal addition performed is. For instance horizontal byte to word adds two bytes {{at a time and}} returns the result as vector of words, but byte to quadword adds eight bytes together at a time and returns the result as vector of quadwords. Six additional horizontal <b>addition</b> and subtraction <b>instructions</b> can be found in SSSE3, but they operate on two input vectors and only does two and two operations.|$|R

30|$|Instruction (i.e., coaching) is {{a typical}} {{training}} method for increasing swing speed and developing the kinetic chain. This is because coaches can confirm swing mechanics in real time and provide instructions for improvement. However, coaches tend to provide qualitative instruction. Thus, {{it is often difficult}} to understand coaches’ intention because they instruct with vague expressions such as “onomatopoeia” or “mimetic word”. In <b>addition,</b> <b>instruction</b> is often based on the coach’s experiences.

40|$|Abstract: Floating-point unit is an {{integral}} part of any modern microprocessor. The fused multiply add (FMA) operation is important in many scientific and engineering applications. With the advancement in FPGA architecture latency has been the important focus of attention in order to improve performance. To improve the performance, two single-precision operations can be performed concurrently with one double-precision data path, which is very useful in multimedia and even scientific applications. Moreover, to reduce the additional area costs for supporting two single-precision operations in parallel, multiple double-precision units, i. e., the multiplier, shifter and adder, are reused as much as possible. In addition, in case of FADD instructions, the multiplier in the first stage is bypassed and kept in stable mode, which can significantly improve fused <b>addition</b> <b>instruction</b> performance and lower power consumption. The paper claims an estimated 15 - 20 % reduction in latency as compared to a conventional fused multiply add (FMA) ...|$|E
40|$|We present here a new {{algorithm}} for accelerating volume rendering with an orthographic projection. Because volume rendering handles huge data sets, {{a reduction}} in the computational cost of voxel projection is required to obtain interactive volume rendering. We satisfy this issue by using the possibilities of orthographic projection that allows the quantization of voxel positions by subdividing the pixels. The same projection properties are given for all the voxels with the center falling within the same pixel subdivision. In contrast with classical algorithms that require several instructions to compute either the next traversed voxel or the next rasterized pixel, our method needs only one <b>addition</b> <b>instruction</b> and one addressing instruction that is sufficient to determine one projected pixel. Splatting can also have a decisive advantage of it. Our algorithm is well suited for low-end platforms when no hardware acceleration is available. Experimental results show that our rendering rate is better than other existing methods.

5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, the {{performance}} gains have mostly been made {{through the use}} of additional [...] "functional units", which allow some instructions to run in parallel. For instance, two <b>addition</b> <b>instructions</b> working on different data can be run at the same time, effectively doubling the speed of the program. Modern CPUs generally have dozens of such units, some for integer math and logic, some for floating point math, some for long-data words and others for dealing with memory and other housekeeping chores. However, most programs do not work on independent data, but instead use the outputs of one calculation as the input to another. This limits the set of instructions that can be run in parallel to some factor based on how many instructions the processor is able to examine on-the-fly. The level of instruction parallelism quickly plateaued by the mid-2000s.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} cognitive {{relationships between the}} fair-share and center-of-balance conceptualizations of the arithmetic mean. It also hypothesized {{the use of these}} conceptualizations as blending spaces for the mathematical and statistical domains within a proposed knowledge structure for the arithmetic mean. Twenty-nine undergraduate liberal arts students completed pre/post verbal protocols with written solutions to arithmetic mean problems. The problems emphasized either the fair-share or center-of-balance conceptualization, or mathematical concepts related to the arithmetic mean. The participants were divided into three groups: those that received fair-share instruction, those that received center-of-balance instruction, and a control group. The data was analyzed using statistical methods, including contingency tables and ANCOVA, to investigate the effects fair-share and center-of-balance instruction had on knowledge of fair-share, center-of-balance, and mathematical concepts regarding the arithmetic mean. A qualitative analysis of the verbal protocols helped explain any statistically significant connection between the fair-share and center-of-balance conceptualizations, or between either conceptualization and mathematical concepts related to the arithmetic mean. Analysis of the data indicated participants increased their knowledge of the fair-share conceptualization after receiving instruction that was focused on center-of-balance. Similarly, participants increased their knowledge of the center-of-balance conceptualization after receiving instruction that was focused on fair-share. In either case, the concept, 'the sum of the deviations from the mean is zero,' was used to transfer knowledge between the conceptualizations. In <b>addition,</b> <b>instruction</b> in either the fair-share or center-of-balance conceptualization increased knowledge of the mathematical concepts related to the arithmetic mean. However, only specific mathematical concepts were impacted by each of the conceptualizations. The results suggest that both the fair-share and center-of-balance conceptualizations are pertinent to pedagogical decisions regarding the arithmetic mean. Furthermore, the concept, 'the sum of the deviations from the mean is zero,' is a viable cognitive connection between the fair-share and center-of-balance conceptualizations...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{products}} enabled by 3 D technology have been increasingly {{adopted in the}} consumer market. The current challenge {{in the field is}} to explore the methods of free-viewpoint interpolation for 3 D TVs. Free-viewpoint interpolation enhances the user experience significantly by allowing the viewer to select and alter the desired viewpoint of the scene interactively. This thesis covers the development of the free-viewpoint rendering platform for the European iGLANCE project. The proposed FTV platform is powered by a 7 -issue slot VLIW architecture combining scalar and vector data paths. Our processor is based on an image signal processor (ISP) template from Silicon Hive. We vectorized the free-viewpoint algorithm developed {{in the context of the}} iGLANCE project, and mapped it onto this processor. The performance of our implementation is compared to an out-of-the-box implementation and previous vectorization work using the same architecture template. In order to address irregular memory accesses, identified as the bottleneck by the previous work, we used scatter-gather unit and a customized memory transfer scheme. This allowed us to apply several classical vectorization methods to fully utilize data level parallelism. In <b>addition,</b> <b>instruction</b> level parallelism is improved by applying further optimizations (loop transformations, data mapping, extending ISA). As a result of all above, a speed-up of a factor 6 x is achieved over the selected baseline, which is equivalent to 78 x over the out-of-the box code, and the ILP is improved by 17 % as compared to the previous work. We set up a demonstration system to validate the results in a real-time environment by mapping our design to an FPGA running at 50 MHz frequency. The achieved frame rate is 6. 75 fps in a 1280 x 720 resolution. This result indicates that when our design is mapped to silicon, running at about 10 x the FPGA frequency and with extended processor resources, we will be able to achieve performance levels required in current-day consumer applications, which is Full HD resolution at 30 fps per eye.
