5|$|Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor {{has a large}} <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> stable population. It is {{therefore}} evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term. October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching {{as far as the}} United Kingdom.|$|E

Six years later, when she was 67 <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> in need of loyalty and affection, she legally adopted a 41-year-old homeopath as her second son.|$|E

5|$|In Tasimboko, Edson's troops {{discovered}} the supply base for Kawaguchi's forces, including large stockpiles of food, ammunition and medical supplies, and a shortwave radio. The Marines seized documents, equipment and food supplies, destroyed the rest, {{and returned to}} the Lunga perimeter at 17:30. The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3,000 Japanese troops were on the island <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> planning an attack.|$|E
5|$|LeRoy King, one of {{the members}} of the Coolidge Mission, wrote in his report that the {{authorities}} in Maribor were suspicious of the work of the mission <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> feared that it had uncovered information they would have preferred to conceal. He argued that there were Slovene populations in Styria who would have preferred the maintenance of Austrian rule.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than five}} minutes later <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> without reason, López took Reyes Moore by her hair and stabbed her. Her {{daughter}} {{ran out of the}} shop to tell her brother.

5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> abandoned her once during a camping trip; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{depressing}} sections of Chicago is the Uptown area on the North Side. Shabby apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers. It also has a new alderman, Helen Shiller, {{and she has a}} vision of what that seedy old neighborhood should be in the future. <b>And</b> <b>apparently</b> her vision is that Uptown should remain a seedy old neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{things happen}} in other brain areas: an initial {{synaptic}} matrix is generated {{as a result of}} genetically determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> exist solely to guide development.|$|E

5|$|The choughs host bird fleas, {{including}} two Frontopsylla species which are Pyrrhocorax specialist. Other parasites recorded on choughs include a cestode Choanotaenia pirinica, and various species of chewing lice in the genera Brueelia, Menacanthus and Philopterus. Blood parasites such as Plasmodium {{have been found}} in red-billed choughs, but this is uncommon, <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> does little harm. Parasitism levels are much lower than in some other passerine groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} {{conducted}} during coastal defense maneuvers {{held by the}} Air Corps without {{the participation of the}} United States Navy, <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> without understanding of their purpose by the Army Chief of Staff. Both had continuing disagreements with the leaders of the Air Corps over roles and missions, with the Navy disputing its maritime mission and the Army seeking to limit its role to that of supporting ground forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{hindbrain}} (or metencephalon) {{is particularly}} involved in swimming and balance. The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest {{part of the}} brain. Hagfish and lampreys have relatively small cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> involved in their electrical sense.|$|E

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} {{is caught in}} flight by several fast, agile falcon species, such as hobbies, and it {{sometimes}} carries parasites, but it faces no major threats. Because of its range of nearly 6millionkm2 (2.3millionsqmi) and a large <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> increasing population, it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The small inner moons {{constantly}} perturb each other. The {{system is}} chaotic <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> unstable. Simulations {{show that the}} moons may perturb each other into crossing orbits, which may eventually result in collisions between the moons. Desdemona may collide with either Cressida or Juliet within the next 100million years.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} for the Siberian accentor is uncertain, although {{estimates for the}} small European part of the range vary from 100–500 breeding pairs. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large <b>and</b> <b>apparently</b> stable. For this reason the Siberian accentor is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although as a northern breeding species it may {{in the long term}} be affected by climate change.|$|E
