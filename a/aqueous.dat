5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for <b>aqueous</b> solutions. The {{reason for this is}} that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with <b>aqueous</b> solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Cerium(IV) <b>aqueous</b> {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important <b>aqueous</b> and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, <b>aqueous</b> cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. <b>Aqueous</b> cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E

5|$|Like most rare-earth elements, {{praseodymium}} most readily {{forms the}} +3 oxidation state, {{which is the}} only stable state in <b>aqueous</b> solution, although the +4 oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among the lanthanides, the +5 oxidation state is attainable in matrix-isolation conditions. <b>Aqueous</b> praseodymium ions are yellowish-green, and similarly praseodymium results in various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources.|$|E
5|$|Nanofibers of {{dysprosium}} compounds {{have high}} strength {{and a large}} surface area. Therefore, {{they can be used}} to reinforce other materials and act as a catalyst. Fibers of dysprosium oxide fluoride can be produced by heating an <b>aqueous</b> solution of DyBr3 and NaF to 450°C at 450 bars for 17 hours. This material is remarkably robust, surviving over 100 hours in various <b>aqueous</b> solutions at temperatures exceeding 400°C without redissolving or aggregating.|$|E
5|$|Oxalates react rapidly with <b>aqueous</b> iron(III) {{chloride}} to give 3−. Other carboxylate salts form complexes, e.g. citrate and tartrate.|$|E
5|$|Samarium {{is one of}} the few {{lanthanides}} that {{exhibit the}} oxidation state +2. The Sm2+ ions are blood-red in <b>aqueous</b> solution.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{chemical}} {{diversity among}} actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions (acetonitrile). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for <b>aqueous</b> solutions, {{but also in}} the solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in <b>aqueous</b> solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous. The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the <b>aqueous</b> solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.|$|E
5|$|A {{small amount}} of {{industrial}} production involves wet chemical processes, which start with <b>aqueous</b> solutions of zinc salts, from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated. The solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800°C.|$|E
5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in <b>aqueous</b> solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in <b>aqueous</b> solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|Animal test based studies (mice) with <b>aqueous</b> {{extracts}} of Amanita abrupta {{have demonstrated}} hepatotoxic potential. Liver cell necrosis can be encountered. 2-Amino-4,5-hexadienoic acid {{is associated with}} these effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aqueous</b> Stannous Chloride {{is used by}} many {{precious}} metals refining hobbyists and professionals {{as an indicator of}} Gold and Platinum group metals in solutions.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to <b>aqueous</b> HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in <b>aqueous</b> solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|Barium {{hydroxide}} ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO2 in <b>aqueous</b> solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.|$|E
5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both <b>aqueous</b> and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment, where it may come into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate <b>aqueous</b> solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms {{a number}} of {{chemical}} compounds, where it normally exists in an oxidation state of +3 or +4, and behaves similarly to its lanthanide analogue, terbium. Like all actinides, berkelium easily dissolves in various <b>aqueous</b> inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the trivalent oxidation state. This trivalent state is the most stable, especially in <b>aqueous</b> solutions, but tetravalent berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. <b>Aqueous</b> solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of the Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective oxide surface layer; however, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds. Berkelium can also form several organometallic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table. The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in <b>aqueous</b> solution. Before nobelium's discovery, {{it was predicted that}} it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state is much more stable than the +3 state in <b>aqueous</b> solution {{and it is difficult to}} keep nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E
5|$|Dissolving praseodymium(IV) {{compounds}} in water results in solutions containing the yellow Pr4+ ions; {{because of the}} high positive standard reduction potential of the Pr4+/Pr3+ couple at +3.2V, these ions are unstable in <b>aqueous</b> solution, oxidising water and being reduced to Pr3+. The value for the Pr3+/Pr couple is −2.35V.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 {{elements}} are generally hard metals with low <b>aqueous</b> solubility, and have low availability to the biosphere. No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms. The radioactivity of the actinides generally makes them highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe {{synthesised}} {{acetic acid}} from inorganic compounds {{for the first}} time. This reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride, followed by pyrolysis to tetrachloroethylene and <b>aqueous</b> chlorination to trichloroacetic acid, and concluded with electrolytic reduction to acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|In {{absence of}} other ligands, its <b>aqueous</b> {{solutions}} are unstable {{with respect to}} disproportionation into Cu and CuCl2. In part for this reason samples in air assume a green coloration (see photograph in upper right).|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to phosphonium ylides {{used in the}} Wittig reaction, phosphonate-stabilized carbanions are more nucleophilic but less basic. Likewise, phosphonate-stabilized carbanions can be alkylated. Unlike phosphonium ylides, the dialkylphosphate salt byproduct is easily removed by <b>aqueous</b> extraction.|$|E
5|$|Indium metal {{does not}} react with water, {{but it is}} {{oxidized}} by stronger oxidizing agents such as halogens to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a boride, silicide, or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination. Indium is rather basic in <b>aqueous</b> solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in <b>aqueous</b> alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{berkelium}} dissolves {{in various}} <b>aqueous</b> inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the berkelium(III) state.

The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium, terbium. <b>Aqueous</b> solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids.

5|$|Nobelium's {{complexing}} ability with chloride ions is most {{similar to}} that of barium, which complexes rather weakly. Its complexing ability with citrate, oxalate, and acetate in an <b>aqueous</b> solution of 0.5Mammonium nitrate is between that of calcium and strontium, although it is somewhat closer to that of strontium.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{properties}} of hydrochloric acid, such as boiling and melting points, density, and pH, {{depend on the}} concentration or molarity of HCl in the <b>aqueous</b> solution. They range from those of water at very low concentrations approaching 0% HCl to values for fuming hydrochloric acid at over 40% HCl.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} the {{impurities}} NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction. The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through <b>aqueous</b> sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate. Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{tends to}} form {{water-soluble}} compounds, such as halides, sulfates, nitrates, carboxylates and carbonates. The main <b>aqueous</b> species are the aquo complexes +, where n = 4–8; with n = 6 indicated from X-ray diffraction data and computer simulations.|$|E
5|$|The colour of an ionic {{compound}} {{is often}} different to the colour of an <b>aqueous</b> solution containing the constituent ions, or the hydrated {{form of the}} same compound.|$|E
5|$|ZnO reacts {{slowly with}} fatty acids in oils {{to produce the}} {{corresponding}} carboxylates, such as oleate or stearate. ZnO forms cement-like products when mixed with a strong <b>aqueous</b> solution of zinc chloride and these are best described as zinc hydroxy chlorides. This cement was used in dentistry.|$|E
25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with <b>aqueous</b> polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable <b>Aqueous</b> Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance <b>aqueous</b> two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical <b>aqueous</b> two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from <b>aqueous</b> solutions by using a second <b>aqueous</b> phase. This second <b>aqueous</b> phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two <b>aqueous</b> phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a fluidized bed rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode. The packed column is run similar as a chromatographic column.|$|E
25|$|Workup {{procedures}} {{may vary}} depending on the stability of the products. If the organic products of the reaction are stable to <b>aqueous</b> acid, <b>aqueous</b> hydrochloric acid may be used to quench the reaction. For workups involving acid-labile products, mildly basic solutions or pH 7–8 buffers may be used. Samarium salts are usually insoluble in these conditions, but do form a suspension in the <b>aqueous</b> phase from which the desired organic product can be extracted.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} the diamond anvil, the {{hydrothermal}} diamond anvil cell (HDAC) is used in experimental petrology/geochemistry {{for the study of}} <b>aqueous</b> fluids, silicate melts, immiscible liquids, mineral solubility and <b>aqueous</b> fluid speciation at geologic pressures and temperatures. The HDAC is sometimes used to examine <b>aqueous</b> complexes in solution using the synchrotron light source techniques XANES and EXAFS. The design of HDAC is very similar to that of DAC, but it is optimized for studying liquids.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{irradiation}} of <b>aqueous</b> solutions of lead compounds leads to the formation of elemental lead, when an inorganic solid such as bentonite and sodium formate are present then the lead is removed from the <b>aqueous</b> solution.|$|E
25|$|A SWCNTs-based {{supercapacitor}} with <b>aqueous</b> electrolyte was systematically {{studied at}} University of Delaware in Prof. Bingqing Wei's group.
