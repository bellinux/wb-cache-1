5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E

5|$|The Engineers, {{also known}} as space jockeys, are an ancient race of large humanoids which created {{humanity}} from their own DNA during Earth's primordial era. In Alien, the fossilized corpse of an Engineer is discovered in the pilot's seat of the derelict alien spacecraft; its suit and helmet {{were thought to be}} bones, and is the first victim of the Aliens identified onscreen. The Engineers {{play a central role in}} the first prequel, Prometheus, which reveals their biology <b>and</b> <b>intention</b> to infect the human race with an alien contagion and mutagen. In the film, the last surviving Engineer on LV-223 is awakened and immediately tries to resume his mission of delivering the substance to Earth, but he is subsequently stopped by the survivors of the human expedition. The android David 8 pilots an Engineer ship to the species' home world, where he unleashes the mutagen against the population, which kills all the Engineers and all other non-floral life on the planet.|$|E

Comparisons with single targets were generally related to concern, though not to <b>intentions.</b> Temporal <b>and</b> exemplar comparisons were unrelated to concern <b>and</b> <b>intentions.</b> Comparative risk (particularly with average targets) may elicit worry about one's risk and encourage protective measures, irrespective of one's absolute risk. ...|$|R

Camels and water bags were purchased, and the parties left Isfahan separately on 3 July 1915 {{for the journey}} through the desert, hoping to rendezvous at Tebbes, halfway to the Afghan border. Von Hentig's group travelled with twelve pack horses, twenty-four mules, and a camel caravan. Throughout the march, {{efforts were made to}} throw off the British and Russian patrols. False dispatches spread disinformation on the group's numbers, destination, <b>and</b> <b>intention.</b> To avoid the extreme daytime heat, they travelled by night. Food was found or bought by Persian messengers sent ahead of the party. These scouts also helped identify hostile villages and helped find water. The group crossed the Persian desert in forty nights. Dysentery and delirium plagued the party. Some Persian guides attempted to defect, and camel drivers had to be constantly vigilant for robbers. On 23 July, the group reached Tebbes– the first Europeans after Sven Hedin. They were soon followed by Niedermayer's party, which now included explorer Wilhelm Paschen and six Austrian and Hungarian soldiers who had escaped from Russian prisoner of war camps in Turkestan. The arrival was marked by a grand welcome by the town's mayor. However, the welcome meant the party had been spotted.|$|E
