5|$|Chinese {{trade with}} the Roman Empire, {{confirmed}} by the Roman desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC.

There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> intermediaries.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>trade</b> {{expanded}} {{during the}} Industrial Revolution, Bridgwater {{was linked to}} Taunton by the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal (1827), although initially it ran from a basin south of Bridgwater at Huntworth. <b>As</b> <b>trade</b> grew docks {{were built in the}} town, linked to an extension of the canal, with both opening in 1841. The docks were dredged by a scraper-dredger Bertha similar to the one Brunel had designed for the Bristol Floating Harbour. 14 June 1841 saw the opening of the Bristol and Exeter Railway from Bristol to Bridgwater. The railway also opened a coach and wagon works in the town; the last of the buildings is currently in 2005 scheduled for demolition. Bridgwater railway station, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel is now a Grade II listed building. An end to the unequal competition between rail and canal came in 1867 when the Bristol and Exeter Railway purchased the canal. A number of local branches were also built, for example to serve the Northgate Brewery (now replaced by a car park north of Angel Crescent) and the former British Cellophane factory. The Somerset and Dorset branch line to Edington was opened in 1890. Its former Bridgwater station is now occupied by J Sainsbury.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th {{century the}} economy of Southampton {{improved}} {{as a result of}} the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, unlike many other properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> with Italy declined, taking with it the prosperity of FrenchStreet. A new parlour was installed in the house, and a floor was added halfway across the open hall to produce additional sleeping space.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, trade dollars began {{appearing}} in American commerce. In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury {{to pay out}} silver coins in exchange for paper currency. That act, combined with {{a drop in the}} price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States. Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California. After the value of silver began to decline and the intrinsic value of the coins fell below one dollar, bullion depositors began having their silver struck <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> dollars and selling them wholesale to be distributed throughout the country. Bullion producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.|$|E
5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades {{as varied as the}} settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} luxury {{product was}} silk, which was imported and then processed in the Empire. In {{order to protect}} the manufacture of silk products, Justinian granted a monopoly to the imperial factories in 541. In order to bypass the Persian landroute, Justinian established friendly relations with the Abyssinians, whom he wanted to act <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> mediators by transporting Indian silk to the Empire; the Abyssinians, however, were unable to compete with the Persian merchants in India. Then, in the early 550s, two monks succeeded in smuggling eggs of silk worms from Central Asia back to Constantinople, and silk became an indigenous product.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{considerable}} public backlash {{to the way}} in which some of the provisions of the War Precautions Act were applied, particularly in relation to certain sections of the community such <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> unions and other sections of the community that were for various reasons not as sympathetic to the British cause as the wider community. Indeed, in 1917, following the suppression of a prominent trade union and the jailing of 12 of its members on charges of sedition and sabotage, it seemed as if Australia's war effort might have been in danger of breaking down.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are also}} classified, {{according}} to their geographical location and dominant weather pattern, <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or polar deserts. Trade wind deserts occur {{either side of the}} horse latitudes at 30° to 35° North and South. These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara Desert is of this type. Mid-latitude deserts occur between 30° and 50° North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the Tengger and Sonoran Deserts. Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. The Thar Desert near the India/Pakistan border is of this type.|$|E

5|$|Stanley {{decided in}} 1901 {{to build and}} set up Stanley Technical Trades School, {{the first of its}} kind in the country. The school was {{designed}} to educate boys between the ages of 12 and 15 in general studies, as well <b>as</b> <b>trade.</b> It was made to Stanley’s own design and included an astronomy tower, and opened in 1907. When it was presented to the public in 1907, it had an endowment valued at £50,000. It was later renamed as Stanley Technical School (now Harris Academy South Norwood). The William F. Stanley Trust (originally The Stanley Foundation) was set up as a charitable Trust to assist with the management of the Stanley Technical Trades School. On 23 November 2006, Lady Harris (wife of Philip Harris, Baron Harris of Peckham, founder of the Harris Federation) and David Cameron (at the time, the leader of the Conservative Party and the Leader of the Opposition) placed a time capsule to recognise the contribution of Stanley to South Norwood. The capsule included a letter from Cameron, a copy of the speech given by William Stanley, on the opening of the Stanley Technical Trades School on 26 March 1907, two reference books (William Stanley the Man; William Stanley’s School), as well as artefacts from both Stanley Technical High School for Boys and the Harris Federation of schools.|$|E
5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.|$|E
5|$|The {{percentage}} of England's population living in towns {{continued to grow}} but in absolute terms English towns shrunk significantly {{as a consequence of}} the Black Death, especially in the formerly prosperous east. The importance of England's Eastern ports declined over the period, <b>as</b> <b>trade</b> from London and the South-West increased in relative significance. Increasingly elaborate road networks were built across England, some involving the construction of up to thirty bridges to cross rivers and other obstacles. Nonetheless, it remained cheaper to move goods by water, and consequently timber was brought to London from as far away as the Baltic, and stone from Caen brought over the Channel to the South of England. Shipbuilding, particular in the South-West, became a major industry for the first time and investment in trading ships such as cogs was probably the single biggest form of late medieval investment in England.|$|E
