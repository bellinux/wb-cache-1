40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{the recent}} results on {{a synthesis of}} the new structures of boron nitride are presented. Light-induced catalyst-free heating of fine-grained graphite-like h-BN powders was performed {{in the flow of}} dried <b>and</b> <b>purified</b> <b>nitrogen</b> in an optical furnace. The new structures of boron nitride were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy JSM- 6490 supplemented with combined Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) provided information about structures, phase and element transformation of fine-grained graphite-like h-BN powders. The coarse structures, thread-like nanostructures (whiskers or dendritic structures) and new morphologies were formed due to the interaction of BN plume with nitrogen ambient {{on the surface of the}} heated compacted h-BN samples. Complicated structure and element composition of the whiskers which were formed on the surface of heated samples of compacted h-BN powders were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray Diffraction (XRD) study demonstrates presence of amorphous phase, pure boron of different modifications and boron nitride of different phase compositions on the surface of these substrates. The process of the synthesis, formation and growth of the nanostructures in an optical furnace was analyzed and understood. A role of oxygen in formation and growth mechanism of BN whiskers was proposed...|$|E
40|$|Vanadium oxides {{have been}} studied because of its some {{important}} properties. Vanadium pentoxide has been used widely as its fine catalytic properties. Meanwhile, Vanadium pentoxide also has fine electrochemical property. Theoretically a Vanadium atom in Vanadium pentoxide crystal can accept two Li ions. Vanadium pentoxide is an attractive cathode material in high capacity Li ions rechargeable battery. Vanadium pentoxide can be also used as ions storage layer in Electrochromic devices. Vanadium pentoxide thin films were obtained in this subject by sol-gel method. The precursors in this project are Vanadium pentoxide powder and Vanadyl acetylacetonate. First, we prepare inorganic sol and organic sol by Vanadium pentoxide powder and Vanadyl acetylacetonate respectively. Then the gel thin films were prepared by dip-coating and spin-coating. Gel films were heat treated at definite conditions and Vanadium pentoxide thin films were synthesized. The properties of Vanadyl acetylacetonate sol was analyzed by FT-IR and DG-DSC. The Crystallinity and optical property of Vanadium pentoxide thin films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectrum and UV-VIS-NIR spectrum. The DG-DSC analysis reveals that Vanadyl acetylacetonate decomposes at 250 oC and 300 oC in nitrogen ambience and air respectively. In this subject, the heat treatment temperature was choosen between 350 - 550 oC. Polycrystalline Vanadium pentoxide thin films were synthesized by heat treating Vanadyl acetylacetonate gel films in air and nitrogrn ambience. Amorphous Vanadium pentoxide thin films were synthesized by heat treating Vanadyl acetylacetonate gel films in argon and hydrogen misture ambience <b>and</b> <b>purified</b> <b>nitrogen</b> ambience. Polycrystalline Vanadium pentoxide thin films synthesized in this object have highly c-axis oriented nano V 2 O 5 structures with grain diameter ranging from 21 nm to 45 nm. Polycrystalline Vanadium pentoxide thin films grow perpendicularly to the substrate. The optical band gap of Vanadium pentoxide thin films is between 2. 0 - 2. 4 ev. The adhesion of Vanadium pentoxide thin films becomes stronger when the oxygen pressure increases in heat treatment atmosphere. The Vanadium pentoxide thin films obtained in air can shed after surface wetting. While the Vanadium pentoxide thin films obtained in nitrogen can bear grinding. The color of Vanadium pentoxide thin films varies from light yellow to light green as the oxygen pressure decrease in heat treatment atmosphere. 氧钒化合物因其具有重要的特性而被人们广泛的研究。其中V 2 O 5 因为其良好的催化特性，而被广泛用作各种化学反应的催化剂。同时V 2 O 5 也具有很好的电化学性能，理论上，V 2 O 5 晶体中平均一个钒原子可以接受两个金属锂原子，具有良好的嵌锂性能，这使得把V 2 O 5 用作高容量锂离子电池的阴极膜有很大的吸引力。在电致变色方面作为离子储存膜，也得到了应用。 本课题采用sol-gel方法，以二乙酰丙酮氧钒和五氧化二钒粉末为前驱物，制备得到了钒的有机溶胶和无机溶胶，通过提拉和旋涂两种涂膜方式得到湿的凝胶膜，通过不同条件下的热处理，得到了五氧化二钒薄膜。利用傅立叶变换红外吸收光谱仪和热重分析仪研究了二乙酰丙酮氧钒溶胶的性质，探讨了溶胶的粘度、热处理温度、热处理气氛和陈化时间对薄膜的影响。通过X射线衍射分析，傅立叶变换红外光谱分析及UV-VIS-NIR光谱表征了五氧化二钒薄膜的结晶性和光学特性。 热分析表明二乙酰丙酮氧钒在氮气中 300 ℃开始分解，在空气中 250 ℃开始分解，据此，本实验的热处理温度选为 350 - 550 ℃之间。二乙酰丙酮氧钒凝胶膜可以在空气，氮气中退火得到多晶五氧化二钒薄膜，在提纯的氮气以及氩氢气中得到的是非晶态的五氧化二钒薄膜。实验中得到的多晶五氧化二钒薄膜均沿着c轴生长。薄膜垂直于衬底平面生长，晶粒大小在 24 - 45 nm之间。所得薄膜的禁带宽度为 2. 0 - 2. 4 ev之间。随着热处理气氛中氧分压的减小，薄膜的附着力增大，空气中热处理获得的样品在受潮后容易脱落，而在提纯氮气中热处理得到的样品能耐受研磨；颜色由淡黄向暗绿色转变...|$|E

50|$|The 3He {{enters the}} {{cryostat}} at a pressure {{of a few}} hundred millibar. In the classic dilution refrigerator (known as a wet dilution refrigerator), the 3He is precooled <b>and</b> <b>purified</b> by liquid <b>nitrogen</b> at 77 K and a 4He bath at 4.2 K. Next, the 3He enters a vacuum chamber where it is further cooled to a temperature of 1.2-1.5 K by the 1 K bath, a vacuum-pumped 4He bath (as decreasing the pressure of the helium reservoir depresses its boiling point). The 1 K bath liquefies the 3He gas and removes the heat of condensation. The 3He then enters the main impedance, a capillary with a large flow resistance. It is cooled by the still (described below) to a temperature 500-700 mK. Subsequently, the 3He flows through a secondary impedance and one side of a set of counterflow heat exchangers where it is cooled by a cold flow of 3He. Finally, the pure 3He enters the mixing chamber, the coldest area of the device.|$|R

40|$|Metal substrates, preferably of {{titanium}} and titanium alloys, are coated by alloying or forming TiN on a substrate surface. A {{laser beam}} strikes {{the surface of}} a moving substrate in the presence of <b>purified</b> <b>nitrogen</b> gas. A small area of the substrate surface is quickly heated without melting. This heated area reacts with the nitrogen to form a solid solution. The alloying or formation of TiN occurs by diffusion of nitrogen into the titanium. Only the surface layer of the substrate is heated because of the high power density of the laser beam and short exposure time. The bulk of the substrate is not affected, and melting of the substrate is avoided because it would be detrimental...|$|R
