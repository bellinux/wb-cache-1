Early researchers investigating these phenomena hoped that these patterns signaled the presence of rich dynamics, possibly chaotic or fractal in nature. Although there is a definite <b>autoregressive</b> and <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity</b> structure in electricity returns, we find that after simple filtering no pattern remains. While the series is non-normal in terms of their distribution and statistical tests fail to identify significant chaos, there is evidence of fractal structures in periodic price returns when measured over the trading day.

We test for both portfolio balance effects and signaling influences by using daily data on central bank intervention (in dollars) against both the yen and the West German mark.

40|$|This thesis first {{investigates the}} moment and memory {{properties}} of exponential-type <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity</b> models. This primarily includes exponential generalised <b>autoregressive</b> <b>conditional</b> heteroscedastic (EGARCH) models, the fractionally integrated EGARCH model of Bollerslev and Mikkelsen (1996) (FIEGARCH(BM)), the hyperbolic EGARCH (HYEGARCH) model and the FIEGARCH(DL) model, as presented in Chapter 2. The moment conditions of these models are derived from previous literature, and the memory properties are measured by using the near-epoch dependence (NED) functions of an independent process approach. The existence of moments supports the limited memory properties of these models. This study shows that exponential <b>autoregressive</b> <b>conditional</b> heteroscedastic (EARCH) (∞) processes may exhibit geometric memory, hyperbolic memory or long memory. The EGARCH {{is a case of}} a geometric memory process. The FIEGARCH(BM) and HY/FIEGARCH(DL) processes can exhibit hyperbolic memory or long memory, depending on the sign of the memory parameter. The study also derives the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) or fractional FCLT for the relevant processes in these exponential-type <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity</b> models. Finally, the results of the simulation show that the HYEGARCH model has a hyperbolic memory and that the FIEGARCH(DL) model can capture long memory in absolute return series. Next, the study investigates the asymptotic properties of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) in autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models with EGARCH or HY/FIEGARCH(DL) errors in Chapter 3. This part of the study aims to investigate the asymptotic theory of the ARMA(1, 1) -EGARCH(1, 1) models and that of the pure HY/FIEGARCH(DL) models. First, the literature on the asymptotic properties of the ARMA-GARCH and EGARCH processes is reviewed. The conditions for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the QMLE of the ARMA-EGARCH models are then demonstrated. This analysis also provides an investigation of that of the QMLE in the HY/FIEGARCH(DL) processes. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to study the properties of the QMLE in the pure HY/FIEGARCH(DL) processes. Lastly, in a study co-authored with Professor James Davidson, we derive a simple sufficient condition for strict stationarity in the ARCH(∞) class of processes with <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity.</b> The concept of persistence in these processes is explored, and {{is the subject of a}} set of simulations showing how persistence depends on both the pattern of the lag coefficients of the ARCH model and the distribution of the driving shocks.

40|$|Extreme value {{methods are}} widely used in {{financial}} applications such as risk analysis, forecasting and pricing models. One of the challenges with their application in finance is accounting for the temporal dependence between the observations, for example the stylised fact that financial time series exhibit volatility clustering. Various approaches have been proposed to capture the dependence. Commonly a two-stage approach is taken, where the volatility dependence is removed using a volatility model like a GARCH (or one of its many incarnations) followed by application of standard extreme value models to the assumed independent residual innovations. This study examines an alternative one stage approach, which makes parameter estimation and accounting for the associated uncertainties more straightforward than the two-stage approach. The location and scale parameters of the extreme value distribution are defined to follow a <b>conditional</b> <b>autoregressive</b> <b>heteroscedasticity</b> process. Essentially, the model implements GARCH volatility via the extreme value model parameters. Bayesian inference is used and implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo, to permit all sources of uncertainty to be accounted for.

40|$|In principle, the {{apparent}} volatility clustering frequently observed in financial/economic time series {{could be due}} to an ARCH/GARCH mechanism, in which the current innovation is multiplicatively influenced by the square root of a function of past squared innovations. This paper examines an intuitively appealing alternative mechanism, which posits that <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity</b> arises – endogenously – as a natural consequence of nonlinear serial dependence in the generating mechanism of the time series. Two interesting new results emerge. First, it is shown that one-step-ahead <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity</b> cannot arise from a generating mechanism with a fixed-variance additive innovation term. Thus, one-step-ahead <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity</b> requires either a separate mechanism driving the time evolution of volatility or, through state-switching, a multiplicity of innovation terms. Second, however, h-step-ahead <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity</b> is shown to be a natural consequence of nonlinear serial dependence for values of h larger than one. These general results are illustrated using a simple bilinear model proposed in Granger and Anderson (1978); an application to daily stock returns data illustrates the empirical relevance of multi-step-ahead <b>conditional</b> <b>heteroscedasticity.</b> These results suggest {{that the best way to}} respond to observed volatility clustering in a time series is to test for and model the nonlinear serial dependence which is likely causing it...|$|R
