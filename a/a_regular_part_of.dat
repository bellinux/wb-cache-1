There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club {{played against}} the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824. Chess problems became <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd composed {{some of the}} most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook of Chess), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.|$|E

5|$|Music took on {{a pivotal}} and {{permanent}} role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as {{the editor of the}} 1937 edition of the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.|$|E

25|$|As {{minstrel}} shows shifted {{towards the}} development of vaudeville theatre, the comedic and misogynistic “wench” also experienced a shift into more of a serious and creative character, the “prima donna.” By {{the end of the}} Prohibition Era, vaudeville shows featured female impersonators as <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> their performance, in which further became a new popular trend of public entertainment.|$|E
25|$|Turkeys are {{traditionally}} eaten {{as the main}} course of Christmas feasts {{in much of the}} English-speaking world (stuffed turkey) since appearing in England in the 16th century, as well as for Thanksgiving in the United States and Canada.

50|$|Another {{by-product}} of Tiswas increased audience was the merchandise bandwagon - an annual book was established, {{and there was}} a tour of universities (recognising their adult and teenaged audience) by the Tiswas team, under the name of The Four Bucketeers, which tied in with their spin-off album on CBS Records. This all was born out of one feature of the sixth series - The Bucket Of Water Song, which was such a hit with the viewers that it evolved from an intended one-off to <b>an</b> almost <b>regular</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Tiswas.|$|R
40|$|The {{stationary}} {{version of}} a modified definition of statistical solution for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations introduced in a previous work is investigated.

25|$|There were parish (parochial) {{libraries}} open in Anglican churches {{all over}} the American colonies. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, founded in 1701, subsidized libraries as <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> their missionary activity whenever they sent a priest to an Anglican mission or church {{that did not have}} a library already. There would thus have been parish libraries at the 289 Anglican churches, and at various missions.|$|E
25|$|The turtledove {{was present}} from about April to October, while the rock pigeon was {{available}} throughout the year. The pigeon {{appears to have}} been domesticated in Sumeria and Canaan during the second millennium BCE, and remained the predominant fowl in ancient Israel {{until the end of the}} Second Temple period. Nonetheless, to avoid the spread of disease, pigeons could only be raised in small numbers and were thus fairly costly and not <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the diet.|$|E

50|$|The ESX {{design team}} set a high goal {{of making the}} vehicle capable of sipping {{gasoline}} {{at the rate of}} 80 mpg, but the eventual vehicle only achieved an estimated 55 mpg. The figure was impressive for such a vehicle. However, the car used a number of exotic materials, which made the cost excessive if it were ever to go into full-scale production. It was estimated that the car would cost $80,000, or roughly $60,000 more than <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> Intrepid. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> this price increase was caused by the use of lead-acid batteries.|$|R
