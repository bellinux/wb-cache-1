Points of Interest (POI) were placed on each kidney to determine the greatest magnitude of displacement in all directions. Without compression, all patients had > 5. 0  mm motion in the craniocaudal (CC) direction in at least one kidney.

40|$|The {{adequacy}} of peritoneal dialysis is generally dependant on {{the choice of}} peritoneal fluid, the intraperitoneal fill volume and the contact time. Moreover, the peritoneal surface area acts as {{a major factor in}} the exchange dynamics of a peritoneal membrane. We designed a mechanism to increase the membrane surface contact area by using an <b>abdominal</b> <b>belt</b> in order to exert enough pressure on the fill volume, to effectively recruit more area in contact for exchange. We studied 12 patients on regular continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at our center from January to October 2008. The age of patients ranged from 44 to 75 years, with a median of 55 years. All the patients were maintained on the same prescription four months before and during the study. Dialysis solutions were 1. 36 % Deaneal®, two liters, three exchanges and the last fill volume was two liters 7. 5 % Extraneal®. The belt was applied to all the patients most of the day and all night. We then observed its effect on dialysis adequacy, reflected by various parameters over a period of eight months. The average Kt/V before wearing the belt was 1. 89 and improved after applying the belt to 2. 3 (P < 0. 05). Our study suggests that increasing the abdominal pressure by wearing an <b>abdominal</b> <b>belt</b> rendered the filling volume of the PD dialysate to have a better contact with the peritoneal membrane and improved the dialysis adequacy.

40|$|Abstract—Difficulty with {{evacuation}} (DWE) {{is common}} in individuals {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI). Numerous studies have concluded that constipation, impaction, and incontinence cause significant morbidity and, collectively, constitute an important quality-of-life issue in individuals with SCI. Colonic motor activity was assessed using a solid-state manometry probe. We report here that colonic pressure activity is depressed during sleep compared to that observed in able-bodied controls. In addition, pressure activity was decreased during sleep com-pared to pre-sleep and post-sleep. We suspect that this may con-tribute to delayed colon transit time after SCI. In addition, since contraction of the abdominal wall musculature plays a role in normal defecation, we assessed whether an <b>abdominal</b> <b>belt</b> with implanted electrodes would improve DWE.

40|$|In {{livestock}} farming, accurate {{prediction of}} calving {{time is a}} key factor for profitability and animal welfare. The most accurate and sensitive methods to date for prediction of calving within 24 h are the measurement of pelvic ligament relaxation and assays for circulating progesterone and oestradiol- 17 β. Conversely, the absence of calving within the next 12 - 24 h can be accurately predicted by the measurement of incremental daily decrease in vaginal temperature and by the combination of pelvic ligament relaxation and teat filling estimates. Continuous monitoring systems can detect behavioural changes occurring on the actual day of calving, some of them being accentuated {{in the last few}} hours before delivery; standing/lying transitions, tail raising, feeding time, and dry matter and water intakes, differ between cows with dystocia and those with eutocia. Use of these behavioural changes has the potential to improve the management of calving. Currently, four types of devices for calving detection are on the market: inclinometers and accelerometers detecting tail raising and overactivity, <b>abdominal</b> <b>belts</b> monitoring uterine contractions, vaginal probes detecting a decrease in vaginal temperature and expulsion of the allantochorion, and devices placed in the vagina or on the vulvar lips that detect calf expulsion.

40|$|Reflex syncope is {{a common}} medical problem. Vasovagal reflex syncope is the most {{frequent}} form. Although the prognosis of the disorder is excellent, it may impose substantial changes in life style and cause profound psychological distress. Thus, management of this disorder is an important issue. This chapter, based on {{a review of the}} literature and the authors' clinical experience, encompasses the non-pharmacological measures used in the management of reflex syncope. The cornerstone of the nonpharmacological management of patients with reflex syncope is education and reassurance regarding the benign nature of the condition. Patients should be instructed to avoid potential triggers. A tilt table test can be employed to teach the patient to recognize early premonitory symptoms. There are several physical maneuvers (e. g., leg crossing, muscle tensing and squatting) that are effective in combating orthostatic intolerance. For the majority of patients this approach is adequate. Patients with frequent attacks of reflex syncope are advised to increase their dietary salt intake. Exercise training also increases orthostatic tolerance. In highly motivated patients with recurrent syncope, raising the head of the bed to permit gravitational exposure during sleep and prolonged periods of enforced maintenance of the upright posture (tilt-training) can be considered. Preliminary data suggest that water drinking may improve orthostatic tolerance. <b>Abdominal</b> <b>belts</b> may also be effective in highly symptomatic subjects with reflex syncop...|$|R

Systolic arterial pressure and right atrial pressure were measured using indwelling catheters. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and mean airway pressure were continuously monitored. Lung volumes were measured using two linear differential transformers mounted on thoracic and <b>abdominal</b> <b>belts.</b> Baroreflex testing was performed by sequential intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine (200 micrograms) and nitroglycerin (200 micrograms) to raise or lower systolic arterial pressure by 20 - 30 Torr. Baroreflex regulation of heart rate was expressed as {{the slope of the}} regression line between R-R interval of the ECG and systolic arterial pressure. In each mode of ventilation the ventilatory settings were chosen to control mean airway pressure and arterial PCO 2 (PaCO 2). In HFJV a tidal volume of 159 +/- 61 ml was administered at a frequency of 320 +/- 104 breaths/min, whereas in CPPV a tidal volume of 702 +/- 201 ml was administered at a frequency of 13 +/- 2 breaths/min. Control values of systolic arterial pressure, R-R interval, mean pulmonary volume above apneic functional residual capacity, end-expiratory pulmonary volume, right atrial pressure, mean airway pressure, PaCO 2, pH, PaO 2, and temperature before injection of phenylephrine or nitroglycerin were comparable in HFJV and CPPV. Baroreflex regulation of heart rate after nitroglycerin injection was significantly higher in HFJV (4. 1 +/- 2. 8 ms/Torr) than in CPPV (1. 96 +/- 1. 23 ms/Torr).

40|$|Abdominal Functional Electrical Stimulation (AFES) {{has been}} shown to improve the {{respiratory}} function of people with tetraplegia. The effectiveness of AFES can be enhanced by using different stimulation parameters for quiet breathing and coughing. The signal from a spirometer, coupled with a facemask, has previously been used to differentiate between these breath types. In this study, the suitability of less intrusive sensors was investigated with able-bodied volunteers. Signals from two respiratory effort belts, positioned around the chest and the abdomen, were used with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, trained on a participant by participant basis, to classify, in real-time, respiratory activity as either quiet breathing or coughing. This was compared with the classification accuracy achieved using a spirometer signal and an SVM. The signal from the belt positioned around the chest provided an acceptable classification performance compared to the signal from a spirometer (mean cough (c) and quiet breath (q) sensitivity (Se) of Se c = 92. 9 % and Se q = 96. 1 % vs. Se c = 90. 7 % and Se q = 98. 9 %).

40|$|AbstractIntroductionProlapse of {{abdominal}} viscera {{into the}} thoracic subcutis through the chest wall {{is known as}} transdiaphragmatic intercostal hernia (TIH). Herein, we present the first case of spontaneous TIH presenting as a thoracoabdominal emergency. Presentation of caseA 78 -year-old male presented with acute left thoracoabdominal pain following a sudden bulge at the left posterolateral chest wall corresponding to a partially reducible soft tissue mass with ecchymosis at the overlying skin. Paroxysmal cough during the last four days was also reported along with a prolonged daily application of a special tight <b>abdominal</b> <b>belt</b> that used while milking sheep. CT-scan of the abdomen showed intrathoracic proptosis of the splenic flexure through a defect of the left hemidiaphragm and subcutaneous prolapse of the herniated colon through the 7 th intercostal space. On laparotomy, the herniated colon showed signs of ischemic necrosis leading to segmental colectomy followed by repair of the diaphragmatic defect. DiscussionThe clinical diagnosis of spontaneous TIH demands very high index of suspicion and thorough patient's history. In this case the daily elevation of the intraabdominal pressure due to an abdominal milking belt might have caused gradual slimming and loosening of the diaphragm and the intercostals muscles rendering them vulnerable to sudden increases of the thoracoabdominal pressure due to violent coughing. Such a hypothesis is reasonable {{in the absence of}} traumatic injury in this patient. ConclusionSpontaneous TIH should be suspected in patients presenting with a sudden palpable chest wall bulge and associated thoracoabdominal symptoms in the absence of preceding injury...|$|E

Male Wistar rats (3 to 4 months old, 250 - 300 g) were divided into 2 groups (N = 6) : control and immobilized for 7 days. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg weight) and the left hindlimb was immobilized with the orthoses composed of acrylic resin model, <b>abdominal</b> <b>belt</b> and lateral supports. The following analyses were performed: glycogen content of the soleus, extensor digitorum longus, white gastrocnemius, red gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles by the phenol sulfuric method, and the weight, fiber area and intramuscular connective tissue of the soleus by the planimetric system. Data were analyzed statistically by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Student t and Wilcoxon tests.

While passive weight bearing of paralyzed lower extremities appears to be ineffective, stressing the bones through muscular contractions initiated by functional electrical stimulation (FES) has yielded positive results in some cases. The intensity, frequency, and duration of stress to the bones appear to be important determinants of improved bone parameters.

To overcome this problem, an <b>abdominal</b> <b>belt</b> (BELT) {{has been suggested}} by a Japanese group. However, its applicability in a Western population has not been previously demonstrated. The {{purpose of this study}} wa s to investigate 1) how the application of a BELT alters breathing patterns during MR scanning and 2) whether the BELT has a similar impact on breathing patterns in UK and Japanese patient populations. Methods 30 patients (15 in the UK and 15 in Japan) were studied at 1. 5 Tesla (Achieva, Philips Healthcare). Real time navigator positioned through the right diaphragm in cranio-caudal direction was evaluated. Measurements were performed in the supine position with free breathing for one minute before and after a tight-fitting BELT was positioned around the patient's abdomen. End expiratory position (EEP), end inspiratory position (EIP), end expiratory duration (EED) for the right diaphragm and respiratory rate (RR) were obtained. Scan efficiency (SE) was calculated as follows; SE = [the duration within 5 mm gating window per minutes]/[RR interval]/[heart rate]. Results Height and weight of UK patients were significantly larger than in the Japanese population (171. 2 ± 10. 8 cm vs 160. 8 ± 8. 5 cm, p = 0. 007; 80. 5 ± 22. 5 kg vs 59. 9 ± 7. 7 kg, p = 0. 004).

40|$|Background. Respiratory {{irregularity}} {{has been}} previously reported in patients with panic disorder using time domain measures. However, the respiratory signal is not entirely linear and a few previous studies used approximate entropy (APEN), a measure of regularity of time series. We have been studying APEN and other nonlinear measures including a measure of chaos, the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) of heart rate time series, in some detail. In this study, we used these measures of respiration to compare normal controls (n = 18) and patients with panic disorder (n = 22) {{in addition to the}} traditional time domain measures of respiratory rate and tidal volume. Methods: Respiratory signal was obtained by the Respitrace system using a thoracic and an <b>abdominal</b> <b>belt,</b> which was digitized at 500 Hz. Later, the time series were constructed at 4 Hz, as the highest frequency in this signal is limited to 0. 5 Hz. We used 256 s of data (1, 024 points) during supine and standing postures under normal breathing and controlled breathing at 12 breaths/min. Results: APEN was significantly higher in patients in standing posture during normal as well as controlled breathing (p = 0. 002 and 0. 02, respectively). LLE was also significantly higher in standing posture during normal breathing (p = 0. 009). Similarly, the time domain measures of standard deviations and the coefficient of variation (COV) of tidal volume (TV) were significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0. 02 and 0. 004, respectively). The frequency of sighs was also higher in the patient group in standing posture (p = 0. 02). In standing posture, LLE (p < 0. 05) as well as APEN (p < 0. 01) contributed significantly toward the separation of the two groups over and beyond the linear measure, i. e. the COV of TV. Conclusion: These findings support the previously described respiratory irregularity in patients with panic disorder and also illustrate the utility of nonlinear measures such as APEN and LLE as additional measures toward {{a better understanding of the}} abnormalities of respiratory physiology in similar patient populations as the correlation between LLE, APEN and some of the time domain measures only explained up to 50 - 60 % of the variation.

Thoracoabdominal {{breathing}} {{movements are}} a complex source of postural disturbance, {{but there are}} contradictory reports in the literature with inspiration described as having either a backward or a forward disturbing effect. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, the present study studied the postural disturbance caused by isolated contractions of the diaphragm. Eight male and four female healthy su bjects followed an original paradigm of phrenic nerve stimulation (bilateral and unilateral) and "diaphragmatic" voluntary sniff maneuvers in the seated and standing postures. Center of gravity (CG) acceleration was calculated from force plate recordings, and respiratory kinematics were assessed with thoracic and <b>abdominal</b> sensor <b>belts.</b> CG and respiratory signals revealed that, while seated, bilateral phrenic stimulation and sniff maneuvers consistently produced expansion of the abdomen associated with a forward peak of CG acceleration. In the standing posture, {{the direction of the}} CG peak was reversed and always directed backward. Unilateral phrenic stimulation induced an additional medial-lateral acceleration of the CG, directed toward the nonactive side while seated, but in the opposite direction while standing. These results suggest that isolated diaphragmatic contractions produce a constant disturbing pattern for a given posture, but with opposite effects between standing and seated postures. This could be related to the different biomechanical configuration of the body in each posture, corresponding to distinct kinematic patterns of the osteoarticular chain. In addition, the lateral component of the CG acceleration induced by unilateral diaphragm contractions could be clinically relevant in patients with hemidiaphragm paralysis...|$|R

As {{part of this}} trend, a new algorithm may emerge for pediatric trauma in which laparoscopic techniques are used in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected hollow viscus perforation. Case Report: We present {{a case in which}} laparoscopy was successfully used in a pediatric trauma patient as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality. A 4 -year-old boy was a back-seat passenger in a head-on collision motor vehicle accident. He was restrained by a lap seat belt. He sustained a concussion, a large forehead laceration and a seat <b>belt</b> <b>abdominal</b> injury. On admission, he complained of abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a soft, nondistended abdomen with moderate diffuse tenderness. He was hemodynamically stable. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed free fluid in the pelvis. No abnormalities were detected in the liver or spleen. Because of clinical deterioration and suspected intestinal perforation, diagnostic laparoscopy was utilized instead of proceeding directly to celiotomy. At laparoscopy a jejunal perforation was found and successfully repaired laparoscopically. Large hematomas were seen in the mesentery, as well as an unsuspected splenic laceration. No active bleeding was found. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 5 days following the surgical procedure. Conclusion: This case illustrates the efficacy of using early laparoscopy in children with abdominal trauma when diagnosis is difficult and hollow viscus injury is suspected...|$|R
40|$|Abdominal injuries, {{along with}} lumbar spine fractures, {{are part of}} a {{constellation}} of injuries referred to as "seat belt syndrome". Geometrical characteristics of the pelvis and abdomen of younger children place them at higher risk for these injuries. Efforts to design restraints that mitigate these injuries are limited as no current pediatric anthropomorphic dummy (ATD) can accurately quantify the <b>abdominal</b> response to <b>belt</b> loading. This paper describes progress on a four-phase project to address this gap involving pediatric anthropometrics, real-world abdominal injury risk, abdominal biomechanical structural response and injury tolerance from a porcine model, and development of an abdominal insert for the 6 -year-old ATD based on these data. Internal anthropometric measures consisted of radiological assessment of abdominal depth, height, and circumference at multiple horizontal planes. External measures consisted of distances, determined by digital photography, taken between skeletal markers while the child was seated on a vehicle seating apparatus with and without a booster seat. Field investigation identified three unique kinematic patterns resulting in abdominal injury: pre-submarining where the belt is initially out of position, classic submarining where the belt starts in position and the pelvis moves under the belt with the torso reclined, and submarining/jackknifing where the pelvis slides under the belt, and the torso flexes forward. The biomechanical studies developed age- and size-based correlations between pediatric swine and humans. Biomechanical tests performed using the most appropriately sized porcine model will be used to define the structural and injury response of the pediatric abdomen to realistic loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the 56 th AAAM Annual Conference, Annals of Advances in Automotive Medicine, October 14 ‐ 17, 2012. Currently, neither abdominal injury risk nor rear seat passenger safety is assessed in European frontal crash testing. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide real world in-depth analysis of the factors related to <b>abdominal</b> injury for <b>belted</b> front and rear seat occupants in frontal crashes. Rear occupants were significantly more at risk of AIS 2 + and 3 + abdominal injury, followed by front seat passengers and then drivers. This was still the case even after controlling for occupant age. Increasing age was separately identified as a factor related to increased abdominal injury risk in all seating positions. One exception to this trend concerned rear seated 15 to 19 year olds who sustained moderate to serious abdominal injury at almost the same rate as rear occupants aged 65 +. No strong associationwas seenbetween AIS 2 + abdominal injury rates andgender. The majority of occupant body mass indices ranged from underweight to obese. Across that range, the AIS 2 + abdominal injury rates were very similar but a small number of very obese and extremely obese occupants outside of the range did exhibit noticeably higher rates. An analysis of variance in the rate of AIS 2 + abdominal injury with different restraint systems showed that simple belt systems,as used by most rear seat passengers, were the least protective. Increasing sophistication of the restraint system was related to lower rates of injury. The ANOVA also confirmed occupant age and crashseverity as highly associated with abdominal injury risk. The most frequently injured abdominal organs for front seat occupants were the liver and spleen. Abdominal injury patterns for rear seat passengers were very different. While they also sustained significant injuries to solid organs, their rates of injury to the hollow organs (jejunum-ileum, mesentary, colon) were far higher even though the rate of fracture of two or more ribs did not differ significantly between seat positions. These results have implications for the design of restraint systems, particularly in relation to the occurrence of abdominal injury. They also raise issues of crash protection for older occupants as well as the protection afforded in different seating positions. ©Annals of Advances in Automotive Medicine...|$|R
