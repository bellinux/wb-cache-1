Thus, two strings in C are added by adding the bits in the strings modulo 2 (that is, <b>addition</b> <b>without</b> <b>carry,</b> or {{exclusive}} disjunction).

50|$|Addition of long {{integers}} {{suffers from}} the problem that carries have to be propagated {{from right to left}} and the final result is not known until this process has been completed. Carry propagation can be speeded up with carry look-ahead logic, but this still makes addition very much slower than it needs to be (for 512-bit addition, addition with carry look-ahead is 32 times slower than <b>addition</b> <b>without</b> <b>carries</b> at all).|$|R
40|$|The {{involvement}} of working memory (WM) was examined in {{two types of}} mental calculation tasks: exact and approximate. Specifically, children attending Grades 3 and 4 of primary school were involved in three experiments that examined the role of verbal and visuospatial WM in solving addition problems presented in vertical or horizontal format. For Experiment 1, the children were required to solve addition problems with carrying. For Experiment 2, {{they were required to}} solve <b>addition</b> problems <b>without</b> <b>carrying.</b> Then, for Experiment 3, the children needed to solve approximate problems with and <b>without</b> <b>carrying.</b> Results confirmed that different WM components are involved in solving mental addition problems. In Experiment 1, horizontally presented addition problems were more impaired than vertically presented ones, according to a verbal WM load; conversely, vertically presented addition problems were more affected by a visuospatial WM load, especially when the children were required to perform approximate calculations. In Experiment 2, this pattern emerged in neither exact nor approximate calculations. Finally, in Experiment 3, the specific {{involvement of}} WM components was observed only in problems with carrying. Overall, these results reveal that both approximate calculation and carrying procedures demand particularly high WM resources that vary according to the task’s constraints...|$|R

For a mixed radix numeral system b, let σ^b be the function that maps (x^ 0, [...] ., x^m - 1) ∈N^m to x^ 0 ⊕_b [...] . ⊕_b x^m - 1, where ⊕_b is <b>addition</b> <b>without</b> <b>carry</b> in b. We present variants of Nim whose Sprague-Grundy functions equal σ^b. Let Δ^b be the set of such games. When b is the binary numeral system, we determine Δ^b. In general, we give a characterization of b such that Δ^b has a unique minimal element, and a construction of the maximum element of Δ^b...|$|E

40|$|During vehicle {{deceleration}} due to {{friction between the}} lining and the brake drum, kinetic energy of the vehicle is turned into thermal energy that raises temperature of the drum brake components. This causesthermal elastic instability that affects braking performance and the brake drum lining failure. This work aimed to study the dynamic behaviors of the drum brake under various braking conditions. Three cases ofsevere braking are considered i. e., high wheel speed <b>without</b> <b>carrying</b> load, medium wheel speed <b>without</b> <b>carrying</b> load and medium wheel speed with full load. Moreover, a case of normal braking, having high wheelspeed <b>without</b> <b>carrying</b> load is also included for comparison purpose. Two dimensional finite element technique was adopted to simulate the dynamic interaction between temperature distribution, brake shoe movementand the declined of wheel speed. The coupled thermo-mechanical results reveal that severe braking {{is an important factor}} that causes high non-uniform temperature distributions and high-risk thermal elastic instability; whereas wheel speed and vehicle load have less effect on the braking behaviors...|$|R

50|$|The second takes {{advantage}} of the identity that −x = not(x)+1 and computes a−b as a+not(b)+1. The carry flag is set according to this addition, and subtract with carry computes a+not(b)+C, while subtract <b>without</b> <b>carry</b> acts as if the carry bit were set. The result is that the carry bit is set if a≥b, and clear if a<b. The System/360, 6502, MSP430, ARM and PowerPC processors use this convention. The 6502 is a particularly well-known example because it does not have a subtract <b>without</b> <b>carry</b> operation, so programmers must ensure that the carry flag is set before every subtract operation where a borrow is not required.|$|R
