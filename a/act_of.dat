5|$|According to Jain texts, {{the fruits}} of himsā (violence) depends upon the {{severity}} of passions {{at the time of}} commencement of such an act.

Also, when two persons commit the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> himsā jointly, its consequences on fruition (of karma), may be grave for one person and mild for the other.|$|E
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E
