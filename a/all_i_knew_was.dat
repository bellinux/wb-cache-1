500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{idea for}} it {{happened}} driving {{up and down}} Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles when I was putting together the Patti Smith book [...] last year," [...] Stipe said in 1998. [...] "I had CDs and tape of new songs in the car. I {{came up with this}} one line, 'I found a way to make you smile.' <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> The Beach Boys had a record or a song called Smile– is that right?– so I was like, 'Well, this will be my gift to [...] Peter and Mike, and Bill at the time. It was hard to write. It was a high order to say, 'I found a way to make you smile.' I had to come up with, 'OK, what are those ways?' That was tough." [...] Of the line, 'I found a way to make you smile', Stipe later recalled, [...] "I just thought, that's the most beautiful thing in the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Banjee. That was the {{identity}} I was given {{back in the}} summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E

Motherland was {{revealed to be}} a 12-track album and when asked why is it taking so long? she commented [...] "One needs to take one's time because good work takes time. But it must be worth the wait in the end." [...] At the 4th City People Awards, 14 July 2013, she lost South South Musician of the Year to fellow Rivers State recording artist Oba Omega; present at the occasion were the celebrities Rita Dominic and Yvonne Nelson from Ghana. Muma Gee competed in the first Imo State intercommunity beauty pageant, representing the community of Umuhu in Ngor Okpala. She came into the competition through her matrimonial union with Eke, whose heritage stems from the Umuhu people. On 1 August 2013, she was named Mrs. Ngor Okpala by first lady of Imo State, Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha, after beating off challenges from 28 other entrants. It was also made known on 23 September 2013, that Muma Gee has commenced a new recording session—possibly for Motherland—with Slim Burna and P Jaydino in the studio. On 15 February 2014, whilst heavily pregnant with her first child, she confirmed {{in a telephone interview}} with Saturday Beats of The Punch that she will be performing at the album launch party for Motherland regardless of her physical condition. On 18 April, just weeks before the anticipated concert, Uwame delivered twins – {{a boy and a girl}} commenting on this Uwame said, [...] "I was not initially expecting twins. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that I started getting big and bigger. And people would see me and say, oh, you are looking so beautiful. I didn't believe I was going to have twins." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that {{he disliked}} me {{and had some}} {{contempt}} for my person. Why? Apparently because his ship had been delayed three hours on my account. Who was I {{to have such a}} thing done for me? Such a thing had never been done for him. It was a sort of jealous indignation.|$|E

But I was not {{altogether}} a fool; Laura Stannard is a charming girl. The obstacle was, she saw I {{was not the}} man for her. Then I did not know you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{paid for}} it. It {{was two years}} and over before I knew what happened. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that I was Julian Jones and that I'd been blacklisted in the big strike, and that I was married to Sarah here. I mean that. I didn't know {{anything}} in between, and when Sarah tried to talk about it, it gave me pains in the head. I mean my head was queer, and I knew it was queer.|$|E

[...] I shouted at him in idiotic remonstrance, for my brain had gone, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that {{we were about to}} be thrown into the fiery pit.

6000|$|Pere Lenegre nodded: [...] "I {{only heard}} it this morning," [...] he said, [...] "from {{one or two}} {{threatening}} words the treacherous brute let fall. He knows that you lodge in the Place des Trois Maries, and that you come here frequently. I would have given my life to warn you then and there," [...] continued the old man with touching earnestness, [...] "but I didn't {{know where to find}} you. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that you were looking after Pierre." ...|$|E

"By Aphrodite, or by Isis, {{or both of}} them I did not know. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that I {{must seek}} him, then and evermore, as seek I do to-day and shall perchance through æons yet unborn.

60|$|I {{replied that}} I was innocent, but that I {{would wait for}} legal {{assistance}} before I defended myself. The justice remanded me and the examination was over. Three days later my unhappy mistress was subjected to the same trial. I {{was not allowed to}} communicate with her. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that the lawyer had arrived from London to help her. Toward the evening he was admitted to see me. He shook his head sorrowfully when I asked after my mistress.|$|E

60|$|Here {{and there}} they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that great gulf they had made, {{overtaken}} by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time this death was incomprehensible. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night.|$|E
60|$|And when Saturday night came, and the week's {{work was}} over until Monday morning, I knew only one desire besides {{the desire to}} sleep, {{and that was to}} get drunk. This was the second time in my life that I had heard the unmistakable call of John Barleycorn. The first time it had been because of brain-fag. But I had no over-worked brain now. On the contrary, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> the dull {{numbness}} of a brain that was not worked at all. That was the trouble. My brain had become so alert and eager, so quickened by the wonder of the new world the books had discovered to it, that it now suffered all the misery of stagnancy and inaction.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard the}} engine whistling, and I felt the speed easing down. I knew the train wasn't going to stop, {{but my mind}} was made up to chance it if she slowed down sufficiently. The right of way at this point took a curve, crossed a bridge over a canal, and cut through the town of Bristol. This {{combination}} compelled slow speed. I clung on to the side-ladder and waited. I didn't know it was the town of Bristol we were approaching. I {{did not know what}} necessitated slackening in speed. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that I wanted to get off. I strained my eyes in the darkness for a street-crossing on which to land. I was pretty well down the train, and before my car was in the town the engine was past the station and I could feel her making speed again.|$|E
6000|$|... "True, but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> where. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> {{that he once}} {{mentioned}} casually in one of {{his letters}} {{that he was going to}} Buenos Ayres, where he had some property." ...|$|R

60|$|And he spat in {{the grass}} at my feet. Then my anger seized me and was beyond me. The red wrath I call it--an overwhelming, all-mastering desire to kill and destroy. I forgot that Philippa waited {{for me in the}} great hall. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> my wrongs--the unpardonable {{interference}} in my affairs by the gray old man, the errand of the priest, the insolence of Fortini, the impudence of Villehardouin, and here Pasquini standing in my way and spitting {{in the grass}}. I saw red. I thought red. I looked upon all these creatures as rank and noisome growths that must be hewn out of my path, out of the world. As a netted lion may rage against the meshes, so raged I against these creatures. They were all about me. In truth, I was in the trap. The one way out was to cut them down, to crush them into the earth and stamp upon them.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{looked at}} each other like owls for a minute or two, and then they all began to talk at once. How had I sold the goods? had I charged the prices {{mentioned}} in the invoice? what percentage had I put on for profit? {{and a lot of other}} things. I waited until they were all out of breath, and then I said I had not bothered about invoices. I knew pretty well the prices such things cost in England. I clapped on so much more for the expenses of the voyage and a fair profit. I could tell them what I had paid for the figs and the currants, and for some bags of Smyrna sponges I had bought, but as to the prices I had charged, it was too much to expect that I could carry them in my head. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> I had paid for the things I had bought, I had paid all the port dues and other charges, I had advanced the men one-fourth of their wages each month, and I had brought them back the balance.|$|E
60|$|I now had no plan of action. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that I {{could not}} leave America without finding out {{something}} definite about this Barker business. That is to say, if it should be made known to me that instead of attending to my business, sending a carpenter to make repairs, if such were necessary, or going personally to the plumber {{to make sure that}} that erratic personage would give his attention to any pipes in regard to which Mr. Vincent might have written, Barker should mingle in sociable relations with my tenants, and drive or play tennis with the young lady of the house, then would I immediately have done with him. I would withdraw my business from his hands and place it in those of old Mr. Poindexter. More than that, it might be my duty to warn Miss Vincent's parents against Barker. I did not doubt that he was a very good house and land-agent, but in selecting him as such I had no idea of introducing him to the Vincents in a social way. In fact, the more I thought about it the more I became convinced that if ever I mentioned Barker to my tenants it would be to warn them against him. From certain points of view he was actually a dangerous man.|$|E
