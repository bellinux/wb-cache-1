40|$|Rock mass {{characterization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} basic and important tasks in rock mechanics and engineering. Literature review indicates that although there are many publications available on weathered rocks, there are few reports in English on weathered <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> rocks and their chemical and mechanical properties. This paper presents a case study of characterizing a group of highly weathered thick <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> rocks. Most importantly, they can be easily and quickly decomposed into soils after they are exposed due to excavation. Consequently, they would substantially lose their mechanical strengths. Geohazards such as landslides and sinkholes could occur in uncovered highly weathered <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> rocks. The problematic weathered rocks were found during the development of a new town in upper mountains above the Three Gorges Reservoir on Yangtze River in Central China in the past 20 years. The factual data are presented on the changes of chemical compositions and mechanical properties of the weathered <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> rocks due to chemical weathering. Some empirical correlations are given to quantify the changes in their uniaxial compressive strength and deformation moduli in terms of their contents of calcium carbonate. The data and findings presented in the paper can be useful to future urban development in geologically poor mountainous environments occupied by highly weathered <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> rocks in the world. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Problem statement: The Upper Cretaceous Gurpi {{and lower}} Tertiary Pabdeh {{formations}} as units of folded Zagros Zone were studied {{in three different}} regions (Tang-e-Abolhiat, Tang-e-Zanjiran and Maharloo) in Fars Province, Iran. Approach: Gurpi formation consisted of thin to medium sized layers of gray marl and marlstone interbedded with thin layers of <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> and shale. The dominant microfacies in this formation biomicrite; Index species of Globotruncana give {{the age of the}} Formation from lower companion to upper Maastrichtian.

30|$|Neritic to basinal marls and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Pabdeh Formation {{deposited}} in a Paleocene–Eocene transgression which {{resulted from the}} Late Cretaceous tectonic activities. This formation consists of shale, marl, and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> (Soleimani et al. 2013). A monotonous deep-water shale facies with a limestone unit in its middle part is the main lithology of the Pabdeh Formation. Based on lithological characteristics, the Pabdeh represents deposition in a deep-water, anoxic environment in an overall transgressive sequence. In the northern Persian Gulf, the Asmari and Gurpi formations overlay and underlie the Pabdeh Formation, respectively. There {{appears to be a}} transition to clean limestones of the Jahrum Formation toward the southwest (Sharland 2001). Regional equivalents of the Pabdeh Formation are the Umm er Radhuma, Rus, and Dammam formations.|$|R
50|$|The Decorah Shale {{is another}} {{formation}} of the Sinnipee Group. It is primarily made of fossiliferous shale.

Since the Decorah Shale is fossiliferous the Decorah Shale layer is often used as a place for amateur fossil hunters to begin their collections. It also serves as release of PO4 into the ground water system if acid rain is introduced to it. This allows, in some cases, for new minerals. The Decorah Shale formation is made of three members. These members are the Spects Ferry, a geological an <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone,</b> <b>argillaceous</b> dolomite, Calcareous shale and <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestones.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{depletion}} of natural resources, {{the requirement for}} sustainable development and environmental restrictions, such as those associated with the Kyoto Agreement, makes the re-use of waste materials increasingly important {{as we enter the}} new millennium. The use of one such material in concrete, ground granulated blast furnace slag is well-accepted {{in many parts of the}} world. However much research and experience of use is based on slags with low alkali levels and low chloride contents. Environmental and economic constraints may force the increased use of slags with higher alkali levels and chloride contents in future works. The alkali level parameter raises concern in respect of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) where susceptible aggregates are used. The performance of high alkali slags in the context of ASR was assessed by a modified version of the concrete prism expansion test, X-Ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Variables in the test programme were binder combination, slag alkali level, aggregate combination, and storage temperature. Previous research by the authors had identified Irish <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> aggregate as potentially classifiable as ASR-vulnerable, despite a low silica content and a satisfactory service record. The performance, in the context of ASR, of <b>argillaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> slag concretes was specifically studied. The study found that inclusion of slag in concrete can be beneficial in inhibiting ASR irrespective of the alkali content of the slag.
