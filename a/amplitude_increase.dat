For adaptation of the rapid shifts {{in the direction of}} gaze called saccades, the oculomotor vermis (OMV) of the cerebellum must be intact. We disrupted the neural circuitry of the OMV by manipulating gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the transmitter used by many neurons in the vermis. We injected either muscimol, an agonist of GABA, to inactivate the OMV or bicuculline, an antagonist, to block GABA inhibition. Our previous study showed that muscimol injections cause ipsiversive saccades to fall short of their targets, whereas bicuculline injections cause most ipsiversive saccades to overshoot. Once these dysmetrias had stabilized, we tested the monkey’s {{ability to adapt}} saccade size to intra-saccadic target steps that produced a consistent saccade under-shoot (<b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> adaptation required) or overshoot (amplitude decrease adaptation required). Injections of muscimol abolished the <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> adaptation of ipsiversive saccades, but had either no effect, or occasionally facilitated, amplitude decrease adaptation.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) observations reveal a seasonal cycle that {{is dominated by}} the growth and decay of land vegetation. Ground-based and aircraft-based observations indicate that the amplitude of this seasonal cycle has increased over the past five decades, suggesting enhanced biosphere activity. Previous studies have tried to explain the <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> with stimulated vegetation growth by higher concentrations of CO 2 and warming, but the understanding of all the important mechanisms and their relative contribution is still lacking. This work comprises of three individual studies that contribute to better understanding of the CO 2 <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> over time and space. With improved crop simulation scheme in a terrestrial carbon model, a new mechanism—the intensive farming practices of the agricultural Green Revolution—is presented as a driver of changes in the seasonal features of the global carbon cycle. Results are further compared with eight other models’ simulations and a number of observation-based datasets on the seasonal characteristics of simulated carbon flux, and on the relative contribution of rising CO 2, climate and land use/cover change. In addition, future projections on the amplitude change of CO 2 seasonal cycle are examined using simulations from 10 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) earth system models. Results from this work demonstrate that human land-management activities are powerful enough to modify the basic seasonal characteristics of the biosphere, as reflected by atmospheric CO 2. Models attribute 83 ± 56 %, − 3 ± 74 % and 20 ± 30 % of global carbon flux <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> to the CO 2, climate and land use/cover factors, respectively. Additionally, the models’ underlying mechanisms for the simulated carbon flux <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> in different regions are substantially different.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether cone redepolarization accounts for the <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> of the b-wave of the human electroretinogram (ERG) during light adaptation. The time course of the b-wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> was compared to the time course of the change in the activation phase of cone phototransduction, as derived from a delayed Gaussian model applied to the leading edge of the ERG a-wave. ERG recordings were obtained from five visually normal subjects, alternately in the presence of the adapting field (adapt-on condition) and 300 ms after its temporary extinction (adapt-off condition). The proportional increase in amplitude was less for Rmp 3 (maximum amplitude of P 3, the massed cone photoreceptor response) than for the b-wave for both adaptation conditions, and the time course of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> for Rmp 3 was faster than that for the b-wave in the adapt-off condition. The results demonstrate that time-dependent changes in the activation phase of cone phototransduction have only a minimal role in governing the increase in the amplitude of the human cone-derived ERG b-wave during light adaptation. In addition, the systematic increase in b-wave amplitude and the decrease in b-wave implicit time in the adapt-off condition indicates that the ERG response measured shortly after adapting field offset does not necessarily represent the waveform of the dark-adapted cone ERG...|$|E

40|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration {{declines in}} spring and summer, and rises in fall and winter. Ground-based and aircraft-based observation records indicate that the amplitude of this seasonal cycle has increased in the past. Will this trend continue in the future? In this paper, we analyzed simulations for historical (1850 – 2005) and future (RCP 8. 5, 2006 – 2100) periods produced by 10 Earth system models participating in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5). Our results present a model consensus that the increase of CO 2 seasonal amplitude continues throughout the 21 st century. Multi-model ensemble relative amplitude of detrended global mean CO 2 seasonal cycle increases by 62 ± 19 % in 2081 – 2090, compared to 1961 – 1970. This <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> corresponds to a 68 ± 25 % increase in net biosphere production (NBP). The {{results show that the}} increase of NBP amplitude mainly comes from enhanced ecosystem uptake during Northern Hemisphere growing season under future CO 2 and temperature conditions. Separate analyses on net primary production (NPP) and respiration reveal that enhanced ecosystem carbon uptake contributes about 75 % of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase.</b> Stimulated by higher CO 2 concentration and high-latitude warming, enhanced NPP likely outcompetes increased respiration at higher temperature, resulting in a higher net uptake during the northern growing season.

The amplitudes of magnetospheric ULF waves, which are induced by solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements or shocks, are thought to damp in one half a wave cycle or an entire wave cycle. We report in situ observations of solar wind dynamic pressure impulse‐induced magnetospheric ULF waves with increasing amplitudes. We found six ULF wave events induced by solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements with slow but clear wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase.</b> During three or four wave cycles, the amplitudes of ion velocities and electric field of these waves increased continuously by 1. 3 – 4. 4 times. Two significant events were selected to further study the characteristics of these ULF waves. We found that the wave amplitude growth is mainly contributed by the toroidal mode wave. Three possible mechanisms of causing the wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> are discussed. First, solar wind dynamic pressure perturbations, which are observed in a duration of 20 – 30  min, might transfer energy to the magnetospheric ULF waves continually. Second, the wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> in the radial electric field may be caused by superposition of two wave modes, a standing wave excited by the solar wind dynamic impulse and a propagating compressional wave directly induced by solar wind oscillations. When superposed, the two wave modes fit observations as does a calculation that superposes electric fields from two wave sources. Third, the normal of the solar wind discontinuity is at an angle to the Sun‐Earth line. Thus, the discontinuity will affect the dayside magnetopause continuously for a long time.

We, therefore, recorded SEPs in nine Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and in seven psychotic patients affected by neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), all showing severe rigidity. Each patient group was studied {{before and after the}} placebo, and before and after an atracurium besilate bolus of 0. 05 mg/kg, in a single recording session. At the time of the test the PD patients had not taken any antiparkinsonian therapy for at least 48 h. The same recordings were also taken on nine neurologically normal subjects undergoing surgical procedures. Atracurium administration produced a remarkable <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> of the major precentral component (N 30) of SEPs. An atracurium-induced N 30 <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> was observed in both PD patients (from 2. 41 to 4. 07 microV) and NMS psychotic patients (from 2. 03 to 3. 97 microV), whereas there was a minor N 30 <b>amplitude</b> <b>increase</b> in healthy subjects (from 3. 53 to 4. 10 microV). The N 30 latency was unaffected. Amplitude and latency of the major parietal SEPs component (N 20) was unchanged in the three groups studied. Our results lead to the conclusion that a neuromuscular blocking agent is capable of increasing the N 30 amplitude in patients affected by severe rigidity, exclusively reducing their muscular tone without interfering with the central dopaminergic system. Thus, a "peripheral gating" of sensory input to the supplementary motor area due to rigidity may play a relevant role in producing the N 30 amplitude decrease described in patients affected by degenerative or pharmacologically induced parkinsonism. The reduction of rigidity could be the mechanism by which dopamine may increase the precentral N 30 amplitude in parkinsonian syndromes...|$|E
