5|$|In William Urban's summary, {{almost all}} <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the battle {{made before the}} 1960s were more {{influenced}} by romantic legends and nationalistic propaganda than by fact.

5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws {{were based}} only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was supposedly from Dominica island. The violet macaw (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> blue parrots supposedly from Guadeloupe, is now thought to have been based on references to the Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E
5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about the mounted police from 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along with radio and television portrayals. The police were depicted as courageous, disciplined and chivalrous, displaying a sense of fair-play as they brought their suspects to justice. Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the mounted police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the force were produced. The force heavily influenced public perceptions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history {{to help make the}} modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E

5|$|The {{agents of}} the Catholic Church wrote {{detailed}} <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire. This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America. In 1839, American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood. Their illustrated <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya {{to the attention of}} the world. The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> the Maya, and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.|$|E

40|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} Hegel’s <b>account</b> <b>of</b> ‘self-consciousness’ in Chapter IV of the Phenomenology of Spirit {{can be read as}} an ‘immanent critique’ of Fichte’s idealism. If this is correct, it raises the question <b>of</b> whether Hegel’s <b>account</b> <b>of</b> ‘recognition’ in Chapter IV can be interpreted as a critique of Fichte’s conception of recognition as expounded in the Foundations of Natural Right. A satisfactory answer to this question will have to provide a plausible interpretation of the ‘life and death struggle’ as an immanent critique <b>of</b> Fichte’s <b>account</b> <b>of</b> recognition. This paper aims to provide such an interpretation. The first part of the paper provides a discussion <b>of</b> Fichte’s <b>account</b> <b>of</b> recognition that emphasizes its ‘epistemic’ concerns. The second part argues that Hegel’s <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the ‘life and death struggle’ can be read plausibly as a critique <b>of</b> Fichte’s <b>account</b> <b>of</b> recognition...|$|R
