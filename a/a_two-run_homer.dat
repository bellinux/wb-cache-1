5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Phillies claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and {{designated}} O'Sullivan for assignment, Williams {{started in the}} opener of a two-game series with the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels won 7–2. The Phillies also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's inconsistency continued. The second (and final) series of the road trip pitted the Phillies against the San Francisco Giants. Hamels started game one, allowing a three-run homer in the fourth inning to give the Giants a 3–0 lead. The Phillies rallied, with a Marlon Byrd {{home run in the}} fifth inning and <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Cody Asche to tie the game in the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save. In the second game, the Phillies jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5. The Phillies also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford.|$|E

50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the third, the Yankees scored two runs to take the lead on <b>a</b> Berra <b>two-run</b> <b>homer,</b> scoring Slaughter. After that Ernie Johnson would mercifully replace Buhl. Johnson then held the Yankees {{scoreless}} until the seventh inning.|$|R
50|$|The American Leaguers {{came right}} back in their half of the first inning. George Brett walked with one out, Don Baylor doubled him in, and Fred Lynn put the AL up 3-2 with <b>a</b> two-out, <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> off Steve Carlton.|$|R

25|$|Back home on August 28, Kershaw {{struck out}} 14 in eight innings and the Dodgers picked up their fourth {{straight}} win, 4–1, over the Chicago Cubs. The Dodgers won {{again the next}} day, 5–2, thanks to a two-run single by Andre Ethier in the seventh inning. However, they lost {{the final game of}} the series, 2–0, when Kris Bryant hit <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> and Jake Arrieta no-hit them, the second time the Dodgers had been no hit in the last week.

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on July 30, but Aaron Harang had a poor day, allowing a three run home run by Paul Goldschmidt and {{a grand slam}} by Chris Johnson as the Dodgers lost 7–2.

25|$|In game two, Zack Greinke {{shut out}} the Cardinals on two hits over seven innings, while {{striking}} out seven.

Matt Kemp hit a solo homer {{in the bottom of}} the eighth to give the Dodgers back the lead and Kenley Jansen closed it out for a 3–2 win and even the series.|$|E
50|$|May 26 - Andrés Galarraga hits <b>a</b> 469-foot <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> and Vinny Castilla adds a solo shot as the Colorado Rockies {{overcome}} a six-run deficit {{to beat the}} Cardinals 9-7. Galarraga has four RBI, and his moon shot off Mark Petkovsek is the third-longest homer in the three-season history of Coors Field.|$|R
50|$|Game 3 was a back-and-forth contest {{won by the}} Mets when Lenny Dykstra hit <b>a</b> <b>two-run,</b> walk-off <b>homer</b> against Astros' {{reliever}} Dave Smith in {{the bottom}} of the ninth inning, giving New York a 6-5 victory and 2-1 series lead on a Saturday afternoon at Shea Stadium.|$|R
50|$|With {{the series}} {{shifting}} to Philadelphia, rookie Charles Hudson {{turned in a}} pitching gem, going the distance and allowing only four hits. <b>A</b> fourth-inning <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Mike Marshall was Hudson's lone mistake.

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 29 {{to play the}} Pirates in a four-game series.

50|$|In April 1970, {{at least}} one news report mistakenly said Rojas was {{critically}} injured in an auto accident. In fact it was former major leaguer Minnie Rojas. In the 1972 All-Star Game in Atlanta, he hit <b>a</b> pinch-hit, <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the eighth inning, {{which was the first}} time that a non-American-born player had ever homered for the American League in the mid-summer classic.|$|R

25|$|Hyun-jin Ryu {{made the}} {{start for the}} Dodgers at Busch Stadium in Game 3, his first {{appearance}} since leaving {{a game against the}} Giants with an injury on September 12. He pitched well, allowing only one run (on another Carpenter homer) and four hits in six innings. However, the Dodgers were also only able to push across one run against Cardinals starter John Lackey. For the third straight game, the bullpen faltered. This time it was Scott Elbert who allowed <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> to Kolten Wong, the difference maker in the 3–1 loss.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} game of the series against the Tigers on October 1, the Braves damaged the Tigers' wild-card hopes with five runs, {{including}} <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Freeman and a solo homer by Markakis, in a 5-3 victory. In {{the final game of}} the season, and last at Turner Field, the Braves beat the Tigers 1-0 with Freddie Freeman's first-inning sacrifice fly providing the only run of the game to finish the season at 68-93, {{and for the first time}} all season, the Braves did not have the worst record in the National League. This win eliminated the Tigers from postseason contention.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on August 25 for a three-game {{series against the}} Milwaukee Brewers on Players Weekend. Kenta Maeda allowed only one hit in six innings with seven strikeouts. Forsythe and Puig homered and the Dodgers won 3–1. In the next game, Zach Davies shut out the Dodgers over seven innings with seven strikeouts and the bullpen finished the job as the Brewers won 3–0 with <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Orlando Arcia being the main offense. The Brewers took the next game as well, 3–2, handing the Dodgers their first series defeat since June 5–7.|$|E

25|$|On April 16 {{against the}} Cincinnati Reds, Pujols {{continued}} his hot start, hitting three home runs, including <b>a</b> walk-off <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{in the bottom}} of the ninth to give the Cardinals an 8-7 victory. The three-dinger day was the second of his career and gave him eight home runs in the Cardinals' first twelve games. St. Louis would continue playing well through April and finished the month with a record of 17-8.|$|R
50|$|Shannon {{began his}} big-league {{career with the}} St. Louis Cardinals in 1962. In 1964, he became the team's regular right fielder, {{shifting}} to third base (in order {{to make room for}} the newly acquired Roger Maris) in 1967. Shannon played in three World Series for the Cardinals. He hit <b>a</b> game-tying <b>two-run</b> <b>homer</b> off Whitey Ford in the Game 1 of the 1964 World Series against the New York Yankees, which St. Louis won 9-5.|$|R
