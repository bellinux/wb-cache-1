50|$|The CLC-1 radar is {{installed}} on the Type 95 (also known as PGZ-95) self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery (SPAA) system as the main search and acquisition radar. This system can operate while moving. It has very strong <b>anti-clutter</b> capacity, can acquire and track ultra-low altitude attacking targets and direct guns to counterattack effectively.|$|E
50|$|The JY-9 {{has high}} {{anti-jamming}} and <b>anti-clutter</b> capability {{due to the}} use of advanced techniques, including pulse to pulse frequency agility, dual channel, JATS, wide operating band, low sidelobes, MTD automatic spectrum processing, automatic clutter map and automatic residue map. The mean time between failures is better than 900 hours with Built-in test equipment (BITE).|$|E
50|$|The JY-9F {{consists}} of an antenna assembly, an operations shelter, a trailer-installed shelter housing two diesel generators and an optional trailer-installed shelter. The antenna can be folded down or erected by a motor-driven mechanism and the assembling and disassembling of the system {{can be accomplished by}} a crew of eight men within one hour. This advanced radar incorporates the state-of-the-art techniques. The excellent low sidelobe antenna employed in the system has greatly enhanced the radar's <b>anti-clutter</b> capability and ECCM performance, giving improved low-altitude detection performance. Three AMTI processing channels are used, each equipped to handle a particular environmental condition, thereby providing maximum low-altitude target detection. The wideband and highly stable TWT+CFA transmitter guarantees a super-clutter visibility in excess of 40 dB in the presence of ground clutter. The quadriphase Taylor code ensures a desirable consistency, high reliability and high stability. Meanwhile, the waveform agility can be realised. The JY-9F radar is characterised by high reliability and maintainability with an MTBF of more than 400 hours and MTTR of less than 30 minutes. Due to extensive BITE adopted in the system, troubleshooting probability reaches 95 per cent while 85 per cent of faults can be isolated to PCB level and all faults can be isolated to the replaceable unit level.|$|E
5000|$|Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B- stating, [...] "But why graft three full stories (and {{possibly}} a fourth) together into one resultingly cluttered episode? It’s a common complaint, {{but a lot}} of recent Simpsons episodes waste promising storylines this way. You’ve got Homer and his pig buddy, coming back together before a barbeque sauce-and-hounds mishaps leads to Mr. Burns taking a shine to the injured Plopper. But that’s only set up by Marge’s enthusiasm for a Japanese <b>anti-cluttering</b> book/philosophy that sees her urging the family to toss out anything that 'no longer brings them joy' (that’s an episode), which leads to Lisa discovering that, once she’s given away everything but her sax (and her Bleeding Gums Murphy poster), she’s lost all joy in playing. 'I finally feel about my sax the way you all do!,' she wails in horror. And that’s another episode. Throw in some promising emotional beats to that story—Homer comforts the confused Lisa during an anxiety attack, Bart hijacks the school’s PA system to restore her love for jazz—and there’s an abundance of good ideas not given enough time to come to fruition." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{constant}} {{false alarm}} rate (CFAR) target detector in non-homogenous backgrounds is proposed. Based on K-sample Anderson-Darling (AD) tests, the method re-arranges the reference cells by merging homogenous sub-blocks surrounding the cell under test (CUT) {{into a new}} reference window to estimate the background statistics. Double partition test, clutter edge refinement and outlier elimination are used as an <b>anti-clutter</b> processor in the proposed Modified AD (MAD) detector. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed MAD test based detector outperforms cell-averaging (CA) CFAR, greatest of (GO) CFAR, smallest of (SO) CFAR, order-statistic (OS) CFAR, variability index (VI) CFAR, and CUT inclusive (CI) CFAR in most non-homogenous situations...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} of a carotid artery with no tilt and an artery with a 20 degrees tilt is performed {{in order to}} test the performance of a multi-dimensional flow velocity estimation technique based on speckle tracking. The results from the speckle tracking algorithm are compared to the ground truth data. There have been performed speckle tracking on the unfiltered simulation data, and on the data filtered with two clutter filters with different filter characterization. From the resulting speckle track data the velocity profiles at different time steps along one cardiac cycle have been estimated and plotted, to be compared with the corresponding plot for the ground truth velocity estimations. Three different grids in the artery have been analyzed, grids in the common, external and internal carotid artery. The volume flow has been estimated over one cardiac cycle based on the velocity estimations from the speckle tracking and the ground truth, using two different ways of finding the mean velocity. All the computations are done in MATLAB. Assuming an adequate <b>anti-clutter</b> filter or a sufficient beam-to-flow angle, this study indicates that speckle tracking can give a relative good volume flow estimastion of the blood flow. Overcoming the limitations of conventional flow imaging, which can only measure the velocity along the ultrasound beam. Future work could be similar stuides for in vitro and in vivo experiments. </p...|$|E
