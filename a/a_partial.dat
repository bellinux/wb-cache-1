The competition-common enemy graph, {{a variant of}} the competition graph, of <b>a</b> doubly <b>partial</b> order is also an interval graph if it does not contain a 4 -cycle as an induced subgraph. It is natural to ask whether or not the same phenomenon occurs for other interesting variants of the competition graph.

We show that the m-step competition graph of <b>a</b> doubly <b>partial</b> order is <b>an</b> interval graph for every positive integer m.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>partial</b> eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
