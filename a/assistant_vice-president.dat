500|$|In October 1980, Luis Vigdor, <b>assistant</b> <b>vice-president</b> for bullion and numismatic {{operations}} of Manfra, Tordella & Brookes, {{then one of}} the largest coin firms in the country, compared the medallions and the efforts to market them unfavorably to the South African Krugerrand. According to Vigdor, they were difficult to market due to their lack of notation of weight, fineness and country of origin. He also criticized the marketing, asserting that people were unlikely to buy gold at the post office, and that the medallions were advertised poorly. Vigdor contrasted the medallions' marketing program with the widespread success of the Krugerrand and the vigorous attempts to market them around the world. Commenting on the poor sale of the medallions, assistant director of marketing for the Mint Francis Frere said in 1984: [...] "it just hasn't worked. They're not selling. We've made a strong effort, but it's not working." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, The Globe and Mail {{reported}} that Sonia Zhao quit her teaching position at McMaster University's Confucius Institute in Hamilton, Ontario, and sought political asylum in Canada based on religious discrimination. In a complaint filed to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Ms. Zhao stated {{she was forced}} to hide her belief in the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which the Chinese government calls an illegal [...] "evil cult", and argued that McMaster [...] "is giving legitimization to discrimination." [...] She told an interviewer that during her CI training in Beijing, she was told that if students asked about Tibet or other sensitive topics, [...] "Don’t talk about this. If the student insists, you just try to change the topic, or say something the Chinese Communist Party would prefer." [...] Andrea Farquhar, McMaster’s <b>assistant</b> <b>vice-president</b> of public and government affairs, said the university was [...] "looking for clarity" [...] from its Chinese partners on aspects of their agreement, notably hiring practices. Having lent its name to the Confucius Institute on its campus, Ms. Farquhar said McMaster was insisting that Canadian laws and expectations be respected. In 2013, McMaster University announced they would close their Confucius Institute. Andrea Farquhar explained that after months of making a concerted effort to save their 5-year partnership with Hanban, [...] "We were uncomfortable, and felt that it didn’t reflect the way the university would do hiring", and explained that McMaster’s Chinese partners replied with a letter expressing [...] "some disappointment." [...] Ms. Zhao, a Chinese citizen, has since been granted refugee status in Canada.|$|E
