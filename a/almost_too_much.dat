500|$|In {{the fourth}} round Arsenal faced Stoke City of the Second Division at home. They made light {{work of the}} opposition, winning by three goals and once more set a unique record: David O'Leary's strike meant all 10 regular outfield players each had scored for Arsenal during the season. In his match report for The Times, Stuart Jones assessed: [...] "Having {{experienced}} northing but victory {{since the end of}} August, Arsenal are walking around with <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> belief," [...] and felt complacency was the only issue preventing the club from reaching the quarter-finals.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were {{generally}} positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly praised guest actor Alan Ruck's [...] "sustained, understated" [...] performance, and also called Olivia being revealed as Bell's vessel [...] "a clever development," [...] especially praising actress Anna Torv's imitation of Nimoy's voice rather than [...] "doing the obvious thing and hav her lip-synch Nimoy reading the lines." [...] The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that unlike Tucker, he thought the idea of [...] "soul magnets" [...] was [...] "just so goofy that it's <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for me to handle". VanDerWerff also felt there wasn't much of {{a connection between the}} episode and the ongoing storyline [...] "until the show tries to force one in a way that doesn't feel as elegant as the show usually makes this stuff feel". He did however praise Ruck as [...] "well-cast," [...] and wrote the episode [...] "very nearly managed" [...] to parallel Walter's [...] "desperate measures to the desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science," [...] which the reviewer considers the strongest asset of the show.|$|E
500|$|Solange Knowles {{included}} {{the song in}} the set list for her 2013 world tour, which has received praise from music critics. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle wrote that Knowles had [...] "put a lovely, downtempo twist on 'I Could Fall in Love". Michael O'Connell of the Hollywood Reporter called Knowles' rendition a [...] "fangirl cover". Writing in the San Francisco Weekly, Erin Browner considered Knowles' cover the [...] "highlight of the night" [...] when she performed it {{at the start of}} her US tour. Browner commented that the [...] "combination of sexy Solange and Selena's epic love song was <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the audience to handle" [...] and that [...] "people immediately whipped out their phones to record (yep, it's already on YouTube) and/or just plain cried the lyrics along with her". On 29 March 2015, Filipino singers Angeline Quinto, Yeng Constantino, and Juris Fernandez performed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] for the variety show ASAP. American singer Adrienne Bailon performed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] after a six-year departure from the music business, during the March 31, 2015 episode of The Real; a talk show she currently hosts.|$|E
5000|$|Abbey's disgust {{with the}} novel was immediate. According to James M. Cahalan's biography, Edward Abbey, A Life, {{he could barely}} get through the galleys before the book was published. He said it seemed [...] "even worse than I had thought," [...] too [...] "juvenile, naive, succeeded in <b>almost</b> nothing. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> empty rhetoric, not enough meat and bone. Not convincing. All the obvious faults of the beginner." ...|$|R

Poor Madeline's unfortunate marriage and terrible accident, my mother's ill-health, my father's absence from England, and last, and worse perhaps, my own roving, idle spirit have <b>almost</b> been <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her. You cannot wonder if among all her cares {{one of the foremost}} is to see me settled in the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reception to {{the various}} incarnations of the story have been positive, with Publishers Weekly saying that the graphic novel's [...] "crisp and vividly {{rendered}} drawings capture the haunting sense of loss and isolation Gaiman expresses in this mythic tale of love and jealousy." [...] Valentinelli of FlamesRising.com praised the casting for the audio drama, but said that the plot was [...] "a bit <b>too</b> vague and <b>almost</b> leaves <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to the imagination." ...|$|R
2500|$|Her fifth album, Rejoice, was {{released}} on 19 November 2007 and included songs written specially for her, two by Take That's Gary Barlow. The album entered the pop album charts at number three, beating the Spice Girls and Girls Aloud. Jenkins commented [...] "I never imagined when I {{was a young girl}} listening to them on the radio that I would outsell the Spice Girls and Celine Dion. It’s <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to take in. I can’t thank my fans enough for all their support." ...|$|E
2500|$|Worth began sewing dresses to {{complement}} the shawls at Gagelin. Initially, these were simple designs, but his expert tailoring {{caught the eye of}} the store's clients. Eventually, Gagelin granted Worth permission to open a dress department, his first official entrance into the dressmaking world. A 1958 article in The Times published shortly before a centenary exhibition in London to mark the opening of his Paris fashion house noted that the ambitious Englishman's ideas were <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for his employers: [...] "The young Worth, full of ideas, was having such a success at Gagelin's that it was felt necessary to restrain his rashness". His obituary, written by a Paris correspondent for The Times explained this comment in somewhat more detail, saying that he was refused a share in the Gagelin business, even though he had extended its activities into making up, rather than just selling, garments. He had also helped build the company's international reputation by exhibiting prize-winning designs to both The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and the Exposition Universelle in Paris four years later. At the Paris exposition he had displayed a white silk court train embroidered in gold.|$|E
2500|$|The spell {{itself and}} its {{consequences}} are certainly less easy to work out effectively than {{was the case with}} the famous spell in The Sorcerer.... After this the fun soon becomes fast and furious — too furious to be in our judgment characteristic of the author's happiest manner. [...] There is certainly a good deal of drollery in Foggerty's interview with Malvina de Vere, and their friendly steps towards an action for breach of promise. [...] But there is <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of it, and there is certainly too much of the satire upon mad-doctors and their ways which occurs when Foggerty's friends believe him demented, and try to get a certificate to that effect from Dr. Lobb and Dr. Dobb. The climax, therefore, which is brought about when the hero takes a pill, summons the fairy once more, and brings matters back to their status quo, is very welcome, for towards the last the fun is felt to be flagging. [...] The mad dream has been almost too long as well as too elaborate in its absurdities. [...] This fault, if it be found to exist, can, of course, be readily remedied, as there seems no real need for the hero's false confession, à la Topsy, of a crime which he never committed.|$|E
5000|$|The Syriza-ANEL {{coalition}} resigned on the 20 August 2015, {{and remained}} as lame ducks until 28 August when a caretaker cabinet led by Vassiliki Thanou was appointed. Speaking to the Observer before the September 2015 legislative election, Xydakis said: [...] "We have all aged. It seems like years {{since we were}} elected, {{and yet it was}} only months ago. So much has happened, events have been so big, it has <b>almost</b> been <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for anyone to take in." ...|$|R
60|$|Then came a {{note from}} Miss Baker, asking {{him to come to}} Littlebath. It was good-humoured, playful, <b>almost</b> witty; <b>too</b> <b>much</b> so for Miss Baker's unassisted epistle-craft, and he at once saw that Caroline had {{dictated}} it. Her heart at any rate was light. He answered it by one equally good-humoured and playful, and perhaps more witty, addressed of course to Miss Baker, in which he excused himself at present in consequence of the multiplicity of his town engagements. It was June, and he could not get away without making himself guilty of all manner of perjuries; but in August he would certainly take Littlebath on his way to Scotland.|$|R
60|$|Such a {{child will}} <b>almost</b> always be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> noticed; and it is {{scarcely}} possible entirely to guard against the evil: hence vanity, and under bad management selfishness of the worst kind. And true it is, that under better and even the best management, such constitutions are liable to selfishness; not showing itself {{in the shape of}} tyranny, caprice, avarice, meanness, envy, skulking, and base self-reference; but selfishness of a worthier kind, yet still rightly called by that name. What I mean I shall explain afterwards.|$|R
2500|$|Hazlitt was {{ambivalent}} about Rome, the farthest {{point of his}} journey. His first impression was one of disappointment. He had expected primarily the monuments of antiquity. But, he asked, [...] "what has a green-grocer's stall, a stupid English china warehouse, a putrid trattoria, a barber's sign, an old clothes or old picture shop or a Gothic palace ... to do with ancient Rome?" [...] Further, [...] "the picture galleries at Rome disappointed me quite". Eventually he found plenty to admire, but the accumulation of monuments of art in one place was <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for him, and there were also too many distractions. There were the [...] "pride, pomp, and pageantry" [...] of the Catholic religion, as well as having {{to cope with the}} [...] "inconvenience of a stranger's residence at Rome....You want some shelter from the insolence and indifference of the inhabitants....You have to squabble with every one about you to prevent being cheated, to drive a hard bargain in order to live, to keep your hands and your tongue within strict bounds, for fear of being stilettoed, or thrown into the Tower of St. Angelo, or remanded home. You have much to do to avoid the contempt of the inhabitants....You must run the gauntlet of sarcastic words or looks for a whole street, of laughter or want of comprehension in reply to all the questions you ask....|$|E

5000|$|Homo Magi: a {{subspecies}} {{of humanity}} {{with the natural}} ability to use magic, this race <b>almost</b> disappeared after <b>too</b> <b>much</b> crossbreeding with normal humans (it's from them {{that people in the}} DC universe inherited the ability to use magic.) The last pure blooded ones decided to retire to a magical invisible city centuries ago, and are now known as [...] "The Hidden Ones". Zatanna knows many of the race's secrets, and Traci Thirteen is currently investigating magical and occult phenomena for the Croatoan Society—both women had Homo Magi mothers.|$|R
60|$|For a {{time all}} went well. The river {{was in high}} flood, for the snow-fall there, as elsewhere, had been unusually heavy, but all three were expert voyageurs, and succeeded in {{steering}} past difficulties of all kinds, until one afternoon, when good fortune seemed to forsake them utterly. They began by running the canoe against a sunk tree, or snag, and were obliged to put ashore to avoid sinking. The damage was, however, easily remedied; and while Ian was busy with the repairs his comrades prepared a hot dinner, which meal they usually ate cold in the canoe. Next they broke a paddle. This was also easily replaced. After that they ventured to run a rapid which <b>almost</b> proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for them; it nearly overturned the canoe, and filled it so full of water that they were compelled to land again, unload, and empty it.|$|R

5000|$|Kevin Yeoman of ScreenRant {{criticized the}} episode in his review, writing, [...] "Like {{the hours before}} it, [...] "Monster Swamp" [...] is loaded with memorable moments that serve the {{characters}} but not necessarily the plot." [...] However, Yeoman noted, [...] "With {{the possible exception of}} Tulip, no one else has matched the energy Gilgun brings to his scenes ..." [...] He highly praised Gilgun by stating, [...] "... Gilgun's animated and engaging performance - is <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> appealing, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fun to be around, and as a result, some of the other characters pale in comparison." [...] SFX Magazine's Anthony John Agnello remarked that, [...] "Monster Swamp doesn’t fix Preacher’s Jesse Custer problem, nor does it actually establish a coherent core plot." [...] However, John Agnello felt that [...] "Odin Quincannon's presence is so strong here that those issues at least don't overshadow the solid performances within.|$|R
60|$|As {{the days}} went on Tephany grew paler and paler, till {{everybody}} noticed it except her aunt.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two simulator experiments {{studying how}} accurately pilots can judge and reproduce specific g loads {{and how their}} control behavior depends on the sensation of physical g loads during unusual attitude recovery. Seventeen commercial pilots participated. The first experiment shows that pilots tend to overestimate g loads, resulting in performance below the target g load. With brief training, their performance instantly improved up to adequate levels. However, a retest after 6 months shows that this improvement did not endure. The second experiment shows that centrifuge-based g cueing helps pilots to recover from a nose-low unusual attitude, with significantly smaller deviations and within the limit load, whereas in the fixed-base condition they tend to pull <b>almost</b> 20 % <b>too</b> <b>much</b> g load. It is concluded that physical g cueing results in improved upset recovery control and may contribute to more realistic and adequate recovery training.

5000|$|Finn {{tells of}} the AMA's (American Medical Association) visit to Dublin. After finding and {{reporting}} endless problems in Dublin's facilities, the Irish threw them out. Finn tells the narrator to use {{the back door to}} his pub rather than the front on any bad days. He says that thinking only brings problems, and that it's better to drink and enjoy being alive. He also recommends a good pub in Dublin called [...] "The Four Provinces." [...] The narrator goes to The Four Provinces on the extremely dull day of Sunday. He meets a man that tells him that thanking others for things makes life much better. The narrator leaves the pub and comes across a woman playing her harp. He thanks her and tells her what an effect she had on his day. However, he finds that he <b>almost</b> thanked her <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> to the point where she stops playing for a while.|$|R
60|$|But the {{argument}} drawn from that comparison between our own conduct {{when we were}} creating our debt, and {{the conduct of the}} Americans while they have been creating their debt--during the twelve months from April 1, 1861, to March 31, 1862, let us say--is hardly a fair argument. We, at any rate, knew how to tax ourselves--if only the taxes might be forthcoming. We were already well used to the work; and a minister with a willing House of Commons had all his material ready to his hand. It has not been so in the United States. The difficulty has not been with the people who should pay the taxes, but with the minister and the Congress which {{did not know how to}} levy them. Certainly not as yet have those who are now criticising the doings on the other side of the water a right to say that the American people are unwilling to make personal sacrifices for the carrying out of this war. No sign has as yet been shown of an unwillingness on the part of the people to be taxed. But wherever a sign could be given, it has been given on the other side. The separate States have taxed themselves very heavily for the support of the families of the absent soldiers. The extra allowances made to maimed men, amounting generally to twenty-four shillings a month, have been paid by the States themselves, and have been paid <b>almost</b> with <b>too</b> <b>much</b> alacrity.|$|R
