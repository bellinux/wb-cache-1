5|$|Law {{originally}} {{found a job}} as {{a traveling}} carpet salesman. He continued until he discovered that his employer was misrepresenting domestic rugs as being imported and was also charging premium prices. His next employer, an outfitter of steamships and hotels, went out of business in the 1860s, when the American Civil War affected the business. Law struggled through unemployment, and even while working, pay was low. At one point, Law was employed at <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> was making eight dollars a week.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. <b>A</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{was born}} in 1871 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to wealthy parents, Eliza and Edward P. Howe, who owned <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> part of a {{wholesale}} business. Edward P. Howe, originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, had been a captain with the Union Army in the Civil War and made an unsuccessful run for the Indiana State Senate as a Democrat before Louis' birth. Louis had two stepsisters, Maria and Cora, from his mother's previous marriage. Howe was sickly and fragile as a child, suffered from asthma, and was generally kept home by his parents; he would never grow to more than five feet tall. Fearing to expose Howe to public school, his parents instead enrolled him in an all-girls seminary.|$|E
5|$|In 1736, a ferry {{began to}} operate, {{traveling}} from Shawnee between Shawnee Island and Depuy Island, then across the Delaware River to New Jersey. By 1740 Aaron Depuy was operating <b>a</b> <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> in 1753 {{he built a}} stone and log church used by ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church. The cornerstone of this church remains, {{now part of the}} Shawnee Presbyterian Church. The farming community grew steadily, using the river to transport produce. A post office was built in 1843, and a brick church was erected in 1853 on the foundation of the old stone and log church. Some of the original beams still remain, as well as the original sounding board.|$|E
5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again used as <b>a</b> <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As {{there was no}} signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E

25|$|When David Deshler {{purchased}} Taylor's former house, he {{was living}} in Northampton Town (now Allentown) in what was then part of Northampton County. Deshler built Northampton Town's first house in 1762, the year of the town's founding. Initially, he operated <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> tavern here, but later started a saw mill and grist mill, Northampton Town's first industries. By the mid-1770s, {{he was one of the}} region's wealthiest men.|$|E

25|$|Copse Road Depot {{was built}} in 1897 by the Blackpool & Fleetwood Tramroad Company with six tracks, capable of housing 18 trams. It was {{originally}} used as <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> service depot. After passing to Blackpool Corporation Tramways {{it was used to}} dismantle old trams. Between 1925 and 1949 a line connected the depot with the railway and was used to shunt wagons. The depot is now a car showroom and the substation still feeds the Fleetwood section.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{two years}} later, {{a close friend}} and non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, {{proposed}} marriage and became Emma's second husband on December 23, 1847. Bidamon moved into the Mansion House and became stepfather to Emma's children. Emma and Bidamon attempted to operate <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> to continue using their large house as a hotel, but Nauvoo had too few residents and visitors to make either venture very profitable. Emma and her family remained rich in real estate but poor in capital.|$|E
25|$|She {{was ordered}} from Robert Batson, Limehouse on 11 August 1780 and was {{laid down in}} December that year. Guardian was {{launched}} on 23 March 1784, too late to see service in the American War of Independence and was instead fitted out at Deptford Dockyard for ordinary. The builder was paid £12,322.12.11d for her construction, with the Admiralty paying another £4,420 to fit her out. After five years spent laid up she was fitted out at Woolwich in 1789 to serve as <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> convict transport, commissioning under Post-Captain Edward Riou in April.|$|E

25|$|Boggs was {{accompanied}} by his second wife Panthea and his younger {{children as well as}} his son William and William's bride Sonora Hicklin. They arrived in Sonoma, California in November and were provided refuge by Mariano Vallejo at his Petaluma ranch house. There, on January 4, 1847, Mrs. William Boggs gave birth to a son, who was named Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo Boggs after their benefactor. Lilburn Boggs became alcalde of the Sonoma district in 1847. During the California Gold Rush, Boggs owned <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> did quite well. On November 8, 1849, Boggs resigned as alcalde and became the town's postmaster.|$|E
25|$|Marie Duclos Fretageot managed Pestalozzian {{schools that}} Maclure {{organized}} in France and Philadelphia {{before coming to}} New Harmony aboard the Philanthropist. In New Harmony she {{was responsible for the}} infant's school (for children under age five), supervised several young women she had brought with her from Philadelphia, ran <b>a</b> <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> was Maclure's administrator during his residence in Mexico. Fretageot remained in New Harmony until 1831, returned to France, and later joined Maclure in Mexico, where she died in 1833. Correspondence of Maclure and Fretageot from 1820 to 1833 was extensive and is documented in Partnership for Posterity.|$|E
25|$|In this fashion, Rush's system {{implemented}} <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> forward public message system {{similar to}} Usenet, but based on, and hosted by, the FidoNet system. The first such echomail forum was one {{created by the}} Dallas area sysops to discuss business, known as SYSOP. Another called TECH soon followed. Several public echos soon followed, including GAYNET and CLANG. These spawned hundreds of new echos, {{and led to the}} creation of the Echomail Conference List (Echolist) by Thomas Kenny in January 1987. Echomail produced world-spanning shared forums, and its traffic volume quickly surpassed the original netmail system. By the early 1990s, echo mail was carrying over 8 MB of compressed message traffic a day, many times that when uncompressed.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} Hathorn, a native of today's Delaware, {{had been on the}} {{surveying}} team that established the present land border between New York and New Jersey, which had been the subject of a lengthy conflict between the two colonies for much of the 18th century. He settled in Warwick and opened <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> iron forge in 1770, and built the house after marrying Elizabeth Welling, daughter of his local host, in 1772. The inscription of their initials and the year of construction {{in the side of the}} house is a tradition more commonly associated with Germanic building traditions, a sign of how influential settlers of that background were in the Hudson Valley.|$|E
25|$|The first {{store in}} the village was opened about 1824 or 1825 by John Ryon Jr. and Robert Tubbs. In 1828, Joel Parkhurst, who had {{previously}} been in business with his brother in Lawrenceville, came to Elkland, joined with and later bought them out. He became within a few years, not only a leading business man, but the wealthiest citizen of the Cowanesque valley, maintaining {{at the same time}} a well-deserved reputation for liberality, enterprise, and public spirit. In 1832, George L. and Samuel Ryon opened <b>a</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> continued in business until 1843. About 1833, Timothy S. and David Coates engaged in merchandising and lumbering, continuing until 1854, when Clark Kimball of Osceola, succeeded David. Other changes occurred previous to Mr. Coates’s retirement in 1859 or 1860.|$|E
25|$|At trial {{the village}} {{attorney}} had given testimony {{suggesting that he}} did not know the meaning of some of the terms in the guidelines, and the village president had testified that she did not know what, exactly, was being regulated. The Flipside had argued that these pointed to the statute's vagueness, but Leighton dismissed those concerns. Both passages had been taken out of context, he wrote. The attorney had been describing how he relied on a report from the police on how such items were displayed in <b>a</b> <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> the village president had similarly explained how she had relied on expertise from the police that she did not herself possess to inform her vote in favor of the ordinance. The judge also noted that the village had enacted an administrative review process to resolve questions over potentially vague terms in the ordinance at the time of any application for a license.|$|E
