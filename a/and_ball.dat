5000|$|A typical cups <b>and</b> <b>balls</b> routine {{includes}} {{many of the}} most fundamental effects of magic: the balls can vanish, appear, transpose, reappear and transform. Basic skills, such as misdirection, manual dexterity, sleight of hand, and audience management are also essential to most cups <b>and</b> <b>balls</b> routines. As a result, mastery of the cups <b>and</b> <b>balls</b> is considered by many as the litmus test of a good magician. Indeed the late magic authority John Mulholland wrote that no less a person than Harry Houdini had expressed the opinion that no one could be considered an accomplished magician until he had mastered the Cups <b>and</b> <b>Balls.</b> Professor Hoffman called the cups <b>and</b> <b>balls</b> [...] "the groundwork of all legerdemain".|$|R

5|$|Netball Australia {{also runs}} a {{modified}} game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds.

5|$|After Maryland {{suffered}} a fifth {{loss in the}} season closer against Boston College, it was very unlikely that the team's preferred postseason game, the Meineke Car Care Bowl, would extend an invitation. The game's selection committee in Charlotte, North Carolina was eager to secure nearby North Carolina (8–4). Meanwhile, the EagleBank Bowl, hosted by RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., {{not far from the}} Maryland campus, secured in-state rival Navy, but the game date conflicted with Maryland's final exams. Soon after Maryland's regular season finale, sportswriters and analysts speculated that the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, was the most likely postseason destination. Bowl officials there worked to secure a game of undefeated teams between the hometown team, Boise State, <b>and</b> <b>Ball</b> State of the Mid-American Conference. However, Ball State rejected the proposal to play at Boise State's homefield as unacceptable.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an industry that grew up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they were right to be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon <b>and</b> <b>Ball</b> public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E

5|$|During the 1946–47 Australian cricket season, all rounder Keith Miller {{represented}} Victoria and Australia. A 27-year-old right-handed batsman {{and fast}} bowler, Miller played in all five Tests against England, performing well with both bat <b>and</b> <b>ball.</b> He finished {{top of the}} Australian Test bowling averages, taking 16 wickets at 20.88, and was second in the batting averages, scoring 384 runs at 76.80. On his Ashes debut in the First Test in Brisbane, Miller scored 79 before taking match bowling figures of 9 wickets for 77 runs (9/77) in Australia's innings victory.

A middle-order batsman and right-arm opening bowler, Miller finished the Test series as Australia's joint leading wicket-taker, along with his new ball partner Ray Lindwall, as Australia won the series 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with both feet, despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy <b>and</b> <b>ball</b> delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable of playing in several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E
