2500|$|Then he adds, [...] "Like I said, when I said collaborative, on the {{new record}} we did this all four of us in a room. Like all four, we'll play a riff, I'll come in with the drums, <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know were jamming, and then {{it sounds like a}} verse, or a chorus or {{breakdown}} part. And then we'll stop. [...] "Alright, man, we got a great verse, let's try to get a chorus for it." [...] So, you know, that's how the process goes. So it is a full band collaboration, much more than ever." ...|$|E

"They'd jolt into action, and wiggle {{around and}} skid and spit and cough and prize 'emselves back again during our hours of bloody battle till I could have wept, Sir, at the {{spectacle}} of modern white men chained up to these old hand-power, back-number, flint-and-steel reaping machines. One of 'em--I called her Baldy--she'd a long white scar all along her barrel-- I'd made sure of twenty times. I knew her crew by sight, but she'd come switching and teturing out of the dust of my shells like--like a hen from under a buggy--and she'd dip into a gully, <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> I'd know 'ud be her old nose peeking over the ridge sniffin' for us. Her runnin' mate had two grey mules in the lead, and a natural wood wheel repainted, and a whole raft of rope-ends trailin' around. 'Jever see Tom Reed with his vest off, steerin' Congress through a heat-wave? I've been to Washington often --too often--filin' my patents. I called her Tom Reed. We three 'ud play pussy-wants-a-corner all round the outposts on off-days--cross-lots through the sage and along the mezas till we was short-circuited by canons. O, it was great for me and Baldy and Tom Reed! I don't know as we didn't neglect the legitimate interests of our respective commanders sometimes for this ball-play. I know I did.|$|E

6000|$|... "She and her Ma's always quarrellin'," [...] said Mr. Lightfoot. [...] "Bonner is {{more than}} a match for the old lady, and treats Sir Francis like that--like this year spill, which I fling into the grate. But she daren't say a word to Miss Amory. No more dare none of us. When a visitor comes in, she smiles and languishes, you'd think that butter wouldn't melt in her mouth: and the minute he is gone, very likely, she flares up like a little demon, and says things fit to send you wild. If Mr. Arthur comes, it's 'Do let's sing that there {{delightful}} Song!' or, 'Come and write me them pooty verses in this halbum!' and very likely she's been a-rilin' her mother, or sticking pins into her maid, a minute before. She do stick pins into her and pinch her. Mary Hann showed me one of her arms quite black and blue; and I recklect Mrs. Bonner, who's as jealous of me as a old cat, boxed her ears for showing me. And then you should see Miss at luncheon, when there's nobody but the family! She makes b'leave she never heats, and my! you should only jest see her. She has Mary Hann to bring her up plum-cakes and creams into her bedroom; and the cook's the only man in the house she's civil to. Bonner says, how, the second season in London, Mr. Soppington was a-goin' to propose for her, and actially came one day, and sor her fling a book into the fire, and scold her mother so, that he went down softly by the back droring-room door, which he came in by; <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> we heard of him was, he was married to Miss Rider. Oh, she's a devil, that little Blanche, and that's my candig apinium, Mr. Morgan." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{takes some}} doing, but {{everything}} finally works out. Ray finds {{a job for}} Anton that involves him traveling to Bombay {{for a long period}} of time.

50|$|The show's so-so in Boston {{and a few}} of them panic, but Russ insists it'll be a hit on Broadway and, sure enough, he's right.

5000|$|After {{releasing}} two hip-hop mixtapes, Solomon {{began working}} on the third mixtape. During the creation he began instead playing with more pop sounds.

5000|$|Prine {{would later}} {{say that the}} album title, which People joked in its review was [...] "probably the worst album title in pop music history," [...] was not a throwback to his own army service but rather came from a friend: [...] "I had this guy explain to me once that a German {{afternoon}} is like you go into town with some errands to run and stuff to do but then you run into an old buddy you haven't seen.

60|$|<b>And</b> the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> Aaron was {{conscious}} of {{was the sound of}} trumpets.

After she became engaged, Harth alleges, Trump began to stalk her.|$|E
