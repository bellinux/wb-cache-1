5|$|Benchley {{returned}} to the cinema in 1937, cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938, and in his largest role to that point, the critically panned Live, Love and Learn. A short that Benchley completed for MGM, A Night <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Movies,</b> was Benchley's greatest success since How to Sleep, and won him a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while How to Sleep needed two days, the later short How to Vote needed less than twelve hours), and took their toll on Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one day (one of which was The Courtship of the Newt), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.|$|E

Hollis and Larey then headed to the lovers' lane just off of Richmond, where the attack occurred. She was beaten and sexually assaulted with the perpetrator's pistol. She suffered a head wound which was stitched up at the hospital. Afterwards, she had nightly nightmares about her attacker.

25|$|Then, a {{rainstorm}} strikes the city, threatening {{to cancel the}} game for which Juror 7 has tickets. Juror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies,</b> {{because he could not}} recall it in much detail. Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous days, which he does, with difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the boy, who was more than half a foot shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound found in the body. Next, Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see whether a shorter person could stab downwards on a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility, but Juror 5 steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade; revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who was taller than they, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time-consuming.|$|E
