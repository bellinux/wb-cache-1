5|$|The testimonies of explorers {{and colonial}} administrators {{demonstrate}} that Carabane {{has participated in}} rice cultivation, fishery, trade, <b>and</b> <b>palm</b> wine production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role {{in the lives of}} the population. Palm oil <b>and</b> <b>palm</b> wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate.

5|$|Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, Florida, is the city's main {{airport and}} is the {{fastest-growing}} major airport in the country. This is, in part, attributable to service by low-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America, resulting in lower airfares than nearby Miami International Airport.

40|$|Abstract—In {{the field}} of concepts, the measure of Wu <b>and</b> <b>Palmer</b> [1] has the {{advantage}} of being simple to implement and have good performances compared to the other similarity measures [2]. Nevertheless, the Wu <b>and</b> <b>Palmer</b> measure present the following disadvantage: in some situations, the similarity of two elements of an IS-A ontology contained in the neighborhood exceeds the similarity value of two elements contained in the same hierarchy. This situation is inadequate within the information retrieval framework. To overcome this problem, we propose a new similarity measure based on the Wu <b>and</b> <b>Palmer</b> measure. Our objective is to obtain realistic results for concepts not located in the same way. The obtained results show that compared to the Wu <b>and</b> <b>Palmer</b> approach, our measure presents a profit in terms of relevance and execution time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract––Building the {{ontology}} {{from the}} scratch {{is a difficult}} process {{and there is no}} proper fully automated ontology construction methodology is available. But more and more ontologies are created and available in the web, reusing the existing ontology is reasonable for the ontology developers. Ontology reuse is one of the research issue which leads to ontology mapping, ontology merging and ontology integration. Ontology mapping process required to find the semantic similarity between the terms. Semantic similarity can be identified by calculating lexical similarity and conceptual similarity. Wu <b>and</b> <b>Palmer</b> developed a simple and good performance algorithm compared to other similarity measure measures. In this paper, a modified algorithm of Wu <b>and</b> <b>Palmer</b> is discussed <b>and</b> the results are compared with Wu <b>and</b> <b>Palmer</b> algorithm. Keywords––Semantic web, ontology reuse, semantic similarity, Wu <b>and</b> <b>Palmer</b> algorithm...|$|R
