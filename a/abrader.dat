40|$|Abstract. Enamel abraders used in {{two-body}} wear tests {{suffer the}} disadvantage that standardization is {{difficult or impossible}} to obtain. The {{aim of this study}} was to test whether steatite (a ceramic material with a Vickers Hardness similar to that of enamel) could be used as a satisfactory human enamel analogue. The friction and wear characteristics of 'spherical ' abraders made from these two materials against composite and amalgam specimens were therefore compared. A two-body wear test for restorative materials was devised which could be carried out in a Universal Testing Machine and which allowed for continuous monitoring of the frictional forces during wear. The results showed that steatite and enamel abraders produced similar coefficients of friction (correlation coefficient, r = 0. 98). A linear relationship was found between depth (and volume) of wear and number of cycles (r = 0. 98 to 0. 99). Wear rate was not affected by the increase in <b>abrader</b> facet area. The wear rate against the steatite <b>abrader</b> was slightly greater than that against enamel, but the two abraders were reasonably correlated (r = 0. 94). Friction and wear were correlated for the steatite <b>abrader</b> (P < 0. 05, r = 0. 88) but not the enamel <b>abrader.</b> The hybrid composites had a high wear rate and wore both the abraders more than did the microfilled composites or amalgam. These findings suggest that steatite is a suitable substitute for enamel in this type of test...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the need}} to develop inexpen-sive {{technology}} to stabilize highly erodi-ble soils and arrest migrating sand dunes, this research was undertaken. Our objec-tive was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} adding clay to very sandy soil to reduce wind erosion susceptibility. The study was conducted in a laboratory wind tun-nel facility. In the first part of the study, various amounts of bentonite and kaoli-nite clay were added to a fine sand. The mixtures were wetted with simulated rain, and resulting aggregates were tested for mechanical stability. The aggregates’ resistance to crushing increased greatly with increasing clay content. Because the bentonite was several times more effec-tive than kaolinite, bentonite was used in the second part of the study. Trays were filled with various concentrations of bentonite-sand mixtures, wetted with simulated rain, dried, and tested in the wind tunnel with and without <b>abrader</b> at a free stream wind speed of 14 m s-’.

A calibrated sandblasting device was used to abrade individual aggregates with weighed amounts of <b>abrader</b> in an enclosed chamber and the weight of soil abraded from the aggregates was determined. Regression equations relating aggregate abrasion to the experimental variables were then developed. Sand <b>abrader</b> produced higher values of W than soil <b>abrader.</b> W also increased as a power of particle velocity. The power was near 2. 0 for fragile aggregates and ranged from 1. 5 to 2. 3 for the most stable aggregates tested. The W of all aggregates decreased nonlinearly as aggregate stability increased.

40|$|Dry playa lake beds can be {{significant}} sources of fine dustemission. This study used a portable field wind tunnel {{to quantify the}} PM 10 emissions from a bare, fine-textured playa surface located in the far northern Chihuahua Desert. The natural, undisturbed crust and its subjection to two levels of animal disturbance (one and ten cow passes) were tested. The wind tunnel generated dustemissions under controlled conditions for firstly an initial blow-off of the surface, followed by two longer runs with sand added to the flow as an <b>abrader</b> material. Dust was measured using a GRIMM particle monitor. For the study playa, {{no significant differences in}} PM 10 concentration and emission flux were found between the untrampled surface and following a single animal pass. This was the case for both the initial blow-offs and tests on plots under a steady <b>abrader</b> rate. Significantly higher dust loading was only associated with the effect of 10 animal passes. In the blow-offs, the higher PM 10 yield after 10 passes reflected the greater availability of easily entrainable fine particles. Under abrasion, the effect of the heaviest trampling increased the emission flux by a third and abrasion efficiency by around 50 % more than values on the untrampled surface. This enhanced abrasion efficiency persisted for a 30 min period under abrasion before the positive effect of the disturbance was no longer evident. The findings highlight the role of a threshold of disturbance that determines if supply-limited surfaces will exhibit enhanced wind erosion or not after undergoing perturbation. No Full Tex...|$|E

50|$|Some ground {{stone tools}} are incidental, caused by use with other tools: manos, for example, are hand stones used in {{conjunction}} with metates and other grinding slabs (querns), and develop their ground surfaces through wear. Other ground stone tools include adzes, celts, and axes, which are manufactured using a labor-intensive, time-consuming method of repeated grinding against a harder stone or with sand, often using water as a lubricant. These tools are often made using durable finer-grained materials rather than coarse materials. In the North American arctic, tools made of ground slate were used by the Norton, Dorset, and Thule tool cultures, among others. Common forms of these tools were projectile points and ulus.

40|$|International audienceFound {{sporadically}} in late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic contexts, grooved <b>abraders</b> {{are among}} the most common tools found in Linear Pottery and Villeneuve-Saint-Germain settlements in north-western Europe (5, 100 - 4, 700 BCE). This paper presents an overview of the technical and functional characteristics of these tools in early Neolithic domestic contexts. Despite different blank morphologies and sizes, these tools tend to be relatively small in size and are generally not shaped. They are characterized by the use of a very specific raw material: low cohesive and generally ferruginous sandstones, chosen because their abrasiveness is enhanced through use. A classification of the different types of grooves is proposed, based on their shape, depth, section and localization. These characteristics are combined with use-wear analysis in order to propose a number of functional interpretations. Far from the widespread hypothesis that these tools functioned as shaft straighteners, we argue {{on the basis of the}} use-wear analysis and archaeological associations of items that these tools were primarily involved in the manufacture of bone and lithic tools, as well as of schist and limestone personal ornaments. They are evidence of the generalization and diversification of polishing and abrading techniques in the technical system of the first Neolithic populations.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{operation of}} long-life, highly loaded mechanisms used for planetary exploration or autonomous structures assembly {{will depend upon}} the ability to effectively lubricate rolling-element bearings. As new tools are developed (i. e., drill, <b>abraders,</b> robotic manipulators, etc.) that interact with their environment in a more direct manner, lubricants will be pushed past the bounds that current scientific literature has published. This paper details results from bearing lubrication lifetime testing performed in support of Honeybee Robotics development of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Surface Removal Tool (SRT). This testing was done {{due to the lack}} of available data in research literature that is applicable to the lubrication regime the SRT bearings are being designed for. Based on the test results, the chosen bearing arrangement can be used for the SRT Grind Shaft bearings with the use of a Braycote Micronic 601 EF grease-plate with a 10 vol% grease slurry fill (50 / 50 wt% Braycote Micronic 601 EF and Brayco 815 Z). This arrangement showed no signs of detrimental degradation over the course of the 3 x life test. The purely grease-plated bearing ran at a consistently higher torque and showed signs of failure beginning at approximately 2. 2 x 10 (exp 7) revs (approximately 6. 3 x 10 (exp 7) stress-cycles) with a torque over-limit failure at approximately 4. 5 x 10 (exp 7) revs (approximately 1. 3 x 10 (exp 8) stress-cycles). Barring cold-start torque margin limitations, it is recommended that any long-life bearing application include some vol% grease-pack in addition to a standard grease-plate to reduce parasitic torque and increase bearing life. While these results are specific to a particular environment and loading condition, they demonstrate the extended capabilities of a commonly used flight lubricant outside of the range that is published in current research literature...|$|R
40|$|Chitons are marine mollusks found {{worldwide}} in the intertidal or subtidal zones {{of cold water}} {{as well as in}} tropical waters. These organisms have evolved an amazing feeding structure called a radula. The radula is a ribbon-like structure that consists of abrasion resistant teeth anchored to a flexible stylus that the organism uses to abrade rocky substrates to reach endolithic and epilithic algae. In this work, we investigated the radula in Cryptochiton stelleri, the largest of the chitons. Using various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, an ultrastructural analysis and investigation of mechanical properties of fully mineralized radular teeth from C. stelleri, as well as the mineralization process of these teeth, has been performed to gain insights into structure-function relationships of the abrasion resistant, impact tolerant, and anti-fatigue composites synthesized by nature. Shape, wear patterns, and feeding positions of the teeth have been analyzed to provide teeth working conditions {{that can be used in}} finite element analysis modeling of the tooth, which helps to provide a foundation to produce abrasion-resistant, impact-tolerant and anti-fatigue materials. An overall analysis of mature radular teeth using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Raman Spectroscopy revealed a magnetite containing hard shell with an iron phosphate containing soft core. &# 945;-chitin was also identified in mature teeth with powder XRD. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis uncovered the higher carbon concentration at the core region than at the shell. Hardness and modulus gradients from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the teeth, which contributes to a self-sharpening mechanism, were revealed by nanoindentation. The mechanical measurements revealed the teeth had the highest hardness (12. 5 GPa) and modulus (125 GPa) of any biomineral reported to date. Phase transformation and structural development during the biomineralization process of the radular teeth were analyzed with EDS, synchrotron XRD, Micro- X-ray Fluorescence (µXRF), SEM and TEM. The phase transformation from ferrihydrite to magnetite, which occurred at the tip of the leading edge, along with aggregation of mineral particles and shrinkage of organic fibers were discovered. Regional micro- and nanostructures as well as the mechanical properties of the mature teeth were characterized via SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces, TEM and nanoindentation. Nanorods structures were found at the trailing edges and the surfaces of the leading edges of teeth. The middle of the leading edge of the tooth is made of close-packed particles and exhibited the highest hardness and modulus. The rods at the trailing edge were orientated along the surface curvature of the trailing edge, while the rods at the surface of the leading edge were rotated 90 °. The diameters of the rods at the trailing edge were larger than those at the leading edge. Tooth performance was simulated with FEM analysis on a radular tooth model obtained from confocal microscopy imaging. Tensile stresses were concentrated at the leading edge, while the compressive stresses were concentrated at the trailing edge. Both of the stress directions are guided along the surface curvature, following the major orientation of the rods. The combination of regional ultrastructural features of these teeth, consisting of the highest hardness and modulus mineral known in Nature, enables the radular teeth to be optimized <b>abraders</b> during the feeding process...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 18 th century, Anglo Americans and Europeans {{entered the}} mouth of the Columbia River for the first time. There they {{encountered}} large villages of Chinookan and other Native Americans. Soon afterwards, the Chinookan People became involved in the global fur trade. Pelts, supplies, and native made goods were exchanged with fur traders, who in return provided Chinookans with a number of trade goods. Over the next 40 years, life changed greatly for the Chinookans; new trade and political alliances were created, foreign goods were introduced, and diseases killed large portions of the population (Hajda 1984; Gibson 1992; Schwantes 1996; Boyd 2011; Boyd et al. 2013). Additionally, fur trade forts, like the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s Bay Company 2 ̆ 7 s (HBC) Fort Vancouver, were established. At these forts, new multiethnic communities were created to support the fur trade economy (Hussey 1957; Kardas 1971; Warner and Munnik 1972; Erigero 1992; Burley 1997; Mackie 1997; Wilson 2010). This thesis is an historical archaeological study of how Chinookan peoples at three villages and employees of the later multicultural Village at Fort Vancouver negotiated the processes of contact and colonization. Placed in the theoretical framework of practice theory, everyday ordinary activities are studied to understand how cultural identities are created, reinforced, and changed (Lightfoot et al. 1998; Martindale 2009; Voss 2008). Additionally uneven power relationships are examined, in this case between the colonizer and the colonized, which could lead to subjugation but also resistance (Silliman 2001). In order to investigate these issues, this thesis studies how the new foreign material of vessel glass was and was not used during the everyday practice of tool production. Archaeological studies have found that vessel glass, which has physical properties similar to obsidian, was used to create a variety of tool forms by cultures worldwide (Conte and Romero 2008). Modified glass studies (Harrison 2003; Martindale and Jurakic 2006) have demonstrated that they can contribute important new insights into how cultures negotiated colonization. In this study, modified glass tools from three contact period Chinookan sites: Cathlapotle, Meier, and Middle Village, and the later multiethnic Employee Village of Fort Vancouver were examined. Glass tool and debitage analysis based on lithic macroscopic analytical techniques was used to determine manufacturing techniques, tool types, and functions. Additionally, these data were compared to previous analyses of lithics and trade goods at the study sites. This thesis demonstrates that Chinookans modified glass into tools, though there was variation in the degree to which glass was modified and the types of tools that were produced between sites. Some of these differences are probably related to availability, how glass was conceptualized by Native Peoples, or other unidentified causes. This study suggests that in some ways glass was just another raw material, similar to stone, that was used to create tools that mirrored the existing lithic technology. However at Cathlapotle at least, glass appears to have been relatively scarce and perhaps valued even as a status item. While at Middle Village, glass (as opposed to stone) was being used {{about a third of the}} time to produce tools. Glass tool technology at Cathlapotle, Meier, and Middle Village was very similar to the existing stone tool technology dominated by expedient/low energy tools; however, novel new bottle <b>abraders</b> do appear at Middle Village. This multifaceted response reflects how some traditional lifeways continued, while at the same time new materials and technology was recontextualized in ways that made sense to Chinookan peoples. Glass tools increase at the Fort Vancouver Employee Village rather than decrease through time. This response appears to be a type of resistance to the HBC 2 ̆ 7 s economic hegemony and rigid social structure. Though it is impossible to know if such resistance was consciously acted on or was just part of everyday activities that made sense in the economic climate of the time. Overall, this thesis demonstrates how a mundane object such as vessel glass, can provide a wealth of information about how groups like the Chinookans dealt with a changing world, and how the multiethnic community at Fort Vancouver dealt with the hegemony of the HBC. Chinookan peoples and the later inhabitants of the Fort Vancouver Employee Village responded to colonization in ways that made sense to their larger cultural system. These responses led to both continuity and change across time...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} tread wear {{particles}} are investigated: tread wear particles from a steel brush <b>abrader</b> (TrBP) and particles produced during a steering pad run (TrSP). A leaching experiment in water at pH = 7. 5 for 24 and 48 h {{was carried out}} on TrBP to simulate environmental degradation. Images of all materials were collected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) together with element microanalytical (EDX) data. Surface morphology is described by a function of wave number (the “enhanced spectrum”) obtained from SEM image analysis and non-linear filtering. A surface roughness index, ρ, {{is derived from the}} enhanced spectrum. The innovative contribution of this work is the representation of morphology by means of ρ, which, together with EDX data, allows the quantitative characterization of the materials. In particular, the surface roughness of leached TrBP is shown to decay in time and is related to the corresponding microanalytical data for the first time. The morphology of steering pad TrSP, affected by included mineral particles, is shown to be more heterogeneous. Differences in morphology (enhanced spectra and ρ), elemental composition and surface chemistry of TrBP and TrSP are discussed. All methods described and implemented herewith can be immediately applied to other types of tread wear material. The arguments put forward herewith should help in the proper design of those experiments aimed at assessing the impact of tread wear materials on the environment and on human health...|$|E
40|$|Background: Vitiligo is an {{autoimmune}} pigmentory disorder, {{that affects}} all age {{group that is}} treated by many medical treatments {{but some of them}} might need surgical therapy. Objective: To evaluate the dermabrasion technique in the treatment of vitiligo by direct transfer of melanocytes from the dermabraded normal donor area to the vitiliginous re-cipient area. Patients and Methods: This is a case interventional study was done in Department of Dermatol-ogy/Baghdad Teaching Hospital from February 2011 -March 2012. Nine Patients with vitiligo were enrolled in this study with different clinical types of vitiligo including 5 segmental, 2 generalized and 2 localized. The donor and re-cipient areas were anesthetized at the same time with xylocain alone. Dermabrasion of recipient area was done first by manual <b>abrader</b> and left for few minutes until the oozing was stopped. Then the donor area was similarly dermabraded and the dermabraded tissue including the epidermis and superficial epidermis was immediately transferred into the re-cipient area and dressing was applied. Removal of the dressing was done after 10 - 14 days from the operative time. Follow up was done every 2 weeks in the first month then monthly for six months to record the result of implantation and repigmentation. Results: The re-pigmentation started one month after the operation as small macules and this in-creased gradually over time: the mean rate of re-pigmentation was 13 % at 2 months, 27. 8 % at 4 months and 36. 78 % at 6 months. In addition, sun light exposure was applied to enhance re-pigmentation. The pigmentation was diffuse an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: polyacrylate/nano-silicon dioxide nanocomposites were {{fabricated}} {{through a}} simple mixing process for resisting scratch and wear as coating. Chemical compatibility between polyacrylate matrix and nano-silicon dioxide (nano-SiO 2) {{was achieved by}} functionalized nano-SiO 2 via three silane coupling agents. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was done to characterize surface and wear morphology of the nanocomposites. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used for representing interfacial properties of the nanocomposites. A MM- 200 machine and a Norman Tool RCA <b>abrader</b> were performed for testing friction and wear properties. SEM showed that incorporation of the nano-SiO 2 functionalized with silane into the polyacrylate matrix showed a better dispersion than the composite without silane at low nanoparticle content (≤ 3 wt%). SEM also revealed that adhesive wear mechanism of the polyacrylate matrix was transited to dominated particle wear of the nanocomposites. An increase of glass transition temperature (Tg) was recorded via DSC at low nanoparticle content (1 wt%). Further addition of the nanoparticles to 3 wt % led to a 10 ˚C increase in Tg comparing to neat polyacrylate. Results of friction and wear properties exhibited that friction coefficient and wear loss of the nanocomposites with silane were {{lower than those of}} the neat polyacrylate. The wear loss of the neat polyacrylate, the nanocomposite containing 3 wt % nanoparticles with silane KH 570, and the nanocomposite with raw nano-particles were 108. 6, 65. 8, and 110. 5 mg, respectively. RCA results also showed a significant improvement of the nanocomposites {{in the presence of the}} nanoparticles with silane...|$|E

40|$|Wind erosion is {{a natural}} process that has formed landscapes but threatens {{sustainable}} agriculture in many locations. Wind tunnels {{have been used for}} several decades to study wind erosion processes. Portable wind tunnels offer the advantage of testing natural surfaces in the field, but they must be carefully designed to ensure that a logarithmic boundary layer is formed and that wind erosion processes may develop without interference from the tunnel structures. Although large portable tunnels often meet the aerodynamic criteria, their size and transportation requirements often limit the locations where they may be employed. We designed and built a self-contained portable wind tunnel that is easily transported on a tandem-axle trailer and pulled with a pickup truck. The wind tunnel uses a centrifugal blower, a flow-conditioning section with optional <b>abrader</b> material feed, and a 1 m tall and 0. 5 m wide working section that can vary in length from 2 m to 6 m. The maximum wind velocity attainable is 18. 7 m s- 1 although a mid-height centerline velocity of 12. 6 m s- 1 is normally used for field testing of natural surfaces. Based on measured wind velocity profiles in the tunnel working section, a conservative estimate of boundary layer depth within the working section is 0. 5 m. Even though no wind tunnel can truly duplicate the scale and variability of the forces that drive wind erosion, tunnels such as this one with deeply developed boundary layers offer reasonable estimates of dust emissions and erodibilities of natural surfaces. This wind tunnel has been used to test rangeland and cropped surfaces in several locations and has provided reliable and useable soil erodibility and dust emission data. Full Tex...|$|E

This {{study was conducted}} to determine dust emission potential of soils due to wind erosion as affected by off-road military vehicle disturbance. Multi-pass traffic experiments using two types of vehicles (i. e., wheeled and tracked) were conducted on six soil textures at four military training facilities: Fort Riley, KS; Fort Benning, GA; Yakima Training Center, WA; and White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NM. Prior to and after the preselected number of vehicle passes, soil samples at three locations were collected with minimum disturbance into trays. Adjacent to the location where tray samples were collected, a Portable In-Situ Wind Erosion Lab (PI-SWERL) was used to measure dust emission potential. The tray samples were tested in a laboratory wind tunnel (with sand <b>abrader)</b> for dust emission potential using a GRIMM aerosol spectrometer and gravimetric method with filters. Comparison of the PI-SWERL (with DustTrak™ dust monitor) and wind tunnel (with GRIMM aerosol spectrometer) measurement results showed significant difference in measured values but high correlation, particularly for soils with high sand content. Wind tunnel tests results showed that sampling locations significantly affected dust emissions for the tracked vehicles but not for the light-wheeled and heavy-wheeled vehicles. Also, soil texture, number of vehicle passes, and vehicle type significantly affected dust emissions. For the light-wheeled vehicles, dust emissions increased as the number of vehicle passes increased. From undisturbed conditions to 10 vehicle passes, there was a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in dust emissions (297 %) on average for all light-wheeled vehicle tests. From 10 to 25 passes and 25 to 50 passes, an additional 52 % and 62 % increments were observed. For the tracked vehicle, for the straight section sampling location, dust emission increased as the number of vehicle passes increased. However, for the curve section, dust emissions at any level of pass were significantly higher than initial condition; beyond the first pass, no significant increase was observed...|$|E
