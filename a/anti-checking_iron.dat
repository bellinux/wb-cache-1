40|$|The {{remaining}} {{the logs}} in the stump area and especially along the forest roadside, {{can increase the}} check in the caused by growth stress in the both sides of log. All of these factors led {{to a decline in}} the quality of the logs, which can be lined up in the ends of log with suitable coating materials such as end coating and <b>anti-checking</b> <b>iron</b> treatments to prevent log checking. A field-based study was performed to study the effects of end coating and <b>anti-checking</b> <b>iron</b> treatments on prevent log checking in beech and hornbeam logs in Gorazbon district in Kheyrud forest northern Iran. In this study, 180 logs were randomly selected from two spices; beech and hornbeam and for any spices, 30 logs were selected for <b>anti-checking</b> <b>iron</b> treatments, 30 logs for paraffin treatments and 30 logs for control. Duncan’s test showed that in the hornbeam logs <b>anti-checking</b> <b>iron</b> treatments was the lowest checking increase comparing the paraffin and control treatments and this difference was statistically significant. Duncan’s test showed that in the beech logs <b>anti-checking</b> <b>iron</b> treatments was the lowest checking increase comparing the paraffin and control treatments. It can be concluded that the lowest check has been shown in the <b>anti-checking</b> <b>iron</b> treatments in two beech and hornbeam logs and this treatment has the greatest role in preventing ends check in compare with the paraffin treatment...|$|E
