5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E
