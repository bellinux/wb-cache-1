5|$|In 1918, Jinnah {{married his}} second wife Rattanbai Petit ("Ruttie"), 24 years his junior. She was the fashionable young {{daughter}} of his friend Sir Dinshaw Petit, and {{was part of an}} elite Parsi family of Bombay. There was great opposition to the marriage from Rattanbai's family and the Parsi community, as well as from some Muslim religious leaders. Rattanbai defied her family and nominally converted to Islam, adopting (though never using) the name Maryam Jinnah, resulting in a permanent estrangement from her family and Parsi society. The couple resided at South Court Mansion in Bombay, and frequently travelled across India and Europe. The couple's only child, daughter Dina, was born on 15 August 1919. The couple separated prior to Ruttie's death in 1929, and subsequently Jinnah's sister Fatima looked <b>after</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his child.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named <b>after</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|In November 1901 the fedayi {{clashed with}} the Ottoman troops in what later {{became known as the}} Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery. One of the best-known episodes of Andranik's revolutionary activities, it was an attempt by the Ottoman {{government}} to suppress his activities. Since Andranik had gained more influence over the region, more than 5,000 Turkish soldiers were sent <b>after</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his band. The Turks chased and eventually circled him and his men, numbering around 50, at the Arakelots (Holy Apostles) Monastery in early November. A regiment under the command of Ferikh Pasha and Ali Pasha besieged the fort-like monastery. The Turkish generals leading the army of twelve hundred men asked the fedayi to negotiate their surrender.|$|E

In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.|$|E

Michael thanks Locke for hunting the boar and then asks Locke about the Monster, but Locke says that he did not see anything.
