5|$|In January 2009, Goldust {{participated in}} the annual Royal Rumble match <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> Cody who {{ultimately}} eliminated him. Goldust married WWE Diva Aksana on 2 November 2010 on NXT, with Dusty and Cody in attendance. In 2013, Goldust was a surprise entrant for the Royal Rumble match on January 26 and was once again eliminated by his half-brother. Although he hinted at a possible feud with Cody, he later confirmed {{in an interview that}} his return was a one night only deal.|$|E
2500|$|At the Royal Rumble, The Undertaker {{competed in}} the Royal Rumble match, but Roman Reigns entered the match at number thirty and {{eliminated}} Undertaker. In the ensuing stare down, Reigns exclaimed: [...] "This is my yard now!", a claim Undertaker had made for many years. On the March 6 episode of Raw, Braun Strowman, who had lost to Reigns at Fastlane, called out Reigns, but instead, The Undertaker appeared <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> Strowman until Strowman left the ring. Reigns then came out and reiterated that WWE was his yard now. After a stare down, The Undertaker attacked Reigns with a chokeslam. A match between the two at WrestleMania 33 was confirmed the following week. Later on Raw, The Undertaker's gong sounded during Reigns' match against Jinder Mahal; Reigns was distracted, but nevertheless defeated Mahal. When Reigns called out The Undertaker after the match, Shawn Michaels came out instead to give Reigns advice about The Undertaker. Reigns said that he appreciated the advice, but {{said that he would}} retire The Undertaker just as Undertaker had retired Michaels at WrestleMania XXVI. The following week, during Reigns' rematch with Strowman, The Undertaker attacked Strowman with a chokeslam, but was surprised by Reigns with a spear. When Reigns had left, Undertaker sat up and taunted Reigns with his throat slash gesture. On the final Raw before WrestleMania, The Undertaker stated that the graveyard would be Reigns' yard after WrestleMania.|$|E

5000|$|Wachter often {{stands in}} a [...] "pigeon-toed" [...] stance (both feet turned in toward each other) when he plays his bass, <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> at his feet. He says doing this allows him {{to focus on what}} he's playing and keeps him from being distracted by fans.|$|R

25|$|For Neff's {{office at}} Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set {{designer}} Hal Pereira conspired {{to create a}} little in-house joke, typical of Billy Wilder. In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles off the elevator {{on his way to}} his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking rows and rows of uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.|$|R
60|$|And Ratcliffe {{sat down}} comfortably {{in the car}} and lit a cigarette, but the others rose excitedly <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> the road.

60|$|Then Dick ground {{his heels}} into the turf and laid his weight against the bow. While all men watched breathless, he drew {{it to an}} arc, he drew it till the string was level with his ear.

60|$|So she ended, and {{listening}} to her, I felt the tears rising in my eyes, {{because she was so}} much alone, and I feared that this god of hers would never come to save her from the torments of the priests.

5000|$|Nidever {{dictated}} {{his memoir}} to Edward F. Murray in 1878, The Life and Adventures of George Nidever, {{towards the end}} of his life. His story was popular; an episode in which he killed one grizzly bear with a single shot <b>and</b> then <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> another became the subject of a ballad. The ballad so impressed Ralph Waldo Emerson that he supplemented his essay [...] "Courage" [...] from his Society and Solitude with a transcription of its lyrics. Nidever died in 1883 and was buried at Calvary Catholic Cemetery Santa Barbara.|$|R
60|$|As for Stephen, {{he stood}} high in his {{stirrups}} <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at the girl. She was standing {{full in the}} light,--her lashes fallen, her face crimson.

60|$|Keith stepped quickly forward, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> {{into his}} brother's face; and {{instantly}} {{he saw that}} it was true. No one could have simulated the look in those eyes--of horrified wonder, as if they would never again get on terms with the face to which they belonged. To see them squeezed the heart-only real misery could look like that. Then that sudden pity became angry bewilderment.|$|E

500|$|San Francisco author Armistead Maupin {{was writing}} his {{installments}} of individual stories {{in a column}} for the San Francisco Chronicle titled Tales of the City in 1977.

On the chancel arch above the altar are inscribed the opening words of the Polish hymn Bogurodzica which Adalbert himself {{is said to have}} composed. And in an F. X. Zettler window to the west, Adalbert again, in green vestments, stands preaching to the surly, slumped Prussian, an unwilling listener whose response would be to martyr Adalbert. Legend says that the King of Poland Bolesław I ransomed back Adalbert's body by paying its weight in gold.|$|R
