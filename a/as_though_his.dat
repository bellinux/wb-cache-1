5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E
25|$|The Tainted – Where {{the other}} Nazgûl were slowly {{swallowed}} by the taint of their rings, the Tainted gave himself wholly and willingly to Sauron. Now all natural things rebel in his presence, vegetation withers, animals sicken and bold warriors cower. He is an abomination whose merest presence is poison to life, honour and hope. The Tainted {{is one of the}} Nazgûl, representing their withering, abhorrent nature. His mounted model is built to look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> horse were sickened and dying by merely being near him.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} the Stanford Law School, Thiel had {{interviews}} with Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. After not being hired, he instead took up a post as a judicial clerk for Judge James Larry Edmondson of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, but soon moved to New York {{to work as a}} securities lawyer for Sullivan & Cromwell. After seven months and three days, he left the law firm citing a lack of transcendental value in his work. He then {{took a job as a}} derivatives trader in currency options at Credit Suisse, working there from 1993 on while also operating as a speechwriter for former-United States Secretary of Education William Bennett, before again feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> work lacked meaningful value and returning to California in 1996.|$|E

500|$|Soeman {{was born}} in Bengkalis, Riau, Dutch East Indies, in 1904. His father, Wahid Hasibuan, and mother, Turumun Lubis, {{had been born in}} [...] (in what is now Mandailing Natal), but moved to Bengkalis after {{marriage}} to avoid conflict between the Hasibuans and a rival clan. In a 1989 interview, Soeman stated that he was not sure of the conflict's source, but he suspected that his father, who was descended from a Mandailing king, felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> honour had been impugned.|$|E
500|$|The novel ends {{abruptly}} {{with the}} sudden {{appearance of a}} bizarre enshrouded figure having skin hued [...] "of the perfect whiteness of the snow." [...] Many readers were left unsatisfied by this ending because, as Poe relative and scholar Harry Lee Poe wrote, [...] "it didn't match the kind of clear ending they expected from a novel." [...] Poe may have purposely left the ending subject to speculation. Some scholars {{have suggested that the}} ending serves as a symbolic conclusion to Pym's spiritual journey and others suggest that Pym has actually died in this scene, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> tale is somehow being told posthumously. Alternatively, Pym may die in the retelling of the story at precisely the same point he should have died during the actual adventure. Like other characters in works by Poe, Pym seems to submit willingly to this fate, whatever it is. Kenneth Silverman notes that the figure radiates ambivalence and it is not clear if it is a symbol of destruction or of protection.|$|E
500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket became Blink-182's first {{number one}} album in the United States upon its June 2001 release; it also hit the top {{position}} in Canada and Germany. Hit singles [...] "The Rock Show" [...] and [...] "First Date" [...] continued the band's mainstream success worldwide, with MTV cementing their image as video stars. However, guitarist Tom DeLonge felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> creativity was stifled by label limitations, and sessions became contentious among the trio. They rescheduled European tour dates {{in the aftermath}} of the September 11 attacks, and they were called off a second time after DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. With time off from touring, DeLonge felt an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was," [...] and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration. Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Blink drummer Travis Barker to record drums on the project.|$|E

500|$|The trio {{embarked}} on a European tour the following fall, during which DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life. [...] "It became [...] we weren't a band, it wasn't {{the three of us}} working together for a goal," [...] said Hoppus, [...] "it was like me and Travis having to pull his along, and be like, 'Come on, let's go, let's do this that we all created and that we love.'" [...] DeLonge eventually expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring in order {{to spend more time with}} family. Hoppus and Barker were dismayed by his decision, which they felt was an overly long break. In addition, DeLonge was not fond of Barker's new reality television series, Meet the Barkers; he disliked television cameras everywhere, feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> personal privacy was invaded. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, DeLonge agreed to perform at Music for Relief's Concert for South Asia, a benefit show to aid victims. Further arguments ensued during rehearsals, rooted in the band member's increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another. DeLonge asserted he would only record another album at his home in San Diego, suggesting he mail Pro Tools files back and forth to Hoppus and Barker in Los Angeles. The duo were flexible regarding DeLonge's time off, but became angry when he began deciding [...] "when we can and can't tour, when and how we can record." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale of the New York Times was {{critical}} of the episode, discussing the show's [...] "increasingly rapid march toward Hallmark country." [...] He commented that while [...] "Acafellas" [...] did not match the standard of the pilot episode, it was funnier than [...] "Showmance", and praised the return of Stephen Tobolowsky as Sandy Ryerson. Hale called Groban's cameo the [...] "most fun of all" [...] in the episode, but overall noted that: [...] "The humor can’t {{make up for the}} lack of big production numbers [...] The problem for this show {{is always going to be}} how to fill the gaps between songs. A lot of the current plot lines, like Will and his wife's phantom baby, are already getting old, so it would behoove the producers to keep those gaps as short as possible." [...] Rachel Ray, reviewing the episode for The Independent deemed Glee [...] "overhyped [...] uninspired, confusing and with a simple plot to boot." [...] Ray wrote, Glee [...] "upbeat message" [...] was [...] "overridden by the show's attempt to be darker than the run-of-the mill high school drama." [...] As with Hale, Ray commented that: [...] "Music should be the redeeming feature of Glee but it's not, because the viewer never gets a satisfying taste of the cast members' musical talents". Shawna Malcom criticized Terri and Will's characterization in the episode, deeming Terri [...] "beyond annoying", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Of Will, Malcom posed the question: [...] "didn’t it feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> commitment to the glee club melted away rather quickly? [...] How could he turn his back so easily?" [...] More positively, Malcom called Kurt's coming out scene [...] "lovely". She wrote that Groban's appearance was [...] "laugh out loud" [...] funny, while Stack commented: [...] "It was a little random, but it's all worth it for the scene when Groban was hitting on Will's mom." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barker {{was born}} in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, England.

[...] He also played for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and he represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players fixture. [...] He bowled at an extremely fast pace, using a roundarm action.

2500|$|Dimitri Tiomkin {{had written}} [...] "Death Telegram" [...] and [...] "Gower's Deliverance" [...] for the {{drugstore}} scenes, {{but in the}} editing room Capra elected to go with no music for those scenes. Those changes, along with others, led to a falling out between Tiomkin and Capra. Tiomkin had worked {{on a lot of}} Capra's previous films, and was saddened that Capra decided to have the music pared or toned down, moved, or cut entirely. He felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> work was being seen as a mere suggestion. In his autobiography Please Don't Hate Me, he said of the incident, [...] "an all around scissors job".|$|E
2500|$|Geisel's {{illustrations}} often convey motion vividly. He {{was fond}} of a sort of [...] "voilà" [...] gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread slightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in One Fish Two Fish when he creates fish (who perform the gesture themselves with their fins), in {{the introduction of the}} various acts of If I Ran the Circus, and in the introduction of the [...] "Little Cats" [...] in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back.

2500|$|Some {{people also}} have {{physical}} symptoms, such as sweating, pacing, and weight loss. In full-blown mania, often the manic person will feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> or her goal(s) trump all else, {{that there are}} no consequences or that negative consequences would be minimal, and that they need not exercise restraint in the pursuit of what they are after. Hypomania is different, as it may cause little or no impairment in function. [...] The hypomanic person's connection with the external world, and its standards of interaction, remain intact, although intensity of moods is heightened. But those who suffer from prolonged unresolved hypomania do run the risk of developing full mania, and indeed may cross that [...] "line" [...] without even realizing they have done so.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, Brummell's wealthy {{friends had}} {{a less than}} {{satisfactory}} influence on him; he began spending and gambling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> fortune were as ample as theirs. Such liberal outlay began to deplete his capital rapidly, and he found {{it increasingly difficult to}} maintain his lifestyle, although his prominent position in society still allowed him to float a line of credit. This changed in July 1813, at a masquerade ball jointly hosted at Watier's private club by Brummell, Lord Alvanley, Henry Mildmay and Henry Pierrepoint. The four were considered the prime movers of Watier's, dubbed [...] "the Dandy Club" [...] by Byron. The Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepoint at the event, and then [...] "cut" [...] Brummell and Mildmay by staring at their faces without speaking. This provoked Brummell's remark, [...] "Alvanley, who's your fat friend?".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1967 The Avengers episode [...] "The Superlative Seven" [...] John Steed {{is invited}} to a costume party aboard a {{chartered}} aeroplane. The aeroplane is being flown by remote control. Steed and the six other fancy-dressed guests, who are specialists in various combat styles, eventually land on a deserted island where they are informed {{that one of them}} is a trained assassin trying to kill them all. When the first murder is committed, Steed observes [...] "Looks <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> back was broken". To which an off-screen protagonist responds, over a speaker, [...] "Quite right, Mr Steed. And then there were six". [...] based an episode of the show's second season under the same name focusing on a gang of armed robbers stealing from casinos outside the Las Vegas metropolitan area with each criminal killing a member of the gang to keep more of the proceeds.

2500|$|For {{the third}} and final {{appearance}} on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of [...] "Hound Dog", [...] "Love Me Tender", and [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", followed by a full version of [...] "Don't Be Cruel". For a second set later in the show he did [...] "Too Much" [...] and [...] "When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again". For his last set he sang [...] "Peace in the Valley". According to Sullivan's co-producer Marlo Lewis, the rumor had it that [...] "Elvis has been hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>his</b> pecker reaches down to his knee!" [...] It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although {{much has been made of}} the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of [...] "Hound Dog", all of the songs on this show were ballads. [...] "Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows", Greil Marcus says, Elvis [...] "stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out. That he did so in front of the Jordanaires, who this night appeared as the four squarest-looking men on the planet, made the performance even more potent." ...|$|E
