25|$|The draw in Toronto {{extended}} the team's Eastern Conference lead to 11 points, though United had played more games {{than any other}} Eastern Conference team. The team also led the Supporters Shield race by 3 points, but the team below them in the table, Vancouver Whitecaps held 2 games in hand. United closed out June with another U.S. Open Cup match, at Philadelphia. The continued fixture congestion meant coach Olsen continued with his rotation <b>and</b> <b>trotted</b> out a nearly fully second choice lineup, with only one regular, defender Steve Birnbaum. Despite the disparity in lineup strength, United struck first. Shortly after Philadelphia Union striker C.J. Sapong was shown a red card, United exploited the man advantage with Arrieta scoring on a deflected cross from rookie Miguel Aguilar. Though they were down a man, the Union soon dominated much of the ensuing play, and won the game on two second half goals, eliminating D.C. from the 2015 Open Cup competition.|$|E
2500|$|Grouchy's dragoons {{broke down}} the town gate <b>and</b> <b>trotted</b> through Prenzlau {{and out the}} other side to view Hohenlohe's 10,000 troops drawn up on the road to Pasewalk. Murat sent Belliard to demand Hohenlohe's surrender, which the Prussian {{declined}} again. By this time some of Lannes' infantry were on the field. Together with Grouchy and Lasalle (but not Beaumont), there were only 4,000 to 5,000 French confronting the Prussians. At this time, Massenbach was allowed to return to the Prussian lines. Completely deceived by the French, Massenbach reported to Hohenlohe that their enemies were now between them and Stettin. Murat asked for a head-to-head parley with Hohenlohe which was granted. The marshal lied to Hohenlohe on his [...] "word of honor" [...] that he was surrounded by 100,000 French in the corps of Lannes, Soult, and Bernadotte.|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving in}} the Royal Navy, Guinness had planned to become an Anglican priest. In 1954, while he was filming Father Brown in Burgundy, Guinness, who was in costume as a Catholic priest, was mistaken for a real priest by a local child. Guinness was far from fluent in French, and the child {{apparently}} did not notice that Guinness did not understand him but {{took his hand and}} chattered while the two strolled; the child then waved <b>and</b> <b>trotted</b> off. The confidence and affection the clerical attire appeared to inspire in the boy left a deep impression on the actor. When their son was ill with polio at the age of 11, Guinness began visiting a church to pray. A few years later in 1956, Guinness converted to the Roman Catholic Church. His wife, who was of paternal Sephardi Jewish descent, followed suit in 1957 while he was in Sri Lanka filming The Bridge on the River Kwai, and she informed him only after the event. Every morning, Guinness recited a verse from Psalm 143, [...] "Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning".|$|E

2500|$|England needed 95 runs {{to win and}} [...] "an {{earthquake}} {{would not}} have shaken Hutton's determination not to be out when until victory was gained". he made 60 not out, his fifth innings over 50 and fourth unbeaten innings of the series and hit the winning runs. Washbrook (7) and Simpson (15) did not last the pace, but Denis Compton finally had some luck as he made 11 not out. Lindsay Hassett bowled the last over with the fielders crowded round the batsman, not {{in the hope of}} a catch, but so they could fight Don Tallon and the umpire for souvenir stumps and bails. They jumped the gun twice, once when Hassett bowled a rank full toss down the leg side, expecting Denis Compton to sweep it to the boundary, so did the umpire who called no ball and grabbed two stumps, Hassett the other and Tallon three, but the Compton missed, Tallon dropped his stumps as he jumped on the ball and they had to start again. The next ball was a single, then with one run to win Hutton amused himself by smothering a full toss amidst the chaos. Play was held up until Ian Johnson returned a bail he had hidden in his pocket. Finally, Compton pulled a stump out the ground and ran down the wicket as Hutton pushed the ball wide of square-leg <b>and</b> <b>trotted</b> over the crease to be congratulated by Hassett while Tallon fought off the close fielders for the stumps. The English batsmen were cheered off the pitch and they shouted for Brown to give them a speech, which he did, giving particular thanks to Len Hutton and Alec Bedser. The team repaired to their hotel for toasts of Champagne [...] "To England – and to Freddie Brown" [...] and to read the congratulatory telegrams that poured in from all over the world.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} relationship between evaluation of conformation and motion indicators and results of the Huculs’ path and also to ascertain the courage (basic and elimination) of Hucul horses with their classification into mare families being taken account of. The scores of 116 horses presented for the evaluation of their exterior (championship breeding) were analyzed. The assessment covered the type, body conformation, movement in walk <b>and</b> <b>trot</b> as well as overall impression and preparedness for the exhibition. Measurements of length of steps, frequency and rate of the walk <b>and</b> <b>trot</b> were performed during the tests for courage. The estimated correlation coefficients exhibited the existence of some interesting trends i. e., there was positive correlation between values for type, body conformation, movement in walk <b>and</b> <b>trot</b> <b>and</b> the length of steps in walk <b>and</b> <b>trot</b> in individuals representing most of mare families. The reverse was the case with horses from the Sroczka and Wyderka families. Amongst the Wrona, however, negative correlations between the grade for walk and frequency of steps in walk was observed while that of between the result of path and utility tests was positive...|$|R
