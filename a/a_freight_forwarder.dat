40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{implications}} of the urban context for the sustainability performance of intermodal road-rail transport (IRRT). By calculating the external costs of a road transport and an intermodal alternative of consolidated cargo between <b>a</b> <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder's</b> consolidation terminals, the paper shows that the environmental benefits of a modal shift depend on the relative location of the intermodal terminal and shipper and receiver in the spatial structure.

40|$|In {{containerised}} supply chains {{the market}} power {{has shifted from}} shippers being responsible for port choice to liner carriers and <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders.</b> If organised as merchant haulage {{on behalf of the}} shipper or consignee, the global sea <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> exerts the biggest influence. But next to choosing an exporting and/or importing port, other maritime supply chain choices are of importance and incorporate a variety of carrier and mode selection decisions. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to derive from case study results a new process-based approach to maritime supply chain choice modelling. The contribution refrains from empirically collecting port, liner carrier and mode choice criteria and their weightings from <b>a</b> <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder's</b> perspective. Instead, previous research findings are summarized and attention is drawn to insights into choice dependencies and potential coordination problems. Prior, modelled business processes serve as a basis for discussion with practitioners and are part of a linear but iterative case study research. Four global sea <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> agreed to participate in the study. As a result, practical insights lead to the introduction of the new process-based approach to maritime supply chain choice modelling which stimulates further research...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a multi-agent-based {{framework}} to facilitate process automation {{for the air}} cargo industry. The focus is on enhancing two labor-intensive flight planning processes, namely cargo consolidation and equalization. By employing a software agent-based flight planning module, which is linked with an RFID-based warehouse management system, air cargo items received at <b>a</b> <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder's</b> warehouse can be processed more efficiently and flight plans can be generated automatically. In particular, we employ agents equipped with simulated annealing optimization engines to handle the time-consuming tasks of optimization. By doing so, the latest flight plans can be generated more efficiently. The system has been evaluated experimentally by both simulated and real-life data. The results are encouraging. For example, operation steps that normally require over 30 minutes to complete can now be carried out in as quickly as two minutes, and produce a better solution. Department of Computin...|$|R

40|$|Cost {{effectiveness}} {{is central to}} the air <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders.</b> In this work, we study how <b>an</b> air <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> should plan its cargo loading in order to minimize the total <b>freight</b> cost given <b>a</b> limited number of rented containers. To solve the problem efficiently for practical implementation, we propose a new large-scale neighborhood search heuristic. The proposed large-scale neighborhood relaxes the subset-disjoint restriction made in the existing literature; the relaxation risks a possibility of infeasible exchanges {{while at the same time}} it avoids the potentially large amount of checking effort required to enforce the subset-disjoint restriction. An efficient procedure is then used to search for improvement in the neighborhood. We have also proposed a subproblem to address the difficulties caused by the fixed charges. The compromised large-scale neighborhood (CLSN) search heuristic has shown stably superior performance when compared with the traditional large-scale neighborhood search and the mixed integer programming model.

50|$|The {{transport}} boxes {{containing the}} locomotive were shipped by the barge van Hees (owned by its captain, van Hees) and pulled upriver by the steamboat Hercules on the Rhine until it reached Cologne. As the waterline in the Rhine was low, Captain van Hees {{had to use}} horses to pull the barge instead of the steamboat, as originally planned. On 7 October, the train of barges reached Cologne; the remaining distance to Nuremberg had to be covered by road because the Main was too shallow to be navigable by barge. The transport on land was disrupted by a strike of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> in Offenbach am Main, and <b>a</b> different <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> had to be ordered.

5000|$|A {{common carrier}} is {{distinguished}} from a contract carrier (also called a public carrier in UK English), {{which is a}} carrier that transports goods for only {{a certain number of}} clients and that can refuse to transport goods for anyone else, and from a private carrier. A common carrier holds itself out to provide service to the general public without discrimination (to {{meet the needs of the}} regulator's quasi judicial role of impartiality toward the public's interest) for the [...] "public convenience and necessity." [...] A common carrier must further demonstrate to the regulator that it is [...] "fit, willing, and able" [...] to provide those services for which it is granted authority. Common carriers typically transport persons or goods according to defined and published routes, time schedules, and rate tables upon the approval of regulators. Public airlines, railroads, bus lines, taxicab companies, phone companies, internet service providers, cruise ships, motor carriers (i.e., canal operating companies, trucking companies), and other freight companies generally operate as common carriers.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the {{liability}} of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> according to national and international law. The liability of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> is <b>an</b> extremely complex issue for theoretical examination.

Considering the fact that process of transformation of freight forwar-ders position imposed a new terminology determinant - logistic operators, in this paper we use the term <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders,</b> and emphasize that the subject of examination is conventional/classical <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders.</b> Theoretical examination of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> status is vital for clarification of many practical dilemmas and disputes in logistic sector.

The clarification of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> liability is closely related to the determination of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> position towards his principal and the third party in the obligation.
