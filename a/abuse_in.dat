5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E

5|$|Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, {{released}} on September 19, 1989, by A Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance <b>abuse,</b> <b>in</b> addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim.

5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq {{in order to better}} man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried that he was not recognisable enough {{at a time when he}} had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, the {{government}} made a Statement of Reconciliation– including an apology {{to those people}} who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schools– and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF). The Foundation was provided with $350million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical and sexual <b>abuse.</b> <b>In</b> its 2005 budget, the Canadian government committed an additional $40million to support the work of the AHF. Federal funding for the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget. The AHF closed in 2014. Former AHF executive director Mike DeGagne has said that the loss of AHF support has created a gap in dealing with mental health crises such as suicides in the Attawapiskat First Nation.|$|E
