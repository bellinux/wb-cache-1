5000|$|Jasmine rice ( [...] ; [...] ) is a long-grain {{variety of}} {{fragrant}} rice (also known as aromatic rice). Its fragrance, reminiscent of pandan (Pandanus amaryllifolius) and popcorn, {{results from the}} rice plant's natural production of aromatic compounds, of which 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline is the most salient. In typical packaging and storage, these aromatic compounds dissipate within a few months. This rapid loss of <b>aromatic</b> <b>intensity</b> leads many Southeast Asians and connoisseurs to prefer each year's freshly harvested [...] "new crop" [...] of jasmine rice.|$|E

40|$|Wines from Antão Vaz, Arinto, Fernão Pires, Verdelho da Madeira and Viosinho grape cultivars, from 2009 and 2010 vintages, {{were studied}} {{in order to}} {{characterize}} the volatile thiols profile, namely 4 -mercapto- 4 -methyl-pentan- 2 -one (4 MMP), 3 -mercaptohexan- 1 -ol (3 MH) and 3 -mercaptohexyl acetate (3 MHA). Volatile thiols profile of these wines was also compared to a Sauvignon blanc wine produced in Portugal. Besides sensory analysis, all wines were analyzed using GC coupled to different detectors, namely FID, FPD, MS and Olfactometry (GC-O). In all wines, GC-O analyses showed the existence of two olfactory zones related {{to the presence of}} 4 MMP and 3 MH. A third olfactory zone for 3 MHA was only observed for the youngest wines. The wines produced from Portuguese cultivars presented <b>aromatic</b> <b>intensities</b> comparable or even higher than those obtained in the Sauvignon blanc wine. Indeed, 3 MH was found in all wines and the highest amounts were observed in Antão Vaz, Arinto and Viosinho wines. In general, these findings are in agreement with those obtained by sensory analysis...|$|R

40|$|Two novel {{applications}} using {{a portable}} and wireless sensor system (e-nose) for the wine producing industry—The recognition and classification of musts coming from different grape ripening times and from different grape varieties—Are {{reported in this}} paper. These applications are very interesting {{because a lot of}} varieties of grapes produce musts with low and similar <b>aromatic</b> <b>intensities</b> so they are very difficult to distinguish using a sensory panel. Therefore the system could be used to monitor the ripening evolution of the different types of grapes and to assess some useful characteristics, such as the identification of the grape variety origin and to prediction of the wine quality. Ripening grade of collected samples have been also evaluated by classical analytical techniques, measuring physicochemical parameters, such as, pH, Brix, Total Acidity (TA) and Probable Grade Alcoholic (PGA). The measurements were carried out for two different harvests, using different red (Barbera, Petit Verdot, Tempranillo, and Touriga) and white (Malvar, Malvasía, Chenin Blanc, and Sauvignon Blanc) grape musts coming from the experimental cellar of the IMIDRA at Madrid. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) have been used to analyse the obtained data by e-nose. In addition, and the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method has been carried out to correlate the results obtained by both technologies. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

40|$|Conventional tasting {{sheets are}} widely used to {{evaluate}} wine quality in wine tasting competitions. However, the higher scores are mostly obtained by international commercial wines, resulting in lower scores being awarded to the classic European wines. We hypothesize that {{this is due to}} the tasting methodology that fails to recognize this wine style. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to show the implementation of a new wine tasting approach to overcome this drawback. The proposed training technique is based on the emotional responses of the taster after smelling two wines of clearly opposite styles. The first wine is characterized by high <b>aromatic</b> <b>intensity</b> but low in-mouth intensity, perceived as disappointing to the taster, here defined as an “easy” wine. The second wine is characterized as a wine with low <b>aromatic</b> <b>intensity</b> but that provides an unexpectedly positive in-mouth experience, here defined as a “difficult” wine. These emotions are explained by the wine sensorial characteristics. The “easy” wine has an intense, simple smell with short persistence while the “difficult” wine has a low intensity, complex aroma, and long persistence. The first style corresponds to the international commercial wines most prized in international wine challenges. The second, frequently rejected by untrained tasters, is consistent with the “so called” classic European wines, and is characterized by light red or yellow straw colors, weak smell intensity, and aggressive mouth-feel. After no more than four training sessions and using the OIV tasting sheet, inexperienced tasters were able to score “difficult” wines equally as “easy” wines and understand their different attributes. In conclusion, this new tasting approach may be used by wine professionals to explain the characteristics of high quality wines that are not easily recognized by untrained consumers...|$|E

In wines obtained from musts charged with french medium toasted oak chips, the content in furans was higher (5 -methylfurfural, trans-methyl-octalattone), phenolic aldehydes (syringic aldehyde, vanillin), eugenol, tyrosol, dihydro methoxycinnamyl alcohol. the wines, subjected to the sensory analysis, appeared more complex, fine and their <b>aromatic</b> <b>intensity</b> was higher than the control.

40|$|White {{grapes of}} Muscat Ottonel variety were treated enzymatically with {{maceration}} enzyme preparation and then fermented with selected yeast.

Also an improvement of filterability and a decreasing of the sedimentation and clarification time were noticed. The enzymatic treatment presented a benefic effect on {{the dynamics of the}} alcoholic fermentation and the final wine composition. By using maceration enzymes, the wine <b>aromatic</b> <b>intensity</b> is emphasized, because the enzymatic preparation contains high concentrations of both glycosidase acting on the first stage of the enzymatic mechanism and the β-glucosidase acting on the second phase of enzyme mechanism able to release the aromatic constituents. These results are also closely related to the sensory analysis, which indicated that the glycosidase enzymatic treatment seemed to be effective for the improvement of the aroma of Muscat Ottonel wines...|$|E
40|$|Net heat release, knock {{characteristics}} and temperature {{were derived from}} in-cylinder pressure and end-gas CARS measurements for different fuels in a single-cylinder engine. The maximum net heat release rate resulting from {{the final phase of}} autoignition is closely associated with knock <b>intensity.</b> <b>Aromatic</b> fuels have lower maximum heat release rates and lower knock intensities than expected from their octane number when compared to paraffinic fuels; this is observed even when there is significant heating of the end-gas from pre-flame reactions. Leaner mixtures have lower combustion rates so that pressure development is slowed and hence ignition needs to be more advanced to get knock to occur as frequently as in a richer mixture. However, for a given frequency of knock occurrence, there is no significant difference in peak net heat release rates and hence in knock intensities for different mixture strengths...|$|R
40|$|Three {{microcrystalline}} cellulose (MCC) samples were manufactured from bleached and unbleached softwood kraft pulp, and their properties {{were compared to}} those of the commercial MCC, Avicel PH- 101. One of the produced samples retained a large portion of lignin (10. 3 %), while the two others retained only some. The physical, chemical, thermogravimetric, and molecular properties were analyzed. The presence of lignin caused a substantial effect on the thermogravimetric and chemical properties of the MCC, as well as on its surface characteristics. The lignin-containing sample degraded at lower temperatures, and its UV Raman spectra had a high <b>intensity</b> <b>aromatic</b> band (1600 cm- 1) arising from the lignin. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed a high surface lignin coverage (40 %) in this specimen only. Particle size and BET surface area measurement results varied in some limits between MCCs, while the cellulose crystallinity index showed almost equal values between 0. 82 and 0. 84.

40|$|The first Herschel Hi-Gal {{images of}} the Galactic plane unveil the far-infrared diffuse {{emission}} of the interstellar medium with an unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. In this Letter, we present the first analysis of these data in combination with those of Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL. We selected a relatively diffuse and low excitation region of the l ~ 59 ° Hi-Gal Science Demonstration Phase field to perform a pixel-by-pixel fitting of the 8 to 500 μm spectral energy distribution (SED) using the DustEM dust emission model. We derived maps of the very small grain (VSG) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundances from the model. Our analysis allows us to illustrate that the <b>aromatic</b> infrared band <b>intensity</b> does not necessarily trace the PAH abundance but rather the product of "abundance × column density × intensity of the exciting radiation field. " We show that the spatial structure of PACS 70 μm maps resemble the shorter wavelengths (e. g., IRAC 8 μm) maps, because they trace both the intensity of exciting radiation field and column density. We also show that the modeled VSG contribution to PACS 70 μm (PACS 160 μm) band intensity can be up to 50 % (7 %). The interpretation of diffuse emission spectra at these wavelengths must take stochastically heated particles into account. Finally, this preliminary study emphasizes the potential of analyzing the full dust SED sampled by Herschel and Spitzer data, with a physical dust model (DustEM) to reach {{the properties of the}} dust at simultaneously large and small scales...|$|R

40|$|Several lignite {{samples were}} {{collected}} from boreholes of the Amynteo opencast lignite mine, northern Greece. Organic geochemical characteristics were investigated {{with the help of}} various analytical techniques, comprising Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gas-chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, petrographical measurements as well as determination of bulk parameters. In the low rank (Rr = 0. 21 %) Amynteo lignites, huminite is the most abundant maceral group, inertinite has relatively low percentages and liptinite concentrations are rather high. Carbon Preference Index (CPI) reveals the predominance of odd-numbered, long-chained aliphatic hydro-carbons, which is related to a higher terrestrial plant input. The Pr/Ph ratio suggests that reducing conditions were persistent during peatification. Gymnosperm biomarkers such as isoprimarane, abietane, phyllocladane and sandaracopimarane, as well as angiosperm indicators (lupane) and hopanoid compounds with bacterial origin were identified. Analyses of the aromatic fractions revealed the presence of naphthalene, alkyl benzenes and phenols, pyrene, cadalene, cadinane, fluoranthene and dibenzofurane. Based on the FTIR analysis, aliphatic and oxygen containing structures were prevailed over the <b>aromatic</b> moieties. The <b>intensity</b> of the mineral bands was preferentially increased in the FTIR spectra of insoluble material. According to NMR analysis, the aliphatic carbons (0 - 50 ppm) have higher proportions comparing to aromatic carbons (100 - 160 ppm). The aromaticity fraction is low (fa = 0. 32), as expected for these low rank coals. The presence of free organic radicals and Fe 3 + and Mn 2 + paramagnetic ions was revealed by EPR.

40|$|The {{removal of}} dyes and others {{contaminants}} such as heavy metals from effluent remains {{a major problem}} for the textile industry. While coloured organic compounds generally impart only a minor fraction of the organic load to wastewater, their colours renders them aesthetically unacceptable. Many dye compounds and their intermediates are carcinogenic and difficult to remove by conventional wastewater treatment methods. Many physico-chemical methods have been used for textile wastewater treatment. However, they showed some disadvantages such as high treatment cost, low efficiency {{to a wide range of}} dyes and toxic sludge generation. Bioremediation based on microbial technologies for treating textile wastewater promise satisfactory contaminants removal due to the biodegradation and mineralization of contaminants into non-toxic compounds. Therefore, this research has focused on bioremediation of textile wastewater, especially in colour and heavy metals removal, using biofilm. The potential dye-degrader and heavy metal removal bacterial strains were first isolated from textile effluents. Screening studies of isolated strains for dye decolourization and heavy metals removal were carried out using filter sterilized textile effluent and simulated textile wastewater in batch scale. Further more, the selected bacterial strains were grown as biofilm on support matrices and the biofilm were used for bioremediation of textile wastewater in lab scale experiments. The biofilm structure was examined using electron-scanning microscope (SEM). Parameters such as colour <b>intensity,</b> <b>aromatic</b> amines, COD, BOD, pH, cadmium, copper, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate content were monitored during the experiment. Generally, it was found that there are three strains of bacteria, namely Bacillus cereus, Aeromonas caviae and Aeromonas hydrophilla, showed a good performance in decolourizing and degrading dyes. Besides, they were also able to remove heavy metals such as cadmium and copper.

40|$|There is {{a long-standing}} {{controversy}} {{about the health}} effects of fumes and vapors generated during paving and waterproofing with bitumen. Such emissions may be carcinogenic. To address this question, a historical multicentric cohort of asphalt workers was assembled by in eight countries. Assessment of historical exposures to known and suspected carcinogens (bitumen, organic vapour, coal tar, respirable silica, diesel exhaust, and asbestos) in the cohort became the main objective of this dissertation. First, published reports on exposures in the industry were reviewed. They provided some insight into the identity of factors that influence exposure to bitumen among road construction workers. However, the data available through published reports have limited value in assessing historical exposure levels in road construction industry. Next, a database of European asphalt individual workers' exposure measurements was created. The database allowed retrieval and consistent coding of 38 data sets, of which 34 have never been described in peer-reviewed scientific literature. It was used to create statistical models of bitumen fume, organic vapour and polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons exposure <b>intensity</b> among paving workers, the most numerous bitumen-exposed group in the cohort. Individual exposure measurements from pavers (N= 1581) were available from all countries enrolled in the study. Statistical models indicated that for paving workers, exposure intensity could be reconstructed quantitatively on the basis of time period and production characteristics. Alternative exposure assessment models were explored in a subset of data with more detailed contextual information in order to see whether they might have produced more optimal exposure grouping for epidemiological analyses. It was observed that {{on the basis of the}} available data and given constraints of retrospective cohort study design, we could not produce more uniform exposure groups by employing different exposure models. Internal validity of statistical models was assessed in a cross-validation procedure. External validity was evaluated using data not used to develop the original models. Validation of the models increased our confidence in their applicability to exposure assessment. Next, the statistical models were applied to the creation of an exposure matrix: the link between exposure estimates and actual working conditions in studies companies. Procedures were also developed for semi-quantitative estimation of exposure for (a) cohort members not employed in paving and (b) agents for which few or no exposure measurements were available. Production characteristics in the companies enrolled in the study were ascertained via a questionnaire. Our approach produced a data-driven exposure matrix that can be challenged in future studies and easily re-estimated. Performance of the exposure matrix was evaluated in analysis of the hypothesized relationship between bitumen fume exposure and lung cancer mortality. Constructing quantitative exposure indices appeared to have been justified because (a) the healthy worker effect confounded any associations between duration of exposure and lung cancer mortality and (b) we identified statistically significant associations between average bitumen fume exposure and lung cancer risk (after adjustment for coal tar co-exposure) that require further investigation. Many of the unresolved issues in the cohort analysis may be remedied in a nested case-control study...|$|R

Wines made with these varieties showed high values of resveratrol that could lead to healthier wines, and the variety Maturana Tinta de Navarrete was found to share quite similarities in the chemical parameters with Tempranillo, studied as a reference variety. In the sensory analysis, and although all the wines obtained good punctuations, Monastel and Maturana Tinta de Navarrete were the best valued.

40|$|Malvasia {{aromatic}}a di Candia (Vitis vinifera L.) is an Italian aromatic grapevine cultivated between Emilia Romagna and Lombardy regions. This grape has an <b>aromatic</b> <b>intensity</b> {{comparable to}} Muscat 1, {{and it gives}} different type of wine: semi-sparkling, semi-dry or sweet wines and, more recently, dry or passito wines. In this study the evolution of aromatic compounds during the fermentation of semi-sparkling sweet and dry wine samples was studied. The extraction of free and glycosylated compounds {{was carried out by}} solid phase extraction onto C 18 -endcapped cartridges, while the detection was performed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Fermentative and varietal compounds were detected, observing similar profiles for both wines. The former compounds showed an increasing trend during the fermentation process, while the latter showed an opposite trend. In particular, the decrease of glycosylated terpenoids during the fermentation does not entail a corresponding increase of free fraction 2. These compounds can be converted into other different, or absorbed onto yeast cell wall, or else stripped away due to gas development. Free and glycosylated varietal component was characterized by a prevalence of diol 1, diol 2, geraniol and its derivatives. These compounds make different the aroma profiles of Malvasia aromatica wines from Muscat white ones. In fact, the latter are characterized by a prevalence of linalool and its derivatives. Considerable free and bound contents of citronellol were also detected as well as linalool and its derivatives. In addition, the presence of other free compounds such as C 13 -norisoprenoids and benzenoids was observed. The main identified fermentative compounds were higher alcohols and their acetates as well as medium-chain fatty acids and their corresponding ethyl esters. Knowledge acquired through this study are useful in order to characterize the wines obtained from Malvasia aromatica di Candia and set up variety-oriented wine making protocols...|$|E

Beef was found to be higher than goat meat only in total and heme iron contents. Ground goat meat and beef were then prepared as plain meat loaves cooked to an internal temperature of ~ 74 ?C or as chili using stir-fried and drained meat. Day- 0 goat meat and beef loaves were not different in fat or moisture contents. Day- 0 chili was not different in fat, but was different in moisture, most likely due to variable rates of moisture loss during cooking. Total, heme, and nowhere iron contents were higher for beef than goat meat loaves. Consumer panelists rated flavor intensity of goat meat and beef loaves similarly. Goat meat served after beef was scored lower in overall acceptability than beef served after goat meat.
