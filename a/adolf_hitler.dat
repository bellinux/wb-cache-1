5|$|The Abyssinian crisis {{showed how}} the League could be {{influenced}} by the self-interest of its members; {{one of the reasons why}} the sanctions were not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> into an alliance.|$|E
5|$|The website {{sometimes}} {{adopts a}} strongly critical stance against figures that it perceives as political or ideological opponents.

5|$|Arthur Harris was {{appointed}} Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command on 22 February 1942, and immediately set about implementing {{his plan to}} destroy Germany through dehousing. As part of their move to area attacks, {{on the night of}} 28 March a force dropped explosives and incendiaries on Lübeck, causing massive damage. <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> and other Nazi leaders were enraged, and ordered retaliation.|$|E
5|$|As the SS grew in {{size and}} importance, so too did Hitler's {{personal}} protection units. Three main SS groups were assigned to protect Hitler. In 1933, his larger personal bodyguard unit (previously the 1st SS-Standarte) was called to Berlin to replace the Army Chancellery Guard, assigned to protect the Chancellor of Germany. Sepp Dietrich commanded the new unit, previously known as SS-Stabswache Berlin; the name was changed to SS-Sonderkommando Berlin. In November 1933, the name was changed to Leibstandarte <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler.</b> In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to Leibstandarte SS <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors. LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old Reich Chancellery and the new Reich Chancellery. The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events. At the Berghof, Hitler's residence in the Obersalzberg, a large contingent of the LSSAH patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone.|$|E
5|$|Before, during, {{and after}} the Second World War, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were {{suspected}} by many in government and society of being Nazi sympathisers. In 1937, they visited Germany and met <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler.</b> In 1940, the Duke was appointed governor of the Bahamas, and the couple moved to the islands until he relinquished the office in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Berger later {{claimed that}} he had come {{up with the idea of}} SS combat troops wearing {{camouflage}} jackets from his own hunting days, and had suggested it to SS-Obergruppenführer Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Leibstandarte SS <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> Regiment (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of Flecktarn camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger's account.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{after the}} loss of Bismarck, <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> ordered the Kriegsmarine to move the ships to Germany for {{overhauls}} in preparation for their deployment to Norway. There they were {{to serve as a}} fleet in being, and as the premier naval defence for German-occupied Norway. After lengthy discussions the Oberkommando der Marine opted for the shorter, but arguably more dangerous route, through the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Even before <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were exploited by interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered as little as possible. The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, German anti-Semitic theorist Alfred Rosenberg in {{his primary}} {{contribution}} to Nazi theory on Zionism, Der Staatsfeindliche Zionismus ("Zionism, the Enemy of the State"), accused German Zionists {{of working for}} a German defeat and supporting Britain and {{the implementation of the}} Balfour Declaration, in a version of the stab-in-the-back myth. <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> took a similar approach in some of his speeches from 1920 onwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Misch {{received}} a call-up notice for military service. In Offenberg, {{he joined the}} SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT), the predecessor to the Waffen-SS, instead of the German Army as the SS-VT did not require Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service) time. Along with eleven others, he was selected for Hitler's personal bodyguard unit, the Leibstandarte SS <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> (LSSAH). In August 1939, {{he was promoted to}} the rank of SS-Rottenführer.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Black {{realizes that}} a {{painting}} {{he has seen}} in Knight's office was a watercolor by <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler.</b> He then notices two men watching his house from a car. He approaches and holds them at gunpoint, and they identify themselves as Group members; however, one of them discreetly draws his own pistol.|$|E
5|$|Nazi war leader Hermann Göring used cyanide to {{kill himself}} {{the night before he}} was {{supposed}} to be hanged during the Nuremberg Trials. <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> had also taken a pill of cyanide but he bit down on the capsule and shot himself in the right temple shortly before the fall of Berlin along with his wife, Eva Braun.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 1936, Charles Lindbergh {{departed}} Penshurst for Staaken Airfield, Berlin, {{which was}} a Luftwaffe airfield closed to civil aircraft.

5|$|On 24 October 1940, <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> {{installed}} Philippe Pétain as {{the head}} of state of Vichy France in the Montoire Agreement, abandoning the idea of an independent Breton state to ensure French cooperation. Lu Brezon was partially disarmed, while the separatist leaders of Breton National Party were replaced with autonomists.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1941, <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> {{resolved}} {{to end the}} conflict in the Balkans and subjugate Allied-sympathetic states. The Invasion of Yugoslavia began in the morning. The German Wehrmacht also intervened in Greece thus beginning the Battle of Greece. Italian failures had allowed another British foothold on the continent too close to the Romanian oilfields — Germany's ally.|$|E
5|$|Starting on {{the morning}} of 10 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps began its attack toward Prokhorovka. Its 3rd SS-Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf {{attacked}} across the Psel River and secured a bridgehead. The 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Division Leibstandarte SS <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> captured Komsomolets State Farm and Hill 241.6. The 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Division Das Reich defended the panzer corps' flank from Soviet armoured counterattacks.|$|E
5|$|Stefanie Rabatsch (née Isak; born 28 December 1887 – died unknown, after 1973) was an Austrian {{woman who}} was alleged by August Kubizek {{to have been an}} unrequited love of then-teenage <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler.</b> Her Jewish-sounding maiden name has been subject to {{speculation}} in this context. However, there is no evidence apart from Kubizek that Hitler ever had such an attachment.|$|E
5|$|Tarkington's {{accompanying}} essay {{published in}} the February 20, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post was really a fable or parable in which youthful <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> and youthful Benito Mussolini meet in The Alps in 1912. During the fictional meeting both men describe plans to secure dictatorships in their respective countries via the suppression of freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|The Führerbunker was an air-raid shelter {{located near}} the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, Germany. It {{was part of a}} {{subterranean}} bunker complex constructed in two phases which were completed in 1936 and 1944. It was the last of the Führer Headquarters (Führerhauptquartiere) used by <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler</b> during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Rommel myth, {{also known}} as the Rommel legend, as a term used by {{critical}} historians, refers to common depictions of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in popular culture and academic writings as an apolitical, brilliant commander, and a victim of the Third Reich due to his participation in the 20 July plot against <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler.</b> According to critical historians, such depictions are not accurate.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault was}} ordered by <b>Adolf</b> <b>Hitler,</b> to {{eliminate}} the gains made by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra and the subsequent weeks, and by reaching the coast {{in the region of}} Avranches {{at the base of the}} Cotentin peninsula, cut off the units of the Third United States Army which had advanced into Brittany.|$|E
