5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> and draw some pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E
25|$|The Attacker {{had a brief}} {{career with}} the Fleet Air Arm, not seeing any action during its time with the FAA and being taken out of {{first-line}} service in 1954. It remained in service with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer,</b> being taken out of service in early 1957. The Attacker was replaced in the front line squadrons by the later and more capable Hawker Sea Hawk and de Havilland Sea Venom.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 {{two of the}} 737-200s were {{replaced}} by Boeing 737-400s (C2-RN10 and 'RN11), leaving the venerable C2-RN3 (kept because it was convertible between passenger and freight configurations) to soldier on for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer.</b> The airline, by now only operating a single 737-400, was corporatised in July 1996 as the Nauru Air Corporation (NAC) headed by a new CEO without ties to the government, enabling it to operate independently in a commercial marketplace, free from most of its government constraints.|$|E

25|$|While the fruitless {{negotiations}} {{were taking place}} the Fallschirmjägers were preparing {{to move away from}} their stronghold and find a new place to fight from. The arrival of the two Norwegian mortars had completely changed the tactical situation and the German force′s supply of ammunition was also running dangerously low. Schmidt decided that he had to move his troops into a new and more defensible position. Negotiations were kept up to buy time so the paratroopers could slip away into cover of darkness. Schmidt believed that strong German forces were advancing up the Gudbrandsdal valley and that if he could hold out for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> the situation might still be salvaged. The reality of the situation was however that the German advanced units were stuck just north of Minnesund far to the south of both Gudbrandsdal and Dombås.|$|E
500|$|When the {{shooting}} between {{the battle lines}} resumed around 18:00, the Japanese concentrated their fire upon Imperator Aleksandr III and Borodino. Imperator Alexandr III sheered out of line to port around 18:30 and capsized, but did not sink until 19:07; there were no survivors. Borodino lasted <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> under concentrated Japanese fire. Two 12-inch hits by the battleship [...] at 19:18 started a massive fire and both the ship's 12-inch gun turrets were knocked out. Ten minutes later, after Tōgō ordered his ships to cease fire and disengage, the battleship [...] fired her already-loaded 12-inch guns before turning away. One of these hit Borodino beneath her starboard forward six-inch turret and ignited the ready-use ammunition in the turret. The fire spread and caused a catastrophic detonation in several magazines that blew open her hull. Borodino quickly capsized and sank with only one crewman from her crew of 855 being rescued.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Gordon {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the 2009 season in front of 176,300 who attended the race. He also earned $541,874 in race winnings. Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been amazing. What a great car. I've never had a car like this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had drawn}} her close to him, ready to whisper in her ear, {{as he had}} whispered {{half an hour ago}} in those of Lydie. He wanted this woman's trust and {{confidence}} just <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer,</b> and he found words readily enough with which to hoodwink and to cajole. Irène was an easier prey than Lydie. She was his wife and her ambitions were bound up with his; her mistrust only came from jealousy, and jealousy in a woman is so easily conquered momentarily, if she be beautiful and young and the man ardent and unscrupulous.|$|R

He has run away from his father, and trudged through the streets, alone, to rejoin his mother. The woman clasped her child in her arms and decides to live for him in the future. The mother takes her child to humble lodgings, the whereabouts of which are unknown even to her husband. There she tries to make a living for herself and him by sewing, but is unable to do so. She has given the last crust of bread to the little one, and is herself in a starving condition, when the baby boy himself comes to the rescue by starting out on a business career, selling papers in the street. In this way the wolf is kept from the door for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer,</b> and the little fellow, while applying his trade on the street corner, is met and recognized by his father. With his son as his guide, the repentant husband, who now realizes his unjust action, goes to his wife, and with the baby as a mediator, the two become reconciled." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, the ECB {{introduced}} a policy against [...] "flat" [...] covers, which can encourage moisture to sweat {{out of a}} damp pitch, making batting more difficult, and opposing captains were given the right to object to its use. The Brumbrella continued in use for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer,</b> but, after 20 years of use, it was replaced in early 2001. [...] Parts were given away to Warwickshire clubs to use as covers, including Moseley Ashfield, and a [...] "massive section" [...] was acquired by Atherstone Town Cricket Club.

2500|$|The actors {{remained}} in character for only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer,</b> the audience growing increasingly restive. In {{spite of their}} efforts, the stage hands could not snuff the fire out; instead they had inadvertently knocked burning material free, spreading fire to the rigging loft. Bits of flaming debris were beginning to fall, descending onto the box set and other properties spread around backstage. Dickinson, sitting in the center parquet, saw a thin wreath of smoke curling along {{the ceiling of the}} boxed-in scene. “Immediately afterward, one corner of the canvas ceiling was raised, and through the opening thus made I saw the flames, and saw men trying to rake the fire off the ceiling [...] with long poles.” With smoldering debris falling onto the stage, the actors fell out of character. Many in the audience, already restive, rose from their seats and commenced to crowd the aisles.|$|E

25|$|That day, Brooke {{ordered a}} counterattack.

5000|$|..... classifications and ascriptions of {{capacities}} rely on {{the good}} sense of making certain generalizations. One way to show this is to recall that broken chairs, while they aren't any good to sit on, are still chairs, not monkeys or palm trees. Classifications are not something rigid but something reasonable. While {{there are some people}} who either for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> or <b>longer</b> <b>while</b> - say when they're asleep or in a coma - lack moral agency, in general people possess that capacity, whereas non-people don't. So it makes sense to understand them having rights so their capacity is respected and may be protected. This just doesn't work for other animals.|$|R
60|$|In <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> she no <b>longer</b> merely {{tampered}} with these seals, for quite silently {{the door had}} opened and she was craning in. This love {{it seemed to her}} might after all be so strange a thing that it goes unsuspected and yet fills the whole world of a human soul. An odd grotesque passage in a novel by Wilkins gave her that idea. He compared love to electricity, of all things in the world; that throbbing life amidst the atoms that we now draw upon for light, warmth, connexion, the satisfaction of a thousand wants and the cure of a thousand ills. There it is and always has been in the life of man, and yet until a century ago it worked unsuspected, was known only for a disregarded oddity of amber, a crackling in frost-dry hair and thunder....|$|R

60|$|In <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time <b>longer,</b> <b>while</b> {{summer was}} still in its prime, the fairy {{structure}} of the Temple arose on {{the summit of the}} knoll, amid the solemn shadows of the trees, yet often gladdened with bright sunshine. It was built of white marble, with slender and graceful pillars, supporting a vaulted dome; and beneath the centre of this dome, upon a pedestal, was a slab of dark-veined marble, on which books and music might be strewn. But there was a fantasy among the people of the neighborhood, that the edifice was planned after an ancient mausoleum, and was intended for a tomb, and that the central slab of dark-veined marble was to be inscribed with the names of buried ones. They doubted, too, whether the form of Lilias Fay could appertain to a creature of this earth, being so very delicate, and growing every day more fragile, so that she looked as if the summer breeze should snatch her up, and waft her heavenward. But still she watched the daily growth of the Temple; and so did old Walter Gascoigne, who now made that spot his continual haunt, leaning whole hours together on his staff, and giving as deep attention to the work {{as though it had been}} indeed a tomb. In due time it was finished, and a day appointed for a simple rite of dedication.|$|R
60|$|We {{passed the}} {{remainder}} of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined. The morning of the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief, but to no purpose. The sea was still smooth, with only a long swell from the northward, as on yesterday. This was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink, {{with the exception of the}} bottle of port wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> unless something could be obtained. I never saw before, nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as Peters and Augustus. Had I met them on shore in their present condition I should not have had the slightest suspicion that I had ever beheld them. Their countenances were totally changed in character, so that I could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom I had been in company but a few days before. Parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far gone as the other two. He suffered with great patience, making no complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise. For myself, although at the commencement of the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all times of a delicate constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being much less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood, generally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and uttering the most absurd platitudes. At intervals, however, they would appear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition, when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak, for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether rational, although full of the most intense despair. It is possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as I did of mine, and that I may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as themselves--this is a matter which cannot be determined.|$|R
50|$|During the evacuation, Lieutenant General Alan Brooke, {{commanding}} II Corps, {{was ordered}} to conduct a holding action with the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions along the Ypres-Comines canal as far as Yser, {{while the rest of}} the BEF fell back. On 26 May, the Germans made a reconnaissance in force against the British position. At mid-day on 27 May, they launched an attack with three divisions south of Ypres. A confused battle followed among woods and villages, where British units became isolated, because they could not use radio below battalion level and the telephone wires had been cut. The German infantry infiltrated through the British defenders, who were beaten back. Most fighting occurred in Major-General Harold Franklyn's 5th Division sector. On 27 May, Brooke ordered Major-General Bernard Montgomery to extend the 3rd Division line to the left, freeing the 10th and 11th Brigades of the 4th Division to join the 5th Division at Messines Ridge. The 10th Brigade arrived first, only to find that the Germans were closing in on the British field artillery. The 10th and 11th Brigades managed to clear the ridge of Germans and by 28 May, the brigades were dug in east of Wytschaete. That day, Brooke ordered a counter-attack led by the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards and the 2nd Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment, both of the 1st Division. The North Staffords advanced as far as the Kortekeer River, while the Grenadiers managed to reach the Ypres-Comines canal but could not hold it. The counter-attack disrupted the Germans, holding them back <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>longer</b> <b>while</b> the remaining BEF retreated.|$|R

5000|$|In [...] "An Invisible Thread", Sylar {{plans to}} keep him alive <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>longer</b> <b>while</b> he acquires more of Nathan's {{memories}} in order to approach the President properly; when Claire {{shows up at the}} Senate office, Sylar impersonates Nathan and leaves the real one unconscious in the bathroom. Once he wakes up, he is found by Peter, and together they try to stop Sylar from reaching the President. As Nathan informs security agents about a threat against the President, he is forced to reveal his ability so they can be trusted to stop Sylar. Nathan and Peter finally confront him, with Peter and the now rescued Claire fleeing from the room once Sylar seemingly flies away from the building with Nathan out of the window, only for them to return to the room mere seconds later, with Sylar having empathically acquired Nathan's flight. In a shocking twist, Sylar slits Nathan's throat using his telekinesis and laughs, telling the dying Nathan that [...] "Claire is going to be so mad at me." [...] After meeting with Matt and Noah, Angela discovers Nathan's body and breaks down in despair, convinced that Matt was supposed to save Nathan, as seen in one of her prophetic dreams. Angela manages to persuade Matt to use his ability on a tranquilized Sylar to make him think he is Nathan Petrelli, intending for Matt to use her own memories of Nathan to essentially 'plant' Nathan's personality in Sylar, hoping that Sylar's stolen power of clairsentience will help the new Nathan 'fill in the blanks'. Once Matt tells him that Sylar is dead, that he is Nathan and wipes his personal memory, Sylar shapeshifts into Nathan and wakes up. 'Nathan' later burns 'Sylar's' (really shape-shifter James Martin) body at Coyote Sands after having convinced the President to shut down the Building 26 operation and proclaims a new beginning.|$|R
