25|$|A {{bookkeeper}} on {{the eighth}} floor was able to warn employees on the tenth floor via telephone, {{but there was no}} <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> and no way to contact staff on the ninth floor. According to survivor Yetta Lubitz, the first warning of the fire on the ninth floor arrived {{at the same time as}} the fire itself. Although the floor had a number of exits, including two freight elevators, a fire escape, and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place, flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women's purses. The foreman who held the stairway door key had already escaped by another route. Dozens of employees escaped the fire by going up the Greene Street stairway to the roof. Other survivors were able to jam themselves into the elevators while they continued to operate.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{stealing}} the 'T' is prohibited and is officially punishable with expulsion, although {{this has not}} happened in practice. After a Georgia Tech visitor was accidentally killed while climbing the Alexander Memorial Coliseum in 1999, Institute President G. Wayne Clough banned stealing of the 'T' and the climbing of any Institute building, due {{to the risk of}} fatal falls and the potential for damage to the building. Clough also expressed concern over the [...] "incredibly expensive liability litigation" [...] Georgia Tech could face {{in the event of an}} accident. To discourage climbing, security features such as pressure-sensitive roof tiling, fiber optic cabling running throughout the letters, and an <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> have been added to the 'T' to help prevent its theft.|$|E

2500|$|Emergency alarms (formerly [...] "Passenger {{assistance}} alarms"): Located {{throughout all}} subway and RT trains — When the yellow strip is pressed, an <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> is activated within the car, a notification {{is sent to}} the train crew and the Transit Control Centre, which in turn dispatches a tiered response. An orange light is activated {{on the outside of the}} car with the alarm for emergency personnel to see where the problem is.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{circulation}} of air through the chamber, the total concentration of oxygen in the chamber never exceeds 25% as this can {{increase the risk of}} fire. [...] Oxygen is never fed directly into soft chambers but is rather introduced via a line and mask directly to the patient. FDA approved oxygen concentrators for human consumption in confined areas used for HBOT are regularly monitored for purity (+/- 1%) and flow (10 to 15 liters per minute outflow pressure). An <b>audible</b> <b>alarm</b> will sound if the purity ever drops below 80%. [...] Personal hyperbaric chambers use 120 volt or 220 volt outlets. [...] Ranging in size from 21inches up to 40inches in diameter these chambers measure between 84in (7ft) to 120in (10ft) in length.|$|E
2500|$|The {{report found}} that the ship's fathometer, which {{measures}} water depth, was broken, as well as both radar repeaters on the cruiser's bridge. [...] Some time before the grounding, the ship switched navigation systems from a Global Positioning System, called the Voyage Management System, to a gyroscope. [...] The switch caused a [...] discrepancy in the ship's reported position. [...] <b>Audible</b> <b>alarm</b> bells triggered by the discrepancy were disregarded by the ship's crew. [...] During the small-boat transfer, the cruiser's operations officer took a binocular bearing to the harbor landing from the boat deck and noted the position discrepancy, {{but was unable to}} correct the ship's course in time. [...] Shortly thereafter, the ship ran soft aground, but then quickly was forced hard aground by the force of the waves.|$|E

40|$|This paper surveys {{current work}} {{on the design of}} alarms for {{anesthesia}} environments and notes some of the problems arising from the need to interpret alarms in context. Anesthetists 2 ̆ 7 responses to <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> in the operating room were observed across four types of surgical procedure (laparoscopic, arthroscopic, cardiac, and intracranial) and across three phases of a procedure (induction, maintenance, and emergence). Alarms were classified as (a) requiring a corrective response, (b) being the intended result of a decision, (c) being ignored as a nuisance alarm, or (d) functioning as a reminder. Results revealed strong effects of the type of procedure and phase of procedure on the number and rate of <b>audible</b> <b>alarms.</b> Some alarms were relatively confined to specific phases; others were seen across phases, and responses differed according to phase. These results were interpreted in light of their significance for the development of effective alarm systems. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design of alarm systems that are more informative and more sensitive to operative context than are current systems...|$|R

After 7.8 m AOD is reached, the barrier is lowered into the Foss.

25|$|Irish level {{crossings}} (crosaire comhréidh in Irish) {{are similar to}} UK {{level crossings}}, {{in the fact that}} they have a preliminary amber light before the red lights start flashing and the barriers descend (one example at Wexford does not have an amber light). Crossings are the same on the whole island of Ireland, and are either of the old gated variant, or are automatic. Ireland does have automatic crossings that have full barriers, which are not seen in the UK. The <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> are unique to the country.|$|R

50|$|Stress can {{narrow the}} focus of {{attention}} in a good way and in a bad way. Stress helps to simplify a pilot's task and enables him or her to focus on major issues by eliminating nonessential information. In other words, a pilot can simplify information and react accordingly to major cues only. However, when a pilot exceeds his or her cognitive load, it will eventually narrow his or her attention too much and cause inattentiaon deafness. The pilot will mainly focus on doing the primary task and ignore secondary tasks, such as <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> and spoken instructions.|$|R

50|$|Sump pump {{systems are}} also {{utilized}} in industrial and commercial applications to control water table-related problems in surface soil.

These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout. They may include electronic control systems with visual and <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in.|$|R

The Turkish Transport minister Binali Yıldırım stated that the crash was a “normal controlled flight into terrain by the fault of the crew.” The report states that the GPWS was not able to produce <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> due to a defect. Both the captain and the first officer were rather inexperienced and it was their first approach to Isparta. They did neither enter the Standard Instrument Departure of Istanbul nor the Standard Terminal Arrival Route and approach procedure of Isparta into the flight management system.|$|R

5000|$|Ice fishing {{can be done}} at {{any time}} of day, and is {{typically}} most active around dusk and dawn. Different fish are active at different times of day, so anglers need to fish for them accordingly.

One can even fish in one's sleep, by using <b>audible</b> <b>alarms</b> on one's lines to tell when a fish is biting. There are also many lightweight and highly mobile portable shelters that mount on plastic sleds and collapse for transportation. These can vary from small, one-person shelters (commonly called [...] "Fish Traps") to large and complex shelters able to fit up to 6 people at once.|$|R

The teleprinter is a thermal dot printer used to produce hard copy messages by electrically heating print elements in contact with heat-sensitive paper. The QCM was designed to estimate contamination buildup on optical surfaces of the earth resources experiment package. A vibrating quartz crystal is used as a microbalance relating deposited mass to shifts in the crystal's resonant frequency.
