As {{a result of this}} initiative to consolidate Shinto beliefs into state-approved practices, Japan's 200,000 shrines had been reduced to 120,000 by 1914, consolidating control to shrines favorable to the state interpretation of Shinto.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>to</b> an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E

5|$|The {{genesis of}} {{the removal of the}} HNC was a power {{struggle}} within the ruling junta. Khánh, who had been saved from an earlier coup attempt in September 1964 by the intervention of some younger generals dubbed the Young Turks, was indebted to them and needed to satisfy their wishes to stay in power. The Young Turks disliked a group of older officers who had been in high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts, and wanted to sideline them completely. As a result, they decided to hide their political motives by introducing <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>to</b> compulsorily retire all general officers with more than 25 years of service. The chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu, an elderly figure appointed by the military to give a semblance of civilian rule, did not want to sign the decree without the agreement of the HNC, which mostly consisted of old men. The HNC recommended against the new policy, and the younger officers, led by I Corps commander General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, disbanded the body and arrested some of its members along with other politicians.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Cold War, Norway {{enforced}} <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> <b>to</b> disallow allied {{aircraft to}} operate further north than Bardufoss and Andøya, {{in an effort}} to minimize tension with the Soviet Union. Specifically, allied aircraft were not permitted to operate east of the 24th meridian east, which was just west of Banak, thus hindering use of the airfield. This was motivated in part to not unnecessarily provoke the Soviet Union, with which Norway shared a land border, and in part because increased allied military presence could decrease the popular support for NATO membership. The restrictions were strengthened following the 1960 U-2 incident, in which a US spy aircraft en route to Bodø was shot down over Soviet territory. During the mid-1960s, NATO unsuccessfully attempted to convince Norwegian authorities to move the allied operational border from the 24th to the 27th meridian east.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most seat control models rely on {{the concept}} of {{marginal}} seat revenue and the assumption of risk neutrality <b>to</b> develop <b>an</b> <b>policy</b> <b>to</b> solve this kind of problem.

The effectiveness of the modified policy was examined by a series of simulation experiments. The simulation analysis shows that the model can balance the expected revenue and revenue variation.
