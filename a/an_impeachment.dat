5|$|Koht's role in {{the weak}} and unorganised defense against Operation Weserübung was debated {{during and after the}} occupation. After the World War, a {{commission}} named Undersøkelseskommisjonen av 1945 ("Scrutiny Commission of 1945") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions. After receiving Undersøkelseskommisjonen analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo <b>an</b> <b>Impeachment</b> trial. The Parliament of Norway did not find it necessary, and no such trial took place.|$|E

5|$|Tensions between Marshall and Innes {{continued}} during Marshall's {{tenure in}} the legislature. When Innes, {{acting on a}} recommendation from an advisory jury, dismissed an unrelated fraud case brought by Marshall in Innes' district court, Marshall retaliated by convincing Congressman John Rowan to file <b>an</b> <b>impeachment</b> petition against Innes in the House of Representatives. Innes countered by having his son-in-law, Thomas Bodley, pursue a censure of Marshall in the state House. Rowan's petition against Innes failed, but Bodley's against Marshall succeeded, and Marshall was expelled from the House in 1808, only to be re-elected the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate {{refused to}} meet to hold <b>an</b> <b>impeachment</b> trial {{before the end of}} the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was {{represented}} by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, <b>an</b> <b>Impeachment</b> trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have {{been marked by}} numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, <b>an</b> <b>impeachment,</b> two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with {{detrimental effects on the}} local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson. A series of protests led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed. Modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>impeachment</b> {{proceedings}} began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one}} of his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|R

25|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>impeachment</b> was <b>a</b> {{procedure}} whereby {{a member}} of the House of Commons could accuse someone of a crime.

Unlike a bill of attainder, a law declaring a person guilty of <b>a</b> crime, <b>impeachments</b> did not require royal assent, so they could be used to remove troublesome officers of the Crown even if the monarch was trying to protect them.|$|R
