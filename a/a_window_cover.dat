2500|$|With {{time running}} out, the Swiss Guard evacuates the Basilica. The camerlengo rushes back in, {{claiming}} that he has received a vision from God who has revealed {{the location of the}} antimatter canister to him. With Langdon in pursuit, the camerlengo ventures into the catacombs and finds the canister sitting atop the tomb of Saint Peter. Langdon and the camerlengo retrieve the antimatter and get in a helicopter with only minutes to spare. The camerlengo manages to parachute safely onto the roof of St. Peter's just as the canister explodes harmlessly in the sky. The crowd in St. Peter's Square look in awe as the camerlengo stands triumphantly before them. Because of this [...] "miracle," [...] the cardinals debate whether to elect the camerlengo as the new Pope. Langdon manages to survive the explosion using <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>cover</b> from the helicopter as a parachute, a trick he learned while touring CERN with Maximillian Kohler and lands in the Tiber River.|$|E
40|$|This is the {{official}} version of the thesis and therefore some confidential information has been removed. The aim of this thesis was to conduct a thorough investigation of truck drivers’ needs and desires regarding sun protection and blackout equipment in the cab and thereafter to develop a concept for a new system that met the customers’ and Volvo Truck’s requirements. The current system was evaluated through interviews with 21 truck drivers. The inquiry showed that to suit drivers of different heights the system needs greater adjustment abilities. Other problems included difficulty to reach parts {{of the system and}} gaps where light entered. Many drivers also wished for a bug net in the roof hatch. A benchmark showed that all competitors except for Scania provide different blind systems, although they are often optional in their biggest models. Only Renault’s biggest truck, the Magnum uses the blinds for both sun protection and blackout. In the other models curtains are used for blackout. The new system consists of blinds in the windshield, side window and roof hatch and is supplemented with a pair of curtains to black out the side window. The motorized windshield blind allows manual pull down and its guide rails are hidden and integrated with the A-pillars so that no gaps appear. The blind can be lowered {{all the way down to}} the dashboard thus working as both sun protection and blackout. To avoid the blind being lowered to far a safety button has to be pushed at the same time as the blind control button when activating the blackout position. For the side window the blind is used only for sun protection. On the driver side a manual blind is used but a motorized roller blind is provided as an option. On the passenger side it is possible to choose whether to have sun protection or not. If this is desired the sun protection consists of a motorized roller blind. The blinds are placed in <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>cover</b> and visible guide rails are placed on the outside of the cover. To allow the guide rails to follow the inclined shape of the side window a spring system is attached to blind’s hem bar. The roof hatch system consists of two blinds. The upper one is a bug net. It is manually operated and can be either rolled up on the roller tube or drawn out completely. Beneath the bug net is an opaque blind which is manually handled and can be placed in four positions, covering one fourth, one half, three fourths or the entire roof hatch. A motorized roller blind is provided as an option. To complete the system curtains are used to black out the side windows. They are attached to the curtain rails by “click-in” clips.

In order to successfully implement this technological innovation into the built environment, it should also complement the surrounding architecture and be visually acceptable to the user. One prominent feature of the LSC is its bright, fluorescent coloration.

40|$|Microsensing is {{a leading}} field in {{technology}} due to its wide application potential, not only in bio-engineering, but in other fields as well. Microsensors have potentially low-cost manufacturing processes, while a single device type can have various uses, and this consequently helps with the ever-growing need to provide better health conditions in rural parts of the world. Capacitive biosensors detect a change in permittivity (or dielectric constant) of a biological material, usually within a parallel plate capacitor structure which is often implemented with integrated electrodes of an inert metal such as gold or platinum on a microfluidic substrate typically with high dielectric constant. There exist parasitic capacitance components in these capacitive sensors, which have large influence on the capacitive measurement. Therefore, they should be considered {{for the development of}} sensitive and accurate sensing devices. An analytical model of a capacitive sensor device is discussed, which accounts for these parasitic factors. The model is validated with a laboratory device of fixed geometry, consisting of two parallel gold electrodes on an alumina (Al 2 O 3) substrate mounted on a glass microscope slide, and with <b>a</b> <b>windowed</b> <b>cover</b> layer of poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS). The thickness of the gold layer is 1 µm and the electrode spacing is 300 µm.

Numerous reports had pointed out to the crucial role of neovascularization in the malignancy of tumors and other angiogenesis dependant diseases. Antiangiogenic therapy which targets activated endothelial cells having several advantages over therapy directed against tumor cells. Determine the antiangiogenic potential of the leaves of Justicia gendarussa by CAM (Chrio Allontoic Membrane assay) method. Approach: A chick chrio allontoic membrane assay was carried out. Six eggs were used per experiment to test one extract at a given dose. The upper part of the shell of the eggs were removed like <b>a</b> <b>window,</b> <b>covered</b> with <b>a</b> plastic film and incubated for 72 h. When the CAM is about 1. 8 - 2. 6 cm development the pellets containing test solution both aqueous and ethanolic placed on the CAM by means of micropipette. After 24 h antiangiogenic effect was measured by means of a stereomicroscope to observe the avascular zone surrounding the pellet. Results: Below 10 µg both extracts showed no effect. In the dose range of 50 µg mL− 1 of ethanolic extract and 100 µg mL− 1 of aqueous extract showed inhibition of neovascularization. The effect was in dose dependant manner. Conclusion: These results indicated that both aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the leaves of Justica gendarussa inhibits the angiogenesois in dose dependant fashion and it provides a scientific basis for its traditional use in the treatment of arthtitis which is an angiogenesis dependant disease...|$|R
