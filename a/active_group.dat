It {{is involved in}} Zionist activism including martial arts training, government lobbying, criticism of national media, and pro-Israel demonstrations. Anti-Zionist demonstrations and picketing occurred every week outside the Marks & Spencer store on Oxford Street in London until 2010. Betar UK organized a counter-demonstration each week during that period, until it lost its 'charity' status for being political.|$|E
25|$|Methylcellulose (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically <b>active</b> <b>group</b> onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E
500|$|By late 1969, Emerson {{thought the}} Nice had progressed {{as far as}} it could musically, and was {{particularly}} dissatisfied with Jackson's limited vocal style. He asked Jack Bruce and Yes' Chris Squire about forming a new band, but both turned Emerson down. While on tour in the US with King Crimson, Emerson held a meeting with Stratton-Smith and declared [...] "the Nice had outlived its usefulness". By the end of the year, Emerson and Crimson's Greg Lake had decided to form a band together. The group carried on touring into 1970, but sometime early in the year, Emerson told Jackson that he would be leaving the band. Matters were not helped by Immediate Records filing for bankruptcy; the band later said they received no royalties from the label while an <b>active</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

Dilling spoke at America First meetings, and was involved in the founding of Van Hyning's [...] "We the Mothers Mobilize for America", a highly <b>active</b> <b>group</b> with 150,000 members who were tasked with infiltrating other organizations. The Chicago Tribune, the newspaper with the highest circulation in the region, was strongly isolationist.

2500|$|In England, Reverend William Cowherd {{founded the}} Bible Christian Church in 1809. Cowherd {{advocated}} vegetarianism {{as a form}} of temperance {{and was one of the}} philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. This was the first vegetarian society, of the modern western world, and was established in 1847. The Society was founded by the 140 participants of a conference at Ramsgate and by 1853 had 889 members. By the end of the century, the group had attracted almost 4,000 members. After its first year, alone, the group grew to 265 members that ranged from ages 14 to 76. English vegetarians were a small but highly motivated and <b>active</b> <b>group.</b> Many of them believed in a simple life and [...] "pure" [...] food, humanitarian ideals and strict moral principles. Not all members of the Vegetarian Society were [...] "Cowherdites", though they constituted about half of the group.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, the Horda {{group was}} {{suspected}} to have stolen a banner from Melbourne Heart's Yarraside <b>active</b> <b>group.</b> [...] In the following games, Horda banners were banned, {{which led to}} great protest from the Northern Terrace active members. At the following games, {{there was an increase}} in police and security present at the active area. Fans that were perceived as being [...] "too aggressive" [...] were escorted from the terrace, and in some cases fined or banned from the terrace. This led to the fans' anger escalating as they protested against the police control. On 2 February 2011, the fans from the North Terrace organised a silent protest for the Melbourne Victory– Newcastle Jets match. They left the North Terrace empty, and had a banner saying [...] "No fans no past no future– without us you are nothing", [...] "NT United". The banner was later confiscated by the police.|$|E

2500|$|In the Apuseni {{region of}} Transylvania, the most <b>active</b> <b>group</b> {{was led by}} Leon Șușman. The group mainly hid {{in the woods and}} {{acquired}} part of its armament from a Iron Guard band that the Germans parachuted in the area in 1944-45. To eliminate this resistance group, the Securitate used informers against them and intercepted the correspondence of family members. An armed group called [...] "The National Defense Front-The Haduc Corps" [...] was headed by a former officer of the Royal Army who participated in the war against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, Major Nicolae Dabija. Resistants from this group robbed the Tax Office in Teiuș, armed with a rifle and handguns. The Securitate learned about the location of this group after an arrested resistant revealed their location on Muntele Mare and about their strength. An operation conducted by the Securitate forces decided to attack the rebels on the morning of March 4, 1949. Securitate forces led by Colonel Mihai Patriciu charged the peak where the rebels were located, with a gunfight and later hand-to-hand combat occurring. The Securitate suffered three deaths and three others wounded. Dabija was arrested on March 22, 1949 after a local villager, whose barn he was sleeping in, notified the authorities of his presence. On October 28, 1949, seven members of the group, including Major Nicolae Dabija, were executed in Sibiu.|$|E
6000|$|And what I {{have said}} of the middle-class parent is true with certain {{modifications}} of all the classes above it, except that in a monarchy you reach at last one State-subsidized family--in the case of Britain a very healthy and <b>active</b> <b>group,</b> the Royal family--which is not only State supported, but also beyond the requirements of any modern Socialist, State bred. There are enormous handicaps at every other social level upon efficient parentage, and upon the training of children for any public and generous end. Parentage is treated as a private foible, and those who undertake its solemn responsibilities are put at every sort of disadvantage against those who lead sterile lives, who give all their strength and resources to vanity and socially harmful personal indulgence. These latter, with an ampler leisure and ampler means, determine the forms of pleasure and social usage, they [...] "set the fashion" [...] and bar pride, distinction or relaxation to the devoted parent. The typical British aristocrat is not parent bred, but class bred, {{a person with a}} lively sense of social influences and no social ideas. The one class that is economically capable of making all that can be made of its children is demoralized by the very irresponsibility of the wealth that creates this opportunity. This is still more apparent in the American plutocracy, where perhaps half the women appear to be artificially sterilized spenders of money upon frivolous things.|$|E
