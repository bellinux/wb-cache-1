25|$|Following their {{successful}} 2–1 aggregate {{victory over}} Real Madrid, Lyon were {{inserted into the}} quarter-finals. The draw was conducted on 19 March and Lyon were drawn to face Ligue 1 rivals and fellow French club Bordeaux. On 30 March 2010, Lyon faced Bordeaux at the Stade de Gerland in {{the first leg of}} the competition. Lyon got on the scoreboard early through a goal through Lisandro López following a blunder from Bordeaux defender Michaël Ciani, which allowed Mathieu Bodmer to recover the ball inside the box and find López in front of goal. Undeterred, Bordeaux quickly leveled with a vital away goal from striker Marouane Chamakh after great service from Yoann Gourcuff. In the 32nd minute, Lyon again took the lead with Michel Bastos scoring following another Bordeaux error, this time from Benoît Trémoulinas who misplayed a Lyon cross, which allowed the ball to land at the feet of Bastos who proceeded to blast a shot past goalkeeper Cédric Carrasso. Midway through the second half, Laurent Blanc's team rallied with the Brazilian Wendel drilling a shot on goal, which went by Hugo Lloris, but went directly off the post. Minutes later, Lyon were awarded a penalty courtesy of a Matthieu Chalmé handball. The penalty was converted by Lisandro to give Lyon a 3–1 lead and the Argentine was later carded in the final minutes of the match, which resulted in him missing the second leg. The 3–1 scoreline remained ensuring Lyon <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reach their first ever UEFA Champions League semi-final.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{measurement}} of regional {{cerebral blood flow}} (rCBF) by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a powerful clinical and research tool. There are several clinical applications now documented, a substantial number under active investigation, and a larger number yet to be studied. Standards regarding patient imaging environment and image presentation are becoming established. This article reviews key aspects of SPECT functional brain imaging in clinical practice, with a particular emphasis on therapeutics, including 1) {{the quality of the}} tomographic device, 2) the radiopharmaceutical employed, 3) environmental conditions at the time of radiotracer administration, 4) characteristics of the subject, 5) the format used for image presentation, and 6) the essential components of image processing necessary to the achievement of high-quality SPECT brain images. Next, a brief description of relevant radiation safety issues is provided. Finally, applications in molecular imaging, especially in small animal imaging for research as well as drug discovery and development are discussed. The gamut of SPECT studies from currently routine clinical applications to molecular imaging offers <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> frontier for <b>opportunities</b> to employ functional brain imaging in neurotherapeutics...|$|R

[...] As the U.S. expanded westward, the need for trade and transportation became a very prominent concern. [...] The area along the U.S.–Mexican border quickly became a highly sought-after property for the United States. As Rachel St. John describes in Line in the Sand: A History of the U.S.-Mexican Border, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California were all incredibly valuable properties at the time. [...] She continues to state that California was particularly beneficial, but in order to get there, the U.S. would also need New Mexico and Arizona. [...] The economic benefits of California were endless. [...] It was very profitable in multiple industries including agriculture, mining, trapping, and trading. [...] The soil was fertile, there were many rich mineral deposits, and the Pacific Ocean provided <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>opportunity</b> for trade with the Eastern hemisphere.|$|E

Arbuckle, accompanied by text headlining his achievement and {{entry into the}} Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. Caption reads: PHILIP H. ARBUCKLE not only was Rice’s first coach and athletic director, in his 10 years, he also was Rice’s winningest coach. Arbuckle’s teams won 48, lost 26 and tied eight for a winning percentage of 58. 5 per cent. He had only one losing season... his last in 1923. This tops even Jess Neely’s great record over 27 years (51. 4 per cent). A former University of Illinois football, baseball and basketball player from the Illinois farm country, Coach Arbuckle took his Ph. D (Bachelor of Philosophy) from Chicago U. in 1906, studying coaching under the late Alonzo A. Staff. By 1908 he {{had been brought to}} Southwestern in Georgetown where he turned that pioneer Texas institution’s athletic program completely around in four years. Going with Rice before the Institute opened in 1912, Arbuckle proved to be not only capable as a coach but a smart salesman. He needed top boys. He recruited them by driving home two points... Rice offered a superior education and Houston offered <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> after-life <b>opportunity.</b> In those days when many good athletes were solid students, this pitch won. In his fifth year (1916) Rice got the cream of the high school crop. By then he had beaten A&M and Baylor, and was ready to win over Texas in 1917. Coach Arbuckle was not year 50 years old in 1932 when he died of a heart condition. He was married to Georgia Ruth Curtin. They had three children – Phil H., Jr. of Houston, H. M.

These devices {{and the development of}} the term embodied fabrication is rooted not only in computer science, but in cognitive science, childhood educational theory, emerging digital fabrication technology, and the convergence of these strands present in the do-it-yourself community known as the 2 ̆ 2 maker movement 2 ̆ 2. As such, we operate under a certain set of premises that guide and direct this work. First, that embodied cognition [...] which places the body at the center of our cognitive operations [...] provides a framework from which to ground our decisions to design physical peripheral devices as opposed to purely screen-based software. Second, that a strong line of pedagogical research supports providing children with tangible, 2 ̆ 2 manipulative 2 ̆ 2 objects to learn with. Third, that digital fabrication technologies [...] 3 D printing in particular [...] provide <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> new <b>opportunity</b> for children and novice designers in general to make, play, and explore creatively [...] and that the current design options for 3 D printers are not suited to meaningful design and creation of objects by non-expert 3 D modelers. Finally, that by following the best traditions of body-centric interaction design for children, devices can be created to provide an educationally and technically rich environment that connects kids to the creative potential of 3 D printing. We unpack these ideas more in the introduction, followed by an overview of three prototype devices belonging to this class of 2 ̆ 2 embodied 2 ̆ 2 interfaces, a chapter on related work followed by a chapter on the three user studies we performed with our devices, a discussion of the presented studies, and finally we present a vision of the future of this work and of embodied fabrication devices as a whole before concluding...|$|R

Assuming 0 is a regular value of F, and some additional conditions on F, find a piecewise linear approximation V of {F = 0 } in the sense that it lies within ǫ of and is isotopic to B 0 ∩ {F = 0 }. It is often the topological condition which is difficult to ensure. We present a theorem which introduces a new test for topological accuracy. Making use of this, we develop a family of algorithms very similar in form to the Vegter-Plantinga algorithm. They are correct for all n and we implement a variation which is practical when n ≤ 4. This is the first known numeric (as opposed to algebraic) algorithm which ensures the topological guarantee with n> 3. When n ≤ 3 this algorithm produces a mesh with densities similar to those produced by the Vegter-Plantinga algorithm. For n = 2 we describe an advancing boxes algorithm which is based on subdivision followed by an advancing front style progression. It has several unique characteristics, including an ability to ensure good approximations of surface normals and no requirement for precise sign determination of F...|$|R
