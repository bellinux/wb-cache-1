5|$|Two {{different}} concepts {{have been}} used for decompression modelling. The first <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> dissolved gas is eliminated while in the dissolved phase, and that bubbles are not formed during asymptomatic decompression. The second, which is supported by experimental observation, <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> bubbles are formed during most asymptomatic decompressions, and that gas elimination must consider both dissolved and bubble phases.|$|E

5|$|The {{information}} sharing model <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> the search modes are mutually exclusive. Hopping {{with the head}} facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E

Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding.

5|$|If Offa did {{not gain}} the {{advantage}} in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, {{it may be}} that his successes south of the river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the southeast. In this view, Egbert of Kent's death in about 784 and Cynewulf's death in 786 were the events that allowed Offa to gain control of Kent and bring Beorhtric into his sphere of influence. This version of events also <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> Offa did not have control of Kent after 764–65, as some historians believe.|$|E
