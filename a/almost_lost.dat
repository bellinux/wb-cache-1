When they arrive in America, Fury single-handedly kills {{all the members}} of their ship aside from Banner and Peter. In spite of this, Fury has <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> the will to live: he failed to protect his Queen, he has been made a traitor to his country, and all his wealth and {{property}} has been seized and taken over by James and his favorites.|$|E
5|$|While other bats have <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> {{the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much {{more powerful than the}} legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E

5|$|Cher Ami, a homing pigeon in World War I, {{was awarded}} the Croix de Guerre Medal, by France, with a palm Oak Leaf Cluster for her service in Verdun. Despite having <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> a leg and being shot in the chest, it managed to travel around twenty-five miles to deliver the message that saved 194 men of the Lost Battalion of the 77th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Argonne, in October 1918.

5|$|Immortalité almost reached safety. On {{the morning}} of 20 October, Captain Jean-François Legrand was {{approaching}} Brest when he was spotted by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Fisgard. Fisgard, part of the inshore squadron of the Brest blockade, immediately offered battle. Immortalité initially attempted to flee but was forced to engage the faster Fisgard at 11:00. During the bitter, close–range action, Fisgard took severe damage and <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> her opponent. Immortalité, which had lost a mast and was in a sinking condition, surrendered at 15:00. Among the 115 casualties aboard Immortalité were Captain Legrand, his first lieutenant and General Monge (commander of the 250 soldiers on board), all dead. Fisgard, {{with the aid of}} other ships of the blockade squadron, successfully brought her prize into port.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E

5|$|Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet (26 August 1764 – 22 October 1843), became Lord Mayor of London in 1805. From humble {{beginnings}} in a farming {{family in}} Ayrshire, {{he became a}} successful merchant and politician; he was a relation of Robert Burns and used his wealth to support Burns's orphaned children. As Lord Mayor of London, he led the funeral procession of Lord Nelson in 1806, having established his {{right to do so}} and was created baronet twice, in 1809 and 1813. While later Chamberlain of London, he <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> his own fortune due to injudicious investments, and died, exonerated, in 1843.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 1940, {{during the}} Battle of Britain, Wilcke {{replaced}} Hauptmann Harro Harder as Gruppenkommandeur of the III. Gruppe. Harder had been last seen at 1:35pm on 12 August and was reported as {{missing in action}} following combat east of the Isle of Wight. The day of his appointment, Wilcke <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> his life as well, when {{he was forced to}} bail out after engine failure over the English Channel. He was rescued that night by a Dornier Do 18 flying boat. III. Gruppe flew a bomber escort mission targeting London on 30 August. Wilcke destroyed a barrage balloon on the morning mission and claimed his fourth victory, a Supermarine Spitfire in the vicinity of Dover during his second mission of the day. On 1 September 1940, on another bomber escort mission that started at 11:20am, Wilcke claimed his fifth victory, a Hawker Hurricane, south of London. He claimed his sixth victory, probably a Fairey Swordfish biplane, on 11 September over the Channel between Dover and Calais.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez did {{not stay}} in the bullpen very long though. After Randy Johnson {{strained}} his shoulder, Sánchez was chosen to start against the San Diego Padres on July 10. In that game, Sánchez not only threw the first complete game and the first shutout of his career; he threw a no-hitter, becoming the first Giants' pitcher to do so since John Montefusco no-hit the Atlanta Braves in 1976. In the process, Sánchez struck out a new career high of eleven batters. Sánchez had a perfect game going into the eighth inning, but an error by Juan Uribe allowed the only baserunner of the night. Sánchez <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> the no-hitter during the ninth inning when Edgar Gonzalez hit a ball deep to centerfield. However, Aaron Rowand made a spectacular catch, and Sánchez got his no-hitter. Sánchez's no-hitter was also special because his father Sigfredo, who had never seen his son start a major league game, was in attendance.|$|E

5|$|The Jain Temple at Lakkundi marked an {{important}} step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation, and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting eave (chhajja), used centuries later in Vijayanagara temples. The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it in a modified dravida outline. Miniature towers of both dravida and nagara types are used as ornamentation on the walls. With further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original dravida structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey.|$|E
5|$|Upon Tự Đức's death, Phan <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> {{his life}} during a power {{struggle}} in the imperial court. The regent Tôn Thất Thuyết disregarded Tự Đức's will of succession, and three emperors were deposed and killed in just over a year. Phan protested against Thuyet's activities, was stripped of his honours and briefly jailed, before being exiled to his home province. At the time, France had just conquered Vietnam {{and made it a}} part of French Indochina. Along with Thuyet, Phan organised rebel armies as part of the Cần Vương movement, which sought to expel the French and install the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi at the head of an independent Vietnam. This campaign continued for three years until 1888, when the French captured Hàm Nghi and exiled him to Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton made a {{pit stop}} on lap 35, coming out behind his teammate, driving {{over the white}} pit exit line in the process. This handed him a five-second time penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Sebastian Vettel came in two laps later, being stationary for more than 13 seconds due to a problem with the wheelnut of his rear right tyre and came out behind Felipe Massa in fourth place. Meanwhile, Romain Grosjean retired with gearbox issues. Vettel closed the gap to Massa in the last podium position, but was eventually unable to pass the Brazilian, handing Massa his first podium finish of 2015. Toward the end of the race, Pastor Maldonado was racing Max Verstappen for seventh place. Going past the start/finish straight, Maldonado <b>almost</b> <b>lost</b> the rear of his car coming out of the Toro Rosso's slipstream, while Verstappen locked up going into turn one, handing the position to the Lotus driver. Rosberg, who complained about vibrations in his front tyres during the last laps, crossed the finish line three seconds ahead of teammate Hamilton, taking his third victory of the season and the second consecutive one at Spielberg, reducing his championship gap to ten points.|$|E
