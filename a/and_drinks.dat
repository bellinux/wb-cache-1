40|$|This {{essay is}} {{a survey of}} the field of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> history in Australia since the 1970 s. It {{discusses}} the range of research and picks out key historiographic aspects: the search for an Australian cuisine; regional food cultures; connection between sources and historical interpretation; and the interdisciplinarity of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> history. It suggests that as food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> histories have broadened beyond a search for culinary traditions and a gastronomic sensibility, so our understanding of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> in Australian history has deepened. It also argues that food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> history is more than textual knowledge in books and articles: television programs and exhibitions held in museums and libraries, for example, have enhanced our understanding of food <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> histories...|$|R

5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often {{out of proportion to}} the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods <b>and</b> <b>drinks</b> (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E

Civilization does not consist in the eschewing of garlic or the keeping clean of a man's finger-nails. It may lead to such delicacies, and probably will do so.
