25|$|Another {{example is}} {{elemental}} tin (Sn), which is malleable near ambient temperatures but is brittle when cooled. This change in mechanical properties due to existence {{of its two}} major allotropes, α- and β-tin. The two allotropes that are encountered at normal pressure and temperature, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as gray tin and white tin respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above 161°C and pressures above several GPa. White tin is metallic, and is the stable crystalline form at or above room temperature. Below 13.2°C, tin exists in the gray form, which has a diamond cubic crystal structure, similar to diamond, silicon or germanium. Gray tin has no metallic properties at <b>all,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dull gray powdery material, and has few uses, other than a few specialized semiconductor applications. Although the α–β transformation temperature of tin is nominally 13.2°C, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below 0°C, and upon addition of Sb or Bi the transformation may not occur at all.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Metal Review, Gregory Bradley {{stopped short}} of calling the album a return to form, but {{asserted}} that the record was an [...] "acceptable" [...] release. Bradley did, however, credit the album for having some [...] "very metal" [...] songs, singling out [...] "What Doesn't Die" [...] and [...] "Black Dahlia" [...] in particular. Chris Ayers from Exclaim! opined that We've Come for You All was the band's strongest release since Sound Of White Noise (1993) and easily {{the best of the}} John Bush era: [...] "Grittier and more confident, the self-produced We've Come for You <b>All</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> certified classic that proves the ageless Anthrax are still a viable metal option." [...] Vik Bansal, of MusicOMH, summarized the album as [...] "a bold, sleek and raucous slab of modern metal", containing elements that were absent from many heavy metal albums at the time. Bansal cited [...] "What Doesn't Die" [...] for particular praise, noting the [...] "razor-sharp" [...] riffs on the song. He noted [...] "Cadillac Rock Box" [...] for sounding similar to bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Black Sabbath. Bansal summed up his review by stating that We've Come for You <b>All</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> [...] "mighty album from a still mighty band".|$|E

500|$|A Bergman {{space is}} an example of a {{reproducing}} kernel Hilbert space, which is a Hilbert space of functions along with a kernel [...] that verifies a reproducing property analogous to this one. The Hardy space [...] also admits a reproducing kernel, known as the Szegő kernel. Reproducing kernels are common in other areas of mathematics as well. For instance, in harmonic analysis the Poisson kernel is a reproducing kernel for the Hilbert space of square-integrable harmonic functions in the unit ball. That the latter is a Hilbert space at <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> consequence of the mean value theorem for harmonic functions.|$|E
500|$|The film also {{received}} mixed reviews from other critics. Ananda Vikatan said, [...] "Though {{this effort to}} improve the quality of Tamil cinema must be appreciated, we do not see the dignity of the epic and only see the dominance of the extravaganza." [...] In 2012, Baradwaj Rangan called the film [...] "a historical epic with little so-called relevance to contemporary life (unless you want to acknowledge the Duryodhana-Karna storyline as the granddaddy of today's bromances)" [...] and stated that Ganesan's performance [...] "isn't as all-consuming as his performance in, say, The Mahabharata, after <b>all,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tale with an ensemble cast, unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero", while calling Rama Rao's performance a [...] "sly, campy take on Krishna".|$|E

500|$|... …And Justice for <b>All</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> musically {{progressive}} album featuring {{long and}} complex songs, fast tempos and few verse-chorus structures. Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range, writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures. Hetfield later explained: [...] "Songwriting-wise, [...] was just us really showing off {{and trying to}} show what we could do. 'We've jammed six riffs into one song? Let's make it eight. Let's go crazy with it.'" [...] Music critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album's epically constructed songs: [...] "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts". BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that …And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album was less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album {{is more of a}} progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands [...] "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took [...] "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek {{said the}} episode started strong {{with the fire}} scare scene, but [...] "tapered off into a disjointed plot" [...] that she felt would not win new viewers. She said many jokes went too long and lost momentum, but {{nevertheless}} wrote [...] "a lot of the episode’s humor was engaging and smart". Lorenzo Perez of The News & Observer said the Pam subplot was [...] "overworked" [...] and lacked impact, and the Dwight character was over-the-top, proving The Office writers clearly {{have no idea how}} to rein in Dwight Schrute. Perez also expressed doubt the show would attract a new audience because it ran too late into the night following the Super Bowl. However, Perez said he enjoyed the Black/Leachman cameos. Terry Morrow of the Knoxville News Sentinel said, [...] "This particular visit to The Office doesn't pop like most episodes". Morrow praised the Black/Leachman film, but said, [...] "To be upstaged by a B-plot, one not involving the show's main characters at <b>all,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bit of a misdirection the show doesn't need in a post-Super Bowl time slot." [...] USA Today critic Robert Bianco said the plot was extremely thin and the Black and Leachman cameos were humorless and grotesque. Bianco wrote, [...] "Unfortunately, in an hour you get at most a handful of funny moments. So if you want funny from a comedy, look elsewhere." ...|$|E
