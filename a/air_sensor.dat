40|$|CO-sensing {{properties}} of potentiometric gas sensors using an anion-conducting polymer (ACP) as an electrolyte and metal oxides loaded {{with and without}} Au as electrodes (EC(MO) or EC(nAu/MO(Tm)), respectively, MO: metal oxide (In 2 O 3, ZnO or Co 3 O 4), n: the loading amount of Au, 0. 5 ∼ 2. 0 wt%, T: heat-treatment temperature, m: heat-treatment atmosphere, air or H 2) have been investigated in wet synthetic air (57 %RH) at 30 °C. In addition, H 2 -sensing {{properties of}} these sensors have also been investigated in the same gaseous conditions, to evaluate their CO selectivity against H 2. All of the EC(MO) sensors showed relatively small changes in electromotive force (EMF), i. e. responses, to both CO and H 2, but the Au loading to In 2 O 3 and ZnO drastically improved the magnitude of CO response of the EC(In 2 O 3) and EC(ZnO) sensors, respectively. The EC(2. 0 Au/In 2 O 3 (400 <b>air))</b> <b>sensor</b> showed larger CO response, faster CO response speed, excellent CO selectivity against H 2 and better long-term stability {{than those of the}} EC(2. 0 Au/ZnO(400 <b>air))</b> <b>sensor.</b> The influence of moisture on the CO response of the EC(2. 0 Au/In 2 O 3 (400 <b>air))</b> <b>sensor</b> was almost negligible in the humidity range of 40 ∼ 100 %RH. The magnitude of CO response of the EC(2. 0 Au/In 2 O 3 (400 <b>air))</b> <b>sensor</b> in wet synthetic air showed a good linear relationship with CO concentration, but the CO response was largely affected by the concentration of O 2. These results indicate that the EMF of the EC(2. 0 Au/In 2 O 3 (400 <b>air))</b> <b>sensor</b> is probably determined by the mixed potential resulting from CO oxidation and O 2 reduction. The heat-treatment conditions of the 2. 0 wt% Au-loaded In 2 O 3 powder largely affected the CO-sensing properties of the EC(2. 0 Au/In 2 O 3 (Tm)) sensors. Among these sensors heat-treated in various conditions, the as-fabricated EC(2. 0 Au/In 2 O 3 (250 H 2)) sensor showed the most excellent CO selectivity against H 2 in their concentration range of 10 ∼ 3000 ppm...|$|E

The deployment {{of a large number}} of sensors across a small geographic area would have potential benefits to supplement traditional monitoring networks with additional geographic and temporal measurement resolution, if the data quality were sufficient. To understand the capability of emerging <b>air</b> <b>sensor</b> technology, the Community <b>Air</b> <b>Sensor</b> Network (CAIRSENSE) project deployed low-cost, continuous, and commercially available air pollution sensors at a regulatory air monitoring site and as a local sensor network over a surrounding [*]∼[*] 2  km area in the southeastern United States. Collocation of sensors measuring oxides of nitrogen, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particles revealed highly variable performance, both in terms of comparison to a reference monitor as well as the degree to which multiple identical sensors produced the same signal. Multiple ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide sensors revealed low to very high correlation with a reference monitor, with Pearson sample correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0. 39 to 0. 97, − 0. 25 to 0. 76, and − 0. 40 to 0. 82, respectively. The only sulfur dioxide sensor tested revealed no correlation (r    0. 5), step-wise multiple linear regression was performed to determine if ambient temperature, relative humidity (RH), or age of the sensor in number of sampling days could be used in a correction algorithm to improve the agreement. Maximum improvement in agreement with a reference, incorporating all factors, was observed for an NO 2 sensor (multiple correlation coefficient R 2 adj-orig [*]=[*] 0. 57, R 2 adj-final [*]=[*] 0. 81); however, other sensors showed no apparent improvement in agreement. A four-node sensor network was successfully able to capture ozone (two nodes) and PM (four nodes) data for an 8 -month period of time and show expected diurnal concentration patterns, as well as potential ozone titration due to nearby traffic emissions. Overall, this study demonstrates the performance of emerging air quality sensor technologies in a real-world setting; the variable agreement between sensors and reference monitors indicates that in situ testing of sensors against benchmark monitors should be a critical aspect of all field studies...|$|E

The paper presents some issues aiming at improving the portability and the user-friendliness of the instrument as well as testing what kind of signal {{may be used to}} monitor the odour "intensity". Main results are the following. The test of various pre-processing data algorithms pointed out that the use of pure reference air could be avoided, as long as the sensors are allowed to periodically regenerate in the presence of ambient <b>air.</b> <b>Sensor</b> array in static contact with ambient air could be sufficient for the on-line monitoring, but the use of a controlled gas flow system to transfer the odour from the source is better to avoid the influence of air movement on the heated sensors. The control of the temperature and the humidity of the gas and the thermo-regulation of the sensor chamber don't seem essential, even for outdoor operation. When trying to build a regression model linking the odour intensity to the sensor signals, Partial Least Square (PLS) model gives better results with respect to Multi Linear Regression or Principal Component regression models.

The optimization-based control strategy uses a cooling coil model and a one-dimensional optimization routine to determine the fraction of outdoor air that minimizes the coil load. A coil model based on the contact-mixture analogy was adopted for this study and validated with experimental data.

Simulations evaluated the sensitivity of the annual and peak cooling loads to outdoor air and return <b>air</b> <b>sensor</b> errors and climatic conditions.

For a scenario representative of poorly maintained sensors, the lowest annual coil loads of the economizer strategies investigated are 3. 0 - 40. 3 % higher than those achieved for the ideal scenario of optimization-based control and ideal sensors (i. e., no sensor errors), and the lowest peak hourly loads for those cases are 6. 8 - 84. 1 % higher than those for the ideal scenario.

SPIE Conf. on Unattended Ground, Sea, and <b>Air</b> <b>Sensor</b> Technologies and Applications XIV, Baltimore, MD, April 2012 A key {{challenge}} of sentry and monitoring duties is detection of approaching people {{in areas of}} little human traffic. We are exploring smartphones as easily available, easily portable, and less expensive alternatives to traditional military sensors for this task, where the sensors are already integrated into the package. We developed an application program for the Android smartphone that uses its sensors to detect people passing nearby; it takes their pictures for subsequent transmission to a central monitoring station. We experimented with the microphone, light sensor, vibration sensor, proximity sensor, orientation sensor, and magnetic sensor of the Android. We got best results with the microphone (looking for footsteps) and light sensor (looking for abrupt changes in light), and sometimes good results with the vibration sensor. We ran a variety of tests with subjects walking at various distances from the phone under different environmental conditions to measure limits on acceptable detection. We got best results by combining average loudness over a 200 millisecond period with a brightness threshold adjusted to the background brightness, and we set our phones to trigger pictures no more than twice a second. Subjects needed to be within ten feet of the phone for reliable triggering, and some surfaces gave poorer results. We primarily tested using the Motorola Atrix 4 G (Android 2. 3. 4) and HTC Evo 4 G (Android 2. 3. 3) and found only a few differences in performance running the same program, which we attribute to differences in the hardware.

However, {{there are a number}} of critical design decisions which need to be made to enable representative data collection, in particular the location of the air sampler or <b>air</b> <b>sensor</b> intake. The aim of this research was to establish the best mounting point for four gas sensors and a Particle Number Concentration (PNC) monitor, onboard a hexacopter, so to develop a UAV system capable of measuring point source emissions. The research included two different tests: (1) evaluate the air flow behavior of a hexacopter, its downwash and upwash effect, by measuring air speed along three axes to determine the location where the sensors should be mounted; (2) evaluate the use of gas sensors for CO 2, CO, NO 2 and NO, and the PNC monitor (DISCmini) to assess the efficiency and performance of the UAV based system by measuring emissions from a diesel engine. The air speed behavior map produced by test 1 shows the best mounting point for the sensors to be alongside the UAV. This position is less affected by the propeller downwash effect. Test 2 results demonstrated that the UAV propellers cause a dispersion effect shown by the decrease of gas and PN concentration measured in real time. A Linear Regression model was used to estimate how the sensor position, relative to the UAV center, affects pollutant concentration measurements when the propellers are turned on. This research establishes guidelines on how to develop a UAV system to measure point source emissions.

However, building owners may not invest in FDD unless they are convinced of the energy cost savings that can be achieved. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the energy cost impacts of a range of common system faults in variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems, which are widely adopted for their good part-load energy efficiency. The faults studied include room <b>air</b> temperature <b>sensor</b> offset, stuck VAV box damper, supply <b>air</b> temperature <b>sensor</b> offset, stuck outdoor air damper and stuck/leaking cooling coil valve.

Since building occupants may adapt to the symptoms of these faults, such as reduced room air temperature, and thus may not complain about them, the occurrence of such faults are not immediately apparent unless a FDD system is available.

40|$|With the {{replacement}} of the Cotton Region Shelter (CRS), new air temperature observing systems such as the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), Maximum-Minimum Temperature System (MMTS), and the Gill shield temperature system were introduced. All of these systems house the air temperature sensor in radiation shields to prevent radiation loading on the sensors; a side-effect is that the air temperature entering a shield is modified by the interior solar radiation, infrared radiation, air speed, and heat conduction to or from the sensor so that the shield forms its own interior microclimate. The objectives of this study are to: (1) Theoretically investigate air temperature errors inside radiation shields. (2) Experimentally determine the air flow characteristics inside the shields. (3) Develop a physical model to understand the microclimate inside the shields including the interior solar radiation, infrared radiation, and air speed effects on the <b>air</b> (<b>sensor)</b> temperature under day and night conditions. (4) Experimentally estimate the effect of underlying ground surface coverings on the shield 2 ̆ 7 s interior solar radiation. ^ Theoretical investigation, field experiments, and the energy balance modeling of temperature sensors were methodologies in this study. Parabolic curves described the fraction of solar radiation entering shields during the day light hours. This fraction increased as the ground solar reflectivity increased, except for the ASOS, as a function of time of day. The rank of solar radiation shielding effectiveness was ASOS 3 ̆e CRS 3 ̆e MMTS 3 ̆e Gill. The ASOS dew point sensor extracted heat from the mirror surface and heated or cooled the shield. The rank for the magnitude of unbalanced infrared radiation was ASOS 3 ̆e CRS 3 ̆e MMTS 3 ̆e Gill. Linear equations provided a reliable air speed estimation inside the shields based on the ambient wind speed. The air flow efficiency of shields (exception of ASOS) ranked as MMTS 3 ̆e CRS 3 ̆e Gill when the ambient wind speed was below 1 m s− 1 and ranked as Gill 3 ̆e MMTS 3 ̆e CRS when the ambient wind speed was more than 2 m s− 1. For all radiation shields, the air temperature corrected for shield effects was in good agreement between shields while the uncorrected “normal operating” temperatures were more variable from shield to shield. ...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) {{collectors}} are {{an emerging}} technology that combines PV and {{solar thermal systems}} in a single solar collector producing heat and electricity simultaneously. The focus of this thesis work is to evaluate the performance of unglazed open loop PVT air system integrated on a garage roof in Borlänge. As it {{is thought to have}} a significant potential for preheating ventilation of the building and improving the PV modules electrical efficiency. The performance evaluation is important to optimize the cooling strategy of the collector in order to enhance its electrical efficiency and maximize the production of thermal energy. The evaluation process involves monitoring the electrical and thermal energies for {{a certain period of time}} and investigating the cooling effect on the performance through controlling the air mass flow provided by a variable speed fan connected to the collector by an air distribution duct. The distribution duct transfers the heated outlet air from the collector to inside the building. The PVT air collector consists of 34 Solibro CIGS type PV modules (115 Wp for each module) which are roof integrated and have replaced the traditional roof material. The collector is oriented toward the south-west with a tilt of 29 ᵒ. The collector consists of 17 parallel air ducts formed between the PV modules and the insulated roof surface. Each air duct has a depth of 0. 05 m, length of 2. 38 m and width of 2. 38 m. The air ducts are connected to each other through holes. The monitoring system is based on using T-type thermocouples to measure the relevant temperatures, <b>air</b> <b>sensor</b> to measure the air mass flow. These parameters are needed to calculate the thermal energy. The monitoring system contains also voltage dividers to measure the PV modules voltage and shunt resistance to measure the PV current, and AC energy meters which are needed to calculate the produced electrical energy. All signals recorded from the thermocouples, voltage dividers and shunt resistances are connected to data loggers. The strategy of cooling in this work was based on switching the fan on, only when the difference between the air duct temperature (under the middle of top of PV column) and the room temperature becomes higher than 5 °C. This strategy was effective in term of avoiding high electrical consumption by the fan, and it is recommended for further development. The temperature difference of 5 °C is the minimum value to compensate the heat losses in the collecting duct and distribution duct. The PVT air collector has an area of (Ac= 32 m 2), and air mass flow of 0. 002 kg/s m 2. The nominal output power of the collector is 4 kWppv (34 CIGS modules with 115 Wppvfor each module). The collector produces thermal output energy of 6. 88 kWth/day (0. 21 kWth/m 2 day) and an electrical output energy of 13. 46 kWhel/day (0. 42 kWhel/m 2 day) with cooling case. The PVT air collector has a daily thermal energy yield of 1. 72 kWhth/kWppv, and a daily PV electrical energy yield of 3. 36 kWhel /kWppv. The fan energy requirement in this case was 0. 18 kWh/day which is very small compared to the electrical energy generated by the PV collector. The obtained thermal efficiency was 8 % which is small compared to the results reported in literature for PVT air collectors. The small thermal efficiency was due to small operating air mass flow. Therefore, the study suggests increasing the air mass flow by a factor of 25. The electrical efficiency was fluctuating around 14 %, which is higher than the theoretical efficiency of the PV modules, and this discrepancy was due to the poor method of recording the solar irradiance in the location. Due to shading effect, it was better to use more than one pyranometer...|$|E

40|$|The Continues Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) {{therapy is}} the most popular noninvasive therapy used to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnoea {{symptoms}} (OSA). Recent sleep clinic research requires more CPAP functions during patient s sleep periods. It would be an advantage to operate the CPAP system at a lower pressure whilst monitoring the patient s air flow, and raise the pressure as the OSA is detected, rather than maintaining a fixed higher minimum pressure in order to reduce OSA symptoms. In order to detect OSA, an <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor</b> is considered ideally suited to assemble within the CPAP system and the characteristics of this type of sensors are investigated by creating and validating a mathematical model. Before determining the most suitable type of <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor,</b> several common methods of air flow measurement were investigated. Ultrasonic and hot wire <b>air</b> flow <b>sensors</b> were considered to be the most suitable sensors to be implemented. After setting up the simulation model and conducting experiments, some limitations of ultrasonic <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor</b> were found, so the hot wire sensor was selected for further investigation. Comparing the performances of three types of hot wire sensor, Constant Voltage (CV), Constant Current (CC) and Constant Temperature (CT), the CT hot wire sensor was found to be the most suitable type for CPAP systems. In order to achieve a precise measurement, different locations for the <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor</b> within CPAP system were investigated and the blower inlet was found to be the best location for <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor.</b> The simulation CT model hot wire sensor was developed. The experimental results were compared to the simulation model results. Comparison of the two results showed less than 1. 5 % error when the air flow velocity exceeded 1. 0 m/s (Average air speed is 5. 0 m/s from the CPAP Blower). Environmental conditions of temperature, humidity and wire property effects were analysed by processing the simulation model under different conditions. The following conclusions were drawn out: The output current to the hot wire <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor</b> rise significantly as the hot wire diameter increases, however, the sensor response time increases significantly. It was found that platinum wire of a diameter 0. 02 mm can meet the response time requirement for diagnosis of sleep disorders. Various wire lengths produce no significant effect on both aspects of output wire current and response time. Therefore wire length can be designed to fit the inlet channel of the CPAP blower. Higher wire temperature causes higher wire current flow at the same air flow velocity, however, lower wire temperatures achieve a faster response speed. The temperature range of 50 to 100 oC over ambient was found to be an optional setting. To achieve the desired level of accuracy a temperature compensation circuit was required for the hot wire <b>air</b> flow <b>sensor.</b> Otherwise it was necessary to keep the sensor in a stable room temperature environment to gain the same result.
