2500|$|In 1946, Winston Churchill {{travelled}} to Westminster College {{in order}} to deliver his famous [...] "Sinews of Peace" [...] address {{as a part of}} the Green Lecture series. [...] An extraordinary confluence of circumstances conspired to bring Winston Churchill to Westminster. [...] At the time, the College had a unique connection to U.S. President Harry S. Truman's administration—Major General Harry Vaughan, a graduate of Westminster College. [...] College president Franc McCluer asked Vaughan to see what President Truman could do to induce Churchill to come to Westminster. [...] President Truman thought the idea of bringing Churchill to Missouri (Truman's native state) was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>idea.</b> [...] On the bottom of Churchill's invitation from Westminster College Truman wrote: [...] "This is a wonderful school in my home state. [...] Hope you can do it. [...] I will introduce you." [...] So it was that two world leaders, Winston Churchill and President Harry Truman, descended onto the little campus of Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri.|$|E

60|$|Even at {{the first}} {{encounter}} it was evident he had changed; he seemed stouter and less nervous, and it speedily appeared that his conversation had already {{lost much of its}} old delicacy. There even seemed a justification for Helen's description of weakness in his face--in certain lights it WAS weak. He seemed busy and preoccupied about his affairs, and almost under the impression that Miss Winchelsea had come for the sake of Fanny. He discussed his dinner with Fanny in an intelligent way. They only had one good long talk together, and that came to nothing. He did not refer to Rome, and spent some time abusing a man who had stolen an idea he had had for a text-book. It did not seem <b>a</b> very <b>wonderful</b> <b>idea</b> to Miss Winchelsea. She discovered he had forgotten the names of more than half the painters whose work they had rejoiced over in Florence.|$|R
40|$|Population biology, {{whether in}} the guise of {{population}} genetics or {{in the guise of}} a more abstract evolutionary theory, provides <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> source of <b>ideas</b> for anyone studying the logical problem of language acquisition (see Yang, 2002, for discussion). These models have, at least, been the source of some thought provoking metaphors in the study of learnability as well as the study of language change. Indeed, there is some hope that the mathematics of population biology could form the basis of a learnability proof for parameterized models of grammar. In this paper, I would like to compare what I'll call “competition models” – models based on evolutionary theory – with “cooperation models”. These latter models are also grounded in mathematical biology, but use cooperative behaviors as seen among social insects as their source of inspiration...|$|R

The aim of the series is to give readers accessible and informative introductions to 30 of the most popular, most acclaimed, and most influential novels of recent years. A team of contemporary fiction scholars {{from both sides of the}} Atlantic has been assembled to provide a thorough and readable analysis of each of the novels in question. The books in the series will all follow the same structure:a biography of the novelist, including other works, influences, and, in some cases, an interview; a full-length study of the novel, drawing out the most important themes and ideas; a summary of how the novel was received upon publication; a summary of how the novel has performed since publication, including film or TV adaptations, literary prizes, etc.; a wide range of suggestions for further reading, including websites and discussion forums; and a list of questions for reading groups to discuss. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R

He made everything dull; an inverted alchemist, turning gold into lead.

Green-faced monsters with goggling eyes and mouths that slowly opened and shut. Green tunnels....|$|E
6000|$|Many {{things at}} Mertle were strange for her interlocutor, but nothing perhaps as yet {{had been so}} strange as the sight of this {{arrangement}} for little Aggie's protection; an arrangement made {{in the interest of}} her remaining as a young person of her age and her monde--so her aunt would have put it--should remain. The strangest part of the impression too was that the provision might really have its happy side and his lordship understand definitely better than any one else his noble friend's whole theory of perils and precautions. The child herself, the spectator of the incident was sure enough, understood nothing; but the understandings that surrounded her, filling all the air, made it a heavier compound to breathe than any Mr. Longdon had yet tasted. This heaviness had grown for him through the long sweet summer day, and there was something in his at last finding himself ensconced with the Duchess that made it supremely oppressive. The contact was one that, none the less, he would not have availed himself of a decent pretext to avoid. With so many fine mysteries playing about him there was relief, at the point he had reached, rather than alarm, in the thought of knowing the worst; which it pressed upon him somehow that the Duchess must not only altogether know but must in any relation quite naturally communicate. It fluttered him rather that a person who had an understanding with Lord Petherton should so single him out as to wish for one also with himself; such a person must either have great variety of mind or have <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>idea</b> of HIS variety. It was true indeed that Mr. Mitchett must have the most extraordinary understanding, and yet with Mr. Mitchett he now found himself quite pleasantly at his ease. Their host, however, was a person sui generis, whom he had accepted, once for all, the inconsequence of liking in conformity with the need he occasionally felt to put it on record that he was not narrow-minded. Perhaps at bottom he most liked Mitchy because Mitchy most liked Nanda; there hung about him still moreover the faded fragrance of the superstition that hospitality not declined {{is one of the things}} that [...] "oblige." [...] It obliged the thoughts, for Mr. Longdon, as well as the manners, and in the especial form in which he was now committed to it would have made him, had he really thought any ill, ask himself what the deuce then he was doing in the man's house. All of which didn't prevent some of Mitchy's queer condonations--if condonations in fact they were--from not wholly, by themselves, soothing his vague unrest, an unrest which never had been so great as at the moment he heard the Duchess abruptly say to him: [...] "Do you know my idea about Nanda? It's my particular desire you should--the reason, really, why I've thus laid violent hands on you. Nanda, my dear man, should marry at the very first moment." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of Sayles' {{most recent}} {{contributions}} {{to both the}} Merry-Go-Round {{and the city of}} Auburn was the idea for the Finger Lakes Musical Theatre Festival. The Festival, which celebrated its inauguration in the summer of 2012, consisted of 6 mainstages productions at the Merry-Go-Round Playhouse; 3 [...] "Off-Broadway"-style shows at the Merry-Go-Round Downtown, held in the Auburn Public Theater; and 20 new musical works held through a series called The PiTCH. The idea for The PiTCH was actually conceived while Sayles was still in his youth. In an interview with Emerging Musical Theatre, Sayles explains the origins of The PiTCH:I’ve always loved the movie Yankee Doodle Day with James Cagney as George M. Cohan. In the movie, Cohan and his partner Sam Harris meet with a producer, and Harris sits at the piano while Cohan “pitches” their story for a show in less than 15 minutes. Pitch. The idea stuck with me for a while. Over the years I’ve become disturbed at the production costs creative teams incur {{in the early stages of}} developing their musicals. So The PITCH came into being as a way for creative teams to receive feedback about their work without any out-of-pocket expenses. This summer, The PITCH will be hosting 20 new musicals, which we hope will give them a start on the way to being fully realized productions. I suspect that <b>a</b> number of <b>wonderful</b> <b>ideas</b> for shows have never reached fruition because of the financial burdens that accompany the development process. It is my wish that, in a small way, this will remedy that problem.|$|R
