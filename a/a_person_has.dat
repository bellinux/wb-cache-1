5|$|Esophageal strictures {{are usually}} benign and {{typically}} develop after <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which {{can also be}} congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E

50|$|Ahead of {{the times}} Rambam, 1133-1204 AD (probably due to Plato and Aristotle’s {{engagement}} with Ethics), determined that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>have</b> {{to take care of}} his soul as to his body, and just as <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who is sick in his body turns to the doctor, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who <b>have</b> mental illness needs to go to the doctor of the soul, which is according to him the philosopher or the sage. Rambam opposed the deterministic approach, arguing that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>have</b> free will and the ability to change its properties.|$|R

5|$|Relapsing-remitting MS is {{characterized}} by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is {{sometimes referred to as}} benign MS, although people will still build up some degree of disability in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period. The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis. 30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.|$|E
5|$|The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) {{recommends}} yearly screening using low-dose {{computed tomography}} {{in those who}} have a total smoking history of 30 pack-years and are between 55 and 80 years old until <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> not been smoking for more than 15 years. Screening should not be done in those with other health problems that would make treatment of lung cancer if found not an option. The English National Health Service was in 2014 re-examining the evidence for screening.|$|E
5|$|Unless <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> medical {{problems}} preventing movement, after a person starts anti-coagulation therapy bed rest {{should not be}} used to treat acute deep vein thrombosis.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a history of kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% {{of people who are}} intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{is the use}} {{of executive}} power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future crimes that will threaten national interest. Among other things, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act empowers the Minister for Home Affairs, if satisfied that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> been associated with activities of a criminal nature, to order that he or she be detained for a period not exceeding 12 months if the Minister is of the view that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E

5|$|Sense and Sensibility {{garnered}} various accolades {{following its}} release, {{ranging from the}} main cast's performances to Thompson's screenwriting. The adaptation received seven Academy Award nominations including the Academy Award for Best Film, though the sole win that night was for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, the only time <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> earned Oscars for both acting and writing. Thompson's screenwriting collected a further eleven accolades, including those given by the Broadcast Film Critics Association, Golden Globe Awards, and London Critics Circle. At the 49th British Academy Film Awards, Sense and Sensibility garnered twelve BAFTA nominations, ultimately coming away with three awards including the BAFTA Award for Best Film; Thompson and Winslet won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
5|$|The {{infection}} {{has been}} preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization in {{the first day of}} life if possible. Two or three more doses are required at a later time for full effect. This vaccine works about 95% of the time. About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006. It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection. During an initial infection, care is based on the symptoms that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has.</b> In those who develop chronic disease, antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful; however, these drugs are expensive. Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments {{play an important role}} in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal whether <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or {{an excess of}} hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|On Saint Lucia, wakes {{are held}} on the first and eighth night after <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>has</b> died, in {{contrast}} to other Caribbean islands, which hold their wakes on the first and ninth days. Wakes often include music, such as the singing of hymns and drumming. Traditional music for wakes is performed {{both inside and outside}} of the deceased's house. The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole, because they are derived from the English-using songs of Lucian churches. The songs include both hymns and sankeys (gospel songs), and are generally responsorial, led by a male singer with the slow, unsyncopated responses of the chorus in unison. The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming and a kind of responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment, called kont. These songs often related to the death of the deceased, and may deal with the cause of death, the last words or events surrounding the death. Mourners also dance to both the débòt and bélè, accompanied zo or tibwa and ka.|$|E
