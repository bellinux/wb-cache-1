5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as breaks in the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E
25|$|Earth's gravity {{allows it}} to hold an {{atmosphere}}. Water vapor and {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere provide a temperature buffer (greenhouse effect) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> except in polar ice caps (as on Mars).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{stormwater}} enters properties: backup through sewer pipes, toilets and sinks into buildings; seepage through building walls and floors; the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> on property and in public rights-of-way; and the overflow of water from water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Where properties are built with basements, urban flooding is {{the primary cause of}} basement flooding.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{hours after}} {{departure}} from Munising, a severe November gale struck Myron and Miztec with northwest winds blowing , a rapidly dropping temperature, and heavy snow. When the pounding seas opened the wooden seams on the aged Myron, her pumps {{could not keep}} up with below deck water.

6000|$|The day drew on, and {{we began}} to feel {{increased}} uneasiness at the novelty of our situation. Our hope and expectation were to find some anchorage; but to obtain this it was indispensable also to find a lee. As the ship moved forward, we still kept the land in view, on our starboard hand, {{but that was a}} lee, instead of a weather shore; the last alone could give our ground-tackle any chance, whatever, in such a tempest. We were drawing gradually away from this shore, too, which trended more northerly, giving us additional sea-room. The fact that we were in a powerful tide's way, puzzled us the most. There was but one mode of accounting for the circumstance. Had we entered a bay, the current must have been less, and it seemed necessary there should be some outlet to such a swift <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> It was not the mere rising of the water, swelling in an estuary, but an arrow-like glancing of the element, as it shot through a pass. We had a proof of this last fact, about eleven o'clock, that admitted of no dispute. Land was seen directly ahead, at that hour, and great was the panic it created. A second look, however, reassured us, the land proving to be merely a rocky islet of some six or eight acres in extent. We gave it a berth, of course, though we examined closely for an anchorage near it, as we approached. The islet was too low and too small to make any lee, nor did we like the looks of the holding-ground. The notion of anchoring there was consequently abandoned; but we had now some means of noting our progress. The ship was kept a little away, in order to give this island a berth, and the gale drove her through the water at the rate of seven or eight knots. This, however, was far from being our whole speed, the tide sweeping us onward at a furious rate, in addition. Even Captain Williams thought we must be passing that rock at the rate of fifteen knots! ...|$|E

5000|$|Availability of {{reliable}} pumps allows lifting <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> into gravity sewers from collection sumps in excavations like mines or building foundations; {{but the cost}} of pumping surface runoff discourages use of lift stations in storm drains or combined sewers. The capitalized cost of operation and maintenance of lift stations and emergency power supplies usually justifies considerable first cost for excavation or tunneling to build a gravity sewer. Sewage treatment is most efficient at centralized locations; and pumping is often required to lift sewage from lower elevations to the sewage treatment plant headworks. Structures called regulators allow overflow into gravity outfall sewers when peak flow in combined sewers exceeds pumping capacity. Sanitary sewers are preferred for cost-effective pumping of sewage when treatment is required. Gravity sewers are preferred where grades are favorable, but lift stations often move sewage to sewage treatment plants.|$|R
