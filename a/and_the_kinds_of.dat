This is often a multi-faceted approach that combines new and old media forms to create highly specialized strategies. This allows them to reach wider audiences, but also to target very specific subsets of the electorate.

In 2007, hospice treatment was used by 1.4 million people in the United States. More than one-third of dying Americans use the service.

Although most hospice patients are in treatment for less than thirty days and many for less than one week. But hospice care may be authorized for more than six months given a patient's condition.|$|E
500|$|Iowa State Teachers College, Cedar Falls, Iowa, {{became the}} new basic {{training}} center for enlisted WAVES. (The school's original assignment was {{the training of}} yeomen). Captain Randall Davis was named commanding officer. He arrived on 1 December, {{two weeks before the}} first class of 1,050 enlisted recruits were to start their five-weeks of basic training. [...] The recruit training routine began each weekday with Reveille at 5:30 or 6:00 A.M.; breakfast at 6:30 A.M.; classes and drill for four hours before lunch, and classes and drill for another four hours in the afternoon. [...] Followed by an hour of free time, dinner, and two hours of study or instruction, lights out at 10:00 P.M. Captain's Inspection on Saturday morning, then free time until taps. [...] On Sunday, reveille was at 7:00 A.M., with breakfast at 7:30 A.M. Then church services and free time until 7:30 P.M., when study hours began. Recruits received immunization shots [...] and were given a series of job aptitude tests. The first class was to graduate in early January 1943, but on 30 December 1942 the Navy announced that future WAVE recruits would be trained at Hunter College in the Bronx, a borough of the City of New York. The change came because of the Navy's reassessment of how many more women would be needed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> work they would be effective in doing. Iowa State Teachers College would return to training yeomen.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Beck, a star {{investment}} banker {{at the time}} with Drexel Burnham Lambert, {{was one of the}} film's technical advisers and has a cameo appearance in the film as the man speaking at the meeting discussing the breakup of Bluestar. Kenneth Lipper, {{investment banker}} and former deputy mayor of New York for Finance and Economic Development, was also hired as chief technical adviser. At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique. For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be [...] "morally bankrupt". Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the trading floor, the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> extras that should be seated at the annual shareholders meeting where Gekko delivers his [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone agreed with Lipper's criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot {{on the floor of the}} New York Stock Exchange during trading hours. Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.|$|E

2500|$|The role {{of former}} members, or [...] "apostates", {{has been widely}} studied by social scientists.

Their motivations, the roles they play in the anti-cult movement, {{the validity of the}}ir testimony, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> narratives they construct, are controversial. Some scholars like David G. Bromley, Anson Shupe, and Brian R. Wilson have challenged the validity of the testimonies presented by critical former members. Wilson discusses the use of the atrocity story that is rehearsed by the apostate to explain how, by manipulation, coercion, or deceit, he was recruited to a group that he now condemns.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that some employees perform OCBs to influence how they are viewed within the organization. While these behaviors are not formally {{part of the job}} description, performing them can influence performance appraisals. Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs as a form of [...] "impression management," [...] a term coined by Erving Goffman. Goffman defined impression management as [...] "the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them.
