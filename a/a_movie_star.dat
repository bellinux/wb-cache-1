5|$|Cooper {{began his}} career as a film extra and stunt rider, but soon landed acting roles. After {{establishing}} himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, Cooper became <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> in 1929 with his first sound picture, The Virginian. In the early 1930s, he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as A Farewell to Arms (1932) and The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper portrayed a new type of hero—a champion of the common man—in films such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), Sergeant York (1941), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943).|$|E
5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star</b> known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E

25|$|On November 30, 2004, the TBS network {{launched}} a reality series titled The Real Gilligan's Island, which placed {{two groups of}} people on an island, leaving them {{to fend for themselves}} in the manner of Survivor– the catch being that each islander matched a character type established in the original series (a klutz, a sea captain, <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>star,</b> a millionaire's wife, etc.).
