40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} a quadratic programming model to the bond <b>and</b> <b>note</b> participation decision of a Cooperative Farm Credit Bank. The model generates an efficient frontier of bond <b>and</b> <b>note</b> portfolios from which a bank can choose. The composition of these portfolios depends upon the expected cost and variance-covariance of cost for the bond <b>and</b> <b>note</b> activities, debt needs, and the debt policy constraints of a bank. The results indicate that the interest rate risk of various bond <b>and</b> <b>note</b> issues should be considered when making debt participation decisions. Agricultural Finance,...|$|R
2500|$|As the [...] "Notes" [...] {{section of}} the music braille chart above {{indicate}}s, a single symbol shows both the pitch and rhythmic length of a note. [...] For instance, dots 1,4,5 indicate an eighth note (or 128th note) C. Every rhythm symbol in braille music does double duty—8th <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> 128th <b>notes</b> use the same symbols, as do quarter <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> 64th <b>notes,</b> half <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> 32nd <b>notes,</b> <b>and</b> whole <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> 16th <b>notes.</b> [...] Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, <b>and</b> whole <b>notes).</b> [...] For advanced users there is never rhythmic ambiguity because the context, including time signature and bar lines, makes the intended rhythmic value clear. [...] For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), context says the symbol must indicate a whole rest.|$|R

The American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling writes that Yah's employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by Pane to cultural constraints; Indonesian readers at the time would not have accepted Tono having an affair with someone of the same socio-economic status.
