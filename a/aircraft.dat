5|$|A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy <b>aircraft</b> during aerial combat (The Germans traditionally set the threshold at 10 victories.). During World War II, hundreds of German Luftwaffe fighter pilots achieved this feat flying contemporary piston engine fighter <b>aircraft.</b> However, only 28 pilots are credited with shooting down five or more enemy <b>aircraft</b> while flying a jet-powered <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

5|$|AirSpace officially {{opened to}} the public on 12 July 2008. Over 30 <b>aircraft</b> are on display, dating back to the First World War; early <b>aircraft</b> include rare {{examples}} of an Airco DH.9 and a Royal <b>Aircraft</b> Factory R.E.8. The former is one of only six surviving DH9s and the only example on display in the UK, and the latter is the only complete and original R.E.8 in existence. More recent notable <b>aircraft</b> include a Hawker Siddeley Harrier which served during the Falklands War with No. 1 Squadron RAF, and a Panavia Tornado, which flew the highest number of bomber sorties of any Tornado in the 1991 Gulf War. Also on display is a British <b>Aircraft</b> Corporation TSR-2 strike <b>aircraft,</b> one of only two survivors from the cancellation of the project in 1965. Recent additions include Eurofighter Typhoon DA4, one of seven Typhoon development <b>aircraft,</b> which was donated to the museum by the Ministry of Defence in 2008 and went on display in June 2009. Civil <b>aircraft</b> include the Duxford Aviation Society's Concorde and Comet described above.|$|E

5|$|As soon as MacArthur cleared US <b>aircraft</b> {{to enter}} North Korea, the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron sent <b>aircraft</b> to scout all of North Korea's airfields. By the afternoon, the <b>aircraft</b> had not {{completed}} their scouting missions but a bombing mission was nonetheless ordered against Heijo Airfield. At 16:15, 18 B-26 Invaders of the 3rd Bombardment Group {{took off from}} airbases in Japan for strikes against the airfield. These {{would be the first}} offensive action against North Korea. The <b>aircraft</b> arrived at the airfield just after dark. There they found a substantial number of <b>aircraft</b> from North Korea's 1st Air Division parked on the tarmac, caught completely by surprise. The US <b>aircraft</b> subsequently placed their fragmentation bombs along the hangar line, ramps, and revetment areas. In the confusion, the North Koreans were only able to get one <b>aircraft</b> off the ground to oppose the flight, a Yak-3. The <b>aircraft</b> was quickly shot down by Staff Sergeant Nyle S. Mickley, a gunner aboard one of the bombers. By the end of the raid, the US <b>aircraft</b> destroyed an estimated 25 North Korean <b>aircraft</b> on the ground and one in the air while suffering no <b>aircraft</b> lost.|$|E
5|$|At 06:45, a U.S. scout <b>aircraft</b> sighted the {{carriers}} of Nagumo's main body. At 06:58, a Japanese scout <b>aircraft</b> reported {{the location of}} Hornets task force. Both sides raced {{to be the first}} to attack the other. The Japanese were first to get their strike force launched, with 64 <b>aircraft,</b> including 21 Aichi D3A2 dive bombers, 20 Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bombers, 21 A6M3 Zero fighters, and two Nakajima B5N2 command and control <b>aircraft</b> on the way towards Hornet by 07:40. Also at 07:40, two U.S. SBD-3 Dauntless scout <b>aircraft,</b> responding to the earlier sighting of the Japanese carriers, arrived and dove on Zuihō. With the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) busy chasing other U.S. scout <b>aircraft</b> away, the two U.S. <b>aircraft</b> were able to hit Zuihō with both their 500-pound bombs, causing heavy damage and preventing the carrier's flight deck from being able to land <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the <b>aircraft</b> {{industry}} as a whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL <b>aircraft.</b> It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so <b>aircraft</b> would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched <b>aircraft</b> like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL <b>aircraft</b> as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{thought that}} they had inflicted more damage than was the case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese <b>aircraft,</b> {{even though there were}} only 42 <b>aircraft</b> in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the {{engagement}} were 25 <b>aircraft,</b> with most of the crews of the lost <b>aircraft</b> not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six <b>aircraft</b> in the engagement, with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} the arguments raised {{for or against}} possessing supersonic <b>aircrafts</b> of the Army of the Czech Republic. The aim is to identify the arguments primarily during deciding on the acquisition of new <b>aircrafts,</b> because the old ones were retired in 2005. In the first part, the author analyzes various approaches to purchasing and possessing weapons systems (nuclear weapons, supersonic <b>aircrafts</b> and tanks) and defines three approaches, which he expects in discourse and which he will examine. The {{main part of the}} study deals with analysis of the arguments for and against the acquisition of supersonic <b>aircrafts</b> through discourse analysis. As a frame of reference author establishes the deputies and senators of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, the professional public and official documents of the Ministry of Defense and Army of the Czech Republic. By analyzing the discourse the author concludes that the official documents of the Army of the Czech Republic looks at supersonic <b>aircrafts</b> as a means of national defense strictly, professional public also looks at supersonic <b>aircrafts</b> this way in most of times.

5|$|Following the {{termination}} of the P.1154, the RAF then began studying a straightforward upgrade of the Kestrel as a production aircraft; accordingly, it issued Requirement ASR 384, which sought a V/STOL ground attack jet, known as the P.1127 (RAF). In late 1965, the RAF placed an order for six pre-production P.1127 (RAF) <b>aircraft.</b> On 31 August 1966, {{the first of these}} P.1127 (RAF) <b>aircraft</b> made its maiden flight. In early 1967, an order for 60 production <b>aircraft</b> was formally received by Hawker Aviation; at this time the <b>aircraft</b> received the Harrier GR.1 designation.

5|$|Four F-111C <b>aircraft</b> were {{modified}} to RF-111C reconnaissance configuration. These <b>aircraft</b> met the RAAF's requirement for <b>aircraft</b> to reinstate its photographic reconnaissance capacity. While the original order for F-111s specified that 18 would be strike variants and six reconnaissance variants, the RAAF later agreed to accept all 24 as strike <b>aircraft</b> and later retrofit six with reconnaissance pallets. In 1971 the USAF dropped plans to fit {{some of its}} F-111s as reconnaissance <b>aircraft,</b> but sold {{the design of the}} reconnaissance pallet to Australia for $3 million. At this time the RAAF decided to fit the pallet to four rather than six <b>aircraft.</b> The reconnaissance pallet contains four cameras and an infrared linescanner unit and is fitted in the F-111's weapons bay. The RF-111Cs retained their strike capability.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article, firstly, categorizes <b>aircraft's</b> {{presented}} area in {{a particular}} hit aspect into non-vulnerable region, non-overlapping vulnerable region and overlapping vulnerable region. Then, the <b>aircraft's</b> unique existing states are divided into kill states, intermediate states and no kill states. The parameters pertinent to <b>aircraft's</b> existing states in the above-mentioned regions are analyzed by using the shot line scanning method. Finally, the method provides two kinds of shot line geometric descriptive data: component's vulnerable area and presented area in each region, {{which can be used}} to calculate the component's single-hit vulnerability and <b>aircraft's</b> unique existing states and the areas corresponding to each state, which can be used to calculate the <b>aircraft's</b> single-hit and multi-hit vulnerability. Examples show that the proposed method can provide the parameters of the <b>aircraft's</b> or its component's area under threat being hit through tracing the shot line path thereby enabling the vulnerability calculated results to conform with reality to larger extent. In addition, the method solves the generality problem in dealing with overlapping components...|$|R
