This mission, known as the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO), would significantly increase NASA s capability to explore deep space by making use of high power electric propulsion. One electric propulsion option under study for JIMO is an ion propulsion system. An early version of an ion propulsion system was successfully used on NASA's Deep Space 1 mission. One concept for an ion thruster system capable of meeting the current JIMO mission requirement would have individual thrusters that are 16 to 25 kW each and require voltages as high as 8. 0 kV.

In the field evaluations, the results obtained by the Determine assay were compared to those obtained by local in-country HIV screening procedures. We evaluated serum from 100 HIV-positive patients and 66 HIV-negative patients. All samples gave the expected results. In a companion study, 42 HIV-positive samples from a Miami, Fla., serum bank were tested by the Determine assay. The samples had been characterized in terms of CD 4 counts and viral loads. Fifteen patients had CD 4 counts 200 cells/mm 3. Viral loads ranged from 630 to 873, 746 log 10 copies/ml. All samples from the Miami serum bank were positive by the Determine test. Combined results from the multicenter studies indicated that the correct results were obtained by the Determine assay for 100 % (142 of 142) of the HIV-positive serum samples and 100 % (66 of 66) of the HIV-negative serum samples.

40|$|METHODS: This {{literature}} review refers to studies and surveys conducted between 2006 and 2012 which support the growing acceptance of SCIg therapy among patients with PIDD. We researched clinical studies that looked at various populations of patients using IVIg and followed {{them through the}} switch to SCIg. Infections and site reactions were tracked {{as well as the}} percentages of the study populations who remained on SCIg therapy as opposed to returning to IVIg. RESULTS: Patient acceptance of SCIg therapy programs has improved signicantly since 2006. When rst introduced, clinical studies looking at patient preference for IVIg compared to SCIg showed 53 % preferred IVIg and only 33 % favored SCIg. The remaining 14 % had no preference. While infection rates were lower with SCIg, site reactions were prevalent, especially with new patients, though site reactions tended to diminish over time. This and the need for increased frequency of infusions led many who tried SCIg to revert back to IVIg for their medication. By 2008, patients reverting back to IVIg after trying SCIg had dropped to 22 %. A 2010 study showed 92 % of patients preferred SCIg over IVIg therapy. With other studies demonstrating that <b>ancillary</b> <b>supplies</b> have a large impact on the success of a SCIg infusions, careful management of patient complaints is essential. CONCLUSIONS: Since the FDA approval of Vivaglobin ® for subcutaneous infusion in 2006 and Hizentra ® in 2011, patient acceptance of this procedure has grown signicantly. Based on the FREEDOM 60 ® Syringe Infusion System being the infusion method of choice for this therapy in the United States (as shown in the Immune Deciency Foundation’s 2008 Patient Survey, where 67 % of those surveyed (290) stated they use the FREEDOM 60 ® for SCIg administration) and a 2011 Hizentra ® study which also conrmed that the FREEDOM 60 ® System is the most often used pump in the United States, it can be inferred that the use of the FREEDOM 60 ® for subcutaneous infusion of immunoglobulin has had a positive impact on patient conversion from IVIg to SCIg.

40|$|Abstract Background While {{feasibility}} of new health technologies in well-resourced healthcare settings is extensively documented, {{it is largely}} unknown in low-resourced settings. Uganda's decision to deploy and scale up malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) in public health facilities and at the community level provides a useful entry point for documenting field experience, acceptance, and predictive variables for technology acceptance and use. These findings are important in informing implementation of new health technologies, plans, and budgets in low-resourced national disease control programmes. Methods A cross-sectional qualitative descriptive study at 21 health centres in Uganda was undertaken in 2007 to elucidate the barriers and facilitators in the introduction of mRDTs as a new diagnostic technology at lower-level health facilities. Pre-tested interview questionnaires were administered through pre-structured patient exit interviews and semi-structured health worker interviews to {{gain an understanding of}} the response to this implementation. A conceptual framework on technology acceptance and use was adapted for this study and used to prepare the questionnaires. Thematic analysis was used to generate themes from the data. Results A total of 52 of 57 health workers (92 %) reported a belief that a positive mRDT result was true, although only 41 of 57 (64 %) believed that treatment with anti-malarials was justified for every positive mRDT case. Of the same health workers, only 49 % believed that a negative mRDT result was truly negative. Factors linked to these findings were related to mRDT acceptance and use, including the design and characteristics of the device, availability and quality of mRDT <b>ancillary</b> <b>supplies,</b> health worker capacity to investigate febrile cases testing negative with the device and provide appropriate treatment, availability of effective malaria treatments, reliability of the health commodity supply chain, existing national policy recommendations, individual health worker dynamism, and vitality of supervision. Conclusions mRDTs were found to be acceptable to and used by the target users, provided clear policy guidelines exist, ancillary tools are easy to use and health supplies beyond the diagnostic tools are met. Based on our results, health workers' needs for comprehensive case management should be met, and specific guidance for managing febrile patients with negative test outcomes should be provided alongside the new health technology. The extent, to which the implementation process of mRDT-led, parasite-based diagnosis accommodates end user beliefs, attitudes, perceptions, and satisfaction, as well as technology learnability and suitability, influences the level of acceptance and use of mRDTs. The effectiveness of the health system in providing the enabling environment and the integration of the diagnostic tool into routine service delivery is critical. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of new and more precise models for reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimation from minimum climatic data is mandatory, since the application of existing methods that provide acceptable results is limited to those places where large amounts of reliable climatic data are available. The performance quality of empirical equations and their local calibrations is to be questioned in a large variety of climatic contexts. As an alternative to traditional techniques, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly appropriate for the modelling of non-linear processes, which {{is the case of}} evapotranspiration. Nevertheless, temperature-based ANN models do not always provide accurate enough ETo estimations and their performance depends highly on the specific relationships temperature-ETo of the studied continental context. This paper describes the performance improvement of temperature-based ANN models through the consideration of exogenous ETo records as ancillary inputs in different continental contexts of the autonomous Valencia region, on the Spanish Mediterranean coast. The influence on the model performance of the number of considered ancillary stations and the corresponding number of training patterns is also analysed. Finally, this performance is compared with existing empirical and ANN temperature-based models. The proposed models can be used with high accuracy not only for infilling purposes, but also for estimating ETo outside the training station. Concerning models which demand scant climatic inputs, the proposed model provides performances with lower associated errors than the currently existing temperature-based models, which only consider local data.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of distributed generation, DG, into low-voltage (LV) networks {{opens up the}} possibility of <b>supplying</b> <b>ancillary</b> services to aid network management and to maintain power quality. DG itself can cause voltage magnitude difficulties when injecting real power into networks with high R/X ratios, but control of reactive power injection can help overcome this. Continuous control and support only at the voltage limit conditions (to avoid unnecessary reactive power flows in normal conditions) are explored. Relatively high-impedance LV networks are prone to harmonic distortion from nonlinear loads. A variety of control methods that emphasise either harmonic-line flows or local-voltage distortion are examined, and a compromise method based on resistance emulation is shown to be effective. Experimental results from a single-phase laboratory network and 2 kVA inverter are used to illustrate how these additional control functions can {{be integrated into the}} existing control scheme for real-power management. Decomposition of observed voltages and currents into harmonic terms that are phase synchronised to the grid voltage is a challenge in real-time systems.

Depending {{on the sun}} irradiation profile, influenced by weather conditions and seasonal variations, these generators usually work at partial loading. As a consequence, the operating point of a PV inverter could be quite far from its current limitation, especially if a rectangular or a circular capability curve is provided. So there are margins for intentionally injecting additional currents according to network requirements without altering the converter rated size and the active power generation. Managing inverters as current controlled devices, with independent regulations on positive, negative and eventually zero sequence current components, makes <b>supplying</b> <b>ancillary</b> services a concrete opportunity, with focus on network balancing.

The mode enabled impact evaluation of the VPP under economical and physical angle. It was concluded that currently no business case exists for such a VPP, however in the future it may be a profitable investment.

40|$|Energy Materials Research was {{organized}} in 1984. The specific {{objective of the}} company is to generate new concepts and to move targeted applications of newly developing technologies into commercial production. The initial technology described here is the outgrowth of a research program to develop concepts and techniques for low-cost energy production from renewable energy resources. The first major project implements an innovative process for the direct production of crystalline silicon sheet from a polycrystalline silicon source. The apparatus is designed to achieve this objective. Its primary goal is the efficient, low cost production of crystal silicon sheet {{of the highest quality}} silicon for the electronics industry. The objective of this phase of the project is to develop a laboratory processor that will produce single crystal ribbons or sheets of semiconductor quality silicon. A summary description of the overall process to be implemented is as follows: a single crystal seed {{in the form of a}} sheet is placed on a substrate in a non-reactive ambient and a carefully controlled thermal environment. The seed is heated to a stabilized temperature near the melting point in the zone designated for the crystal growth. A melt zone is developed. Melting is accomplished in the growth zone with a unique heating source which provides a very low thermal gradient in the pull direction but permits a high thermal gradient normal thereto. The sheet is pulled from the melt allowing crystallization to occur nearly normal to the pulling direction. The melt is replenished from a polycrystalline source heated by an <b>ancillary</b> RF power <b>supply.</b> Development of this process, unique to silicon sheet technology, provides several important benefits...|$|R
40|$|Denmark has the World's highest {{penetration}} of grid connected wind power in electricity generation with {{a share of}} 15. 0 % of total domestic demand in 2002 [Danish Energy Authority. Rapport fra arbejdsgruppen om kraftvarme- og VE-elektricitet. Bilagsrapport. Copenhagen: Danish Energy Authority; 2001]. This is unevenly distributed in the two separate electricity systems comprising Denmark, giving a 2003 share as high as 21 % in Western Denmark [Eltra. [URL] Skærbæk: Eltra; 2004] compared with a more modest 8 % in the more densely populated Eastern Denmark [Elkraft System. Miljøberetning 2004. Ballerup: Elkraft System; 2004]. At the same time, Denmark has other forms of distributed generation, e. g., extensive cogeneration of heat and power (CHP) plants for district heating or for covering industrial heat demands. This results in a high fuel-efficiency but also in a technically complex energy system. This combination of wind power and CHP is a challenge for system operators but also gives opportunities. This article analyses the possibilities for integrating even more wind power using new power balancing strategies that exploit the possibilities given by the existence of CHP plants {{as well as the}} potential impact of heat pumps used for district heating and installed for integration purposes. The analyses are made with particular focus on grid stability and delivery of ancillary services (required to control voltage and frequency) and demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} accommodate 50 % or more wind power without having to rely on import or export for power balancing. Relying on import and export sets demands on the neighbouring countries which may not be met. Compulsion to export or import furthermore gives a poor bargaining position on the electricity market. However, in order to reach such high levels of wind power, the generating equipment must be able to <b>supply</b> <b>ancillary</b> services in contrast to their present abilities.

40|$|In 1821, William Becknell and {{his companions}} from Missouri arrived in Santa Fe with a few pack animals loaded with an {{assortment}} of trade goods. The response they received from goods-starved New Mexicans was so enthusiastic they quickly returned to Missouri for another load to sell in this new market. Operating on the theory that the more supplies they carried the greater their profits would be, Becknell 2 ̆ 7 s 1822 company loaded three wagons this time and again reaped a tremendous reward for their efforts. When news of his success spread he was quickly joined by others, and a trading enterprise to continue for the next sixty years began. The wide variety of wagons employed in this Santa Fe trade is the subject of Mark Gardner 2 ̆ 7 s carefully researched and richly illustrated book. Prompted by a general interest in wagons and the Santa Fe Trail, Gardner initially encountered an apparent scarcity of primary documentation. What he learned, though, and what becomes quickly evident to his reader, is that the documentation did exist; it had just never been thoroughly researched and summarized in a single source. Gardner 2 ̆ 7 s book does an excellent job of rectifying this situation in an engrossing and highly readable fashion. Beginning with a discussion of the various types of wagons used in the trade, Gardner moves on to document how most of the early ones were built by manufacturers in Pennsylvania before the rise of a significant wagon making industry in Missouri. Of particular interest is his information on the success of several free black wagon makers in St. Louis in the 1850 s. He also strips away many of the myths surrounding the fabled Murphy wagons, long regarded as the 2 ̆ 2 monster 2 ̆ 2 wagons of the Santa Fe trade. In looking objectively at the extant documentation, though, he succeeds in placing Joseph Murphy 2 ̆ 7 s contributions within the proper historic context and fully acknowledges that 2 ̆ 2 {{he was one of the}} important manufacturers of wagons used on the Santa Fe Trail. 2 ̆ 2 Subsequent chapters examine a host of details about trade wagons, including their origins in the Trans-Appalachian regions, various features and specifications taken largely from primary sources, how their design evolved to meet the conditions of the country and changing requirements of the trade, and how an ever-growing demand for wagons brought about the displacement of the individual wagonmaker by mechanized factories, complete with specialized labor and an <b>ancillary</b> parts <b>supply</b> industry. In a final chapter, the fascinating story of William Thompson and his invention of the patented Windwagon should be especially interesting to students of Great Plains history. The depth of detail and the many valuable illustrations Gardner provides make Wagons for the Santa Fe Trail an indispensable addition to any library documenting the history of transportation in the West...|$|R
