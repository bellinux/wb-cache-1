Following his move to Samsunspor, Andre told Feyenoord's {{official}} website that [...] "he admits he is sorry to be leaving and says sorely miss this club and this city" [...] He also told Feyenoord's official website that [...] "It {{will take time to}} get used to being Samsunspor <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> at Feyenoord". Two months after signing for the club due to pre match friendly, Andre made his debut in the Samsunspor shirt in a 3–2 win over Gençlerbirliği on 10 September 2011. At the start of the 2012–13 season, Andre left Samsunspor by mutual consent after one season. His release was explained as Andre sued the club over allegedly owing him four months of unpaid wages.|$|E

I thought it would make me feel myself a boy again, but, heigh-ho, it has just the opposite effect: I never felt so old as I do to-day." ...|$|E

50|$|On August 2, 2012, Harvey {{performed}} {{his final}} stand-up act at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, ending a 27-year {{career as a}} stand-up comedian. The two-hour performance was broadcast live on Pay-Per-View. “The road to this final show has been an amazing journey, doing stand-up for the past 27 years, and I can’t thank fans enough <b>after</b> reflecting on <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> on stage,” he said.|$|R
5000|$|The name 'See No Evil', Bennett explained, is {{from the}} three wise monkeys who see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. “It sort of works on the artistic element, and {{because it has a}} musical element to it as well. And of course because we’re taking over the old magistrates’ courts” and Police station. The irony of Inkie being invited to paint the very courts he was sentenced in <b>after</b> Operation Anderson <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> ago was not lost. [...] "Half the early {{graffiti}} artists in Bristol must have been taken to that police station or through the magistrates’ courts at one time or another" [...] [...] "I mean, we've legally painted the old juvenile and magistrates' courts where a few of these artists have been processed and charged. It was quite a surreal thing to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|Young Jolyon, on {{the point}} of leaving the Club, had put on his hat, and was in the act of {{crossing}} the hall, as the porter met him. He was no longer young, with hair going grey, and face--a narrower replica of his father's, with the same large drooping moustache--decidedly worn. He turned pale. This meeting was terrible <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years,</b> for nothing in the world was so terrible as a scene. They met and crossed hands without a word. Then, with a quaver in his voice, the father said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Tyrrel {{leaned back}} in agony as he spoke, and looked utterly crushed. It was an awful memory. Le Neve hardly knew what to say, the man's remorse was so poignant. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> the boy's thoughtless act seemed to weigh like a {{millstone}} round the grown man's neck. Eustace held his peace, and felt for him. By and by Tyrrel went on again, rocking himself to and fro on his rough seat as he spoke. [...] "For fifteen years," [...] he said, piteously, [...] "I've borne this burden in my heart, and never told anybody. I tell it now first of all men to you. You're the only soul on earth who shares my secret." ...|$|E
60|$|Overhearing {{complimentary}} {{remarks about}} himself, he drew {{back a little}} from the porch into the church which had now emptied. As he stood there someone tapped him on the shoulder. The touch disturbed him; it was unpleasant {{to him and he}} turned impatiently to see from whom it came. There in front of him, bundled up in a rusty black cloak of which the hood covered the head, was a short fat woman. Her face was hidden, but from the cavernous recesses of the hood two piercing black eyes shone like to those of a tiger in its den. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> Godfrey recognised them at once; indeed subconsciously he had known who had touched him even before he turned. It was Madame Riennes.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the death}} of her parents, Grace lived with her grandparents, uncle, and aunt; her uncle became her legal guardian. She {{eventually}} went on to live in Niagara Falls, working for the Salvation Army. Every year on the anniversary of the sinking she went to Toronto to place a wreath at a cemetery monument honoring the Empress victims, but mostly her parents. She even had a photo of her taken with nine other Salvation Army members that survived the sinking, (Thomas and Margaret Greenaway, David MacAmmond, Ernest Green, Rufus Spooner, Alfred Keith, Mary Atwell, and Frank and Henrietta Brooks) in 1934 And missed only two years. When she grew older she married Maurice Martyn, became Grace Martyn, had one son name Gordon how became a doctor, and settled in St. Catharine’s, Ontario. In 1992, she was reported to be in the Toronto area, and attending Highland Road Baptist Church. But even <b>after</b> <b>all</b> of <b>those</b> <b>years,</b> she still felt close to her parents in the water before they were killed. And she still had nightmares over the tragedy, because ever since she survived the sinking of the Empress of Ireland, a tap of water running in the bathtub would frighten her into terrible shivers and once again experience the panic of going down in the water. She didn’t talk about the disaster unless somebody brought up the subject. Except for one time at school, when she did a composition about the Empress.|$|R
500|$|William Leith of the London Evening Standard was {{impressed}} with the biography, and noted that [...] "the thing about Madonna is not in her sensationalism, it’s in the fact that how much humane she appeared in the book. Taraborrelli does a fine job of capturing the world's most famous courtesan, in the most infamous way", and John Smyntek from Knight Ridder thought [...] "Taraborrelli [...] retelling all [...] and more. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> in <b>those</b> 10 <b>years,</b> the Great Woman has had two children, wed and maintained her image as a major pain in the keister. He does a great job of bringing forth these unknown facts." [...] Ward Triplet of the Kansas City Star felt that although the book is [...] "an eerie, but compelling day by day account of Madonna, and how she became who she is, sometimes Taraborrelli feels like revealing more about his process of writing than his subject", and Ann O' Neil in the Los Angeles Times complimented the book for being [...] "different" [...] from the [...] "regular dirt written everyday about Madonna." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{occasion}} {{in the early}} 1940s, when the grandmother watched the children, Carol would join White in singing, performing and recording with the folk collaborative group, the Almanac Singers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Carol was a guest on Eleanor Roosevelt's television talk show, and in 1982 she was a featured speaker at the Smithsonian Institution's 100th anniversary celebration of the birth ofFranklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, while her son, Josh White, Jr., performed a musical program of songs his father had presented {{at one of his}} White House command performances. Josh White, Jr., a successful singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, educator, and social activist for the past 60 years, performed and recorded with his father as a duet from 1944 to 1961 and performed with him in two Broadway plays (Josh White, Jr., won a 1949 Tony Award for the play How Long Till Summer). At various times in the 1950s and 1960s, White's daughters Beverly, Fern, and Judy also performed, recorded and appeared on radio and television with him. In 1964, when new anti-segregationist legislation made it easier for African Americans to purchase real estate in previously all-white neighborhoods, White and his wife bought a duplex in the Rosedale, Queens section of New York City. His daughter Beverly and her family lived upstairs, and White and his wife couple lived downstairs. White lived in this semi-suburban home {{for the rest of his}} life. Carol White continued to live there and worked until she was in her 80s, first as manager of a clothing boutique manager and then as a social worker serving people in nursing homes, until her sudden death in 1998. One week before her fatal heart attack, she received final confirmation that the United States Postal Service would honor White in 1998 with a postage stamp. When shown a mock-up photograph of the stamp by White's estate manager, Douglas Yeager, she expressed joy, gratitude and a long-awaited satisfaction that <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> painful <b>years</b> of social isolation in the McCarthy era, White would be receiving this recognition. She felt that she could finally go in peace.|$|R
60|$|A {{matter of}} {{discovery}} {{and not of}} inheritance, that very inferiority of the title makes the faculty still more precious, lays the possessor under a lifelong obligation to remain worthy of his great fortune. But {{it seems to me}} that all this sounds as if I were trying to explain--a task which I have just pronounced to be impossible. If in action we may admit with awe that the Impossible recedes before men's indomitable spirit, the Impossible in matters of analysis will always make a stand at some point or other. All I can claim <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> of devoted practice, with the accumulated anguish of its doubts, imperfections and falterings in my heart, is the right to be believed when I say that if I had not written in English I would not have written at all.|$|E

Then, as I was headed off from our camp, I galloped away anywhere, still to save my miserable life from those savages, so {{strongly}} is the instinct of self-preservation implanted in us. From a distance I looked back and saw {{by the light of}} the fired tents that the Fung were attacking the Arabs with whom I had travelled, I suppose because they thought them parties to the sacrilege.

I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at {{the other side of the}} road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.

Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding." ...|$|E
