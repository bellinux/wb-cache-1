5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} galaxies that lie near it. M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf spheroidal galaxy or simply a generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|According to Tanaka, the Beach Boys were {{repeatedly}} referenced {{between him}} and Suzuki, {{and that he would}} often listen to co-founder Brian Wilson's 1988 eponymous album while on the way to Suzuki's home. Suzuki has stated that the percussive arranging in the game's soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums Smile (unreleased) and Smiley Smile (1967), which both contained American themes shared with Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle (1968). To Suzuki, Smile evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while Song Cycle displayed <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> sound mixed with American humor and hints of Ray Bradbury, a style which he considered essential to the soundtrack of Mother. Tanaka recalls Randy Newman being the first quintessentially American composer he could think of, and that his albums Little Criminals (1977) and Land of Dreams (1988) were influential. While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for Harry Nilsson's Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), he also cited John Lennon as a strong influence due to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game, and that his album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970) helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over the SNES's technical constraints.|$|E
25|$|Diffraction grating {{effects are}} {{sometimes}} seen in meteorology. Diffraction coronas are colorful rings surrounding {{a source of}} light, such as the sun. These are usually observed {{much closer to the}} light source than halos, and are caused by very fine particles, like water droplets, ice crystals, or smoke particles in <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> sky. When the particles are all nearly the same size they diffract the incoming light at very specific angles. The exact angle depends {{on the size of the}} particles. Diffraction coronas are commonly observed around light sources, like candle flames or street lights, in the fog. Cloud iridescence is caused by diffraction, occurring along coronal rings when the particles in the clouds are all uniform in size.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Milky Way" [...] {{can be seen}} as <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> band {{of white}} light some 30 degrees wide arcing across the sky. Although all the {{individual}} naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way, the light in this band originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located {{in the direction of the}} galactic plane. Dark regions within the band, such as the Great Rift and the Coalsack, are areas where light from distant stars is blocked by interstellar dust. The area of the sky obscured by the Milky Way is called the Zone of Avoidance.|$|E
500|$|Dykstra and Apogee created {{three models}} {{to stand in}} for the Epsilon 9 station. A [...] model was used for {{distance}} shots, while an isolated [...] panel was used for closer shots. The station control tower was replicated with rear-projection screens to add the people inside. A 2ft model spaceman created for the shot {{was used in the}} drydock sequence and Spock's spacewalk. Unique destruction effects for the station had to be discarded due to time constraints. V'Ger itself was filmed in <b>a</b> <b>hazy,</b> smoky room, in part to convey depth and also to hide the parts of the ship still under construction. The multiple passes were largely based on guesswork, as every single available camera was in use and the effects had to be generated without the aid of a bluescreen.|$|E

500|$|... "Sweet Thing" [...] is {{the only}} song on the album to look forward instead of backward. In the words of The AllMusic reviewer: [...] "Over the {{endlessly}} descending, circular progression, Morrison sings positive lyrics about nature and a romantic partner, seemingly beginning {{in the middle of}} a thought: 'And I will stroll the merry way.'" [...] Paul Du Noyer wrote, [...] "Sweet Thing puts the singer in <b>a</b> <b>hazy,</b> pastoral paradise where he wanders in 'gardens wet with rain', or counts the stars in his lover's eyes, and vows to 'never grow so old again' or 'read between the lines'. He pleads with his mind to keep quiet, so his heart can hear itself think. He yearns to obliterate experience and rediscover innocence." [...] It has been a more popular cover song than any of the others on the album and {{is the only}} Astral Weeks song that has been included in any of Morrison's compilation albums.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{stressed}} that {{a knowledge of}} Macbeth was not necessary to enjoy the episode. [...] "Knowing the text", suggested Jack Seale of Radio Times, [...] "will take you only halfway and, in any case, the clever plot is really just a vehicle for characters sketched fully {{in only a few}} lines, and a torrent of fruity luvvie gags about jealousy, superstition and stage-hogging hams." [...] Dessau agreed, saying that [...] "ou don't need to be a literary scholar to get the gags". Critic Jane Simon, writing in the Daily Mirror, suggested that [...] "even <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> knowledge of the Scottish play will tip you the wink what might lie ahead". David Chater in The Times and an anonymous reviewer in the Sunday Herald both praised the plot's divergence from Shakespeare, with the latter saying that [...] "the script cleverly offers parallels with The Scottish Play, just to whip them away again". Dessau felt that the complex plot meant that the guest stars did [...] "not get quite as much screen time as they deserve", but that this was no complaint, as it was [...] "very much Pemberton and Shearsmith's instalment and they are both brilliant".|$|E
500|$|Peggy and Archie's {{wedding was}} filmed on {{location}} in North London in January 2009 and was screened on 2 April 2009 that year in an hour-long special. To promote the storyline, EastEnders screened a trailer showing Peggy being assembled in her wedding outfit by a robot, which symbolised Archie's control of her. Realising {{the extent to which}} Archie had been controlling and trying to change her throughout their engagement, Peggy gave him an ultimatum at the altar: he either accept the real her, or call the wedding off. Archie chose to marry her, though Tim Teeman for The Times commented: [...] "'he real Peggy' is <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> concept: there’s Peggy the big-hearted East End landlady and Peggy the crone famous for rasping 'Get ahht my pub' to anyone who crosses her path. For someone into evil mind control, Archie has brilliant taste. The wedding outfit he had chosen for Peggy was much nicer than the tatty net curtains that even Miss Havisham would have rejected that the 'real Peggy' chose to marry in." [...] Peggy and Archie's wedding was watched by 10.6 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 48% audience share. A further 1.2 million viewers watched the episode's repeat on BBC Three at 10pm. However, the marriage lasts only as long as the reception; when Peggy realises Archie has been manipulating other members of his family, Peggy throws him out and a feud ignites between Archie and the Mitchell clan.|$|E

500|$|The {{constellation}} of Andromeda lies {{well away from}} the galactic plane, so it does not contain any of the open clusters or bright nebulae of the Milky Way. Because of its distance in the sky from the band of obscuring dust, gas, and abundant stars of our home galaxy, Andromeda's borders contain many visible distant galaxies. The most famous deep-sky object in Andromeda is the spiral galaxy cataloged as Messier 31 (M31) or NGC 224 but known colloquially as the Andromeda Galaxy [...] for the constellation. M31 {{is one of the most}} distant objects visible to the naked eye, 2.2million light-years from Earth (estimates range up to 2.5 million light-years); it is seen under a dark, transparent sky as <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> patch in the north of the constellation. M31 is the largest neighboring galaxy to the Milky Way and the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies. In absolute terms, M31 is approximately 200,000 light-years in diameter, twice the size of the Milky Way. It is an enormous– 192.4 by 62.2 arcminutes in apparent size– barred spiral galaxy similar in form to the Milky Way and at an approximate magnitude of 3.5, is one of the brightest deep-sky objects in the northern sky. Despite being visible to the naked eye, the [...] "little cloud" [...] near Andromeda's figure was not recorded until AD 964, when the Arab astronomer al-Sufi wrote his Book of Fixed Stars. M31 was first observed telescopically shortly after its invention, by Simon Marius in 1612.|$|E
500|$|Stay Trippy {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 66, based on 10 reviews. Al Shipley of the Baltimore City Paper gave the album a positive review, saying [...] "Stay Trippy winds up {{as something of}} a triumph, one of the year's most thoroughly enjoyable major label albums." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "Fans will need four or five hands to count all the other laugh-out-loud punch lines, and even if this album is redundant and overstuffed with hedonism and recklessness, that's just Juicy being Juicy." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect stated, [...] "Stay Trippy is as wild as modern hip-hop gets. It's a slick, seductive, and stone romp through <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> synth boom, strip club-ready beats, and some of Juicy J's tightest rapping to date." [...] Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe gave the album a positive review, saying [...] "Despite the wild assortment of flows and flavors, Juicy J manages to avoid being eclipsed on his own project. Their presence only amplifies the quality of his offering, a hypothesis that is reinforced by three of the album's standout pieces." [...] B.J. Steiner of XXL said, [...] "Stay Trippy is a record that knows to stay within the lane that it's carved for itself. Big-budget stripper rap has rarely sounded so fresh." [...] Nick Henderson of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "On Stay Trippy, Juicy J sounds as energized, self-assured, and dangerous as ever." [...] Patrick Taylor of RapReviews.com stated, [...] "Even if Juicy J's brand of explicit hip-hop isn't your cup of syrup, you have to admire the man for staying relevant and good as he nears his third decade in the game." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a {{prototype}} for automatically measuring the atmospheric visibility using {{a digital camera}} is described. The dark object approach is used on the images obtained by the camera. In this method, two dark objects must first be identified in the images so that visibility can be derived using the modified Koschmieder formula. Due to inherent camera positioning shifts, the images are not always aligned which leads to an altered position of the chosen objects. Therefore, image registration algorithms are needed so that the atmospheric visibility can be automatically retrieved. The dark object approach and the image registration algorithms are described. Results for a clear day and for <b>an</b> <b>hazy</b> day are presented...|$|R

[...] That the glow originates from innumerable faint stars and other materials which lie within the galactic plane was one of Galileo's early telescopic discoveries. Similarly, the Magellanic Clouds are not asterisms, but galaxies in their own right.|$|E
2500|$|The Three Philosophers {{is equally}} enigmatic and its {{attribution}} to Giorgione is still disputed. [...] The three figures stand near a dark empty cave. Sometimes interpreted {{as symbols of}} Plato's cave or the Three Magi, they seem lost in a typical Giorgionesque dreamy mood, reinforced by <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> light characteristic of his other landscapes, such as the Pastoral Concert, now in the Louvre. The latter [...] "reveals the Venetians' love of textures", because the painter [...] "renders almost palpable the appearance of flesh, fabric, wood, stone, and foliage". The painting is devoid of harsh contours and its treatment of landscape has been frequently compared to pastoral poetry, hence the title.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} {{hours of the}} Somme Offensive, Rees was on patrol, taking off in Airco DH.2 No. 6015 at 0555 hours. His attempt to join a {{formation}} of [...] "British" [...] machines brought an attack {{from one of the}} Germans. He shot up the attacker, hitting its fuselage between the two aircrew. As it dived away, Rees attacked a Roland. Long range fire from three other Germans did not discourage Rees from closing on it; it emitted <b>a</b> <b>hazy</b> cloud of smoke from its engine from the 30 rounds Rees fired into it and it fled. Rees then single handedly went after five more Germans. A bullet in the thigh paralysed his leg, forcing him to temporarily break off his assault. As the shock of the wound wore off, he was able to pursue the German formation leader, which was leaving after dropping its bomb. He fired his Lewis machine gun empty. In frustration, he drew his pistol but dropped it into his DH.2's nacelle. Meanwhile, the German two-seater pulled away above him. The German formation was shattered and scattered.|$|E
