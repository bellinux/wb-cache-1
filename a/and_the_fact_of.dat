5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E

Finally, in 1881, it determined to tear down the old house where it had so long met, on Harvard street and build a new structure its site. The new structure is of brick, handsomely trimmed in stone, and rises to the height of four stories, with about seventy or eighty feet of frontage on Harvard street. Two large stores claim a part of the ground floor, but they do not encroach on the broad and handsome entrance to the club's apartments.|$|E

500|$|It is at {{this time}} that the Israeli {{officers}} in the field appreciated the strategic importance of Latrun. A report was sent from OC Harel brigade to OC Palmach that concluded that [...] "The Latrun junction became the main point in the battle [...] " [...] , but [...] "that appreciation was not shared by the staff one week previously". Meanwhile, because of the Egyptian Army's advance, the Givati brigade got an order to redeploy on a more southern front, and the Harel brigade to remain in the Jerusalem sector. This decision to leave the area, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> not planning for its strategic importance, would later be a source of controversy between Haganah chief of operations Yigael Yadin and Yitzhak Rabin, commander of the Harel brigade.|$|E
500|$|Orthodox Hindus, {{especially}} Hindu wives, {{remember the}} panchakanya, the five virgins or maidens, in this daily morning prayer.

500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision.

It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, literary critic David Rannie praised the poems as a whole: [...] "that strange little lovely group, which breathe a passion unfamiliar to Wordsworth, and about which he—so ready to talk about the genesis of his poems—has told us nothing [...] Let a poet keep some of his secrets: we need not grudge him the privacy when the poetry is as beautiful as this; when there is such celebration of girlhood, love, and death [...] The poet's sense of loss is sublime in its utter simplicity. He finds harmony rather than harshness in the contrast between the illusion of love <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> death." [...] Later critics focused on the importance of the poems to Wordsworth's poetic technique. Durrant argued that [...] "The four 'Lucy' poems which appeared in the 1800 edition of Lyrical Ballads are worth careful attention, because they represent the clearest examples of the success of Wordsworth's experiment." [...] Alan Grob (1932–2007) focused less on the unity that the poems represent and believed that [...] "the principal importance of the 'Matthew' and 'Lucy' poems, apart from their intrinsic achievement, substantial as that is, is in suggesting the presence of seeds of discontent even in a period of seemingly assured faith that makes the sequence of developments in the history of Wordsworth's thought a more orderly, evolving pattern than the chronological leaps between stages would seem to imply." ...|$|E

Leila Cobo Hanlon from Miami Herald was positive, saying that the album [...] "retains Shakira's trademark sound — rock-laced pop melodies backed by acoustic guitars — as well as her deeply personal approach to music-making", but also noting that [...] "ironically, the album's only failures occur when it looks too closely at its predecessor". Sputnikmusic website gave a positive review saying [...] "¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? is the gem of Shakira's discography, {{and one of the best}} Spanish pop releases of the past decade", although criticized its [...] "slight lack of variety". Franz Reynold from Latin Beat Magazine noted that [...] "while many of the cuts on this collection are definitely chart-bound, that is due more to the fact that she doesn't stray too far from the previous formula, than it does to any hope that success provides room for expansion", but complimented tracks like [...] "Inevitable" [...] and [...] "Tú". Rubens Herbst from Brazilian newspaper [...] gave a mixed review, writing that the album was [...] "homogenous, well-produced and full of potential hits", but [...] "empty and forgettable, like every FM pop — <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> singing in Spanish doesn't take Shakira away from the label". In July 2017, the album ranked at number 95 on the list for the 150 greatest female albums of all time by the National Public Radio.|$|E

2500|$|The {{constitutional}} {{division of}} competencies between provincial {{governments and the}} central government, guaranteeing {{the autonomy of the}} former, which could not be unilaterally revoked by the central government; the capacity of the provincial governments to make decisions autonomously about matters relative to taxation, the police force, public works, jobs, etc.; the constant negotiation between provinces and the center in parliament to reduce tensions and confrontations between divergent interpretations about the sphere of the competence of each; the attribution of the central government to respond to national unity, provided the tools necessary for both; and its coexistence with autonomous provincial governments, which accounted for strategic regional issues, were federalist factors that prevailed in nineteenth century Brazil.
