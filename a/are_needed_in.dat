5|$|High thorium {{concentrations}} <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> nuclear applications; particularly, {{concentrations of}} atoms with high neutron capture cross-sections {{must be very}} low (for example, gadolinium concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective complexation of Th4+ is used. For example, following alkaline digestion {{and the removal of}} phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with tributyl phosphate in kerosene.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins {{are essential}} parts of organisms {{and participate in}} virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down {{for use in the}} metabolism.|$|E

25|$|A {{hospital}} is {{a health care}} establishment that provides inpatient care and specialized (and other) care, providing such services as <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> its geographical area.

25|$|The {{health effects}} of salt are the {{conditions}} associated with the consumption of either {{too much or too}} little salt. Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl) and is used in food for both preservation and flavor. Sodium ions <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>in</b> small quantities by most living things, as are chloride ions. Salt is involved in regulating the water content (fluid balance) of the body. The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The CCSPS {{heart attack}} and {{cardiovascular}} death outcomes appear {{to be better than}} what has been reported for prescription statin drugs.
