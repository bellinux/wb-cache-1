5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. There is a clear pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 19, accompanied with spiral bands of convection around an area of low pressure. A large circulation quickly developed once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Four late on August 19 while located 345mi (555km) southeast of Cape Verde. Initial forecasts predicted for great intensification, including one forecast for the depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days. However, the depression remained disorganized, <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> intensified to attain tropical storm status on August 22.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities.|$|E

5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|Alibera quickly intensified, {{attaining}} {{tropical cyclone}} status on December20 while southwest of Agaléga. Although the MFR estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph) that day, the JTWC assessed that {{the storm was}} vastly stronger, estimating peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). This is equivalent to a super typhoon, which made Alibera tied for the strongest cyclone in the southern hemisphere that season, along with Cyclone Alex in the Australian basin. On December21, Alibera turned sharply to the south <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> weakened. On the next day, the storm curved to an eastward drift as a downgraded severe tropical storm, its path influenced by ridges {{to the east and}} west. It maintained its intensity for the next several days, turning back to the south on December24 <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> recurving to the west. However, the movement was erratic, and the storm executed four small loops. Although the MFR had forecasting difficulties during this time, the storm remained far enough {{to the north of the}} Mascarene Islands to limit rainfall warnings.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} became {{increasingly}} congested further {{means of transportation}} were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, were replaced by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse The trolley cars {{did not last long}} as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> made the trolley system seem like a burden.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|Domoina {{developed}} on January16 off the northeast coast of Madagascar. With a ridge to the north, the storm tracked generally westward and later southwestward. On January21, Domoina struck eastern Madagascar. After crossing the country, Domoina strengthened in the Mozambique channel to peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). On January28, the storm made landfall in southern Mozambique, <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> weakened over land. Domoina crossed into Swaziland and later eastern South Africa before dissipating on February2.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese raid on Ceylon of March–April 1942, the Eastern Fleet was {{transferred}} from its base at Trincomalee, {{to the other}} side of the Indian Ocean: Kilindi in Kenya. From there the fleet undertook local patrols, escorted convoys and occasionally despatched ships to operations in the Mediterranean. During Operation Vigorous, a convoy to Malta in June 1942, Nestor was serious damaged in an air raid <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> sank.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, the {{demobilisation}} process began <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> the battalion's numbers {{began to}} dwindle as its personnel were repatriated back to Australia and returned to civilian life. The 23rd Battalion was disbanded in Belgium on 30 April 1919. Throughout its service during the war, it suffered 686 killed and 2,317 wounded (including gassed). For its involvement during the war, the 23rd Battalion received a total of 19 battle honours; these were bestowed upon the battalion in 1927.|$|E
5|$|HMS Gipsy was a G-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She {{spent most of the}} pre-war period as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. The ship was transferred to the British Isles to escort shipping in local waters shortly after the beginning of World War II. Less than a month after her arrival she struck a mine outside Harwich and sank with the loss of 30 of her crew. Her wreck was salvaged <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> scrapped {{over the course of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emmy was the longest-lived {{hurricane}} of the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth {{tropical cyclone}} {{and the third}} hurricane of the season, Emmy developed from a tropical wave on August 20 {{to the east of}} the Lesser Antilles. After changing its direction three times over several days, during which it reached a peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h), it turned to the east <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> weakened. Emmy passed through the Azores on September 3, and a day later it was absorbed by approaching Hurricane Frances.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Trotsky and his {{supporters}} believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which {{was intended to be}} a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters within the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.|$|E
5|$|On September28, {{a system}} {{developed}} into a tropical depression, simultaneously with Tropical Storm Monica.. It headed generally westward and on September29, 18 hours after Monica did it, strengthened into a tropical storm. Nanette continued out to sea <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> strengthened. It peaked in windspeed of 50mph (85km/h) on October3 {{and turned to the}} southwest. It then slowly weakened. On October4, it weakened into a tropical depression and then degenerated into a disturbance that same day. No damage or deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|On {{level ground}} again, {{they began to}} make quick progress. They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> make the treacherous descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} glacier they spent four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E

5|$|She was reconstructed between 1931 and 1934 {{with new}} boilers, fire-control systems and greatly {{enlarged}} superstructures. During the Winter War she bombarded Finnish coastal artillery positions one time. Her anti-aircraft armament was greatly reinforced in early 1941, just before Operation Barbarossa. She provided gunfire support against the Germans during the Siege of Leningrad despite being bombed {{three times and}} under repair for a year. Retained on active duty after the war she became a training ship in 1954 before being struck off the Navy List in 1956 <b>and</b> <b>slowly</b> scrapped.|$|E
