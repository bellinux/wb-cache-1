50|$|An {{important}} part of most SCADA implementations is alarm handling. The system monitors whether certain alarm conditions are satisfied, to determine when an <b>alarm</b> <b>event</b> has occurred. Once an <b>alarm</b> <b>event</b> has been detected, one or more actions are taken (such as the activation {{of one or more}} alarm indicators, and perhaps the generation of email or text messages so that management or remote SCADA operators are informed). In many cases, a SCADA operator may have to acknowledge the alarm event; this may deactivate some alarm indicators, whereas other indicators remain active until the alarm conditions are cleared.|$|E

50|$|For added {{security}} centralized {{storage is}} frequently used to record alarm video for easy alarm verification and long-term secure storage. Pre-alarm recording {{is offered by}} introducing a buffer in the encoder so that the seconds or minutes of video before and after an alarm can be automatically transmitted to the centralized storage. Because of the huge edge storage capacities of some encoders, ranging from 256 MB to 800 GB, you can continuously record video at high frame rates and high resolutions, and still take advantage of pre-alarm recording. For instance, if you continuously transmit a 1 Mbit/s stream (30 IPS at 4 CIF) to a central recorder in the anticipation that an <b>alarm</b> <b>event</b> will occur, you will consume 1 Mbit/s of network bandwidth, or send about 11 Gigabytes of video data. If, however, you use recording at the edge, and use pre-alarm recording configured to 5 seconds pre- and 10 seconds post-alarm, then assuming 20 alarms per day you will transmit a much lower total of around 40 Megabytes of video. The same 11 GB will still be recorded locally but only 40 MB, or 0.4% of it, will touch the network.|$|E

30|$|The AVSS 2007 dataset {{contains}} {{three cases}} with different difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. The easy case contains objects with larger appearance, activities {{closer to the}} camera and less scene clutter; as the difficulty level raises, objects shrink and clutter increases. The proposed approach successfully detects the abandoned luggage in all three cases. The owner in the easy case is tracked continuously until leaving the scene without his luggage, triggering an <b>alarm</b> <b>event.</b> In the medium and hard cases, the owners pass behind a large pillar before leaving the scene without their luggage, and both are occluded for about 1.5 [*]seconds. The proposed tracking engine is unable to follow the owner through the occlusion, and thus the owner is deemed lost; therefore alarms are also triggered in these two cases.|$|E

The event is verified by the detection of a corresponding indication during the same period within the flow waveform of the circulatory assist system. The appropriate alarm (for the right or left chamber) is updated each time a full-fill event is verified.

40|$|Devices in energy-limited {{wireless}} sensor networks {{remain in}} a low-communication `sleep' mode until an <b>alarm</b> <b>event</b> is detected. It has been proposed to use `censoring sensors' to reduce {{the probability that a}} sensor must transmit in this mode, thereby minimizing energy consumption when alarm events are not occurring, and lengthening sensor lifetime. Further, since devices in multi-hop networks are not usually in single-hop range of a fusion center, hierarchical distributed detection can lead to further energy efficiency. We report on a system that applies censoring in a hierarchical network to the CUSUM test of Page and Lorden, an online abrupt change detector.

40|$|Today video {{surveillance}} systems {{are widely used}} in public spaces, such as train stations or airports, to enhance security. In order to observe large and complex facilities {{a huge amount of}} cameras is required. These create a massive amount of data to be analyzed. It is therefore crucial to support human security staff with automatic surveillance applications, which will create an alert if security relevant events are detected. This way {{video surveillance}} could be used to prevent potentially dangerous situations, instead of just being used as forensic instrument, to analyze an event after it happened. In this treatise we present a surveillance system which supports human operators, by automatically detecting abandoned objects and loitering people. Two major parts have been implemented: a multi-camera tracking algorithm based on homographic transformation and the subsequent analysis of the observed object trajectories. An <b>alarm</b> <b>event</b> is triggered if an object is abandoned for 25 seconds or a person is staying in the view for more than 60 s. 1...|$|E
40|$|Develop {{predictable}} rule-based applications Event-triggered real-time {{systems are}} responding to occurrences in its monitored environment and {{may be required to}} handle a large amount of data within a predictable time-frame. Such systems can be implemented as event condition action (ECA) rules using an active real-time database system (ARTDBS). In the ECA rule paradigm, actions are executed as a response to an event occurrence if a specified condition is true. However, systems implemented as ECA rules are known to be hard to analyze with respect to correctness and timeliness, which is not conducive to the high predictability requirements of a real-time system. The behavioral complexity of a rule set is further increased if composite events are supported. A composite event is an event that is raised by the occurrence of a specified combination of other events; it may e. g. be desirable to raise an <b>alarm</b> <b>event</b> in an application, monitoring pressure and temperature in a tank, if both an event high pressure and another event high temperatur...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the wide}} use of video {{surveillance}} systems has caused an enormous {{increase in the}} amount of data that has to be stored, monitored, and processed. As a consequence, it is crucial to support human operators with automated surveillance applications. Towards this end an intelligent video analysis module for real-time alerting in case of abandoned objects in public spaces is proposed. The overall processing pipeline consists of two major parts. First, person motion is modeled using an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filter. The IMM filter estimates the state of a person according to a finite-state, discrete-time Markov chain. Second, the location of persons that stay at a fixed position defines a region of interest, in which a nonparametric background model with dynamic per-pixel state variables identifies abandoned objects. In case of a detected abandoned object, an <b>alarm</b> <b>event</b> is triggered. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated on the PETS 2006 dataset and the i-Lids dataset, both reflecting prototypical surveillance scenarios...|$|E
