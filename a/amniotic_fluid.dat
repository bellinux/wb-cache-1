5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
40|$|An {{immunoassay}} {{based on}} a monoclonal antibody specific for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was used prospectively over a two year period to screen second trimester <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> for fetal abnormalities.

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies of}} in utero-infection {{with the human}} {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) were focused on HCMV-seropositive women. Here, we assessed the clinical relevance of HCMV infection in normal pregnancies. In a prospective cohort study, <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> from 403 pregnant women undergoing amniocentesis for non-virological reasons were tested for HCMV DNA (nested PCR analysis of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids),</b> and sera of mothers and their neonates for IgG and IgM anti-bodies against HCMV (ELISA). Clinical data were obtained through questionnaires {{at the time of}} amniocentesis and at delivery. HCMV DNA was found in 3 % of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids,</b> and was associated with an increased occurrence of preterm delivery, reduced birth weight, premature labor and preeclampsia. The seroprevalence of HCMV-specific IgG in maternal and newborn sera was about 40 %, IgM was very rarely found in mothers, and in none of the neonates. Serological results were not associated with pregnancy complications. Hence, in utero HCMV infection is rare in normal pregnancies but might have consequences for the course of pregnancy...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

25|$|Olfactory cues are {{widespread}} within {{parental care}} {{to assist in}} the dynamic of the mother-infant relationship, and later development of the offspring. In support of fetal olfactory learning, newborn infants display behavioral attraction to the odor of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid.</b> For example, babies would more often suck from a breast treated with an amount of their own <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid,</b> rather than the alternative untreated breast. Newborns are initially attracted to their own <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> because that odor is familiar. Although exposure to <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> is eliminated after birth, breast fed babies have continued contact with cues from the mother’s nipple and areola area. This causes breast odors to become more familiar and attractive, while <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> loses its positive value.

40|$|Summary. Conceptus (placental membranes, fetal {{fluids and}} fetus) {{development}} was characterized between Days 27 and 111 of gestation. Progestagens, oestrone, oestradiol, oestrone sulphate and prostaglandins (PG) F were measured in maternal plasma and allantoic and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids.</b> Protein concentrations are described for fetal fluids. The early increase in placental membrane weight from 1 =. 2 g (27 days) to 58 =. 5 g (50 days) {{was associated with}} oestrogen production presumably of con-ceptus origin. Oestrogens increased significantly in allantoic and <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids</b> throughout the period studied with oestrone being the primary free oestrogen, rising from 2 pg/ml (Day 33) to 144 ng/ml by 111 days in allantoic fluid. Changes in plasma oestrogens of the maternal circulation were not detected until after Day 70 at which time oestrone concentration was {{greater than that of}} oestradiol. Fetal fluid concentrations of progestagens, oestrone sulphate and PGF were not related to maternal plasma levels and a sequestration of these hormones by the allantois is postulated...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of congenital syphilis continues {{to pose a}} difficult clinical challenge. Because the sero{{diagnosis of}} congenital syphilis has significant limitations, the direct detection of Treponema pallidum in suspect neonatal tissues or body fluids represents a desirable alternate diagnostic strategy. We developed and applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{for the detection of}} T. pallidum in clinical material relevant to the diagnosis of congenital syphilis but which typically contain factors inhibitory for the PCR. Four methods of specimen processing were examined to circumvent PCR inhibition; clinical materials included <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids,</b> neonatal sera, and neonatal cerebrospinal fluids. The PCR was 100 % specific for T. T. pallidum compared with the sensitive rabbit infectivity test (RIT) for all clinical materials tested. For <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluids,</b> the PCR was 100 % sensitive when correlated with the RIT but had a lesser sensitivity when applied to sera or cerebrospinal fluids, which typically contain few treponemes. The combined sensitivity of the PCR for all clinical samples was 78 %. Positive PCR results also were obtained among some clinical specimens for which RIT was not performed; these results correlated well with either stigmata or risk factors for congenital syphilis. The combined results suggest that the PCR can be a useful adjunct to the diagnosis and clinical management of congenital syphilis and that it will provide a valuable tool for investigations of the pathogenesis of the disorder...|$|R

25|$|Development of {{the mature}} kidney begins between weeks 5 and 7 of gestation. Fetal urine {{production}} begins in early gestation and comprises {{the majority of}} the <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> {{in the second and third}} trimesters of pregnancy. The fetus continuously swallows <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid,</b> which is reabsorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and then reintroduced into the amniotic cavity by the kidneys via urination. Oligohydramnios occurs if the volume of <b>amniotic</b> <b>fluid</b> is less than normal for the corresponding period of gestation. The fetal urine is critical to the proper development of the lungs by aiding in the expansion of the airways - alveoli, by means of hydrodynamic pressure and by also supplying proline which is a critical amino acid for lung development. Alveoli are the small sacs in the lungs that exchange oxygen with the blood. If the alveoli, and thereby the lungs, are underdeveloped at the time of birth the infant will not be able to breathe air properly and will go into respiratory distress shortly after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs). This is the primary cause of death to Potter sequence infants secondary to renal failure. The fetal urine also serves to cushion the fetus from being compressed by the mother's uterus as it grows.|$|E
