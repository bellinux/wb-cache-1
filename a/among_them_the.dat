5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, <b>among</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E

5|$|At {{this early}} stage, the term punk {{applied to the}} scene in general, not {{necessarily}} a particular stylistic approach as it would later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. <b>Among</b> <b>them,</b> <b>the</b> Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.|$|E
