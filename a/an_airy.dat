5|$|Portrait of a Young Girl {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus. It was completed {{towards the end of}} his life, between 1465 and 1470, and is held in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture; the girl is set in <b>an</b> <b>airy,</b> three-dimensional, realistic setting, and stares out at the viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved, yet intelligent and alert.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and {{laborious}} study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and <b>an</b> <b>airy</b> atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E

The Accueil is {{organised}} into two wings, each consisting of six storeys, with the Reception area on the ground floor and the Transit Lounge on the fifth. Each floor from one to four is named after a specific saint, with female saints honoured on one side and male ones on the other. Each floor has a central refectory area where pilgrims congregate to eat.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{set of the}} Charenton (asylum) in Quills {{was built}} at Pinewood Studios, {{where most of the}} filming took place. Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire, and London stood in for the exterior shots of early 19th century France. Oscar-winning production designer Martin Childs (Shakespeare in Love) imagined the primary location of Charenton as <b>an</b> <b>airy,</b> though circuitous place, darkening as Royer-Collard takes over operations. The screenplay specifies the way the inmates' rooms link together, which {{plays a key role in}} the relay of the Marquis' climactic story to Madeleine. Screenwriter/playwright Doug Wright was a constant presence on set, assisting the actors and producers in interpreting the script and bringing his vision to life.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{velocity}} and thus the frequency of a signal pulse can be adjusted {{by the use of}} <b>a</b> control <b>Airy</b> pulse. In particular, we utilize <b>a</b> nonlinear <b>Airy</b> pulse which, via cross-phase modulation, creates an effective potential for the optical signal. Interestingly, during the interaction, the signal dispersion is suppressed. Importantly, the whole process is controllable and by using Airy pulses with different truncations leads to predetermined values of the frequency shifting. Such a functionality might be useful in wavelength division multiplexing networks...|$|R

To {{the north of the}} Edge is a sharp descent into the head of Little Dale, part of the Newlands catchment. This valley runs north east, flanked by parallel ridges descending from Robinson and Hindscarth, its stream being named Scope Beck. Robinson’s north east ridge is rough and craggy towards the top before levelling out onto the grassy spur of High Snab Bank. This finally runs down to Newlands Church and the hamlet of Little Town. Beneath the nose of the ridge is the confluence of Scope Beck and Keskadale Beck.|$|E
25|$|Interior design {{improvements}} {{were another}} {{main focus of}} the LRX concept though {{the interior of the}} production Evoque changed significantly from the concept LRX. Notable interior features in the LRX included ambient interior lighting that changed according to Terrain Response settings, and vehicle data which was presented to the driver through a ‘floating’ three-dimensional LCD display. An aluminium centre console with an iPhone docking station stretched the length of the cabin, separating the four seats and the tailgate. Seats with open frameworks were used to give the impression of <b>an</b> <b>airy</b> interior while also creating useful under-seat and under-floor stowage areas. Electric motors folded the rear seats forward providing enough room for two mountain bikes to be fitted upright, with front wheels removed and stored in dedicated slots in the floor.|$|E

Rolling Stone magazine described the track as [...] "the closest Reznor has ever come to disco, right down to a splashing high-hat, boosted way up in the mix". Eric Harvey of Pitchfork also compared the song to disco, saying that the song [...] "eschews a typically monstrous chorus for an airtight industrial disco grind ventilated by <b>an</b> <b>airy</b> piano and falsetto cooing." ...|$|E

Patrons of the latter café have access to a rooftop patio area as well as the [...] "Halifax Living Room" [...] housed in the cantilevered portion of the building overlooking Spring Garden Road. The Living Room was designed as <b>an</b> <b>airy,</b> indoor public space with views of both Citadel Hill and Halifax Harbour as well as the civic square below. The ground floor café, {{in the corner of the}} building nearest the intersection, opens earlier than the rest of the library. The concession to operate from both spaces was won by Pavia Gallery Espresso Bar and Café of Herring Cove, who beat out Second Cup and Uncommon Grounds. Pavia holds a ten-year contract with an option for an additional seven years.|$|E

[...] Billboard reviewer Ken Tucker stated that it [...] "is <b>an</b> <b>airy</b> and flowing song about family on which father and daughter's voices blend nicely".

Waugh promptly resigned his position at Arnold House, in anticipation of [...] "a year abroad drinking Chianti under olive trees." [...] Then came Acton's [...] "polite but chilling" [...] response to The Temple at Thatch. This letter has not survived; its wording was recalled by Waugh 40 years later, in his biography A Little Learning. Acton wrote that the story was [...] "too English for my exotic taste ... too much nid-nodding over port." [...] He recommended, facetiously, that the book be printed [...] "in a few elegant copies for the friends who love you", and gave a list of the least elegant of their mutual acquaintances. Many years later Acton wrote of the story: [...] "It was <b>an</b> <b>airy</b> Firbankian trifle, totally unworthy of Evelyn, and I brutally told him so. It was a misfired jeu d'esprit.|$|E

It is the latter that contains the spores and later stinks and attracts the flies; within this layer is a green layer which will become the 'head' of the expanded fruit body; and inside this is a white structure called the receptaculum (the stalk when expanded), that is hard, but has <b>an</b> <b>airy</b> structure like a sponge. The eggs become fully grown stinkhorns very rapidly, over a day or two. The mature stinkhorn is [...] tall and [...] in diameter, topped with a conical cap [...] high that is covered with the greenish-brown slimy gleba. In older fungi the slime is eventually removed, exposing a bare yellowish pitted and ridged (reticulate) surface. This has a passing resemblance to the common morel (Morchella esculenta), with which it is sometimes mistaken. The rate of growth of Phallus impudicus has been measured at [...] per hour. The growing fruit body is able to exert up to 1.33kPa of pressure — a force sufficient to push up through asphalt. The spores have an elliptical to oblong shape, with dimensions of 3–5 to 1.5–2.5µm.|$|E

There is also a series of images of people using Windows XP for real-time communications, to collaborate in <b>an</b> <b>airy</b> restaurant, to relay digital images of flying people, watch videos and listen to music. Then, a snippet from the song follows the phrase: [...] "Faster than the speeding light she's flying... You soar. Yes you can". The campaign was reworked after the September 11 attacks; the tag line [...] "Prepare to fly" [...] was changed to [...] "Yes you can", to sidestep new concerns about air travel, said Stephanie Ferguson, director of the company's PC Experience Solutions Marketing Group. In 2008, a Sunsilk shampoo commercial included shots of Marilyn Monroe and Shakira with songs well known by them, and ends with several video shots of Madonna {{to the sounds of}} [...] "Ray of Light".
