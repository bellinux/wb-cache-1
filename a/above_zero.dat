The CCDC130 protein is rich in charged amino acids and deficient in uncharged, non-polar amino acids. Mobyle @ Pasteur predicted CCDC130 to be extremely hydrophilic due to {{the large numbers of}} charged and polar amino acids, with no site scoring <b>above</b> <b>zero</b> on the hydrophobicity graph and some sites reaching as low as -6 (F180). There is a region in the coiled coil domain (182-214) in which 14 of 18 amino acids are charged. SAPS analysis predicted that this protein would be unstable. Due to its high hydrophilicity, this protein definitely does not contain transmembrane segments.|$|E

Harbin Railway Bureau is the first Railway Bureau established by People's Republic of China Government, of which the railway density is the highest in China. Five conventional rail lines radiate from Harbin to: Beijing (Jingha Line), Suifenhe (Binsui Line), Manzhouli (Binzhou Line), Beian (Binbei Line) and Lalin (Labin Line). In addition, Harbin has a high-speed rail line linking Dalian, Northeast China's southernmost seaport. In 2009, construction began on the new Harbin West Railway Station with 18 platforms, located on the southwestern outskirts of the city. In December 2012, the station was opened, as China unveiled its first high-speed rail running through regions with extremely low winter temperatures. with scheduled runs from Harbin to Dalian.

2500|$|A {{chemical}} reaction will (or can) proceed spontaneously if {{the change in}} the total entropy of the universe that would be caused by the reaction is nonnegative. As discussed in the overview, if the temperature and pressure are held constant, the Gibbs free energy is a (negative) proxy for the change in total entropy of the universe. It is [...] "negative" [...] because S appears with a negative coefficient in the expression for G, so the Gibbs free energy moves in the opposite direction from the total entropy. Thus, a reaction with a positive Gibbs free energy will not proceed spontaneously. However, in biological systems (among others), energy inputs from other energy sources (including the Sun and exothermic {{chemical reaction}}s) are [...] "coupled" [...] with reactions that are not entropically favored (i.e. have a Gibbs free energy <b>above</b> <b>zero).</b> Taking into account the coupled reactions, the total entropy in the universe increases. This coupling allows endergonic reactions, such as photosynthesis and DNA synthesis, to proceed without decreasing the total entropy of the universe. Thus biological systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
2500|$|According to Schmidt and Hunter, [...] "for hiring {{employees}} without {{previous experience}} in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability." [...] The validity of IQ {{as a predictor of}} job performance is <b>above</b> <b>zero</b> for all work studied to date, but varies with the type of job and across different studies, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. The correlations were higher when the unreliability of measurement methods was controlled for. While IQ is more strongly correlated with reasoning and less so with motor function, IQ-test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations. That said, for highly qualified activities (research, management) low IQ scores {{are more likely to be}} a barrier to adequate performance, whereas for minimally-skilled activities, athletic strength (manual strength, speed, stamina, and coordination) are more likely to influence performance. The prevailing view among academics is that it is largely through the quicker acquisition of job-relevant knowledge that higher IQ mediates job performance. This view has been challenged by Byington & Felps (2010), who argued that [...] "the current applications of IQ-reflective tests allow individuals with high IQ scores to receive greater access to developmental resources, enabling them to acquire additional capabilities over time, and ultimately perform their jobs better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Estimates for the {{habitable}} zone {{within the}} Solar System range from 0.5 to 3.0 astronomical units, though arriving at these estimates has been challenging {{for a variety}} of reasons. Numerous planetary mass objects orbit within, or close to, this range and as such receive sufficient sunlight to raise temperatures above the freezing point of water. However their atmospheric conditions vary substantially. The aphelion of Venus, for example, touches the inner edge of the zone and while atmospheric pressure at the surface is sufficient for liquid water, a strong greenhouse effect raises surface temperatures to [...] at which water can only exist as vapour. The entire orbits of the Moon, Mars, and numerous asteroids also lie within various estimates of the habitable zone. Only at Mars' lowest elevations (less than 30% of the planet's surface) is atmospheric pressure and temperature sufficient for water to, if present, exist in liquid form for short periods. At Hellas Basin, for example, atmospheric pressures can reach 1,115 Pa and temperatures <b>above</b> <b>zero</b> Celsius (around the triple point for water) for 70 days in the Martian year. Despite indirect evidence in the form of seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes, no confirmation has been made of the presence of liquid water there. While other objects orbit partly within this zone, including comets, Ceres {{is the only one of}} planetary mass. A combination of low mass and an inability to mitigate evaporation and atmosphere loss against the solar wind make it impossible for these bodies to sustain liquid water on their surface. Most estimates, therefore, are inferred from the effect that a repositioned orbit would have on the habitability of Earth or Venus.|$|E
