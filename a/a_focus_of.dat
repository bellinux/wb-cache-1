40|$|Feedback which induces <b>an</b> {{external}} <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention, about movement effects, {{has been}} found to promote motor performance in healthy subjects. It is unknown whether this effect transfers to retraining reach-to-grasp after stroke. This thesis first explored the attentional <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> feedback used by therapists and adopted a mixed methods paradigm. Where feedback was used it predominantly induced <b>an</b> internal <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention, about body movements. The main experimental study compared feedback which induced either an internal or external <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention during the motor performance of reach to grasp after stroke. A counterbalanced design was used and reaching movements were recorded using motion analysis. Support was found for adopting <b>an</b> external <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention compared with <b>an</b> internal <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention, although <b>an</b> interaction between feedback type and order was also found. Finally, the influence of the level of arm and memory impairment on the feedback type was explored. Neither the level of arm or memory impairment was found to influence feedback type. This study highlights the complexities of providing feedback after stroke and suggests that adopting <b>an</b> external <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention may be beneficial to improving motor performance after stroke. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} <b>a</b> decade <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> {{attention}} {{studies have shown}} <b>an</b> external <b>focus</b> is superior for performance compared to <b>an</b> internal <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention. The constrained action hypothesis suggests this occurs because <b>an</b> external <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention allows movement to happen more autonomously compared to <b>an</b> internal <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention. The {{purpose of the current}} experiment was to investigate if the benefit <b>of</b> <b>an</b> external <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention would still exist when participants were asked to change their <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention mid-trial. Based on the constrained action hypothesis and the findings of previous research it was hypothesized that participants’ (N= 21) balance on a stabilometer would be superior when using <b>an</b> external <b>focus</b> (i. e., keep the markers level) compared to their balance on a stabilometer when using <b>an</b> internal <b>focus</b> (i. e., keep your feet level). Results did not reveal significant differences in RMSE of the external (M = 6. 73, SD = 1. 15) and internal (M = 6. 09, SD = 1. 16) attentional foci. These findings are not with the majority <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention research. Due to these findings it is suggested that practitioners avoid switching their verbal instructions mid-trial. Also future studies should consider using additional dependent variables (i. e. MPF) or conditions where participants do not switch <b>foci</b> mid-trial so <b>a</b> better understanding can be found in regard to the processes that are occurring when participants switch <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> attention mid-trial...|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this suburbanization significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made {{efforts to create}} new attractions, such as the Gateway Arch, which construction became <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> {{the civil rights movement}} to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E
5|$|Castle Wolfenstein, {{originally}} {{available on}} the Apple II in 1981, also employed stealth elements as <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the gameplay. Players were charged with traversing the levels of Castle Wolfenstein, stealing secret plans and escaping. Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves and walk by guards undetected. Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, released in 1984, included some additions to its predecessor, such as a dagger for close-range kills and {{a greater emphasis on}} disguising in enemy uniform. id Software's technically updated 1992 remake Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to feature some of the original's stealth gameplay, such as body hiding, but this was cut to make the game faster paced. This Wolfenstein game would ironically pave the way for quite a few later 3D action games, specifically first-person shooters.|$|E
