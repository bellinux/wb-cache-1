5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too ill {{to return}} to school, but by early 1985 {{he began to feel}} better. His mother asked if he could return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{recessed}} on August 28 for the Labor Day holiday, and did {{not come}} back into session until September 4. The same day, Governor Stanley conferred with Rep. Smith, Delegate Gray, and House Speaker Moore. Their discussion focused on the Stanley plan's lack of an appeals process for pupil assignments. Stanley agreed to a compromise that would allow an <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> (through an as-yet-to-be-worked-out process), followed by a required appeal to state courts and lower federal courts before any appeal could {{be taken to the}} U.S. Supreme Court. The Stanley plan seemed to suffer a serious blow the following day, however, when the Virginia State Board of Education voted not to endorse the plan. Four members strongly opposed withholding state funds from integrated schools, which led to the negative vote. The board also voted to publicly support the original Gray Commission plan. Meeting with the board after the vote, Governor Stanley discussed the possibility of merging his plan with some sort of pupil assignment plan, so that pupil assignment would be permitted but funds would still be withheld if assignment failed to segregate the schools. Another blow to the Stanley plan came when Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the former governor of Virginia who was now president of the University of Virginia, announced he opposed the Stanley plan and supported the Gray Commission's original proposals.|$|E

5000|$|In 1989, {{the then}} {{president}} of New South Wales Court of Appeal Michael Kirby wrote that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Appeals</b> Tribunal Act 1975 were [...] "probably the most adventurous and far-reaching legal reforms" [...] to haven taken place in Australia.In a 2011 seminar, the then President of the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Appeals</b> Tribunal Garry Downes wrote that, of the reforms of administrative law in the 1970s and 1980s (including {{the establishment of the}} Federal Court, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Appeals</b> Tribunal) was the most significant legislative work of the reform.|$|R

Documents subsequently obtained by EPIC under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) indicated, despite a request from Congress, that the FTC did not examine Google's data from private wireless networks before dropping the case. EPIC filed an <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> with the FTC, challenging its decision, and in May 2011 EPIC filed a suit against the FTC for access to the documents on which the FTC's decision was based.|$|E
25|$|The {{seats of}} the disqualified Senators were filled by countbacks of the 2016 Senate {{election}} results in their states of Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. The countback results were announced on 10 November: in Western Australia, the Greens' Scott Ludlam {{was replaced by}} Jordon Steele-John; in Queensland, the Greens' Larissa Waters was replaced by former Australian Democrats leader Andrew Bartlett and One Nation's Malcolm Roberts was replaced by Fraser Anning. However, the court has delayed the appointment of Nationals' Fiona Nash's replacement Liberal Hollie Hughes due to concerns that Hughes may also be ineligible under s 44(iv) of the Constitution as a holder of an office of profit under the Crown, due to her reappointment to the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Appeal</b> Tribunal in the period following her apparent election defeat. If Hughes is found to not {{be eligible for the}} vacant Senate post, the spot could be filled by former general Jim Molan, who was a Liberal candidate at the 2016 election. But according to constitutional law professor George Williams, as Hughes was a valid candidate {{at the time of the}} July 2, 2016 election, if the High Court rules her out then a casual vacancy would be created and that could be filled as such, including by Nash.|$|E

500|$|Another {{legislative}} package {{was introduced by}} State Senators Armistead Boothe and Ted Dalton. The Boothe-Dalton plan was less ambitious in scope. It proposed a plan in which: 1) Student school assignments would be made on factors other than race; 2) Parents unhappy with their child's school assignment would have access to an administrative appeals system; and 3) Teachers could transfer schools only as conditions warranted. The key element of the Boothe-Dalton plan was in how it differed from the Gray Commission student assignment plan. The Gray Commission plan assigned students {{on the basis of}} student welfare, availability of facilities and transportation, health, and aptitude, whereas the Boothe-Dalton plan expanded the list of factors to include school attendance areas, academic background, student personality, and student needs. Additionally, the Boothe-Dalton plan provided for an <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> process, which the Gray Commission plan did not. It also identified a very specific, time-consuming process for assignment appeals (to the local school board, the state board of education, state circuit courts, state supreme court, and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court). Finally, it contained a [...] "local option" [...] that would allow racial integration in public schools [...] "where localities are ready" [...] (according to Boothe).|$|E

2500|$|In April 2003, the University's Vice-Chancellor set the conditions: one of {{the persons}} {{requesting}} access, the sociologist Eva Kärfve, {{would have to get}} her research project approved by the ethical review committee, and each concerned individual would have to consent before documents about her or him could be read by Eva Kärfve and Leif Elinder, the other person who had requested access. However, Kärfve and Elinder appealed the University's conditions and the Administrative Court of Appeal ruled that the conditions were unreasonable. In an analysis of the case, Sven Ove Hansson, Professor and Head of the Department of Philosophy and the History of Technology at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, {{a former member of the}} Swedish Government Research Advisory Board, wrote: [...] "t is particularly interesting to note that the Court of <b>Administrative</b> <b>Appeal</b> nullified the decision by Gothenburg University to require individual consent and approval from an ethical review committee before giving access to sensitive data on individual research subjects. These are two of the cornerstones of the scientific community's own system for protecting research subjects." ...|$|E

50|$|While {{administrative}} {{decision-making bodies}} are often controlled by larger governmental units, their decisions could be reviewed {{by a court}} of general jurisdiction under some principle of judicial review based upon due process (United States) or fundamental justice (Canada). Judicial review of administrative decisions is different from an <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal.</b> When sitting in review of a decision, the Court will only look at the method in which the decision was arrived at, whereas in an <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> the correctness of the decision itself will be examined, usually by a higher body in the agency.
