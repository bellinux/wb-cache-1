[URL] The species cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies infliximab, bevacizumab, and an anti-VEGF-B antibody, 2 H 10, {{in humans}} and rodents was determined. METHODS: The binding of infliximab to human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> TNF-α, of bevacizumab to human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-A, <b>and</b> of the 2 H 10 antibody to human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-B was evaluated by ELISA. The sequence of human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> TNF-α <b>and</b> VEGF-A at the binding sites for infliximab and bevacizumab were compared. RESULTS: Infliximab bound to human TNF-α, but no binding to mouse or rat TNF-α was detected between 10 pg/mL and 10 μg/ml. Sequence {{comparison of the}} binding site revealed four changes in mouse <b>and</b> five in <b>rat</b> TNF-α compared with human. Bevacizumab bound strongly to human VEGF-A, but showed 5 -log weaker binding to both mouse <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-A. There was a single amino acid substitution in mouse <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-A at the bevacizumab binding site. The 2 H 10 antibody displayed a similar binding profile to human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-B. CONCLUSIONS: The species cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies should be determined prior to their use in preclinical animal models. The 2 H 10 antibody binds to human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> VEGF-B making it suitable for testing in rodent models of human diseas...|$|R

40|$|Mammalian carboxylesterase (CES or Ces) genes encode {{enzymes that}} {{participate}} in xenobiotic, drug, and lipid metabolism {{in the body}} and are members of at least five gene families. Tandem duplications have added more genes for some families, particularly for mouse <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> genomes, which has caused confusion in naming rodent Ces genes. This article describes a new nomenclature system for human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> carboxylesterase genes that identifies homolog gene families and allocates a unique name for each gene. The guidelines of human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> gene nomenclature committees were followed and "CES" (human) and "Ces" (mouse <b>and</b> <b>rat)</b> root symbols were used followed by the family number (e. g., human CES 1). Where multiple genes were identified for a family or where a clash occurred with an existing gene name, a letter was added (e. g., human CES 4 A; mouse <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> Ces 1 a) that reflected gene relatedness among rodent species (e. g., mouse <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> Ces 1 a). Pseudogenes were named by adding "P" and a number to the human gene name (e. g., human CES 1 P 1) or by using a new letter followed by ps for mouse <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> Ces pseudogenes (e. g., Ces 2 d-ps). Gene transcript isoforms were named by adding the GenBank accession ID to the gene symbol (e. g., human CES 1 _AB 119995 or mouse Ces 1 e_BC 019208). This nomenclature improves our understanding of human, mouse, <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> CES/Ces gene families and facilitates research into the structure, function, and evolution of these gene families. It also serves as a model for naming CES genes from other mammalian species. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|CD 59 -antigen (protectin) is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} glycolipid-anchored inhibitor of complement lysis. CD 59 interacts with complement components C 8 and C 9 during assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). To evaluate species specificity of these interactions {{we have in the}} present study examined cross-species binding of isolated human <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> CD 59 to the terminal complement components C 8 and C 9. By using primarily soluble CD 59 isolated from urine (CD 59 U) potentially non-specific binding interactions of the phospholipid portion of the membrane forms of CD 59 could be avoided. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis showed that human CD 59 U bound to both human <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> C 8 in the SC 5 b- 8 complexes. Similar binding occurred when rat CD 59 U was used. The degree of binding did not significantly differ between the heterologous and homologous CD 59 -C 8 combinations. C 9 from both species inhibited the binding of CD 59 to soluble SC 5 b- 8. In ligand blotting analysis human <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> CD 59 U bound to human <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> C 8 alpha gamma-subunit and C 9. Binding of human <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> CD 59 U was stronger to human than rat C 9. In plate binding assays the erythrocyte form of CD 59 (CD 59 E) bound to both human <b>and</b> <b>rat</b> C 8. Binding of CD 59 E to heterologous C 9 was considerably weaker than to homologous C 9. Our results imply that the reciprocal binding sites between C 8 and CD 59 and to a lesser degree between CD 59 and C 9 are conserved between human <b>and</b> <b>rat.</b> Interactions of CD 59 with the terminal C components are thus species selective but not 'homologously restricted'...|$|R
5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques <b>and</b> <b>rats.</b> Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, {{which may explain why}} it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.|$|E
