Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E

Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.|$|E

5|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is one of}} key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management.

5|$|Arsenal {{succumbed to}} a 4–1 defeat in their opening match against Spartak Moscow, {{which was the}} biggest loss inflicted on the club in 18 years. The team let slip a two-goal lead against Bayern Munich at Highbury on 5 December 2000, before winning 1–0 at Olympique Lyonnais to keep their {{aspirations}} of qualifying for the quarter-finals attainable. In the reverse fixture, an equaliser scored by Edmílson in the last minute of normal time prompted Wenger to rue fatigue <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> captain Adams. Arsenal defeated Spartak Moscow by a solitary goal {{and in spite of}} losing to Bayern Munich on 14 March 2001, Lyon's draw with Spartak Moscow meant Arsenal qualified for the quarter-finals by the head-to-head rule.|$|E

5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E
5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia.

Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).|$|E

5|$|Efforts made {{by local}} {{authorities}} in the Cluj-Napoca district {{at the end of}} the 1990s to reform the protection of children's rights and assistance for street children proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> any real collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police).

5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E
