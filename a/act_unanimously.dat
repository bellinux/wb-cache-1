Truman on August 1, 1946, it went into effect on January 1, 1947, and the Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility for nuclear energy from the wartime Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to <b>act</b> <b>unanimously,</b> only with a majority.|$|E

25|$|Article 294 TFEU {{outlines}} ordinary {{legislative procedure}} in the following manner. The Commission submits a legislative proposal to the Parliament and Council. At the first reading Parliament adopts its position. If the Council approves the Parliament's wording then the act is adopted. If not, it shall adopt its own position and pass it back to Parliament with explanations. The Commission also informs Parliament of its position on the matter. At the second reading, the act is adopted if Parliament approves the Council's text or fails to take a decision. The Parliament may reject the Council's text, leading to {{a failure of the}} law, or modify it and pass it back to the Council. The Commission gives its opinion once more. Where the Commission has rejected amendments in its opinion, the Council must <b>act</b> <b>unanimously</b> rather than by majority.|$|E

40|$|After {{successful}} implementation, {{adherence to}} hospital guidelines should be sustained. Long-term adherence to two hospital guidelines was audited. The overall {{aim was to}} explore factors accounting for their long-term adherence or non-adherence. A fluid balance guideline (FBG) and body temperature guideline (BTG) were developed and implemented in our hospital in 2000. Long-term adherence was determined retrospectively {{based on data from}} patient files. Focus groups were launched to explore nurses' perceptions of barriers and facilitators regarding long-term adherence. The predominant themes from the nurses' focus groups were posed to clinicians in questionnaires. Nurses involved in the FBG (overall adherence 100 %) stated that adherence has immediate advantages in terms of safety and a gain in time. Nurses and oncologists <b>acted</b> <b>unanimously</b> which was thought to enhance adherence. On the other hand, opinions differed on the BTG within the nursing teams and medical staff (overall adherence 50 %). Although the guideline discourages routine postoperative body temperature measurements, temperature should be measured according to the guideline in a considerable number of cases due to changes in patient characteristics since the year 2000. Therefore, adherence was judged to be rather complex. To secure adherence to hospital guidelines after their successful implementation, guidelines should preferably be comprehensive in terms of being applicable to the majority of the patients in that particular setting and to the most common clinical situations. All healthcare professionals involved should be aware of its immediate benefits for themselves or to their patient...|$|R

50|$|Mitchell {{worked as}} a program officer in the Division of State Programs of the National Endowment for the Humanities and became {{president}} of the Council of Independent Colleges and Universities of Pennsylvania (CICU) in 1991.

The bill provided uniform standards for determining the tax-exempt eligibility for all nonprofits, especially private colleges. This legislation was passed in response to Washington, Pennsylvania's 1993 lawsuit against Washington & Jefferson College challenging the college’s tax-exempt status. The bill clarified the law and has had a long-term impact on other nonprofits besides private colleges, including hospitals, nursing homes, and public universities.|$|E

5000|$|A trust {{can have}} one trustee or many. In {{the event of}} {{multiple}} trustees, the older common law rules required that all trustees <b>act</b> <b>unanimously.</b> [...] The modern rule reflected in the UTC permits co-trustees to act by majority vote. [...] Where a co-trustee is unable {{to be actively involved}} in the management of the trust due to age or illness, the remaining co-trustees can generally act on behalf of the trust [...] "to achieve the purposes of the trust or to avoid injury to the trust property." [...] However, it is generally better practice for the co-trustee either to resign or to otherwise delegate his decision-making functions while incapacitated to one or all of the remaining co-trustees. [...] A trustee who dissents from acting in a certain way with his fellow co-trustees is protected under the Code from liability provided the trustee has indicated his dissent and only acts based on the direction of the majority co-trustees. [...] In practical terms, the use of co-trustees can often become unwieldy. The Code generally notes this and advises great care for attorneys who draft documents that use multiple co-trustees.|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this paper is to discuss Andrew Jackson?s {{controversial}} actions and policies affecting Native Americans, most notably the Indian Removal Act of 1830. This act required all Native American tribes east of the Mississippi river to move west into designated frontier territories. The native migration would allow the white Americans to possess new farmlands to increase the union?s crop output. White settlers supported the <b>act</b> <b>unanimously</b> due to the promise of state improvement, but many natives would claim that the act was either a great shame or a declaration of war. This paper will examine Jackson?s rise to the presidency and how Jackson?s stance on the Native American issue increased his popularity amongst southern whites. This paper will also examine the correspondence of Fort Armstrong Indian Agent, Thomas Forsyth. The content of these letters help to provide a rationale for the Jackson?s course of action. Although it is unknown if Jackson ever met Forsyth, the information contained in Forsyth?s correspondence reflect contemporary concern with the ?Indian problem. ? Confrontations from forcibly removed tribes and conflicts such as the Black Hawk War and the Second Seminole War will be addressed as well. Finally, this paper will examine contemporary praises and/or criticisms of Jackson?s Indian removal policies provided by contemporary historians...|$|E
