5|$|The king of {{one country}} {{threatened}} by the imminent arrival of the stoor worm sought the advice of <b>a</b> <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> or spaeman, who suggests that the beast might be appeased if it is fed seven virgins every week. In line with the wise man's advice, every Saturday the islanders provide a sacrificial offering of seven virgins, who were tied up and placed on the beach for the serpent to sweep into its mouth as it reared its head from the sea.|$|E
5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult <b>a</b> <b>wise</b> <b>man,</b> who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was <b>a</b> <b>wise</b> <b>man,</b> he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E
25|$|About corrupting Athenian youth, Socrates {{explained}} that the young, rich men {{of the city of}} Athens {{have little to do with}} their time. They therefore follow him about the city, observing his questioning of intellectual arguments in dialogue with other intellectual men. In turn, the young men imitate the method of Socrates. Moreover, the embarrassed men, whose arguments Socrates examined and found wanting, do not know how to avoid the ridicule of exposure as pretenders to wisdom. To not lose face, the beardless lads re-state the prejudicial, stock accusations against Socrates, that he is a morally abominable man who corrupts the youth of Athens with sophistry and atheism. In his defence, Socrates said, “For those who are examined, instead of being angry with themselves, are angry with me!” Hence is Socrates considered <b>a</b> <b>wise</b> <b>man,</b> yet has acquired a bad reputation among the politically powerful personages of Athens.|$|E
25|$|For his self-defence, Socrates first {{eliminates}} {{any claim}} that he is <b>a</b> <b>wise</b> <b>man.</b> He says that Chaerephon, reputed to be impetuous, went to the Oracle of Delphi and asked her, the Pythia, to tell him of anyone who was wiser than Socrates. The Pythia answered to Chaerephon {{that there was no}} man wiser. On learning of that oracular pronouncement, Socrates says he was astounded, because, on the one hand, it is against the nature of the Oracle to lie, but, on the other hand, he knew he was not wise. Therefore, Socrates sought to find someone wiser than himself, so that he could take that person as evidence to the Oracle at Delphi. Hence why Socrates minutely queried everyone who appeared to be a wise person. In that vein, he tested the minds of politicians, poets, and scholars, for wisdom; although he occasionally found genius, Socrates found no one who possessed wisdom; yet, each man was thought wise by the people, and each man thought himself wise; therefore, he (Socrates) was the better man, because he was aware that he was not wise.|$|E

Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say?

500|$|At this time, {{the aging}} leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, {{much of the}} {{high-level}} work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin. These sessions, which Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Nikolai Bulganin, who comprised Stalin's inner circle, attended, began with showings of cowboy movies favored by Stalin. Stolen from the West, they lacked subtitles. The dictator had the meal served at around 1a.m., and insisted that his subordinates stay with him and drink until dawn. On one occasion, Stalin had Khrushchev, then aged almost sixty, dance a traditional Ukrainian dance. Khrushchev did so, later stating, [...] "When Stalin says dance, <b>a</b> <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> dances." [...] Khrushchev attempted to nap at lunch {{so that he would}} not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, [...] "Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table." ...|$|E

500|$|The farmer's [...] "proper {{position}} in society" [...] was in particular jeopardy in New England, according to {{leaders of the}} agricultural education movement. [...] Increasing industrialization caused the population of mill towns to grow exponentially in the mid-19th century {{at the expense of}} rural towns, many of which were left all but abandoned, especially in western Massachusetts. [...] Adding to the crisis was the phenomenon of westward movement and the lure of cheap land in the Midwest. The agricultural education movement in Massachusetts, in reaction to this crisis, had highly moralistic tones. [...] Clark criticized those who left New England, writing, [...] "Will <b>a</b> <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> exchange the beautiful and diversified scenery of New England... Will he forsake the school and churches and the social privileges of prosperous communities for the semi-barbarous condition of newly and sparsely settled districts?"

Penn, for his part, urged Canassatego to remove the Delaware Indians from the land purchased in the controversial Walking Purchase of 1737.

2500|$|According to Stoic philosophy, each being, whether animate or inanimate (plant, {{animal or}} human being), carries on fitting actions {{corresponding}} {{to its own}} nature. They distinguished between [...] "kathēkonta" [...] and [...] "katorthōmata," [...] a perfect action derived from the [...] "orthos logos" [...] (reason) (also [...] "teleion kathēkon": a perfect, achieved kathēkon). They said that the wise man necessarily carried out katorthōmata, that is, virtuous kathēkon, and that what distinguished both was not {{the nature of the}} act, but the way it was done. Thus, in exceptional circumstances, <b>a</b> <b>wise</b> <b>man</b> (which state of being, in Stoic philosophy, is nearly impossible to achieve) could carry out a katorthōma which, according to ordinary standards, would be deemed monstruous (for example, having sexual intercourse with one's daughter, if the destiny of humanity is at stake, or mutilating oneself).|$|E
