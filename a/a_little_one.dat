During the 165 years of Ottoman rule, Bečkerek {{consisted of two}} separate settlements: the settlement of Bečkerek and the village of Gradnulica. The town was divided into two parts, a Turkish and a Serbian. The Turkish part was fenced and closed, while the Serbian one was open. On the main square {{there was a large}} mosque built and inside the fortress there was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>one.</b> There was a Turkish bath, and around it there were about twenty stores. Gradnulica was a disorderly village, whose centre was approximately on the crossroad of the present streets Sindjelićeva and Djurdjevska. Prior to Ottoman occupation, the citizens were Serbs. At the end of the 18th century there were about fifty Turk families.|$|E

Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting [...] "carried away" [...] in the studio, appreciating the [...] "mad distorted and hectic" [...] sound {{they were able}} to create. Rusko said [...] "She's got a kid, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>one</b> year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of crazy ideas". Rusko has described M.I.A. as the best artist he has ever worked with, saying that she had [...] "been the most creative and I really had a good time making music with her".|$|E

[...] Models {{would be used to}} show prospective customers what new models would look like. Of course, they could also be purchased at the parts counter for around one dollar. [...] Commonly, especially in the 1950s, they were simply given away in the showroom after a test drive, usually to children (Ostrander 2011; Gibson 1970 pp44–45). For example, a 1958 Edsel ad prompted [...] "Road Check The Big One, Get <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> <b>One</b> Free" [...] (Feder 1990; see also Clarence Young Autohobby museum).|$|E

2500|$|Thérèse {{entered the}} Carmel of Lisieux with the {{determination}} to become a saint. But, {{by the end of}} 1894, six full calendar years as a Carmelite made her realize how small and insignificant she was. She saw the limitations of all her efforts. She remained small and very far off from the unfailing love that she would wish to practice. [...] She understood then that it was on this very littleness that she must learn to ask God's help. [...] Along with her camera, Céline had brought notebooks with her, passages from the Old Testament, which Thérèse did not have in Carmel. (The Louvain Bible, the translation authorized for French Catholics, did not include an Old Testament). In the notebooks Thérèse found a passage from Proverbs that struck her with particular force: [...] "Whosoever is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>one,</b> let him come to me" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|On 24 July, the Serbian government, expecting an Austrian {{declaration}} of war the next day, mobilized while Austria broke off diplomatic relations. The British Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to London: [...] "War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna." [...] Asquith {{wrote in a letter}} to Venetia Stanley that he was worried that:"Russia is trying to drag us in. The news this morning is that Serbia had capitulated on the main points, but it is very doubtful if any reservations will be accepted by Austria, who is resolved upon a complete and final humiliation. The curious thing is that on many, if not most of the points, Austria has a good and Serbia a very bad case. But the Austrians are quite the stupidest people in Europe (as the Italians are the most perfidious), and there is a brutality about their mode of procedure, which will make most people think that is a case of a big Power wantonly bullying <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>one.</b> Anyhow, it is the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years." [...] In order to stop a war, the Permanent Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, suggested again that a conference be held in London chaired by Britain, Germany, Italy and France to resolve the dispute between Austria and Serbia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Judah {{approached}} Joseph, whom he likened to Pharaoh, and recounted how Joseph {{had asked the}} 10 brothers whether they had a father or brother, and they {{had told him that}} they had a father who was an old man (Jacob), and a child of his old age who was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>one</b> (Benjamin), whose brother was dead, who alone was left of his mother (Rachel), and whose father loved him. Judah recalled how Joseph had told the brothers to bring their younger brother down to Egypt, they had told Joseph that the lad's leaving would kill his father, but Joseph had insisted. Judah recalled how the brothers had told their father Joseph's words, and when their father had told them to go again to buy a little food, they had reminded him that they could not go down without their youngest brother. Judah recounted how their father had told them that his wife had born him two sons, one had gone out and was torn in pieces, and if they took the youngest and harm befell him, it would bring down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Judah began to explain to Joseph what would happen if Judah were to come to his father without the lad, seeing that his father's soul was bound up with the lad's. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{noted that}} Amy did not develop much {{throughout}} the 2010 series. Dan Martin of The Guardian, in a mid-series review, wrote, [...] "I wonder whether I really know Amy Pond. Beneath the sass and the sauce and the wit and (there's no {{getting away from}} this) the skirts, I've yet to completely empathise with her, or work out what makes her tick". In a review before the finale, Martin called her [...] "a revelation", although she sometimes [...] "felt <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>one</b> note...But I'd put all of that down to guest writers responding to a character brief that probably said little more than 'feisty redhead'". IGN's Matt Wales shared similar sentiments, writing, [...] "Despite Gillan's effortless charisma, Pond was frequently painted in largely two-dimensional strokes that made for a brash, sometimes irritating turn. It's testament to Gillan's abilities and brilliant chemistry with Smith that she remained thoroughly watchable throughout but, bereft of back story (albeit intentionally), {{it was hard to}} really get involved with the character". Paul Kerton of Zap2it, however, wrote in a review of [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] that Amy's [...] "brilliantly executed introduction to the show stood out. Amy's character after just one episode is already one with depth". Tor.com's Teresa Jusino was also more positive towards Amy in the fifth series, writing that she was equally [...] "competent, intelligent, and [...] " [...] as she was flawed and made mistakes, which made her relatable and [...] "a successful female character".|$|E
