The control system was implemented with a high speed, real time DSP board using MATLAB Simulink code downloaded onto the board. A single crystal silicon prototype was fabricated and used as a test bed. Experimental results demonstrated that the control system maintains the gyroscope motion at a defined energy level with some steady state error while simultaneously reducing <b>anisoelasticity</b> induced angular momentum by 31 %.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{design for a}} new tuned gyroscope framework consisting of a heavy rotor supported hy a heli-flex suspension. Inherently free of 2 u> drift-error, the gyro can be precisely tuned by adjusting pre-extension between two ends of its helix. The symmetrical support structure of this isotropic helical suspension design significantly reduces error moment caused by linear acceleration, and the device eliminates G ^ drift {{by virtue of its}} desirable <b>anisoelasticity</b> characteristic. The gyro design is simple, highly manufacturable, and when appropriate suspension parame-ters are used, produces a long-term drift-rate of 0. 01 deg. /hr...|$|E

Fabrication process and <b>anisoelasticity</b> of the material are known to reduce {{the performance of the}} bias stability of micromachined gyros. However, solutions exist to compensate for the quadrature error in silicon-based gyros: DC voltage, parallel capacitance. The principle of operation presented in this paper is based on charge injection in opposite phase to balance the charges induced by the quadrature error in quartzCoriolisVibrating Gyros. The concept is experimentally tested first with an open-loop circuit. The result of this experiment showed a bias stability of 96 °/h RMS over the temperature range. An additional closed-loop feedback circuit is designed and experimented. The activecompensation of the quadrature error then improves the bias stability by 5 times, leading to a performance of 20 °/h RMS over temperature...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to identify nonproportional damp-ing and structural <b>anisoelasticities</b> in vibratory MEMS gyroscopes is proposed in this paper. The proposed identification method {{is based on}} measured vibration data − {{in the form of}} frequency response functions (FRFs.) A new identification method, called the matrix pertur-bation method, is proposed to identify nonproportional damping from the measured FRFs. This method is based on a perturbation expansion of the FRF matrix of the nonproportionally damped system in terms of the FRF matrix of the proportionally damped system. A closed form expression for the off-diagonal modal damp-ing matrix is obtained based on the perturbation the-ory. The mass and stiffness matrices required by this method are obtained using the instrumental variable (IV) method, proposed by Fritzen [1], which is also used to identify the structural <b>anisoelasticities...</b>|$|R
