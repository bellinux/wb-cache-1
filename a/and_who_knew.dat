5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} authors that stated Hitler {{showed signs}} of {{hysteria}} without using the Pasewalk episode and Hitler’s alleged treatment by Forster as main evidence, was the American psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer. Langer wrote his study in 1943 {{on behalf of the}} OSS. He and his team conducted interviews with many people who were available to the American intelligence services <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Hitler personally. They came to the final judgment that Hitler was “a hysterical at the edge of schizophrenia”. The study was for a long time held under lock and key and published in 1972 under the title The Mind of Adolf Hitler.|$|E

Originally Bowie had hoped to have Édouard Lock of La La La Human Steps be involved in the show, but the group was booked with other commitments. Bowie later lamented that the Tour may have been viewed differently if La La La Human Steps had been involved: [...] "It would have been a different ballgame." [...] La La La Human Steps would provide the choreography for Bowie's next tour, the Sound+Vision Tour of 1990.|$|E

500|$|National Book Award finalist Richard Yates told The New York Times in 1977 {{that reading}} Salinger's stories {{for the first}} time was a {{landmark}} experience, and that [...] "nothing quite like it has happened to me since". Yates describes Salinger as [...] "a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> exactly what he was doing in every silence as well as in every word." [...] Gordon Lish's O. Henry Award-winning short story [...] "For Jeromé—With Love and Kisses" [...] (1977, collected in What I Know So Far, 1984) is a play on Salinger's [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor".|$|E
500|$|Crawford {{sees the}} {{events at the}} 1913 Derby as a lens [...] "through which... whole life has been interpreted", and the {{uncertainty}} of her motives and intentions that day has affected how she has been judged by history. Carolyn Collette, a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including [...] "uncontrolled impulses" [...] or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians [...] "to accept what some of her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" [...] and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse. Cicely Hale, a suffragette {{who worked at the}} WSPU <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Davison, described her as [...] "a fanatic" [...] who was prepared to die but did not mean to. Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison did not mean to die.|$|E
500|$|In early 1929 Gernsback went bankrupt, and his {{magazines}} {{were sold}} to Bergan A. Mackinnon; both Amazing Stories and Amazing Stories Quarterly continued publication under their new ownership, and Sloane remained as editor. [...] Within two months Gernsback had launched two new magazines, Air Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Stories. [...] Gernsback still believed in the educational value of science fiction, and contrasted his goals for Air Wonder Stories with the fiction appearing in aviation pulps such as Sky Birds and Flying Aces, which were [...] "purely 'Wild-West'-world war adventure-sky busting" [...] stories, in his words. [...] He planned to fill Air Wonder with [...] "flying stories of the future, strictly along scientific-mechanical-technical lines, full of adventure, exploration and achievement". [...] Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were edited by David Lasser, who had no prior experience as an editor <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> little about sf, but whose degree from MIT had convinced Gernsback to take him on. [...] Lasser printed work by some popular authors, including Fletcher Pratt, Stanton Coblentz, and David H. Keller, {{and two of the}} winners of the contests Gernsback frequently ran subsequently became well known in the field: Raymond Palmer, later the editor of Amazing Stories, and John Wyndham, best known for his 1951 novel The Day of the Triffids. [...] The readership of the two magazines overlapped strongly, most readers being science fiction fans rather than aviation fans. [...] With these two titles established, Gernsback added Science Wonder Quarterly in October 1929, also edited by Lasser. [...] At the same time Gernsback sent a letter to some of the writers he had already bought stories from, asking for [...] "detective or criminal mystery stories with a good scientific background", and in January 1930 he launched Scientific Detective Monthly, edited by his deputy, Hector Grey, as a new cross-genre title, giving him four magazines in all.|$|E

2500|$|While at Bluffton College, he was mentored by Dr. Lawrence Templin, a noted pacifist who {{had been}} imprisoned for his beliefs and was now a {{professor}} of English literature.

Templin's teachings deeply influence Velásquez's approach to securing social justice for farmworkers. Templin knew Bayard Rustin while in prison, and Templin encouraged him to volunteer with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)—a civil rights organization in which Rustin played a major role. Baldemar Velásquez spent several weeks in the summer of 1968 working with CORE and living with an African American family in Cleveland, Ohio. After graduation, he spent time picking cherries in Michigan to pay off his student loans, and went to Wisconsin to meet with the founder of Obreros Unidos, Jesus Salas (also known as [...] "Jesse Salas").|$|E
2500|$|Wang {{wanted to}} compete against IBM as a {{computer}} company, selling directly to Management Information System departments. Before the VS, however, Wang Laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company. The calculators, word processing systems and OIS were sold into individual departments, bypassing the corporate data-processing decision-makers. The chapter in Wang's book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as [...] "a beachhead in the Fortune 1000." [...] The Wang VS was Wang's entrée into IT departments. In his book, An Wang notes that, to sell the VS, [...] "we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing... who had experience dealing with MIS executives, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> their way around Fortune 1000 companies." [...] As the VS took hold, the word processor and OIS lines were phased out. The word processing software continued, {{in the form of}} a loadable-microcode environment that allowed VS workstations to take on the behavior of traditional Wang WP terminals to operate with the VS and use it as a document server.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 24 March 1944 a patrol of German police from Łańcut under Lieutenant Eilert Dieken came to the Ulmas' house which was on the {{outskirts}} of the village. They were informed ahead of time about the Jews in hiding by Włodzimierz Leś – a member of the Polish Blue Police – who was Ukrainian himself <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> the Szall family from Łańcut and who took over their property there. The Germans surrounded the house and caught all eight Jews belonging to the Szall and Goldman families. They shot them in the back of the head according to eyewitness Edward Nawojski and others, who were ordered to look at the executions. Then the German gendarmes killed the pregnant Wiktoria and her husband, so that the villagers would see what punishment awaited them for hiding Jews. The six children began to scream at the sight of their parents' bodies. After consulting with his superior, 23-year-old Jan Kokott, a Czech Volksdeutscher from Sudetenland serving with the German police, shot three or four of the Polish children while other Polish children were murdered by the remaining gendarmes.
