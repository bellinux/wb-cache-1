5|$|For many {{communities}} {{the existence of}} buildings that formerly housed residential schools are a traumatic reminder of the system's legacy, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> much discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.|$|E
5|$|In his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, Sir John Eliot Gardiner {{performed}} and recorded {{the work with}} cantatas for the Fifth Sunday after Trinity, but is not known for sure when in the liturgical year Bach performed it, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> speculation that it was written for a special occasion.|$|E
5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} have disappeared <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system {{and the development of}} warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established farther to the east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E

5|$|Following Llywelyn's {{death in}} 1240, Gwynedd's power {{declined}} {{and many of}} its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247. Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending his power across Wales. Owain was eventually released in 1277 <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> much historical debate over which castle he was held in. Hywel Foel ap Griffri wrote a famous poem describing Owain's long imprisonment in a round tower; historians believe that this refers to the keep at Dolbardarn.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{remained}} {{ruled by}} native kings into the 12th century, largely {{without the use}} of castles. There was a history of Irish fortifications called ráths, a type of ringfort, some of which were very heavily defended but which are not usually considered to be castles in the usual sense of the word. The kings of Connacht constructed fortifications from 1124 which they called caistel or caislen, from the Latin and French for castle, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> considerable academic debate over how far these resembled European castles.|$|E
5|$|The {{high bulk}} density of some ash {{deposits}} can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or {{the lines and}} structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further {{increases the risk of}} breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.|$|E

5|$|There are extant liturgical vestments {{containing}} embroidered figures, {{including that}} of St. Barbara, in Lochner's style and with similar facial types. This has led to some speculation whether Lochner provided the models. In addition a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar in style, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> debate whether {{he might have been}} responsible for church murals; the over-life size figures of the Dombild and Virgin with the Violet indicate his ability to work on a monumental scale.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{resistance}} poses {{a growing}} problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years {{and the availability of}} substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> emerging resistance in Laos.|$|E
5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{evidence to show that}} women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia the {{continental}} area (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) generally practices Theravada Buddhism. Most of insular Southeast Asia (namely Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia) practices mostly Sunni Islam. The {{rest of the}} insular region (Philippines and East Timor) practices mostly Roman Catholic Christianity and Singapore practises mostly Mahayana Buddhism. Significant long-distance labor migration {{that occurred during the}} late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity. Relations between the indigenous population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group. During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a significant amount of unity throughout history. This differs from both nearby East and South Asia.|$|E
