5|$|Apart from Newfoundland and Labrador, each {{province}} and territory bears {{at least some}} elements from its coat of arms upon its flag. The flags of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are banners of the provincial arms, while Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon each have the shield of the local coat of arms on their flags, with other design elements. The flag of Nunavut uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours. The shield of the arms of each province, on a blue background <b>and</b> <b>circled</b> with ten gold maple leaves, the whole surmounted by a crown, forms the main element of {{the flag of the}} Lieutenant-Governor of that province. The exceptions are Nova Scotia, which uses the Union Flag defaced with the shield of Nova Scotia, surrounded by green maple leaves, and Quebec, which uses the shield on a white circle with the provincial motto inscribed below.|$|E
5|$|Phát was {{supposed}} to seize the second largest {{air force base in}} the country, located in the satellite city of Biên Hòa outside Saigon. This was to prevent Kỳ from mobilizing air power against them, but this failed, as Kỳ had already flown there to take control after dropping Khánh off at Vũng Tàu. Phát could not challenge Kỳ's fighter planes, which were already patrolling the air above Biên Hòa by the time they arrived. Kỳ flew a short distance southwest <b>and</b> <b>circled</b> Tân Sơn Nhất, threatening to bomb the rebels. Kỳ had never trusted Thảo or Phát, and did not want them in power. Most of the forces of the III and IV Corps surrounding the capital disliked both Khánh and the rebels, and took no action. As nightfall came, it appeared that forces loyal to Khánh were strengthening as they began to move towards Saigon.|$|E

5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin lemon shark. Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and certainly this species has been known to defend itself quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, <b>and</b> <b>circled</b> for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters visual range. Young sharks are reportedly more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon sharks are the main attraction of daily shark-feeding ecotourism dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E

A method is developed to convert lines <b>and</b> <b>circles</b> into Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves. In order to get smooth machining process the PH curve is used to replace the joints of the circular/linear elements by the connection situation. The slope of line is used to get the tangent vector in the line conversion. When converting a circle to a PH curve, points of the divided circle are introduced to compute the vectors. The methods of computing tangent vectors are proposed according to {{the slope of the}} line and the quadrant of the circle. The transformation errors from lines <b>and</b> <b>circles</b> to PH curves are computed. In the corner smoothing process the tangent vectors are computed by the connection between lines <b>and</b> <b>circles.</b> Replacement errors at the joints are computed for the use of PH curve. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the conversion from line <b>and</b> <b>circle</b> to PH curve. The PH curves at the joints of the circular and linear elements show continuous trajectory...|$|R

Kondo ordered the Sendai group of ships—plus Nagara and four destroyers ("D" [...] on the maps)—to engage and destroy the U.S. force before he brought the bombardment force of Kirishima and heavy cruisers ("E" [...] on the maps) into Ironbottom Sound. The U.S.ships ("A" [...] on the maps) detected the Sendai force on radar but did not detect the other groups of Japanese ships.
