25|$|Touchdown PCR (Step-down PCR): {{a variant}} of PCR that aims to reduce nonspecific {{background}} by gradually lowering the <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature</b> as PCR cycling progresses. The <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature</b> at the initial cycles is usually a few degrees (3–5°C) above the Tm of the primers used, while at the later cycles, it is a few degrees (3–5°C) below the primer Tm. The higher temperatures give greater specificity for primer binding, and the lower temperatures permit more efficient amplification from the specific products formed during the initial cycles.|$|E
25|$|It is {{critical}} to determine a proper temperature for the annealing step because efficiency and specificity are strongly affected by the <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature.</b> This temperature must be low enough to allow for hybridization of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific, i.e., the primer should bind only to a perfectly complementary part of the strand, and nowhere else. If the temperature is too low, the primer may bind imperfectly. If it is too high, the primer may not bind at all. A typical <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature</b> is about 3–5°C below the Tm of the primers used. Stable hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are formed only when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence. During this step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation.|$|E
25|$|Enhanced {{magnetic}} coercivities for hematite {{have been}} achieved by dry-heating a 2-line ferrihydrite precursor prepared from solution. Hematite exhibited temperature-dependent magnetic coercivity values ranging from 289 to 5,027 Oe. The origin of these high coercivity values has been interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the subparticle structure induced by the different particle and crystallite size growth rates at increasing <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature.</b> These differences in the growth rates are translated into a progressive development of a subparticle structure at the nanoscale. At lower temperatures (350–600°C), single particles crystallize however; at higher temperatures (600-1000°C), the growth of crystalline aggregates with a subparticle structure is favored.|$|E

25|$|Annealing of the 3' {{end of one}} primer {{to itself}} or the second primer may cause primer extension, {{resulting}} {{in the formation of}} so-called primer dimers, visible as low-molecular-weight bands on PCR gels. Primer dimer formation often competes with formation of the DNA fragment of interest, and may be avoided using primers that are designed such that they lack complementarity—especially at the 3' ends—to itself or the other primer used in the reaction. If primer design is constrained by other factors and if primer-dimers do occur, methods to limit their formation may include optimisation of the MgCl2 concentration or increasing the <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature</b> in the PCR.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{steps of}} a touchdown polymerase chain reaction cycle have high annealing temperatures. The <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature</b> is decreased in increments for every subsequent set of cycles (the number of individual cycles and increments of temperature decrease is chosen by the experimenter). The primer will anneal at the highest temperature which is least-permissive of nonspecific binding that {{it is able to}} tolerate. Thus, the first sequence amplified is the one between the regions of greatest primer specificity; it is most likely that this is the sequence of interest. These fragments will be further amplified during subsequent rounds at lower temperatures, and will out compete the nonspecific sequences to which the primers may bind at those lower temperatures. If the primer initially (during the higher-temperature phases) binds to the sequence of interest, subsequent rounds of polymerase chain reaction can be performed upon the product to further amplify those fragments.|$|E

2500|$|Touchdown {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} or touchdown style {{polymerase chain reaction}} is a method of polymerase chain reaction by which primers will avoid amplifying nonspecific sequences. The <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature</b> during a polymerase chain reaction determines the specificity of primer annealing. The melting point of the primer sets the upper limit on <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature.</b> At temperatures just below this point, only very specific base pairing between the primer and the template will occur.

2500|$|Non-specific binding of primers {{frequently}} occurs and {{may occur}} for several reasons. These include repeat sequences in the DNA template, non-specific binding between primer and template, {{high or low}} G-C content in the template, or incomplete primer binding, leaving the 5' end of the primer unattached to the template. Non-specific binding of degenerate primers is also common. Manipulation of <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature</b> and magnesium ion concentration {{may be used to}} increase specificity. For example, lower concentrations of magnesium or other cations may prevent non-specific primer interactions, thus enabling successful PCR. A [...] "hot-start" [...] polymerase enzyme whose activity is blocked unless it is heated to high temperature (e.g., 90–98˚C) during the denaturation step of the first cycle, is commonly used to prevent non-specific priming during reaction preparation at lower temperatures.

2500|$|Annealing brass {{to make it}} softer {{and less}} brittle is fairly easy, but {{annealing}} cartridge cases is a more complex matter. Since {{the base of the}} case must be hard, it cannot be annealed. What is needed is a form of heat treatment called differential hardening, where heat is carefully applied to part of the case until the desired softness is reached, and then the heat treatment process is halted by rapidly cooling the case. [...] Since annealing brass requires heating it to about 660°F (350°C), the heating must be done {{in such a way as}} to heat the neck to that temperature, while preventing the base of the case from being heated and losing its hardness. The traditional way is to stand the cases in a shallow pan full of water, then heat the necks of the cases with a torch, but this method makes it difficult to get an even heating of the entire case neck. A temperature-sensitive crayon can be used at the point to which it is to be annealed, which is just behind the shoulder for bottlenecked cartridges, or at the bottom of the bullet seating depth for straight-wall cartridges. The neck of the case is placed in a propane torch flame and heated it until the crayon mark changes color, indicating the correct temperature. Once the correct temperature is reached the case is completely quenched in water to stop the annealing process at the desired hardness. [...] Failing to keep the base of the case cool can anneal the case near the head, where it must remain hard to function properly. [...] Another approach is to immerse the case mouth in a molten alloy of lead that is at the desired <b>annealing</b> <b>temperature</b> for a few seconds, then quickly shake off the lead and quench the case.|$|E

We performed a long room temperature aging with subsequent <b>annealing</b> at different <b>temperatures</b> up to 250 °C. A distinct change of the junctions' normal-state resistance has been observed. Aging at room temperature results in a slight decrease of the normal-state resistance combined with improved junction quality, characterised by a better subgap-to-normal resistance ratio. <b>Annealing</b> at moderate <b>temperatures</b> in air increases the normal-state resistance and leads to improvement of the junction quality followed by degradation at higher <b>annealing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The increase in the junction quality after long-term aging at room temperature is attributed to relaxation of the internal junction structure and interfaces, thus, resulting in a lower density of interface traps.
