Uncharged hydrophobic materials achieved the next greatest biofilm accumulation, averaging approximately 50 % of the total biomass which was accumulated on the charged surface materials after 16 days. Uncharged hydrophilic materials supported very little biofilm development. In general, biofilm accumulation increased with decreased surface roughness.

40|$|Summary In {{addition}} to recognizing and repairing mismatched bases in DNA, the mismatch repair (MMR) system also detects cisplatin DNA adducts {{and loss of}} MMR results in resistance to cisplatin. A comparison {{was made of the}} ability of MMR-proficient and-deficient cells to remove cisplatin adducts from their genome and to reactivate a transiently transfected plasmid that had previously been inactivated by cisplatin to express the firefly luciferase enzyme. MMR deficiency due to loss of hMLH 1 function did not change the extent of platinum (Pt) <b>accumulation</b> or <b>kinetics</b> of removal from total cellular DNA. However, MMR-deficient cells, lacking either hMLH 1 or hMSH 2, generated twofold more luciferase activity from a cisplatin-damaged reporter plasmid than their MMR-proficient counterparts. Thus, detection of the cisplatin adducts by the MMR system reduced the efficiency of reactivation of the damaged luciferase gene compared to cells lacking this detector. The twofold reduction in reactivation efficiency was of the same order of magnitude as the difference in cisplatin sensitivity between the MMR-proficient and-deficient cells. We conclude that although MMR-proficient and-deficient cells remove Pt from their genome at equal rates, the loss of a functional MMR system facilitates the reactivation of a cisplatin-damaged reporter gene...|$|R

Shellfish toxicity {{is a result of}} algal abundance and toxicity as well as <b>accumulation</b> and depuration <b>kinetics</b> in mussels. We mass-cultured Dinophysis acuta containing OA, DTX- 1 b and PTX- 2 and fed it to the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis under controlled laboratory conditions for a week to study toxin accumulation and transformation. Contents of OA and DTX- 1 b in mussels increased linearly with incubation time, and the net toxin accumulation was 66 % and 71 % for OA and DTX- 1 b, respectively. Large proportions (≈ 50 %) of both these toxins were transformed to fatty acid esters. Most PTX- 2 was transformed to PTX- 2 seco-acid and net accumulation was initially high, but decreased progressively throughout the experiment, likely due to esterification and loss of detectability. We also quantified depuration during the subsequent four days and found half-life times of 5 – 6 days for OA and DTX- 1 b. Measurements of dissolved toxins revealed that depuration was achieved through excreting rather than metabolizing toxins. This is the first study to construct a full mass balance of DSP toxins during both accumulation and depuration, and we demonstrate rapid toxin accumulation in mussels at realistic in situ levels of Dinophysis.

Currently, the mechanism of <b>accumulation</b> and <b>kinetics</b> of pentosidine formation in hemodialysis patients remain unknown. Gel filtration of uremic plasma revealed that plasma pentosidine exists in the albumin fraction (approximately 90 %) and, interestingly, in free form (approximately 5 %) as well. Plasma free pentosidine was undetectable in subjects with normal renal function. There was a significant correlation between the plasma levels of albumin-linked and free pentosidine in hemodialysis patients. Kinetic studies indicated that dietary pentosidine was absorbed into the circulation and that, after either oral or intravenous administration of pentosidine to intact or nephrectomized rats, the plasma free pentosidine level was closely linked to the level of renal function. These findings demonstrate that: (I) Pentosidine accumulates as albumin-linked and in free form in the circulation of uremic patients; (2) dietary pentosidine be absorbed into the circulation, thus being one possible origin of circulating free pentosidine; (3) free pentosidine may accumulate as a result of decreased glomerular filtration; and (4) the mechanism of accumulation of albumin-linked pentosidine is not related to high glucose levels.

However, little is known about shRNA in vivo processing, <b>accumulation,</b> functional <b>kinetics,</b> and side effects related to shRNA saturation of the cellular gene silencing machinery. Therefore, we constructed first-generation recombinant adenoviruses encoding different shRNAs against murine ATP-binding cassette multidrug resistance protein 2 (Abcc 2), which is involved in liver transport of bilirubin to bile, and analyzed Abcc 2 silencing kinetics. C 57 /BL 6 mice injected with these viruses showed significant impairment of Abcc 2 function for up to 3 weeks, as reflected by increased serum bilirubin levels. The lack of Abcc 2 function correlated with a specific reduction of Abcc 2 mRNA and with high levels of processed shRNAs targeting Abcc 2. Inhibition was lost at longer times postinfection, correlating with a decrease in the accumulation of processed shRNAs. This finding suggests that a minimal amount of processed shRNAs is required for efficient silencing in vivo. This system was also used to evaluate the effect of shRNA expression on the saturation of silencing factors. Saturation of the cellular silencing processing machinery alters the accumulation and functionality of endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) and pre-miRNAs. However, expression of functional exogenous shRNAs did not change the levels of endogenous miRNAs or their precursors. In summary, this work shows that adenoviral vectors can deliver sufficient shRNAs to mediate inhibition of gene expression without saturating the silencing machinery...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} role(s) of cytokines in {{the reduction}} of infectious virus and persistent viral infection in {{the central nervous system}} was examined by determining the kinetics of cytokine mRNA expression following infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Mice were infected with an antibody escape variant which produces a nonlethal encephalomyelitis and compared to a clonal virus population which produces a fulminant fatal encephalomyelitis. Infection with both viruses induced the accumulation of mRNAs associated with Th 1 - and Th 2 -type cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL- 4, and IL- 10. Peak mRNA accumulations were coincident with the clearance of virus and there was no obvious differences between lethally and nonlethally infected mice. TNF-α mRNA was induced more rapidly in lethally infected mice compared to mice undergoing a nonfatal encephalomyelitis. Rapid transient increases in the mRNAs encoding IL- 12, iNOS, IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 occurred following infection. Nonlethal infections were associated with increased IL- 12, IL- 1 β, and earlier expression of IL- 6, while lethal infections were associated with increased iNOS and IL- 1 α mRNA. These data suggest a rapid but differential response within the central nervous system cells to infection by different JHMV variants. However, neither the <b>accumulation</b> nor <b>kinetics</b> of induction provide evidence to distinguish lethal infections from nonlethal infections leading to a persistent infection. Accumulation of both Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines in the central nervous system of JHMV-infected mice is consistent with the participation of both cytokines and cell immune effectors during resolution of acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis...|$|R

In all brains, FDG time-activity curves showed a linear increase during the whole experiment (Fig.  3 d) and thus confirmed the expected <b>accumulation</b> <b>kinetics</b> of FDG. Similarly, Patlak regression plot showed a good correlation with r values always ≥[*] 0.97. Again, previous STS decreased CRMGlu* from 38.3 [*]±[*] 11 to 17.8 [*]±[*] 7.2  nmol[*]×[*]min− 1 (p[*]<[*] 0.05, Fig.  3 d).|$|E
40|$|Preferential <b>accumulation</b> and {{agglomeration}} <b>kinetics</b> of nanoparticles {{suspended in}} an acoustically levitated water droplet under radiative heating has been studied. Particle image velocimetry performed {{to map the}} internal flow field shows a single cell recirculation with increasing strength for decreasing viscosities. Infrared thermography and high speed imaging show details of the heating process for various concentrations of nanosilica droplets. Initial stage of heating is marked by fast vaporization of liquid and sharp temperature rise. Following this stage, aggregation of nanoparticles is seen resulting in various structure formations. At low concentrations, a bowl structure of the droplet is dominant, maintained at a constant temperature. At high concentrations, viscosity of the solution increases, leading to rotation about the levitator axis due to the dominance of centrifugal motion. Such complex fluid motion inside the droplet due to acoustic streaming eventually results {{in the formation of}} a ring structure. This horizontal ring eventually reorients itself due to an imbalance of acoustic forces on the ring, exposing larger area for laser absorption and subsequent sharp temperature rise...|$|R
40|$|In human {{erythrocytes}} (h-RBCs) various stimuli induce {{increases in}} [cAMP] that trigger ATP release. The resulting pattern of extracellular ATP <b>accumulation</b> (ATPe <b>kinetics)</b> depends on both ATP release and ATPe degradation by ectoATPase activity. In {{this study we}} evaluated ATPe kinetics from primary cultures of h-RBCs infected with P. falciparum at various stages of infection (ring, trophozoite and schizont stages). A " 3 V" mixture containing isoproterenol (β-adrenergic agonist), forskolin (adenylate kinase activator) and papaverine (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) was used to induce cAMP-dependent ATP release. ATPe kinetics of r-RBCs (ring-infected RBCs), t-RBCs (trophozoite-infected RBCs) and s-RBCs (schizont-infected RBCs) showed [ATPe] to peak acutely to a maximum value followed by a slower time dependent decrease. In all intraerythrocytic stages, values of ΔATP 1 (difference between [ATPe] measured 1 min post-stimulus and basal [ATPe]) increased nonlinearly with parasitemia (from 2 to 12. 5 %). Under 3 V exposure, t-RBCs at parasitemia 94 % (t 94 -RBCs) showed 3. 8 -fold higher ΔATP 1 values than in h-RBCs, indicative of upregulated ATP release. Pre-exposure to either 100 µM carbenoxolone, 100 nM mefloquine or 100 µM NPPB reduced ΔATP 1 to 83 - 87 % for h-RBCs and 63 - 74 % for t 94 -RBCs. EctoATPase activity, assayed at both low nM concentrations (300 - 900 nM) and 500 µM exogenous ATPe concentrations increased approx. 400 -fold in t 94 -RBCs, as compared to h-RBCs, while intracellular ATP concentrations of t 94 -RBCs were 65 % that of h-RBCs. In t 94 -RBCs, production of nitric oxide (NO) was approx. 7 -fold higher than in h-RBCs, and was partially inhibited by L-NAME pre-treatment. In media with L-NAME, ΔATP 1 values were 2. 7 -times higher in h-RBCs and 4. 2 -times higher in t 94 -RBCs, than without L-NAME. Results suggest that P. falciparum infection of h-RBCs strongly activates ATP release via Pannexin 1 in these cells. Several processes partially counteracted ATPe accumulation: an upregulated ATPe degradation, an enhanced NO production, and a decreased intracellular ATP concentration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{flow sensor}} for trace {{analysis}} of zinc, using graphite felt as working electrode is reported here. A flow cell, well-adapted to 3 -D porous electrodes and capable {{to do both}} the preconcentration step at a cathodic potential and the stripping of the zinc was successfully developed. It was demonstrated that this cell allows to obtain better electrochemical signals for Zn(2 +) compared to a standard three-electrodes cell and that the percolation during <b>accumulation</b> increases the <b>kinetics</b> of electrodeposition. The influence on Zn(2 +) signal of the deposition potential, the time of deposition and the flow rate was studied. The resulting sensor shows a linear response towards Zn(2 +) with a linear range of 10 (- 6) - 10 (- 4) M and a limit of detection of 5 × 10 (- 7) M for an analysis time of 5 min. The interferences study showed that the Cr(3 +), Pb(2 +), Cd(2 +) ions have a small effect on the Zn electrochemical signal, whereas Fe(3 +), Cu(2 +), Co(2 +) and Ni(2 +) ions strongly influence it. The electrode was tested on real samples (tap water spiked with Zn(2 +), food supplement) with a good recovery by applying the standard addition method...|$|R
