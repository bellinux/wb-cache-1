40|$|A {{combined}} accelerator-brake pedal in {{passenger cars}} is {{a device that}} combines the accelerating and braking functions in one pedal. This device {{is known as the}} CAB system. The aim of the CAB system is to save the time that is normally spent in moving the foot from the accelerator to the brake pedal. It is asserted that in an emergency situation either the accident risk or the serious outcome of an accident can be reduced by the gain in time. This paper investigates whether the literature regarding this assertion is indeed correct. The paper provides statements about the real road safety gain caused by the CAB system. It is concluded that the literature used gives a clear indication that a further road safety improvement is possible by shortening the brake reaction time. The paper briefly describes alternative systems for the brake distance improvement. These systems include: (1) the Advanced Brake Light Device (ABLD). The ABLD system enables that the braking lights are energized sooner than they would be normally; (2) the third brake light; and (3) the <b>anti-locking</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> (ABS).

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Anti-locking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> (ABS) {{are well}} {{established}} in the automotive industry as a safety feature. ABS generally offers superior vehicle safety by limiting the longitudinal wheel slip in a braking event with deep slip condition. In this paper is presented a structure solution of elastic element from electromagnetic valve that has the roll to reduce the noise and vibrations from brake pedal. At the same time, this solution improve the dynamic of ABS regulator of the vehicle, allowing an increase of frequency of work and, implicit the reducing the braking space. Drivers would have better directional control of the vehicle equipped with ABS. The performances of constructive solution depending on achieving own resonance frequency are presented and confirmed in this paper by means of results obtained experimentally.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{regenerative}} braking mode can reduce overall vehicle energy usage {{for most of the}} most common drive cycles. However, a number of technical issues restrict the use of {{regenerative braking}} for all possible braking situations. These issues are concerned with two key limitations. The first is related to physical limitations of the applied regenerative braking system, e. g. Electric Motor (E-Motor) power limits; energy storage device capacity and vehicle load transfer etc. The second limitation results from the potentially detrimental interaction between regenerative braking and the <b>Anti-locking</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> (ABS). The first type of limitation can, to some extent, be alleviated by suitable choice of hardware and, as a consequence, will not be discussed further in this paper. The second type of limitation concerns the regenerative braking strategies during an ABS event. Some of the regenerative braking strategies designed and investigated within the Low Carbon Vehicle Technology Project (LCVTP) will be described and analyzed in this paper. A comparison of competing strategies is made and conclusions are drawn together with suggestions for further research. The work has been progressed {{as a part of a}} major research programme; namely the LCVTP, which has been conducted within an extensive industrial and academic partnership, mutually funded by the European Regional Development Found and Advantage West Midlands...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new model for {{predicting}} the speed gradient of peak friction values on asphalt pavements based on surface characteristics. The innovative feature of the proposed model is the reliable estimation of peak friction values experienced by vehicles equipped with <b>anti-locking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> (ABS) at a certain vehicle speed. In order to define the experimental model, several types of Dense Asphalt Concrete (DAC) surface layers, with different surface characteristics, are analyzed by in situ tests. Friction {{is measured by the}} Skiddometer BV 11 and the British Pendulum Tester whilst texture properties are measured by a laser profilometer. The Rado model is used to predict peak friction values at 3 different vehicle speeds and, by using these data, the gradient of peak friction values is determined for each pavement section. The spectral analysis of pavement profile data allows to define a texture parameter that is negatively correlated with peak friction values; this parameter is introduced in a new formulation of the speed number SP* that {{is a measure of the}} pavement macrotexture influencing peak friction values. The speed number SP* is used in the new exponential model proposed to defining the gradient of peak friction values. The obtained results show the model is highly reliable and, as it enables to identify texture characteristics to be modified in order to optimize peak friction values, it is particularly useful for the optimization of the mix design and maintenance of pavement surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{last three}} decades have seen {{computers}} invading our society: computers are now present at work to improve productivity and at home to enlarge the scope of our hobbies and to communicate. Furthermore, computers {{have been involved in}} many critical <b>systems</b> such as <b>anti-locking</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> (ABS) in our cars, airplane control systems, space rockets, nuclear power plants, banking and trading systems, medical care systems, and so on. The importance of these systems requires a high level of trust in computer-based systems. For example, a failure in a trading system (even if it is temporary) may result in severe economical losses. Hence coping with failures is a key aspect of computer systems. A common approach to tolerate failures is to replicate a system that provides a critical service, so that once a failure occurs on a given replica, the requests to the critical service are still executed by other replicas. This approach has the advantage of masking failures, i. e., requests to the service are continuously executed even in the presence of failures. However, replication introduces a performance cost, mainly because the execution of the service requests must be coordinated among all replicas. Furthermore, despite its apparent simplicity, replication is rather complex to implement. Replication is made easier by group communication which defines several abstractions that can be used by the designer of replicated systems. The group communication abstractions are implemented by distributed protocols that compose a group communication middleware. The aim of the thesis is to study two techniques to improve the performance of group communication middleware, and thus, reduce the cost of replication. First, we study dynamic protocol update, which allows group communication middleware to adapt to environment changes. More particularly, dynamic protocol update consists in replacing at runtime a given protocol composing the group communication middleware with a similar but more efficient protocol. The thesis provides several solutions to dynamic protocol update. For instance, we describe two algorithms to dynamically replace consensus and atomic broadcast, two essential protocols of a group communication middleware. Second, we propose solutions to introduce concurrency within a group communication middleware in order to benefit from the advantages offered by multiprocessor (or multicore) computers...|$|R

It includes detailed studies of individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement.
