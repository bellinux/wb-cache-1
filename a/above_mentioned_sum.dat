5000|$|The said Messrs Watt and Boulton grant {{a license}} to the said company to erect a steam engine at the Whitegrit Mine with a {{cylinder}} of 30" [...] in diameter which will effectively and properly work a pump of 101/2" [...] in diameter, eight foot stroke and eight strokes/minute, {{to raise the water}} 60 yards and to consume only 136 lbs of coal per hour. The said company paying them the said Messrs Watt and Boulton £90 per year and that if the said engine shall by any accident that may happen thereto stand and not be worked for one month or more at any time they the said Messrs Watt and Boulton shall and will make to the said company an allowance of the <b>above</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>sum</b> or premium of £90 per year proportional to such space of time exceeding 30 days as the said engine shall stand without working at each such time of stopping. And they the said engineers also agree to send a proper person to the said mines to assist in putting the said engine together, the said company paying such person £1 6s 0d per week whilst he is employed by the said company. And they the said Joshua Blakeway, John Lawrence and Thomas Lloyd Anwyl on behalf of themselves {{and the rest of the}} said company agree to pay to the said Messrs Watt and Boulton for the considerations and subject to the allowances aforesaid the said sum or premium of £90 per year and also to the beforementioned proper person apportion the said sum of £1 6s 0d per week. In witness whereof the said parties have here unto signed their names the Day and Year above written.Witness Signed ..........John Scrymster ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to generalize two {{important}} results known for the Stratonovich and Itˆo integrals to any stochastic integral obtained as limit of Riemann sums with arbitrary evaluating point: the ordinary chain rule for certain nonlinear functions of the Brownian motion and the Wong–Zakai approximation theorem. To this scope we begin by introducing a new family of products for smooth random variables which reduces for specific choices of a parameter to the pointwise and to the Wick products. We show that each product in that family is related in a natural way to a precise choice of the evaluating point in the <b>above</b> <b>mentioned</b> Riemann <b>sums</b> and hence to a certain notion of stochastic integral. Our chain rule relies on a new probabilistic representation for the solution of the heat equation while the Wong–Zakai type theorem follows from a reduction method for quasi-linear SDEs together with a formula of Gjessing’s type...|$|R
40|$|Our {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to clarify the mechanism of polarographic filtrate reaction (in accordance with Muller's method), and the essential character of its reactive factor in cases of cancer and inflammatory diseases. And further to settle a conclusive base in the differential diagnosis between these two types of the diseases. The results of our investigations in the physico-chemical properties of this so-called filtrate substance are as shown in Table. Polarographic studies on the serum mucoprotein, extracted utilizing Winder's method, was made simultaneously, which was recognized to be identical with the <b>above</b> <b>mentioned</b> filtrate substance. <b>Summing</b> up these findings, it is our opinion that the essential character of the filtrate substance is in the category of Winder's mucoprotein, or according to K. Meyer's classification, to he in that of mucoprotein or mucoid. We are, however, not able to certify, in the present stage of the study, the difference between those of cancer and inflammatory diseases...|$|R
60|$|It is {{sometimes}} instructive {{to look back}} and see hour Destiny gave us a kick here, and Fate a shove there, that sent us in the right direction at the proper time. And when Stephen Brice looks backward now, he laughs to think that he did not suspect the Judge of being an ally of the two who are <b>mentioned</b> <b>above.</b> The <b>sum</b> total of Mr. Whipple's words and advices to him that summer had been these. Stephen was dressed more carefully than usual, in view of a visit to Bellefontaine Road. Whereupon the Judge demanded whether he were contemplating marriage. Without waiting for a reply he pointed to a rope and a slab of limestone on the pavement below, and waved his hand unmistakably toward the Mississippi.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyse the foreign trade of People's Republic of China during the {{specific}} period, from the reforms made in 1979 leading up to 2001 when China {{became a member of}} the World Trade Organization. The writer evaluates the changes that occurred in the period <b>mentioned</b> <b>above</b> and <b>sums</b> up the positive as well as the negative consequences of them. The thesis is aimed at showing the most important precautions that occurred after the initiation of the reform process. It also highlights the growing importance for China to embrace foreign trade. Within wider connections in the international economic relationships the writer pays attention to direct foreign investments coming to China, their structure, territory and importance for China. The writer also mentions the preparations of People's Republic of China to enter the World Trade Organization, the measures taken and the possible consequences for the further development of the country. The thesis is based on published materials and on the most recent qualified literature...|$|R
