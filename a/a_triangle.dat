50|$|Likewise, <b>a</b> <b>triangle's</b> {{circumcenter}} - {{the intersection}} of the three sides' perpendicular bisectors, which is the center of the circle that passes through all three vertices - falls inside <b>an</b> acute <b>triangle</b> but outside <b>an</b> obtuse <b>triangle.</b>|$|R

5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (<b>a</b> <b>triangle)</b> as fundamental domain. Such <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|Areas along Fishing Creek contain pools {{followed}} by riffles, which are further {{followed by}} more pools. This configuration of pools and riffles creates an ideal situation for fly-fishing. The {{lower part of}} the creek forms one side of <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> of low-lying land in western Bloomsburg, which floods severely during heavy rains.|$|E
5|$|Barycentric {{subdivision}} is {{an example}} of a subdivision rule with one edge type (that gets subdivided into two edges) and one tile type (<b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles). Any triangulated surface is a barycentric subdivision complex.|$|E
50|$|Since barycentric {{coordinates}} are all positive for {{a point in}} <b>a</b> <b>triangle's</b> interior {{but at least one}} is negative for a point in the exterior, and two of the {{barycentric coordinates}} are zero for a vertex point, the barycentric coordinates given for the orthocenter show that the orthocenter is in <b>an</b> acute <b>triangle's</b> interior, on the right-angled vertex of <b>a</b> right <b>triangle,</b> and exterior to <b>an</b> obtuse <b>triangle.</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{has also}} been claimed that Heron's formula for calculating the area of <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes. However, the first {{reliable}} reference to the formula is given by Heron of Alexandria in the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|At Cage Rage 24, Mann faced Jordan Miller, {{who took}} the fight at short notice. Mann {{was able to take}} Miller down almost {{immediately}} in the fight and took a rear naked choke. Mann dominated from that point and soon after, transitioned to <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> choke after just 53 seconds of the first round.|$|E
5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} <b>a</b> <b>triangle,</b> they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two. If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.|$|E

5|$|Each award {{consists}} of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> logo, based on the logo the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year and award category are etched on a small plaque on the base or on the plexiglass itself. A small cash stipend is awarded to winners in the Best Novel category. The cost of the awards is met through individual donations and fundraising events.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> with corners at Dakar, Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies {{believed that this}} area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through. As such, the Brazilian unit's mission was to patrol for mines laid by German minelaying submarines {{and to make sure}} that convoys passing through would be safe. Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condensers, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.|$|E

5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G {{is the same}} as a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 is the core of any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, {{during the}} battle of Cambrai, the Tank Corps adopted new tactics. Three tanks working {{together}} would advance in <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> formation, with the two rear tanks providing cover for an infantry platoon. The tanks were to create gaps in the barbed wire for the accompanying infantry to pass through, then use their armament to suppress the German strong points. The effectiveness of tank–infantry co-operation was demonstrated {{during the battle}}, when Major General George Montague Harper of the 51st (Highland) Division refused to co-operate with the tanks, a decision that compelled them to move forward without any infantry support; the result was the destruction of more than 12 tanks by German artillery sighted behind bunkers.|$|E
