5|$|Although the {{marriage}} had been strained from the beginning, Teresa Cristina continued striving to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>wife.</b> Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, {{along with the}} birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and their concern for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness. That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. After the birth of their first son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>wife</b> like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E

25|$|Lord Lowborough, {{a friend}} of Huntingdon's and Anabella's husband, is apathetic but devoted. Melancholic, dour and gloomy, he is in {{complete}} contrast to Huntingdon. He used to gamble and drink too much alcohol and developed an addiction to opium, but after his financial ruin gradually reforms himself. Lowborough truly loves Annabella, and her infidelity brings him such suffering that only his Christian faith and strong will keep him from suicide. Later he divorces her and after some time marries a plain middle-aged woman, who makes <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>wife</b> to him and a stepmother to his children with Annabella — {{a son and a}} nominal daughter. Lord Lowborough also has some resemblances to Branwell, such as a life of debauchery, periods of remorse/religious torments, and opium, as well as moral weakness.|$|E
25|$|Eve is {{the second}} human created by God, taken from one of Adam's ribs and shaped into a female form of Adam. Far from the {{traditional}} model of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>wife,</b> she is often unwilling to be submissive towards Adam. She is more intelligent and curious about external ideas than her husband. Though happy, she longs for knowledge and, more specifically, self-knowledge. Her first act in existence is {{to turn away from}} Adam and look at and ponder her own reflection. Eve is extremely beautiful and thoroughly in love with Adam, though may feel suffocated by his constant presence. In Book IX, she convinces Adam that {{it would be good for}} them to split up and work different parts of the Garden. In her solitude, she is tempted by Satan to sin against God. Adam shortly follows along with her.|$|E

Mick and Linda do not witness this, and Ollie seems fine so Linda {{says he does not}} need medical attention. However, she later finds him not breathing, and when she resuscitates him, he suffers a seizure. In hospital, the family are {{informed}} that Ollie could have brain damage; Mick blames Nancy and says he cannot forgive her, but Linda defends her and eventually forces them to work together to get Ollie the medical care he needs. Mick is devastated at Dean's acquittal but Linda reassures him. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a miscarriage but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. Mick struggles look after his family when Linda goes to Spain to look after her ill mother Elaine who suffers a stroke during the Christmas break. Mick is then unhappy to learn that Lee's depression has made him contemplate suicide and that he is in debt, which Mick offers to pay. When Whitney is injured in a bus crash, Mick accompanies her to the hospital and after he assures her that she is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>wife</b> to Lee, she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish).|$|E

Mimi sternly criticised Cynthia for divorcing Lennon—and letting him start a {{relationship}} with Yoko Ono—by saying she should have stopped him from making [...] "an idiot of himself". Even though Mimi was described as domineering, Ono later compared herself to her when describing her own relationship with Lennon. She later admitted that Ono was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>wife</b> and mother. After Lennon's death, Ono and Sean Lennon visited Mimi in Liverpool, where she was staying at her sister Anne's house because of a heart condition. She said, [...] "Sean is like John in every way—looks and manner—and he has got John's sense of humour. As long as he keeps away from music, he will be all right".|$|E

2500|$|Also {{known as}} matianak or kuntilanak, {{it is the}} ghost of a {{stillborn}} female. To prevent this, as with its mother the lang suir, a needle is placed in each of the corpse's hands and a hen's egg under each armpit. Depicted as an ugly woman wiith sharp nails and a white dress, the pontianak can also {{take the form of a}} beautiful young woman or a night-bird. When she is close, she gives off a strong smell of frangipani. It is usually encountered by the roadside or under a tree, and attack men and drink their blood. The Indonesian kuntilanak, however, typically uses its bird form to attack virgin women. The bird, which makes a [...] "ke-ke-ke" [...] sound as it flies, may be sent through black magic to make a woman sick, the characteristic symptom being vaginal bleeding. A pontianak can be made into <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>wife,</b> by placing a nail into the hole at the nape of its neck (called Sundel Bolong). Modern popular culture often confuses the pontianak with its mother the lang suir. However, traditional myth is clear that the pontianak is {{the ghost of a}} dead baby and not a pregnant woman. A similar ghost called tiyanak exists in Philippine lore.|$|E
2500|$|ReelViews' James Berardinelli said Enough is {{director}} [...] " [...] Apted at his most commercial, and, unfortunately, his least compelling." [...] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice called Campbell the film's [...] "primary power source", [...] "His steely gaze and overbearing quietude are forever tainted; [...] "Once and Again" [...] doesn't {{stand a chance}} in Lifetime reruns". Robert Koehler of Variety was negative, [...] "Enough, a thriller detailing how <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>wife</b> gets back at an evil, possessive husband, is never provocative enough to generate strong emotional response." [...] Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert called the film [...] "tacky material" [...] {{and was surprised to}} [...] "see a director like Michael Apted and an actress like Jennifer Lopez" [...] involved in it. Paula Nechack of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Enough [...] "implausible and ugly" [...] and felt that it had already been done by actresses including Julia Roberts and Ashley Judd, and its script was [...] "more than enough of a mess to tarnish her box-office luster." [...] Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide reviewed the film negatively, but praised the ending sequence, [...] "If ever a movie was undermined by its packaging, it's this formulaic thriller about a resourceful battered wife and the brutal husband who won't let her go [...] the entire promotional campaign is driven by the last 20 minutes, in which Slim becomes a lean, mean fighting machine and kicks the bastard's ass". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club said [...] "the film's idiocy works for Lopez: Every diva needs at least one camp classic on her résumé", while Desson Thomson from the Washington Post emphasized his disappointment with the film, stating: [...] "In terms of actual social conscience, the movie gets a demagogic, rabble-rousing F.
