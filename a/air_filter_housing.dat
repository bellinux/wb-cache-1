The PUREX facility is currently in surveillance and maintenance mode. During a State of Washington, Department of Health (WDOH) 291 -A-l emission unit inspection, {{a small amount of}} corrosion was observed {{at the base of a}} high-efficiency particulate <b>air</b> (HEPA) <b>filter</b> <b>housing.</b> A series of internal and external inspections identified the source of the corrosion material as oxidation of a small section of one of the carbon steel I-beams that provides support to the stainless steel <b>filter</b> <b>housing.</b> The inspections confirmed the corrosion is isolated to one I-beam support location and does not represent any compromise of the structural support or <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> integrity. Further testing and inspections of the support beam corrosion and its cause were conducted but did not determine the cause. No definitive evidence was found to support any degradation of the housing. Although no degradation of the housing was found, a conservative approach will be implemented. The following actions will be taken: (1) The current operating <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> No. 9 will be removed from service. (2) The only remaining available filter housings (No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3) will be placed in service. These filter housings have new HEPA filters fitted with stainless steel frames and faceguards which were installed in the spring of 2007. (3) Filter housings No. 5 and No. 10 will be put on standby as backups. To document the assessment of the unit, a draft ALARACT <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> demonstration for the PUREX <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> was prepared, and informally provided to WDOH on August 7, 2008. A follow up WDOH response to the draft ALARACT <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> demonstration for the PUREX <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> questioned whether deteriorated galvanized filter faceguards discovered during an internal <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> inspection met American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) AG-l or Military Specification (MIL) 51068 standards. The filter system was designed and installed prior to the issuance of AG-l, February 1986; however, MIL 51068 did require galvanized faceguards. The faceguards are not necessary for filtration or structural purposes; it is concluded that the system is in compliance with the intent of the applicable standard.

40|$|An <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> is a {{significant}} element of any mechanical ventilation system. However, the importance and performance evaluation of <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> have not been well publicized and related scientific reports are scarce. In this study, a transportable, off-line, air filter-testing unit (the Unit) was designed and utilized to simulate the <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> of a mechanical ventilation system. The Unit was designed, assembled, and operated in a laboratory. To demonstrate the applications of the Unit, a series of <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> handling and installation scenarios was performed to determine the characteristic curve and capture efficiencies of a selected set of HEPA filters. The research project produced a transportable, closed system <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> testing unit.

These engines were fitted {{to a wide range of}} vehicles, from Ford Transit vans to sedans, coup√©s like the Ford Capri and sports cars like TVR and Marcos. The earlier versions of engine were rated at 128 hp ( [...] 95 kW [...] ) and 173 lb/ft of torque, around October 1971 the engine was revised by modifying the camshaft and cylinder heads that improved the power and torque to produce 157 SAE Hp or 138 DIN hp (103 kW) at 5000 rpm and 192 SAE lb/ft or 174 DIN lb/ft of torque at 3000 rpm. At the same time, the oil disptick was moved from the front of the engine to the side, the inlet manifold was improved from earlier models, and the compression ratio was raised slightly from 8.9:1 to 9.0:1 due to a change of the piston design. The shape of the inlet ports were also changed, from an O-port design to a D-port design which improved the flow characteristics of the heads, the old Weber 40 DFAV carburetor that was prone to over-fueling and resulting bore wash was replaced by the Weber 38 DGAS Carburetor, the <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> was also changed and later around 1976 and a hot air intake was added consisting of a metal pipe running from the top of a plate welded on the exhaust manifold or header to an opening in the air intake to prevent the carburetor from icing and making the engine warm up quicker, the carburetor was also modified again and a return style fuel system was adopted and a vacuum operated choke in the <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> were also added, this and a Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system were also early forms of emissions control. The camshaft gear was also made slightly stronger by using steel with nylon teeth instead of being completely made from nylon as on previous ones. Aftermarket steel, aluminium, and alloy gears have been produced as replacements to prevent the gear from stripping its teeth: this is commonly due to overheating causing the nylon to weaken.

Older studies of carbureted gasoline vehicles have indicated that replacing a clogged or dirty <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> can improve vehicle fuel economy and, conversely, that a dirty <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> can be significantly detrimental to fuel economy. In contrast, a recent study showed that the fuel economy of modern gasoline vehicles is virtually unaffected by filter clogging due to the closed loo...|$|R
40|$|There are {{presented}} design solutions and operation properties of <b>air</b> inlet <b>filters</b> of motor vehicles and sports cars. An {{analysis of the}} impact of the use of a sports car <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> in a passenger car was performed. The effect of this change on the increase in power and torque in several car engines was shown. The conditions and methodology of sports car <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> studies have been developed. A research stand with a particle counter was presented. The test results on the characteristics of efficiency and accuracy filtration and flow resistance of two sports <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> were presented. Each filter was tested at a different filtration rate. The dust absorption coefficient of the sport filter was determined. The dust particle fraction in the air purified behind the filter was calculated. Keywords: engine, <b>air</b> <b>filter,</b> sports filter, filtration efficiency and filtration accuracy, flow resistance, dust absorption coefficient, particle siz...|$|R

40|$|Early life is {{a dynamic}} period of growth for the lung and immune system. We {{hypothesized}} that ambient ozone exposure during postnatal development can affect the innate immune response to other environmental challenges in a persistent fashion. To test this hypothesis, we exposed infant rhesus macaque monkeys to a regimen of 11 ozone cycles between 30 days and 6 mo of age; each cycle consisted of ozone for 5 days (0. 5 parts per million at 8 h/day) followed by 9 days of <b>filtered</b> <b>air.</b> Animals were subsequently <b>housed</b> in <b>filtered</b> <b>air</b> conditions and challenged with a single dose of inhaled LPS at 1 yr of age. After completion of the ozone exposure regimen at 6 mo of age, total peripheral blood leukocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) numbers were reduced, whereas eosinophil counts increased. In lavage, total cell numbers at 6 mo were not affected by ozone, however, {{there was a significant}} reduction in lymphocytes and increased eosinophils. Following an additional 6 mo of <b>filtered</b> <b>air</b> <b>housing,</b> only monocytes were increased in blood and lavage in previously exposed animals. In response to LPS challenge, animals with a prior history of ozone showed an attenuated peripheral blood and lavage PMN response compared with controls. In vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with LPS resulted in reduced secretion of IL- 6 and IL- 8 protein in association with prior ozone exposure. Collectively, our findings suggest that ozone exposure during infancy can result in a persistent effect on both pulmonary and systemic innate immune responses later in life...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{research}} {{is to determine the}} influence by the small dispersive coal dust particles of the different fractional consistence on the technical characteristics of the vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> at nuclear power plant. The research on the transport properties of the small dispersive coal dust particles in the granular filtering medium of absorber in the vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> is completed in the case, when the modeled aerodynamic conditions are similar to the real aerodynamic conditions. It is shown that the appearance of the different fractional consistence of small dispersive coal dust particles with the decreasing dimensions down to the micro and nano sizes at the action of the air dust aerosol stream normally results in a significant change of distribution of the small dispersive coal dust particles masses in the granular filtering medium of an absorber in the vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter,</b> changing the vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> aerodynamic characteristics. The precise characterization of the aerodynamic resistance of a model of the vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> is completed. The comparative analysis of the technical characteristics of the vertical and horizontal iodine <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> is also made.
