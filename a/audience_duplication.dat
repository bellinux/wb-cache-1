40|$|The move to high-choice media environments {{has sparked}} fears over {{audience}} fragmentation. We analyze news audiences across media platforms (print, television, and online) in 6 countries, going beyond platform-specific, single-country studies. We find surprisingly {{high levels of}} news <b>audience</b> <b>duplication,</b> but also that cross-platform audiences vary from country to country, with fragmentation higher in Denmark and the United Kingdom than in Spain and the United States. We find no support for the idea that online audiences are more fragmented than offline audiences, countering fears associated with audience segmentation and filter bubbles. Because all communication exists {{in the context of}} its audience, our analysis has implications across the field, underlining the importance of research into how trends play out in different contexts...|$|E

Yet the tools we use to study fragmentationprovide limited informationabouthowpeople allocate their attention across digital media. We offer a theoretical framework for understanding fragmentation and advocate for more audience-centric studies. This approach is operationalized by applying network analysis metrics to Nielsen data on television and Internet use. We find extremely high levels of <b>audience</b> <b>duplication</b> across 236 media outlets, suggesting overlapping patterns of public attention rather than isolated groups of audience loyalists. doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1460 - 2466. 2011. 01616. x One {{of the most widely}} observed consequences of the growth in digital media is audience fragmentation. As more offerings are delivered on broadband networks and more choices are available ‘‘on-demand,’ ’ patterns of consumption become more widely distributed. Although some celebrate these changes as signaling a more responsive marketplace and robust public sphere (e. g., Anderson, 2006; Benkler, 2006), others see cause for concern. To them, fragmentation spells the end of a common cultural forum, or worse, the birth of media enclaves and ‘‘sphericules’...|$|E
40|$|The author shows {{one way to}} estímate the net {{cumulative}} {{coverage and}} frequency distribution of a print schedule from the duplicated audiences of pairs of publications and pairs of issues. ESPITE AN ABUNDANCE of information little dreamed of a decade ago, the media planner still lacks {{some of the basic}} tools he needs. This is particularly true in the case of <b>audience</b> <b>duplication.</b> When a schedule encompasses both print and broadcast media, assessing the number of different people reached is largely a matter of guesswork. Generally, the net coverage o £ print and broadcast are estimated separately. But when it comes to marrying these two parts together, the amount of duplication is either guessed at or ignored. D Moreover, print coverage, based on average-issue readership, ignores the effect of repeat reading of different issues of the same publication. As early as 1953, Alfred Politz demonstrated that this cumulative readership is far from negligible: whereas an average issue of Life was read by 22. 1 percent of individuals, this figure increased to 50. 6 per cent over six issues. It would not be rash to say that most net coverage estimates bear little resemblance to fact. (Note: the word "readership, " used here in the European sense...|$|E
40|$|The well {{recognised}} and parsimonious Dirichlet {{model of}} buyer behaviour (Goodhardt, Ehrenberg and Chatfield 1984) has summarised {{a number of}} empirical generalisations about market structures and buyer behaviour. These generalisations have been described by Sharp, Wright and Goodhardt (2002) as: Differences in market share can be attributed largely to differences in market penetration A double jeopardy pattern emerges, with smaller brands having a lower average purchase frequency, share of category requirements, and proportion of sole buyers A brand’s customers buy from other brands more frequently Sole buyers {{tend to be very}} rare, and are also very light buyers Heavy buyers buy more brands and are very unlikely to be sole buyers Brands share their customers in proportion to their market share (Duplication of Purchase Law). Of these empirical generalisations, double jeopardy, polygamous loyalty and the duplication of purchase law are amongst the better known. They have been observed across an increasing number of product categories, countries and differing market conditions. This thesis considers whether the Dirichlet and its accompanying empirical generalisations also hold true for radio markets. Whilst Goodhardt, Ehrenberg and Collins (1975) and Barwise and Ehrenberg (1988) have considered television and its audiences there has been very little study into radio audience patterns. Perhaps this is because many researchers consider radio to be more like television than any other media. However, Lees (2003, 2006) has started to address the issues of radio market structures and radio audience patterns. This thesis adopts an empirical generalist approach showing the Dirichlet model of consumer behaviour and its associated empirical generalizations appear to apply to radio markets in that they: Show a high correlation between market share and the brand performance measures of: cumulative audience, average time spent listening, share of category requirements and exclusive audience Reflect the double jeopardy pattern with those stations that have a higher market share also having a higher penetration or cumulative audience and a higher average weekly time spent listening. Conversely those stations with a low market share having a lower cumulative audience and a lower average weekly time spent listening Show <b>audience</b> <b>duplication</b> between radio stations that varies according to each stations’ market cumulative audience, in accordance with the Duplication of Purchase Law Have the percentage of listeners loyal to one radio station reflecting the Dirichlet’s expectation of low exclusive audience. These exclusive listeners also reflect a double jeopardy pattern with the bigger stations having more exclusive listeners than the smaller stations. The most compelling result of this thesis is the apparent ability of the Dirichlet to describe a radio market place. Thus has managerial implications – especially to what extent a manager should take the patterns as ‘normal’ or seek to ‘buck the trend’. The conclusion is that radio station managers need to carefully manage their station working with the market rather than trying to ‘buck the trend’. This is likely to involve station managers actively promoting their stations to ensure that their station remains salient to its current listeners while also trying to increase its awareness amongst non listeners. This thesis has also made several contributions to knowledge about the Dirichlet. First, it has extended knowledge about the model to a new area – that of radio listening. Second, it has shown that while some radio listening seemingly violates some of the assumptions behind the model it is still robust enough to account for variations in multivariate count data {{in a manner that is}} parsimonious. Third, it has confirmed the known boundary condition that the Dirichlet does under-predict sole loyal purchase frequency. This thesis also calls for further research into both the Dirichlet model with further extensions to differentiated product categories; and into the question of radio audience measurement. It calls for the New Zealand Radio Broadcasters Association to commission a report into the effect of introducing portable people meters as a form of audience measurement...|$|E
