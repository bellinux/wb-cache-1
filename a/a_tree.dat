5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> by eating through the trunk.|$|E

In another incident, <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> was blown onto a home on Campbellton Street, causing damage to the structure. Several trees and power lines down in Fulton County, with the worst damage in the southwest portions of the county. Several of trees were also down in the Roswell area. The Roswell Cat Clinic was forced to close when a large tree damaged the facility. Also, a home in North Atlanta was damaged when a large oak tree fell on its deck.

5|$|A polytree is a {{directed}} graph formed by orienting {{the edges of}} a free tree. Every polytree is a DAG. In particular, {{this is true of}} the arborescences formed by directing all edges outwards from the roots of <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
25|$|From a {{graph theory}} perspective, binary (and K-ary) trees as defined here are {{actually}} arborescences. <b>A</b> binary <b>tree</b> may thus be also called a bifurcating arborescence—a term which appears in some very old programming books, before the modern computer science terminology prevailed. It {{is also possible}} to interpret <b>a</b> binary <b>tree</b> as <b>an</b> undirected, rather than a directed graph, in which case <b>a</b> binary <b>tree</b> is <b>an</b> ordered, rooted <b>tree.</b> Some authors use rooted binary tree instead of binary tree to emphasize {{the fact that the}} tree is rooted, but as defined above, <b>a</b> binary <b>tree</b> is always rooted. <b>A</b> binary <b>tree</b> is <b>a</b> special case of <b>an</b> ordered K-ary <b>tree,</b> where k is 2.|$|R
