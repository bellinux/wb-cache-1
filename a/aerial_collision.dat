25|$|In {{the first}} half of the match Wales were on top, with Scotland only {{managing}} to score four points overall, two penalties by Danny Brough. Richard Fletcher had been carried off after an <b>aerial</b> <b>collision,</b> which caused the game to be stopped for six minutes. At half time the score was 14–4 in favour of the Dragons, meaning Scotland would not qualify. In the 52nd minute Ben Fisher darted over the line to score Scotland's first try. Importantly this was converted by Danny Brough. And with seven minutes remaining Jamie Benn latched onto Mick Nanyn's speculative pass to score Scotland's second try, which Brough converted. Wales scored late on but it was not enough. The match finished Scotland 16–18 Wales, with an aggregate score of Scotland 37–32, and Mick Nanyn received Man of the Match award.|$|E
25|$|Dempsey {{was not in}} the {{starting}} XI for the first three matches of the 2007–08 season, but after an injury to Brian McBride, he came into the side as a striker and scored in a 2–1 defeat against Aston Villa. He followed this up by scoring in Fulham's next fixture in a 3–3 home draw against Tottenham on September 1. Two weeks later, he opened the scoring in Fulham's 1–1 away draw against Wigan Athletic. These goals gave Dempsey three in as many games. On September 29, Dempsey was involved in an <b>aerial</b> <b>collision</b> with John Terry during a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge which resulted in Terry later being substituted. There was some suggestion that Dempsey used a deliberate elbow on Terry; however, he wasn't punished for the incident as referee Martin Atkinson didn't report it to The Football Association (The FA). On November 3, Dempsey scored during Fulham's 3–1 home win over Reading to secure just a second league win of the season. He scored his last goals of the season in a 1–1 home draw with Wigan Athletic and a 5–1 away loss to Tottenham in December. In May 2008, Fulham announced Dempsey had signed a contract extension which would keep him at the club until the summer of 2010. Fulham beat Portsmouth 1–0 {{on the final day of}} the season to secure Premier League status for another year. He ended the season as Fulham's top Premier League goalscorer with six goals.|$|E

40|$|A small {{low-cost}} {{motion detector}} would have widespread applications in visual control {{systems such as}} miniature unmanned <b>aerial</b> vehicles and <b>collision</b> avoidance systems. In the last 20 years a number of analog VLSI chips have been developed which incorporate both photodetection and motion computation on the same chip. Nevertheless, artificial real-time vision and simple seeing systems remain a massive challenge mainly because the environment greatly impacts on their performance. On the other hand, biological systems have, through years of evolution, {{come up with a}} number of simple but clever solutions. The Reichardt Correlator is a biologically inspired model for motion detection. However, the basic model is not a robust estimator of velocity. The accuracy and reliability of this model can be significantly improved through various elaborations. VLSI is ideally suited to the parallel processing seen in nature because it allows for high device integration density and complex implementation of complex functions. Howsoever, VLSI poses some serious bounds on the types of elaborations that can be implemented. We have explored this problem and will present a number of improved models with robust outputs that are practical in terms of real time implementation in microchips.

40|$|SummaryAnimals must quickly {{recognize}} {{objects in}} their environment and act accordingly. Previous studies indicate that looming visual objects trigger avoidance reflexes in many species [1 – 5]; however, such reflexes operate over a close range and might not detect a threatening stimulus at a safe distance. We analyzed how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) respond to simple visual stimuli both in free flight and in a tethered-flight simulator. Whereas Drosophila, like many other insects, are attracted toward long vertical objects [6 – 10], we found that smaller visual stimuli elicit not weak attraction but rather strong repulsion. Because aversion to small spots depends on the vertical size of a moving object, and not on looming, it can function at a much greater distance than expansion-dependent reflexes. The opposing responses to long stripes and small spots reflect a simple but effective object classification system. Attraction toward long stripes would lead flies toward vegetative perches or feeding sites, whereas repulsion from small spots would help them avoid <b>aerial</b> predators or <b>collisions</b> with other insects. The motion of flying Drosophila depends on a balance of these two systems, providing a foundation for studying the neural basis of behavioral choice in a genetic model organism...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{level of}} human {{interaction}} with Unmanned Aerial Systems varies greatly from {{remotely piloted aircraft}} to fully autonomous systems. In the latter end of the spectrum, the challenge lies in designing effective algorithms to dictate {{the behavior of the}} autonomous agents. A swarm of autonomous Unmanned <b>Aerial</b> Vehicles requires <b>collision</b> avoidance and formation flight algorithms to negotiate environmental challenges it may encounter during the execution of its mission, which may include obstacles and chokepoints. In this work, a simple algorithm is developed to allow a formation of autonomous vehicles to perform point to point navigation while avoiding obstacles and navigating through chokepoints. Emphasis is placed on maintaining formation structures. Rather than breaking formation and individually navigating around the obstacle or through the chokepoint, vehicles are required to assemble into appropriately sized/shaped sub-formations, bifurcate around the obstacle or negotiate the chokepoint, and reassemble into the original formation at {{the far side of the}} obstruction. The algorithm receives vehicle and environmental properties as inputs and outputs trajectories for each vehicle from start to the desired ending location. Simulation results show that the algorithm safely routes all vehicles past the obstruction while adhering to the aforementioned requirements. The formation adapts and successfully negotiates the obstacles and chokepoints in its path while maintaining proper vehicle separation...|$|R

Drawn away to fellow Championship side Leeds United, they prepared for the match by giving squad numbers to several youth players. Colin Doyle made his second appearance {{of the season in}} goal, and, with all senior strikers missing through injury or suspension, Ravel Morrison and Nathan Redmond played up front. Morrison's running put pressure on the Leeds defence, who were punished when Wade Elliott ran from deep before unleashing a [...] "stunning long-range shot" [...] to take the lead.

These were used to boost the takeoff performance of their medium bombers, and the enormous 55-meter wingspan Gigant, Messerschmitt Me 321 glider, conceived in 1940 for the invasion of Britain, and used to supply the Russian front. The enormous Me 321s originally had air tow assistance from up to three Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters in a so-called Troika-Schlepp arrangement into the air with loads {{that would have made}} the takeoff run too long otherwise, but with much attendant risk of <b>aerial</b> <b>collision</b> from the trio of vee-formation Bf 110s involved in a simultaneous towplane function, meant to be greatly eased with the substitution of the trio of Bf 110s with a single example of the unusual, twin-fuselage Heinkel He 111Z purpose-designed five-engined towplane. The use of reaction-assisted takeoff methods became especially important late in the war when the lengths of usable runways were severely curtailed due to the results of Allied bombing. Their system typically used jettisonable, self-contained Walter HWK 109-500 or -501 Starthilfe ("takeoff-help"), unitized liquid-fuel monopropellant rocket booster units whose engines driven by chemical decomposition of [...] "T-Stoff", essentially almost pure hydrogen peroxide, with a Z-Stoff catalytic compound. [...] A parachute pack at the blunt-contour front of the motor's exterior housing was used to slow its fall after being released from the plane, so the system could be re-used. First experiments were held in 1937 on an Heinkel He 111, piloted by test-pilot Erich Warsitz at Neuhardenberg, a large field about 70 kilometres east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war. Other German experiments with JATO were aimed at assisting the launch of interceptor aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 262C, as the Heimatschützer special versions, usually fitted with either a version of the Walter HWK 109-509 liquid fuelled rocket engine from the Me 163 Komet program either in the extreme rear of the fuselage or semi-"podded" [...] beneath it just behind the wing's trailing edge, to assist its Junkers Jumo 004 turbojets, or a pair of specially rocket-boosted BMW 003R combination jet-rocket powerplants in place of the Jumo 004s, so that the Me 262C Heimatschützer interceptors could reach enemy bomber formations sooner.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of accurate self-motion {{information from the}} visual world is a difficult problem that has been solved very efficiently by biological organisms utilizing non-linear processing. Previous bio-inspired models for motion detection based on a correlation mechanism have been dogged by issues that arise from their sensitivity to undesired properties of the image, such as contrast, which vary widely between images. Here we present a model with multiple levels of non-linear dynamic adaptive components based directly on the known or suspected responses of neurons within the visual motion pathway of the fly brain. By testing the model under realistic high-dynamic range conditions we show that the addition of these elements makes the motion detection model robust across a large variety of images, velocities and accelerations. Furthermore {{the performance of the}} entire system is more than the incremental improvements offered by the individual components, indicating beneficial non-linear interactions between processing stages. The algorithms underlying the model can be implemented in either digital or analog hardware, including neuromorphic analog VLSI, but defy an analytical solution due to their dynamic non-linear operation.

Test flights with a single intruder aircraft of the same class were carried out to demonstrate autonomous noncooperative unmanned <b>aerial</b> system (UAS) <b>collision</b> avoidance capability and to evaluate the level of achievable situational awareness. First, the adopted architecture and the developed tracking algorithm are presented. Subsequently, flight data gathered in various relative flight geometries, covering chasing flights and quasi-frontal encounters, are analyzed in terms of radar performance, including detection range and range and angle measurement accuracies. The analysis describes the impact of ground echoes and navigation uncertainties, system tracking reliability, and achievable accuracy in estimation of relative position and velocity. On the basis of Global Positioning System (GPS) data gathered simultaneously with obstacle detection flight experiments, a detailed error analysis is conducted. Special emphasis {{is given to the}} validation of proposed methodology to separate between intruder and ground echoes, which is a critical aspect for light aircraft due to their limited radar cross sections (RCS) and flight altitudes.
