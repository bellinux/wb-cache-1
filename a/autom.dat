Such knowledge integration often requires the schema expressed in one knowledge modelling language {{be translated into}} an equivalent schema in another knowledge modelling language.

The spirit of rock should be that: outside of the norm, not just mainstream and predictable." [...] The music video originally shot for their lead single [...] "Lonely Boy" [...] employed a big budget and several people, but the band decided instead to release a one-shot video consisting solely of footage of an extra-actor and part-time security guard Derrick Tuggle-dancing. The video went viral, garnering more than 400,000 views on YouTube in 24 hours. On October 9, 2011, the band placed an ad in the Akron Beacon Journal advertising their used tour van as a [...] "1994 El Camino" [...] for sale.

[...] The phone number in the ad led to a recorded message of Patrick Carney describing the car and asking for the caller to leave a message. The band launched the promotional website WannaBuyAVan.com with a video parodying a low-budget used car commercial for the same van.

40|$|Abstract. Current dataintegration systems allow avariety of {{heterogeneous}} structured or semi-structured {{data sources}} {{to be combined}} and queried by providing an integrated view over them. The Semantic Web also requires {{us to be able}} to integrate information from a variety of heterogeneous information sources. However, these information sources will also include natural language (e. g. web pages) and ontologies. In this paper we describeanarchitecture which combines the data integration approach with techniques from Information Extraction in order to allow information from ontologies and natural language sources to be integrated with other, semantically related, structured or semi-structured data. Our architecture is based on the <b>AutoMed</b> data integration system, and in this paper we describe several extensions which have been made to <b>AutoMed</b> in order to support this work, including adding RDF to the data sources supported by <b>AutoMed</b> and providing a repository for the data and metadata discovered by the Information Extraction process. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a problem of}} on-line parameter identification of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In the previous study, on the actuation side, both distributed (SIAM J. Optim. Control 1997; 35 : 678 – 713; IEEE Trans. <b>Autom.</b> Control 2000; 45 : 203 – 216) and boundary (IEEE Trans. <b>Autom.</b> Control 2000; 45 : 203 – 216) actuations were considered in the open loop, whereas for the closed loop (unstable plants) only distributed one was addressed. On the sensing side, only distributed sensing was considered. The present study goes beyond the identification framework of (SIAM J. Optim. Control 1997; 35 : 678 – 713; IEEE Trans. <b>Autom.</b> Control 2000; 45 : 203 – 216) by considering boundary actuation for the unstable plants, resulting in the closed-loop identification, and also introducing boundary sensing. This makes the proposed technique applicable to a much broader range of practical problems. As a first step towards the identification of general reaction–advection–diffusion systems, we consider two benchmark plants: one with an uncertain parameter in the domain {{and the other with}} an uncertain parameter on the boundary. We design the adaptive identifier that consists of standard gradient/least-squares estimators and backstepping adaptive controllers. The parameter estimates are shown to converge to the true parameters when the closed-loop system is excited by an additional constant input at the boundary. The results ar...|$|E
40|$|Autochthony is {{the belief}} that the first {{occupants}} of a territory are its rightful owners with the most right to decide on national matters. Previous work focused on the use of autochthony to reserve political and economic privileges for the country’s dominant majority while justifying discrimination against immigrants. The present study argues that autochthony is not about outright exclusion. Instead, autochthony is about defining the boundaries wherein immigrants can be tolerated. The present study tested a novel framework – The Autochthony Orientations Model (<b>AUTOM)</b> – to see if the ‘boundary setting’ perspective is substantiated. The <b>AUTOM</b> consists of two orthogonal dimensions – support for autochthony and a preference for equality – that define four attitudinal orientations towards immigrants. This model was tested with an American community sample (n = 297). A factor analysis indicated that both dimensions were, indeed, orthogonal and weakly correlated. The model contained two key predictions. Firstly, supporters of autochthony and its exclusive privileges would feel threatened by immigrants insofar as they view immigrants as competitors for those privileges. In turn, this sense of threat would lead to greater anti-immigrant prejudice. Secondly, the indirect relationship between autochthony and prejudice would be weakened when locals have greater preferences for equality, reserve fewer privileges for themselves, and hence feel less threatened by immigrants. Results supported these predictions in relation to attitudes towards immigrants and the ‘Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 ’. To wit, the <b>AUTOM</b> provides a new conceptualisation of autochthony that can inform future academic and political pursuits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{heterogeneous}} {{data warehousing}} environments, autonomous data sources are {{integrated into a}} materialised integrated database. The schemas of the data sources and the integrated database may be expressed in different modelling languages. It is possible for either the data source schemas or the warehouse schema to evolve. This evolution may include evolution of the schema, or evolution of the modelling language in which the schema is expressed, or both. In such scenarios, {{it is important for}} the integration framework to be evolvable, so that the previous integration effort can be reused as much as possible. This paper describes how the <b>AutoMed</b> heterogeneous data integration toolkit can be used to handle the problem of schema evolution in heterogeneous data warehousing environments. This problem has been addressed before for specific data models, but <b>AutoMed</b> has the ability to cater for multiple data models, and for changes to the data model. ...|$|R
