40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the fire protection and life safety features for UW Medicine Lake Union, a research and laboratory building, in accordance with Seattle Building Code (SBC), International Building Code (IBC), and Life Safety Code (NFPA 101). The objective of this report is to identify if UW Medicine Lake Union meets both the prescriptive and performance based code. The primary fire safety goal is to provide life safety system that reduced the risk of fire-related injuries and loss of life due to fire. The prescriptive analysis is used to identify the building integrity per code. This evaluates the egress capacity, fire detection, fire suppression and structural fire protection. The UW Medicine Lake Union includes numerous laboratories that regularly utilize various hazardous materials. According to the literature in the Architectural drawings, the design team worked with the university does that the chemical quantities in these areas would not exceed the limits set forth in the code. With these limits in place, portions of the facility {{did not need to be}} classified as hazardous occupancy, and the special provisions associated with a hazardous occupancy. Although its spaces are used in various ways, the building was able to be classified as business occupancy. Hazardous occupancy areas were not required because hazardous materials were limited to the code-defined exempt quantities. These details helped simplify the overall life safety and egress system, while providing appropriated levels of life safety. UW Medicine Lake Union Building is high rise building with seven story research and development laboratory and two levels of below grade parking garages. It includes testing and research laboratories, laboratory support, offices and conference room. It is approximately 317, 382 square feet in gross area and a building height of 109 feet.
