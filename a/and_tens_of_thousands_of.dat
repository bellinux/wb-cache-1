5|$|Gravitational {{redshift}} {{was first}} measured {{in a laboratory}} setting in 1959 by Pound and Rebka. It is also seen in astrophysical measurements, notably for light escaping the white dwarf Sirius B. The related gravitational time dilation effect has been measured by transporting atomic clocks to altitudes of between tens <b>and</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> kilometers (first by Hafele and Keating in 1971; most accurately to date by Gravity Probe A launched in 1976).|$|E

The UN withdrew most of its personnel, but the Dili compound had been flooded with refugees.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, Nasser nationalized all {{remaining}} British and French {{assets in}} Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer tax incentives and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them {{a part of his}} economic development organization. He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands. This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product <b>and</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union {{in the construction of the}} Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi took {{leadership}} of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him <b>and</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan.

5|$|Auschwitz I {{was first}} {{constructed}} to hold Polish political prisoners, {{who began to}} arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941, and Auschwitz II–Birkenau {{went on to become}} a major site of the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question. From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered Jews to the camp's gas chambers from all over German-occupied Europe, where they were killed en masse with the pesticide Zyklon B. An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to the camp, of whom at least 1.1million died. Around 90 percent of those killed were Jewish; approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp. Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 Poles, 23,000 Romani and Sinti, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 400 Jehovah's Witnesses, <b>and</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> others of diverse nationalities, including an unknown number of homosexuals. Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, infectious diseases, individual executions, and medical experiments.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 200,112 half {{dollars in}} October 1920, with the excess above the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were shipped to the National Shawmut Bank of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to the public, with the profits {{to go to the}} tercentenary commission. The coins could be ordered through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek believed the sale of 1920-dated coins to have been very successful, and there was no thought at that time of returning any to the Mint for redemption and melting. The first order had not exhausted the authorized mintage, so the tercentenary commission ordered 100,000 more during the spring of 1921 when sales slowed. These were coined in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the year of issue added on the obverse to the left of Bradford. This was done to comply with the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. The recession of 1921 began soon after; sales dropped, <b>and</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> both dates remained unsold. The tercentenary commission returned 48,000 of the 1920 issue and 80,000 of the 1921 to the Mint.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, huge {{stockpiles}} of uranium were amassed <b>and</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600short tons (540metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded {{facilities in the}} Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated {{by the federal government}} of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy propane tank was lofted and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was lofted and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, <b>and</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> trees were downed in the area.
