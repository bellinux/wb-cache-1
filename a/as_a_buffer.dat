5|$|Fort Ripley {{was built}} in 1848–1849 in central Minnesota near modern Little Falls. It was built to provide a {{military}} presence on the frontier near the new Winnebago reservation created as the tribe was moved from Iowa. In addition it helped to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> between the Dakota Sioux and the Ojibwe.|$|E
5|$|In the Iazyges' early {{relationship}} with Rome, {{they were used}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> state, being between the Romans and the Dacians. Later on this would develop into an overlord and client-state relationship, with the Iazyges being nominally sovereign subjects of Rome. Throughout this relationship, the Iazyges still continued their raids on Roman land, which often caused punitive expeditions to be made against them.|$|E
50|$|The useful {{property}} of <b>a</b> circular <b>buffer</b> {{is that it}} does not need to have its elements shuffled around when one is consumed.(If <b>a</b> non-circular <b>buffer</b> were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed.)In other words, the circular <b>buffer</b> is well-suited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> FIFO <b>buffer</b> while <b>a</b> standard, non-circular <b>buffer</b> is well suited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> LIFO <b>buffer.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E
5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E

Roosevelt's goals – {{military}} victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, {{and the creation of}} a world peace organization – were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{into the}} Peloponnese {{was a disaster}} for Epiriote ambitions. Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus {{to return to his}} homeland with the remainder of his army, Epirus ceased to be a regional power. Pyrrhus' son and successor, Alexander II of Epirus was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king. Epirus was able to keep Pyrrhus' conquests of Tymphaea, Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon. Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> against the Illyrians to the north.|$|E
5|$|After Austerlitz, Napoleon {{established}} the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. A collection of German states intended to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> zone between France and Central Europe, {{the creation of}} the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.|$|E
5|$|After Napoleon's total {{defeat in}} 1815, the Congress of Vienna merged the French {{territory}} in Belgium with the Netherlands {{to form the}} United Kingdom of the Netherlands <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> state against the French. It was ruled by William I of Orange. The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers in Belgium with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia. Keen to promote the economic development of the southern provinces as well, William I founded the Société Générale des Pays-Bas in 1822 to provide businesses with capital to invest in machinery. The Société Générale served as a driving force behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century, and at its height controlled large swathes of the national economy. William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces, founding the State University of Leuven, the University of Liège and Ghent University in 1817.|$|E

5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> zone {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green belt to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood are seeing rapid growth in housing.|$|E
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's {{population}} recovered {{quickly after}} the war, as {{a wave of}} skilled migrants from the Republic of China moved in to seek refuge from the Chinese Civil War. When the Communist Party eventually took full control of mainland China in 1949, even more skilled migrants fled across the open border for fear of persecution. Many newcomers, especially {{those who had been}} based in the major port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, established corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses and shifted their base operations to British Hong Kong. The establishment of a socialist state in China (People's Republic of China) on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong's open border to mainland China. In 1951, a boundary zone was demarked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> zone against potential military attacks from communist China. Border posts along the north of Hong Kong began operation in 1953 to regulate the movement of people and goods {{into and out of the}} territory.|$|E

5|$|In {{consolidating}} his power, Muhammad Ali, {{the rebel}} governor of Ottoman Egypt, was modeling his {{rule on the}} bureaucratic organization characteristic of modern European states. Like earlier rulers of Egypt, Muhammad Ali desired to exercise control over greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), both for its strategic value and for its natural resources. In addition to its abundant natural resources, Syria also had a prospering international trading community with well-developed markets. In addition, in Ali's strategy, Syria {{would serve as a}} captive market for goods being produced in Egypt. Moreover, the extension of Egyptian control over Syria was sought because it would serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> state between Egypt and the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. Ali was attempting to become independent of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements {{to abandon their}} new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.|$|E
5|$|Many of the scutes are {{strengthened}} by bony plates known as osteoderms, {{which are the}} same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in hard-wearing beta-keratin. Most of the skin on the head is fused to the skull. The skin on the neck and flanks is loose, while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is sheathed in large, flat square scutes arranged in neat rows. The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests that alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.|$|E

5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
5|$|Sa'd al-Dawla was {{succeeded by}} his son, Sa'id Abu 'l-Fada'il Sa'id al-Dawla, but real power rested {{in the hands}} of Sa'd al-Dawla's former chamberlain, Lu'lu'. Several of the Hamdanid ghilman, resenting the {{influence}} of Lu'lu', went over to the Fatimids, who now launched a sustained offensive against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin. Only the personal intervention of Basil II in 995 and again in 999 would save the emirate from Fatimid conquest. Warfare lasted until 1000, when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo's continued existence <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>buffer</b> state between the two powers.

Upon learning of Rainiharo's death, disgruntled southeastern factions rose up against the Merina military stationed at posts within their territory.
