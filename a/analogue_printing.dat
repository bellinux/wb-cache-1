40|$|Abstract The {{printing}} industry has experienced cyclical change throughout its history. Since {{the advent of}} early hand-operated printing presses {{to the introduction of}} mechanical, high-volume technology the industry has evolved, for the most part, incrementally. Printing firms have capitalised on developments with various degrees of success. The industry currently faces a radical shift with the advent of digital printing technology. When digital was introduced in 1993, predictions that it would replace analogue were rife: This has not happened and currently digital and analogue co-exist within the industry, albeit targeting different sectors of the print market. However, as digitals capabilities and consumer expectations become more complex the opportunity to capitalise on new markets is widened for both printing firms and digital press and solutions vendors. This research explores the factors that enable or limit print firms and vendors to maximise their position within the digital arena. The results present three areas that are vital for the long-term success of digital technology within the print industry; building value into business re-design; workflow reengineering; innovative thinking. Key Words: <b>Analogue</b> <b>Printing</b> Technology; Digital Mindset; Digital Printing Technology; On-demand printing; Personalisation; ROI; Web-to-print; Workflow...|$|E
40|$|This book is {{the first}} major {{monograph}} on Sarah Jones’ photographs, surveying her practice from the 1990 s to 2013, including 10 new works produced for the book. Alongside full-colour reproductions are specially commissioned essays by Brian Dillon and David Campany. The book also includes the transcript of a conversation between Jones and the fiction writer A. M. Homes (winner of 2013 Women’s Fiction Prize). The monograph explores Jones’ constructs of space within the photographic frame, and time as embedded in <b>analogue</b> <b>printing</b> processes. Overseeing {{the design of the}} book, Jones focused on the spatial relations of the images and the texts in order to produce a montage of different periods of her work over the past 15 years. Using techniques drawn from her practice, including reverse images, vivid colour and inky blackness, the sequence of images chosen and arranged by Jones represent her research subjects, using tropes from the stereograph, the double, the still life and portraiture. The book was published by Violette Editions as part of its series of monographs on contemporary art and culture, including special editions by Sophie Calle, Louise Bourgeois, Michael Clark, Malerie Marder and Marina Warner. It was launched following Jones’s ‘Arnold Newman Lecture’ at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, USA in conjunction with her solo exhibition (2013). The book was also launched at the Anton Kern Gallery (NYC) and at Frieze London in 2013. New photographs from the monograph were featured in Exit Magazine’s special edition ‘On pictorial photography’ (2013) ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} how {{one group}} of workers, hairdressers, use aspects of their material landscape of work as important resources in the production and re-production of their work identities. It shows how the participants of the study use the spaces, objects and things in their workplaces to form a visual narrative of who they are. The article also considers the significance of visual methods in such identity research. It argues for encouraging participants using participant-led photography to choose how to view and arrange their photographs. Participants’ preference for paper <b>analogue</b> <b>prints</b> rather than on-screen digital images allowed them to work with multiple images simultaneously, rather than consecutively, and enabled them to create richer accounts of career development by incorporating time and movement in their stories. The participants’ construction of these ‘identityscapes’, it is argued, can be usefully understood {{in relation to the}} concept of ‘photomontages’ developed by the British artist David Hockney...|$|R
40|$|The {{gas station}} {{is one of}} the most iconic of twentieth century buildings. Recognised across the world, it is arguably most {{established}} on American soil where the notion of the road trip on a full tank of gas is culturally ingrained. Gasoline presents 35 archive press images of gas stations taken between 1944 and 1995. They have been collected by writer David Campany, purchased from the photography archives of several American newspapers which have been discarding their <b>analogue</b> <b>print</b> collections and moving to the now ubiquitous. jpeg or. tif formats. Gasoline can be read as a cautionary tale about the modern dependence on oil, about news photography, about the shift from film to digital imaging, or as a minor history of car design and vernacular architecture. Marked with the grease pen notations of the newspapers’ art directors, the photos tell of oil shortages, road congestion, crimes, accidents and choking cities. Individually the images are single moments in time; collectively they show a growing consciousness about cars, the oil trade and global concern about pollution...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with exploring phenomena of the night through combining printmaking and installation practices. I explore a phenomenology of darkness via embodied vision. The embodied nature of vision implies subjective experience {{and this is the}} key to re-activating a viewer's relationship to the environment in darkness. I consider how perception changes in the dark and the intermingling of the senses becomes more apparent, precipitating a heightened suggestivity to nocturnal phenomena. I have drawn on phenomenological ideas and methods and on my own nocturnal experiences to reflect on aspects of the changing contemporary night, creating a series of print-based installations that extend the possibilities for sensory affect. I bring together installation strategies and the <b>analogue</b> <b>print</b> as an embodiment of the tactile to assert the phenomenological. The submitted work has developed through extensive experimentation that draws together diverse methods for combining prints in installation environments. I have explored strategies that locate the visual via embodied processes, combining the physical mark making possibilities of the <b>analogue</b> <b>print</b> with installation strategies. Using print processes I have collected a range of marks derived from tactile interactions with forms. The printed marks do not describe visual forms, rather they are fragments that signify a sensate engagement with the unseen in the dark. The ability of print to reproduce images in different states has facilitated possibilities for the construction and fragmentation of imagery, as repeated forms alter and echo, generating heightened effects. I configure these in ways that strategically focus on the tactile, inviting an intimate and experiential engagement. The intent of the project is to create a perceptual intervention, a break in habitual and everyday modes of viewing. In terms of theory, Merleau Ponty's discussions of phenomenological thought provide key reference points for the project, in particular the idea that experience at the moment of apprehension and prior to conceptual meaning suggests new ways of understanding the relationship between self and the world, one that relocates vision in the body. I have also drawn on the writings of Jonathan Crary, who describes how an understanding of embodied vision has emerged and discusses ways that contemporary perceptual experiences are changing, and Paul Crowther, who considers the phenomenological possibilities for artworks. Rosalind Krauss' critique of the optical has also been significant as it locates several art practices that subvert the disembodied optical; and I trace a series of connections with other artists who have enlisted the bodily as a means of destabilising the visual. The project is located within a field of contemporary artists who engage with ideas about perception and darkness in relation to the environment and, in particular, with artworks that deal with the concept of an embodied relationship to darkness and utilise phenomenal strategies to engage viewers on a sensory level. Rothko, Turrell, Morris, Eliassen and Kusama deal with perceptual questions, creating immersive environments that engage in reflection on the world. Fernandez, Hofshi, Bitters, Seigel, Silveira and Pien deal with perceptions of darkness in their works and develop strategies to extend the sensory. While current installation practices often explore the sensory possibilities of Lhe digilal, my installation positions the <b>analogue</b> <b>print</b> to comment on the transition from the physical to the virtual worlds that we increasingly inhabit. The results of this project are shown in a dark, labyrinthine installation that interrogates the realm of perception, as the viewer is invited to consider the embodied nature of vision. Everyday modes of seeing are destabilised through encounters with fragments of imagery that hover between form and feeling, imagination and reality. This is suggestive of experiences of the night, where not only tactile, aural and visual phenomena are experienced differently but also images are conjured in the mind in response to nocturnal events. This exploration of ideas and processes suggests a reading of the night which points to the richness of sensuous engagement with the world, encouraging the viewer to reconsider their own multi-sensory relationship to the world in darkness...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} question: why, when encountering {{the products of}} many new technologies delivering information via a new media, do I often experience a feeling of disquiet or estrangement? I use the example of laser-photographic printing to explore the issue through a program of practice-based research. The outcome of this line of enquiry includes an original contribution via three series of large-format digital photographic works: Presenting "The Amazing Kriels", Home At Last, and Pure. In this thesis, which supports {{the main body of}} the research, that is, the practice-based research, I will briefly review the case for artefact as noise within photographic printing, articulate a significant difference between the artefact levels of traditional <b>analogue</b> and Lambda <b>prints,</b> present original dialogical evidence for estrangement in the latter, and identify it via readings of Sigmund Freud's "The Uncanny" and McLuhan's "The Gadget Lover", as a function of the uncanny. I will propose an original rewriting of McLuhan's ideas of "hot" and "cool" media, as well as the cycles of irritation/mediation repression within McLuhan's media theory as a direction for future research, and relate them to a shift from large-scale <b>analogue</b> photographic <b>printing</b> to Lambda printing.

It consists {{of photographs of}} prints of petrol stations from 1945 to 1995 rescued from archives of several American newspapers that have been discarding their <b>analogue</b> <b>print</b> collections in favour of digital storage, and edited into a visual meta-narrative. Most of the photographs have been marked by the grease pencil of a newspaper's art director, outlining the crop required to illustrate a particular story, or stories, in the newspaper. They are often heavily retouched by hand, painting selectively over the image with white-out and pen. The {{second half of the}} book consists of pictures of the reverse of the prints, showing caption information, the name of the photographer and copyright holder, dates of publication, the newspaper, and sometimes clippings from the image's use in the paper, an archive of its own use which is lost in a digital archive. As well as being [...] "elevated to icon in the visual language of 'America'", gas stations [...] "are quite banal but when they make news it's because there's been a crime, an accident, a price rise or a geopolitical crisis" [...] which [...] "makes the gas station a revealing measure of a society over {{the second half of the}} 20th century".

40|$|From {{a conference}} paper {{given at the}} Third International Conference: Preservation and Conservation Issues Related to Digital Printing and Digital Photography, 25 th April 2006, Institute of Physics, London. For many blue chip artists the master printer has been {{essential}} to the realization of highly creative, innovative, museum quality prints. Besides offering bespoke printing services and techniques, {{one of the many}} concerns of the master printer - especially {{in the latter half of}} the 20 th century- was to translate the artists creative intentions into print through fully preservable materials. A further offshoot of this work also, (in many cases) necessitated the actual documentation of the artists working approach and procedures in note form and progressive proofs to provide a unique insight into the creative process. This paper outlines some of the previous parameters and achievements in the field, looking at some of the worlds most prestigious print ateliers and examining the work produced for major artists under these terms. The paper will then investigate how the precedents of the master printer/atelier system have transferred into the field of digital printing for fine artists at the onset of the 21 st century. For many, the current generation of digital inkjet printers (especially wide format printers) can be seen to have had a democratising effect on the art world. Where artists who formerly needed to access the master printers skills and technology to produce ambitious print works, can now with a computer and access to a wide format printer create similar results. Or can they? By giving an overview of the specialised print work produced by the University of the West of England Centre for Fine Print Research digital printing facility and a selection of other British Digital Printing Studios, the presentation will provide an overview of some of the advantages offered by the transfer of the master printer system to the digital arena, arguing the case for the production of prints aiming to maintain and transcend the high standards of individuality and permanence previously set by 20 th century <b>analogue</b> <b>print</b> practice...|$|R
40|$|This practice-led {{research}} project explores {{the influence of}} digital tools on the composition of narrative. Its purpose {{was to create a}} fictional narrative in both <b>analogue</b> (<b>print)</b> and digital forms, observing and analysing the effects of this multimodal composition on the writer's creative practice, and on the resulting narratives. This project thus consists of both the creative artefacts and the critical exegesis that presents the analysis of the creative process and artefacts. The creative artefacts encompass the analogue novella Færwhile, included in this bound thesis as print novella, and its digital counterpart, included in the attached DVD as HTML digital fiction. The digital fiction actualises the narrative's fabula through a variety of narrative media, including Flash fiction, blog fiction, interactive fiction, and hyperfiction. These platforms were chosen in order to gain a broader understanding of the available media and their literary affordances; the selection of each was based primarily on its suitability for best crafting and communicating the characters, themes, and voice of each individual story or chapter. The critical thesis examines how composing multimodal texts refocuses the writer's cognitive composition process on media-specific semiotic translations, and results in texts that depart from traditional narrative forms into anti-linear structures engaging in unnatural narration. The chapters included present my practice-led methodology; an examination of how the specific materiality of digital media affords multimodal layering of meaning; an analysis of the shift from mimetic first- and third-person narration in work preceding this research to unnatural narration and anti-linear structures in both the analogue and digital artefacts; a discussion of the implicit collaboration that arises from appropriating digital resources such as visuals, audio, and source code shared online under Creative Commons licensing; and an exploration of how knowledge and awareness of digital technologies and ergodic literature results in changes to the composition process, shifting it from a monomodal translation of imagined story to written text, to a multimodal practice engaged in multiple media even in planning stages...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} component, &# 147;Body and Soul&# 148;, is an interdisciplinary, {{comparative study}} of the essay form, focusing on the Weimar period. The essay is a marginal literary genre, which, like much documentary style photography, attempts &# 147;the imaginative recreation of a culture, a period or an individual&# 148;. August Sander's photographic opus, People of the 20 th Century and Robert Musil's essayistic novel, The Man Without Qualities invite comparison as complex and problematic portraits of their respective societies. Sander's typological portraits are well known and his legacy informs much of contemporary documentary photography. Sixty images were published in 1929 by Kurt Wolff, Transmare Verlag, Munich, as Antlitz der Zeit (Face of Our Time) with an introduction by Alfred Döblin. The first two volumes of Robert Musil's, Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (The Man Without Qualities), were published in 1930 and 1932 by Rowohlt Verlag, Hamburg. Recent publication of new editions of both Musil's and Sander's works prompted the attempt to reconcile two portraits of people and events of {{the early decades of}} the 20 th Century in Germany and Austria. The essay form in literature and the documentary style in photography are examined with regard to the polemic associated with truth and reality. This review attempts to illustrate the inevitable inclusion of the fictional element into the fabric of both forms of investigation. The study concludes with a review of contemporary art practice in photodocumentary and some thoughts on future developments. The studio component, &# 147;Dargan&# 148;, is a photographic essay of a site in the Blue Mountains West of Sydney.

40|$|This group {{exhibition}} {{presents a}} selection of recent works by fifteen British artists that demonstrate the richness and vigour of contemporary painting in the UK. British painting has a different look and feel in this century: a lighter touch, more conceptual, sometimes ironic and even funny. These paintings show traces of everyday reality and reflections on the age that we live in, whether we consider {{it to be a}} post-industrial or digital era or a period of religious, political, financial and social conflict. Compared to the heavy spirit of the medium in the 1980 s, painting now seems more focused on the idea of surface and reflects a virtual idea of space, referring to image technology and the images we see on smartphones and computer screens. A century of struggle between photography and painting provides a backdrop to this contemporary style. As the photographic image has shifted from heavy, <b>analogue</b> <b>printed</b> matter to the weightless digital image, this lightness has become characteristic of visual culture. The underlying theme of The Painting Show is influenced by Unlawful Assembly (2013), a book of crime fiction stories written by artists Lucy McKenzie and Alan Michael. In the foreword to this book, artist Ed Atkins and gallerist Martin McGeown propose that the plot structures of crime novels, designed to lead the reader on a journey that questions the stability of truth and fiction, mirror the subversive way in which certain painters manipulate their medium, its history and the audience’s understanding of it. The artists in this exhibition have different approaches to experimenting with painting: they play with the romanticism of the act of painting, wryly imitate historical styles and question the relationship between the artist, the subject and the viewer.

Using chance, structure, or system, many of these works employ a variety of {{strategies}} to disrupt intuition and interrupt the measured performance of art-making. Maurice Carlin translates surface patterns from a concrete floor into labored <b>analogue</b> <b>prints.</b> Arnaud Desjardin uses the cyanotype process historically used for blueprints to make ghostly images of everyday objects. Marcia Farquhar’s work is precariously balanced between the prescribed and the unpredictable; her contribution to this show bears the intimate physical imprint of a live performance. Jem Finer has produced drawings made by a chart recorder transformed into an automatic drawing machine, its source the electrical fluctuations of a detuned radio. Richard Galpin specializes in photographic works in which he reconfigures images of urban environments by physically removing elements of the photographic emulsion. Denise Hawrysio’s methodology is concerned with exploring process while investigating the semiotics of meaning within language or mark-making, and often involves working collaboratively with the subject(s) of the work. Dan Hays’ work explores the limitations and opportunities offered by applying lenticular printing processes to found digital images from locations he has never visited. Tim Head exploits unpredictable colour mixes based on numerical calculations of CMYK print values. Sam Hodge’s work is a collection of drypoint prints made from cracked smartphone screens, reproduced, along with their stories, in a limited edition artist's book. Petri Huurinainen is a Finnish artist and musician whose drawings track both controlled and random marks made using stencils. Johanna Love’s practice explores notions of visual emptiness and absence through a combination of digital photographic print and drawing languages. Liselotte Boegh Mathiasen uses systematic repetitions of pencil on paper to produce intricate, meditative and minimalist imagery. Michael Petry works with repetition and movement through the process of knot-tying, transforming simple materials into unique hand-made sculptures. Emily Richardson is a filmmaker whose work Nocturne is shot entirely at night in the deserted streets of London, hinting at its concealed history.

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{the use of}} the Graphical User Interface (GUI) as a site of creative practice. By creatively repositioning the GUI as a work of art it is possible to challenge our understanding and expectations of the conventional computer interface wherein the icons and navigational architecture of the GUI no longer function as a technological tool. These artistic recontextualizations are often used to question our engagement with technology and to highlight the pivotal place that the domestic computer has taken in our everyday social, cultural and (increasingly), creative domains. Through these works the media specificity of the screen-based GUI can broken by dramatic changes in scale, form and configuration. This can be seen through the work of new media artists who have re-imagined the GUI in a number of creative forms both, within the digital, as image, animation, net and interactive art, and in the <b>analogue,</b> as <b>print,</b> painting, sculpture, installation and performative event.

40|$|My {{paper will}} address both Duration and temporality of the ‘still’ imageand Sensorial and bodily {{experience}} of photography through {{a discussion of}} a recent body of work ‘Fly Rhythm’, a series of photographs and video works exhibited in a gallery context. By acknowledging the inter-relationship between {{the body and the}} camera my project seeks to challenge a perceived separation between performance and photography. Fly Rhythm was conceived through a performative somatic process. Through using a custom made camera I was able to negotiate time and space to create a visual drawing of movement and stillness together in photography. The resultant images are discussed as a notation of body movement – a record of bodily history enabled through a self imposed discipline of learning to read light. I initially constructed a human size camera to understand how photography works. Spending time inside observing the way light moves and affects the formation of sight is also a way of embodying the act of photography. I responded by making a bespoke camera that enabled light to be captured during extended periods while moving. My project is dependent upon a self-imposed discipline of intuiting light’s strength and erratic changes, a skill developed by making <b>analogue</b> <b>prints</b> while inside a camera obscura. Once I had developed an ability to read light’s changes and gain an understanding of camera mechanics I made durational recordings moving through the landscape on Bruny Island Tasmania and industrial sites in Melbourne, photographs exhibited as part of Fly Rhythm. I will discuss these prints in context with the idea that light is a conduit through which past and present fuse together in a bodily act of photographing and processing images. I will explore durational aspects of photography by discussing light’s relative motion while taking photographs without using the viewfinder or composing images in the traditional way. Rather, the camera {{at the end of my}} arm is directed through how I read light therefore a choreography notated in the prints – a kind of body signatureMy practice enables a new the way of seeing, in a spontaneous hand held process creating a sense of embodiment. By analyzing process my paper will consider how the body together with analogue and 21 st century digital technology coalesce cross-disciplinary practice combining visual art, performance and photographic disciplines.

40|$|I {{propose that}} a learnt somatic {{experience}} of dance can translate into another discipline such as visual art. In my visual art practice I combine both photography, which is traditionally {{seen as a}} still medium, and performance {{in order to create}} a new form of embodiment. I have developed two series of art works of prints and video made in response to the Australian landscape. By analyzing my method of movement and photography I will describe how an embodied dance language can result in a material outcome – a series of drawings of light and movement, a body signature made possible through old and new technology. I have activated a performative state while capturing images discovering new ways of using technology reliant upon my knowledge of dance, performance and photography. Making a human size camera to make <b>analogue</b> <b>prints</b> I gained an intuitive knowledge of light – a skill that has become foundational in performance and photography. In response to space and light in the Australian landscape I then built a custom made camera that allows for the longest possible time to capture an image. I move while taking the image and use the camera as if an eye at the end of my arm. In this way I activate dance skills and embodied knowledge of space, timing and light, opening up a radical space for new thinking, making and performing. Furthermore this process engages memory and sentiment embodied through age. Many artists have responded to the unique qualities of the Australian landscape and by using a performative/photographic approach I have engaged with my own body memory. Being brought up in the landscape and training in ballet my body has acquired memories at a cellular level. My method has given memory a voice. In doing these works I have become conscious of how unconscious memories of the space and light in the landscape is a movement vocabulary activated in a way that ‘feels’ like dancing. As an ageing person this experience is profound and the resultant materialisation of the photographs and videos leave a material record of the event. The sentiments evoked through my process bridge the past with the present, the body with the mind, memory with body and space connecting disciplines in a new way. The materialisation of artworks itself continues cross-disciplinary processes using a technique that is a continuum of the performative. Through using technology I release memory of the landscape and pixel by pixel build imagery that relies on and is a part of the performative process. It is a photographic performance dance manifesting as pigment on paper exhibited a gallery context. The exhibition allows a space for the viewer to respond - re-membering the universal the act of moving. The works titled ‘body signatures’ and ‘Fly Rhythm’ become a communicative device in the gallery context. My paper through an analysis of process and methods used in making the two series will talk to several of the subjects listed and reveal a new way of connecting performance and visual art and old and new technologies...|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} sensor belt, {{designed as}} a mobile monitoring device for hospital use, was built during the work reported here. This sensor belt is capable of measuring electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory rate, tilt and skin temperature. Its analogue electronics were designed to be effective, have a low current consumption and use the most suitable components available for all couplings. For wireless data transmission, the sensor belt utilizes a separate module, attached to a base soldered to an <b>analogue</b> electronic PCB (<b>Printed</b> Circuit Board). On this module, there is an 8051 microcontroller and a ZigBee transceiver supporting the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard. Programming of the module {{was done in the}} Linux environment using the C language. The sensor belt proved capable of successfully sending wireless data. Moreover, wirelessness improved signal quality, as it reduced the noise coupling risk. This effect could be observed in the quality of both ECG and accelerometer signals. Among the greatest benefits of wirelessness is increased mobility. To sum up, the capacity to receive a large amount of measurement data from the belt and the application of new wireless data transmission based on ZigBee technology make the sensor belt a remarkable application for the needs of the wireless hospital.

5000|$|Sherry's work {{varies from}} {{landscape}} and studio photography, to collage and sculpture, {{often with a}} heavy focus on color. Working with <b>analogue</b> film and <b>printing</b> techniques [...] "the use of anachronistic, primitive methods reflects a concern with craft, introducing {{the hand of the}} artist into a medium most commonly associated with mechanical reproduction." [...] Sherry's work often merges human and natural subjects, creating images in which landscapes take on anthropomorphic qualities and the humans in them become part of the landscape, as opposed to inhabitants. His exhibition [...] "Astral Desert", at Salon 94 gallery in New York City explored the topography of the desert and American West through multiple processes pushing photography to a [...] "chromatic extreme." [...] In the exhibitions [...] "Climate Vortex Sutra" [...] and [...] "Paradise Fire" [...] Sherry's work continued to explore themes of queer landscape, as well as climate change and its effects on the American landscape. Sherry's insertion of queer themes into the trajectory of modernist photography gives us space to stop and consider the erotic body of the image itself... In Deep Blue Sea Rising, Oregon, 2014, for example Sherry's vision of the American landscape breaks down into the tactile skin of the sea, only to be brought back together by swaths of pigment.

40|$|An {{exhibition}} of 14 contemporary New Zealand photographers: Gary Blackman, Joyce Campbell, Conor Clarke, John Collie, Bruce Connew, David Cook, Karen Crisp, Marina Farrer Gilmour, Darren Glass, Robyn Hoonhout, John Miller, Davina Monds, Andrew Ross, Julian Ward. "This issue of PhotoForum represents {{a snapshot of}} recent work by a mix of established and new photographic practitioners from around New Zealand. It also documents the exhibtion, On Show, PhotoForum 2008 organised by PhotoForum for the Bath Street Gallery, Parnell, {{as part of the}} Auckland Festival of Photography, shown from 12 June to 5 July 2008. Rather than nominate a particular theme, the selection panel, drawn from PhtoForum's committee, and consisting of Mark Adams, Julie Downie, Tim Mackrell, Garry Sturgess and John B. Turner, put forward the names of more than 80 candidates to represent a diversity of approaches and experience, from which the final selection of 14 was reached by consensus [...] . Irrespective of content, technology has always affected the way photographs look and how they are received. This is one obvious thread in this selection, which includes pinhole contact prints from scanned colour negatives or tranparencies and b&w negatives, digital duratrans, and classic <b>analogue</b> b&w contact <b>prints.</b> In effect, this collection bridges the beginnings of photography in the early 19 th Century through to recent developments in the digital era.

40|$|In the sciences, digital {{modes of}} {{publication}} are already regarded as equivalent (if not superior) to their <b>printed</b> <b>analogues,</b> {{whereas in the}} humanities, hard-copies still count as the silver bullet to aggrandise symbolic capital {{in the sense of}} Bourdieu. While the scientist community seems to have overcome the general scepticism towards the digital realm, humanist academics especially in Germany appear more reluctant to fully embrace the new technologies. Apart from just ‘publishing’ texts in a strict sense, social media, blogs and platforms also hold a lot of catalyst potential especially regarding reflective communication, which is barely made use of due to the stigma of poor quality. The printed book, on the other hand, remains among the indispensable criteria to gain a tenured position. “Researching” and “writing (documenting the results) “ appear as separate stages in the sciences, but are closely interlocked in the humanities – so the geneses of texts may indeed differ to a degree rendering those processes incomparable. But even though it may sound like comparing apples and oranges, it reveals the crux of the matter: The practices of the disciplines have grown historically. We wish to emphasize that some elements of today’s scholarly practice are not so much the best possible solution {{to meet the needs of}} academic discourse, but rather atavisms, once established as compromises between what was needed and what was technically possible. Thus, they need to be carefully reassessed in order to eliminate inhibitions, p. e. those rooting in the specific limitations inherent to the printed book as a static, unidirectional medium. Quite possibly, a closer look at the situation in Germany might reveal the authority of the printed book as overrated and in fact hindering rather than advancing knowledge and scholarly discourse...|$|R
40|$|The {{print and}} media {{industries}} {{have been going}} through significant and prolonged change in recent years due to the digitization of media content. As with many innovations, the earliest phase of change involved a kind of replication of existing services with new technological processes. Hence the replacement of <b>analogue</b> with digital <b>printing</b> machines simply allowed print media to be produced more flexibly and efficiently. This resembled the motorized carriage design of early cars, echoing the horse drawn carriages they were replacing. More recently, print itself is being threatened by screen-displayed content, which can not only reproduce the printed word and image, but go beyond this by packaging multiple pages in a highly portable and convenient e-book form, providing instant access to multiple sources of web-based content, and integrating other media such as sound, video and interactive games. Similar things could {{be said about the}} digital broadcasting of radio and TV content, which is now ready for more radical integration with paper and the web. In this special issue, we examine some of the factors involved in new media innovation within this context of media digitization and convergence. In particular, we consider the future of print media in relation to screen-based media, and some possibilities for combining them in different ways. The papers were invited from presentations at the IARIGAI 2015 conference on Advances in Printing and Media Technology in Helsinki from the 6 th– 9 th September last year. Furthermore, four out of the five papers were submissions from members of the EU COST network FP 1104 on ‘New possibilities for print and packaging: Combining print and digital’. The non-FP 1104 paper was a related keynote paper on digitization and service business model innovation by Viljakainen, Toivonen & Seisto. The COST network is comprised of 140 academic and company members from 29 countries across Europe, and has been meeting for four years to share and generate new research on augmented print and packaging: [URL] It also held the Paper Evolutions exhibition of new product concepts in the area at the IARIGAI 2015 conference (Seisto et al., 2015). The selected papers are a small window on the discussions of the network regarding the future of paper, and the need to think about its innovation from an interdisciplinary point of view...|$|R
40|$|The Industrial Revolution of {{the late}} 18 th – 19 th C coincided with art’s Romantic period and its {{depiction}} of the ‘great person’ theory. Here, the Romanticists’ solitary creator and autographic distinction were the highest forms of originality in art. When considering the artistic compatibility of a process such as printmaking, that was predominantly mechanically assisted and reproductive in its design, one became aware of its initial rejection as a valid art medium during this time. Despite these contradictory factors concerning the realisation of original artworks, the development of print as an artistic medium began to present qualities that were unique to printmaking. Coupled with the proliferation and economic potential of the process, artists such as Picasso also acknowledged the pragmatic utilisation of a Master Craftsman in the work. Producing works of art using the print medium can often involve {{a certain amount of}} logistical and technical knowledge. In some instances, depending on the complexity of a project or the specialist equipment that may be needed to realise a fine art print, an artist may often consider consulting a Master Printer. The main premise for utilising such an individual allows the artist to traverse much of the technical and laborious components of the print process. This partnership between printer and artist offers a generalised description as to what an artist will benefit from in such a venture. However the mediation of a fine art print is not always that straightforward, if one considers previous definitions that have existed concerning this type of collaboration. Historically, the Master Printer’s contribution to the field of fine art print has required various levels of involvement towards the realisation of many prestigious artists’ prints. Despite the technical affiliation of the printer, there is potentially a wealth of other factors that an artist will be introducing to the work when collaborating in this manner. If one considers the holistic nature of printmaking then associative contexts from the Atelier practice begin to present themselves. For example, parameters such as a ‘house style’, and the printers’ collaborative philosophies, begin to offer an insight as to how and why a fine art print may be conceived in a particular way. Thus one may deduce that the printing of one work by two different Ateliers could result in two very different looking prints. Digital print technology within the field of Fine art Printmaking is relatively new when compared to the more established traditional print processes such lithography, screen-print and etching. The subsequent adoption and development of digital technology through the traditionally defined concepts of the Atelier and Master Printer model are equally still in their infancy. The situation of previously defined printmaking concepts and practices (obtained through mechanical print technologies) has essentially been migrated into a digital printmaking equivalent, but to what effect? In comparing both <b>analogue</b> and digital <b>print</b> practices we need to consider the migration process of what may become obsolete, and what possibly needs redefining in the printmaking field. This presentation will therefore provide an overview of how digital technology has begun to inform what an Atelier and Master Printer might be today...|$|R
