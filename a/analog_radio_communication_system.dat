40|$|Background: Delays {{in getting}} medical help are {{important}} factors {{in the deaths of}} many pregnant women and unborn children in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Studies have suggested that the use of cell phones and <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> might reduce such delays. Objectives: We review the literature regarding the impact of cell phones and <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> on delays in getting medical help by pregnant women in the LMIC. Design: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Maternity and Infant care (Ovid), Web of Science (ISI), and Google Scholar were searched for studies relating to the use of cell phones for maternal and child health services, supplemented with hand searches. We included studies in LMIC and in English involving the simple use of cell phones (or <b>radio</b> <b>communication)</b> to either make calls or send text messages. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. All the studies, while of various designs, demonstrated positive contributory effects of cell phones or <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> in reducing delays experienced by pregnant women in getting medical help. Conclusions: While the results suggested that cell phones could contribute in reducing delays, more studies of a longer duration are needed to strengthen the finding...|$|R

40|$|DE 102005041121 A 1 UPAB: 20070711 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} transmitting an estimating signal (SIG 1) to a {{radio station}} (NodeB) by a subscriber station (UE 1). Another estimating signal (SIG 2) is received from the radio station {{as a response to}} the former estimating signal. A signal propagation delay is determined based on transmitting and receiving point of time of the estimating signals, where only one carrier frequency is utilized for the estimating signals. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a subscriber station for a <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> (2) a <b>radio</b> station for a <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> (3) a <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> with a subscriber station. USE - Used for estimating a signal propagation delay between a subscriber station (claimed) e. g. mobile telephone, or other movable or stationary device, that is utilized for transmission of images and audio data to facsimile or short message service, multimedia messaging service, electronic mail transmission and/or for Internet access, and {{a radio station}} of a multi user <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> in a data network e. g.

This situation motivates {{the definition of}} advanced methods, models, and tools {{in order to maintain}} the design complexity of terminal architectures. In this context, architects of next generation <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> aim at designing SDR baseband architectures able to support a wide variety of communication interfaces with a wide range of processing resources and that fully meet expected requirements. As a result, it is mandatory to efficiently assist system architects in the process of evaluating performances of potential architectures and in exploration of the design space. In this paper, we present a case study representative of next generation <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> and we describe its modeling and evaluation of performances of the related architecture. The case study corresponds to an adaptive multi-standard and multi-application <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>system.</b> Performance evaluation is performed following a simulation-based approach. Modeling techniques are proposed to facilitate estimation of expected resources according to complex use case scenarios and to allow achieving a good compromise between simulation speed of architecture models and accuracy of provided estimations. The presented results concern the evolution over time of the architecture and the observation of resource usage taking into account dynamic changes of the system environment...|$|R
