40|$|Great {{consumption}} of coal {{has transformed the}} underground coal mining industry with new features. The first is the increasing depth of cover of coal mining operations due to shallow resources being exhausted. Some operations overseas have been operated at an overburden of more than 1300 meters. The second feature is the intensified production concentration associated with the greatly improved <b>advancing</b> <b>rate</b> of longwall faces； a single face output has reached more than 10 million tonnes per annum. Deep operations are exposed to a high ground stress regime, high gas content, and coal and gas outburst risk. These issues cause changes in mine design, including {{but not limited to}} high demand for stone roadways， which are more stable than coal ones under high ground stress conditions. Stone gate roads are needed to accommodate cross measure drilling to protect coal gate drivage from the risk of high gas emissions and outburst hazards. Increasing longwall face <b>advancing</b> <b>rate</b> shortens the lifespan of panels. Further, it necessitates short longwall development time to achieve smooth panel succession. Improved coal gate development and stone gate development are essential to fulfil this requirement. A Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a kind of tunnel construction machinery which integrates the functions of excavation, ground support, mucking, lining， and surveying. It can achieve much higher heading rates than conventional drill and blast and roadheader methods, consequently, it has been proposed to be employed in underground coal mines to accommodate the requirement of high development rate...|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{prediction}} result, the tunneling method {{was changed to}} bench method by small <b>advancing</b> <b>rate</b> (0.5 – 1.0  m/round) from full face method to assure {{the stability of the}} tunnel. Long drill holes were adopted to detect the water pressure and allow an earlier water leakage to decrease the water pressure. At the same time, grouting was applied to strengthen the rock. By using the above measures, the construction succeeded. After the excavation, the treated cave and fractured zones were clearly observed on site, which in turn verified the geological prediction result. From this study, {{it was found that the}} geological prediction in karst strata would focus on caves and water.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} numerically {{the evolution}} of surface settlement during continuous tunnel excavation by formulating and solving the poro-elasticity equations in a frame of reference, which is fixed to the moving face. In tunnelling through low-permeability soils, consolidation processes take place in general simultaneously with the spatial stress redistribution {{in the vicinity of}} the advancing face. Apart from the borderline case of highly permeable ground or very slow excavation, the excavation <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> must be taken into consideration. One can readily verify by a dimensional analysis that the time-development of settlement is governed by the ratio of <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> to ground permeability.

40|$|In recent decades, satellite-derived {{start of}} {{vegetation}} growing season (SOS) has advanced in many northern temperate and boreal regions. Both {{the magnitude of}} temperature increase and {{the sensitivity of the}} greenness phenology to temperature-the phenological change per unit temperature-can contribute the advancement. To determine the temperature-sensitivity, we examined the satellite-derived SOS and the potentially effective pre-season temperature (T eff) from 1982 to 2008 for vegetated land between 30 °N and 80 °N. Earlier season vegetation types, i. e., the vegetation types with earlier SOSmean (mean SOS for 1982 - 2008), showed greater advancement of SOS during 1982 - 2008. The <b>advancing</b> <b>rate</b> of SOS against year was also greater in the vegetation with earlier SOSmean even the T eff increase was the same. These results suggest that the spring phenology of vegetation may have high temperature sensitivity in a warmer area. Therefore {{it is important to consider}} temperature-sensitivity in assessing broad-scale phenological responses to climatic warming. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms and ecological consequences of the temperature-sensitivity of start of growing season in a warming climate...|$|E
40|$|Microtomy for {{electron}} microscope studies has recently shown considerable progress {{due to a}} number of improvements such as the reduction of the <b>advancing</b> <b>rate</b> of the usual microtomes (1, 2), the embedding in hard plastics (3), and the introduction of glass knives (4). As a result of this progress, it is now possible to obtain sections of suitable thinness in sufficient yield to permit systematic study of practically any type of cell in situ. An appreciable number of {{electron microscope}} studies on sectioned material have already been published. Although they have provided interesting morphological information, the results with the technique have not thus far come up to expectations, particulaxly in the range of fine structure. This is due, in general, to the poor fixation d the specimens, although, in most instances, fixatives known to give good results in light microscopy have been used.

Silicon MOS technology has now been developed into two extremes: as fine as nanometer size in the device structures and as large as gigascale in terms of number of transistors in a chip.

The present invention adds to the three-phase system of pending application Ser. No. 199, 765, filed Oct. 23, 1980, means for modifying {{the operation of the}} system for a motor start-up interval of 5 to 30 seconds. The modification is that of providing via ramp generator 174 an initial ramp-like signal which replaces a constant power factor signal supplied by potentiometer 70. The ramp-like signal is applied to terminal 40 where it is summed with an operating power factor signal from phase detectors 32, 34, and 36 to thereby obtain a control signal for ultimately controlling SCR devices 12, 14, and 16 to effect a gradual turn-on of motor 10.

40|$|Background: With the <b>advancing</b> <b>rate</b> of {{the blunt}} and non-blunt traumas, the {{occurrence}} of such traumas in pregnancy increases. Such traumas could result in mother and fetus complications. Considering the prevalence {{and the importance of}} trauma and the controversy seen on the causes and complications, the present study was designed to evaluate the mother and fetus complications induced by pregnancy traumas in Kashan educational hospitals during 1384 - 1387. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was carried out on 5500 deliveries. All pregnant (n= 60) hospitalized for traumatic reasons in the center were studied for personal data, type of the trauma, site of injury, mother and fetus complications based on physical examination. Findings was reported as descriptive statistics and frequency distribution tables. Results: Sixty (1. 1) out of the 5500 delivery cases were hospitalized for traumatic reasons. Fifty-five (91. 6) were in age range of 18 - 35 years. In terms of gestational age 15 (25) cases were 20 weeks. The type of trauma in 58 (96. 7) was non-blunt and the reason in 61. 7 of cases was accidents. Five cases had mother complications (e. g. premature delivery, need for cesarean and placental decollement) and 8 (13. 3) cases had fetus complications (abortion, heart rate fall, premature delivery and in-utero death). Conclusion: Based on our study the prevalence of delivery traumas are higher than the similar studies in other countries and are concurrent with the increasing mother and fetus complications.

40|$|A 5. 15 m {{diameter}} {{water diversion}} tunnel was driven into Bangkok stiff clay using an earth pressure balance shield. The tunnel was driven within a clear distance of 2 m from the closest pile of a 3 x 4 pile group supporting an expressway. During construction, tunnel driving parameters {{as well as}} induced ground and pile group responses were recorded. To avoid cutting the piles supporting the expressway, the alignment of the tunnel was adjusted and curved. As {{a result of this}} change in tunnel alignment, the tunnel <b>advancing</b> <b>rate</b> was reduced from an average 17 m/day for a straight drive to an average of only 6 m/day for the curved alignment, and the ratio between the tunnel face pressure and overburden pressure was changed from 0. 5 to 0. 4, accordingly. Due to the reduction of the tunnel face pressure, up to a 280 % larger inward ground movement towards the tunnel was observed. As the shield penetration rate decreased, the torque required for tunnel driving was reduced by 33 %, while the ratio between shield penetration rate and soil extraction was almost constant throughout the tunnel route. A transverse influence zone due to tunnel driving was identified to extend up to a distance that was twice the tunnel diameter radially from the longitudinal tunnel axis. The maximum tilting of the expressway pier and deduced differential settlement of the pile located within the influence zone were up to 1 : 2600 and 2. 0 mm, respectively. Tilting of all the piers was mainly caused by long-term subsurface settlement having the tilting direction towards the tunnel.

40|$|A semi-permanent area of {{open water}} has been {{frequently}} observed within the winter sea ice cover in the polar region. The continuous existence of the open water polynya even in the severe winter shows that two phenomena, namely vigorous frazil ice production and sweeping it away with a strong wind blowing, simultaneously occur there. The open water polynya, therefore, serves as an efficient ice factory {{much more than the}} sheet ice growth. The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify the atmosphere-ocean interaction through the processes of high-sea ice production. Laboratory experiments were performed in which the processes of frazil ice production and the resulting convection were examined as a function of air temperature (- 10 ∿- 30 ℃) and wind speed (2 - 10 m/s). A plexiglass test tank (0. 4 × 2 × 0. 6 m in dimension) was filled with salt water (32 permils in salinity) and set in a large cold room. The wind was blowing on the water surface from one side. The convection phenomena in the test tank were observed with a schlieren optical system. The edge position of a frazil ice layer which was accumulated on the lee was advancing against the wind. The processes of frazil ice production markedly changed with wind speed. The higher the wind speed, the thicker frazil ice layer composed of fine crystals formed, whereas at the lower wind speed the thinner frazil ice sheet was advancing windward. The <b>advancing</b> <b>rate</b> of frazil ice layer increased with lowering air temperature but did not depend on wind speed noticeably. The rate of frazil ice production increased with increasing wind speed and lowering air temperature, the wind effect was much larger. At the higher wind speed, a significant amount of supercooled water tank through the wind-driven circulation as well as the instability in density, which results in the production of a large amount of frazil ice in the interior of the water tank. From these experimental observations, it was found that the following four typical regions exist during the processes of frazil ice production; (1) Fast ice sheet (most close to the wind and common ice growth); (2) Open water (region of frazil ice production); (3) Ice edge (brine exclusion mainly occurs in this region); (4) Frazil ice layer (this forms on the lee and is gradually advancing windward) ...|$|E

At the lowest supersaturation, the growth behavior was mainly the advancement of the initial step edges and filling in of the etch pits formed in the water before the BaSO 4 solution was injected. For solutions with higher supersaturation, the growth behavior was characterized by the advance of the and [010] half-layer steps with two different <b>advance</b> <b>rates</b> {{and the formation of}} growth spirals with a rhombic to bow-shaped form and sector-shaped two-dimensional (2 D) nuclei. The <b>advance</b> <b>rates</b> of the initial steps and the two steps of 2 D nuclei were proportional to the SI.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{contribution}} of fractures (joints) in controlling the <b>rate</b> of weathering <b>advance</b> for a low-porosity rock by using methods of homogenization to create averaged weathering equations. The <b>rate</b> of <b>advance</b> of the weathering front can be expressed as the same rate observed in non-fractured media (or in an individual block) divided by the volume fraction of nonfractured blocks in the fractured parent material. In the model, the parent has fractures that are filled with a more porous material that contains only inert or completely weathered material. The low-porosity rock weathers by reaction-transport processes. As observed in field systems, the model shows that the weathering <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> is greater for the fractured {{as compared to the}} analogous non-fractured system because the volume fraction of blocks is 3 ̆c 1. The increase in <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> is attributed both to the increase in weathered material that accompanies higher fracture density, and to the increase in exposure of surface of low-porosity rock to reaction-transport. For constant fracture aperture, the weathering <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> increases when the fracture spacing decreases. Equations describing weathering <b>advance</b> <b>rate</b> are summarized in the ‘List of selected equations’. If erosion is imposed at a constant rate, the weathering systems with fracture-bounded bedrock blocks attain a steady state. In the erosional transport-limited regime, bedrock blocks no longer emerge at the air-regolith boundary because they weather away. In the weathering-limited (or kinetic) regime, blocks of various size become exhumed at the surface and the average size of these exposed blocks increases with the erosion rate. For convex hillslopes, the block size exposed at the surface increases downslope. This model can explain observations of exhumed rocks weathering in the Luquillo mountains of Puerto Rico...|$|R
