A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin.

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known <b>are</b> <b>holding</b> therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E

5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that <b>are</b> <b>holding</b> the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E
