5|$|The four-headed god Brahma {{should be}} shown {{seated on the}} ground in the {{foreground}} officiating as the wedding priest and making offerings to the homa (sacred fire) in the kunda (fire-altar). The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial ladle and spoon) in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) in his back arms. The presence of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where the bride and groom go <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> seven times.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ritual}} the priest {{delivers}} a short sermon, {{followed by the}} church choir singing Christmas songs; poems that praise the Nativity of Jesus Christ may be recited. In Montenegro, decasyllable Serbian epics are sung to an accompaniment played on the gusle, a traditional Serbian bowed string instrument. The celebration ends with parishioners gathered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> served with cooked rakia, wine, or tea, and the food allowed during the Nativity Fast. Parishioners may pick a twig from the badnjak and take it home to place {{in front of their}} icon, or at another appropriate location.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslavia's socialist {{government}} suppressed or discouraged public religious celebrations {{until the}} early 1990s. Since then, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. There are typically three elements to such celebrations: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of cutting down the oak sapling {{to be used as}} the badnjak, taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes Vespers, placing the badnjak on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the badnjak, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the badnjak not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of gathering <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and socializing. Each particular celebration has its own specific traits however, reflecting the traditions of the local community.|$|E

25|$|The {{types of}} stones, bones, and {{minerals}} {{found at the}} campsites further describe the use of animal hides as tent covering. Butchered and burned animal bones found <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> pit show which types of animals were hunted and eaten. Stone tools such as hide scrapers and deposits of minerals employed in preparing skins show the routine use of animal hides. In addition, there {{are a host of}} ethnographic parallels, as indigenous cultures throughout the world relied on animal hides as a shelter covering material until the onset of the modern era.|$|E

A Hindu school teacher was roasted alive by his Muslim students who danced <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> In the village of Madhabpasha, under Babugunge police station presently Babuganj upazila, two to three hundred Hindus were rounded up by a Muslim mob. They were made to squat in a row and their heads were chopped off one by one with a ramda. In the Madhabpasha zamindar house 200 Hindus were killed and 40 injured.|$|E

25|$|In Portugal, {{where the}} saint's day is celebrated across the country, {{it is common}} for {{families}} and friends to gather <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> in reunions called magustos, where they typically eat roasted chestnuts and drink wine, jeropiga (drink made of grape must and firewater) and aguapé (a sort of weak and watered-down wine). According to the most widespread variation of the cloak story, Saint Martin cut off half of his cloak in order to offer it to a beggar and along the way, he gave the remaining part to a second beggar. As he faced a long ride in a freezing weather, the dark clouds cleared away and the sun shone so intensely that the frost melted away. Such weather was rare for early November, so was credited to God's intervention. The phenomenon of a sunny break to the chilly weather on Saint Martin's Day (11 November) is called Verão de São Martinho (Saint Martin's Summer, veranillo de san Martín in Spanish) in honor of the cloak legend.|$|E
60|$|By {{eight o'clock}} that evening {{the field in}} which they were to encamp for the night was reached.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{shielding}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> chamber is {{a mixture}} of masonry, concrete, steel armor and earth shielding. The limited angle of fire, coupled with problems of noise and ventilation, limited installations to ten locations. None were ever fired in action, and most were removed for scrap by the Germans in 1943, or by the French Army after the war.|$|R

500|$|The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), {{demonstrated}} {{a change in}} direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, {{who had worked with}} Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions ended up providing the context for the album itself. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by [...] "the whole idea of the old men sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> passing on...legends and fables to the grandchildren".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Volcano" [...] {{episode was}} in {{production}} when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{significant}} poet {{of the independent}} United States was William Cullen Bryant (17941878), whose great contribution was to write rhapsodic poems on the grandeur of prairies and forests. However, the first internationally acclaimed poet was Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (18071882) who nearly surpassed Alfred, Lord Tennyson in international popularity, and, alongside William Cullen Bryant, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., formed the Fireside Poets (also known as the Schoolroom or Household Poets). The Fireside Poets were a group of 19th-century American poets from New England. The name [...] "Fireside Poets" [...] is derived from that popularity: their general adherence to poetic convention (standard forms, regular meter, and rhymed stanzas) made their body of work particularly suitable for memorization and recitation in school and also at home, where it {{was a source of}} entertainment for families gathered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> [...] The poets' primary subjects were the domestic life, mythology, and politics of the United States, in which several of the poets were directly involved.|$|E
2500|$|It was ancient custom {{that when}} {{sacrifice}} {{was to be}} made, all farmers were {{to come to the}} heathen temple and bring along with them the food they needed while the feast lasted.

Also all kinds of livestock were killed in connection with it, horses also; and all the blood from them was called hlaut , and hlautbolli, the vessel holding the blood; and hlautteinar, the sacrificial twigs [...] These were fashioned like sprinklers, and with them were to be smeared all over with blood the pedestals of the idols and also the walls of the temple within and without; and likewise the men present were to be sprinkled with blood. But the meat of the animals was to be boiled and served as food at the banquet. Fires were to be lighted {{in the middle of the}} temple floor, and kettles hung over them.

Often considered a close relative of the Chassepot rifle, and borrowing Dreyse's turning-bolt action lock, still the most innovative features of the new weapon were the work of Peter Paul Mauser.|$|R
