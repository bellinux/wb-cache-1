40|$|The {{properties}} of cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and aminoacyl-transferring enzymes in the myocardium were examined and methods for the assay {{of the activity}} of these enzyme systems were developed. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> measured from the rate of incorporation of 14 C-labelled amino acid into aminoacyl-tRNA.

5|$|Even {{though the}} Romney Literary Society's {{membership}} was relatively small, its debates and <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> frequently discussed throughout the Potomac Highlands region.

5|$|Most <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> open to slaves except politics, {{which was}} {{reserved}} for citizens. The principal use of slaves was in agriculture, but hundreds of slaves were also used in stone quarries or mines, and perhaps two per household were domestic servants.
