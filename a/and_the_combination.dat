5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, {{with the onset of}} World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> of construction activity and pollution made observation of the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.|$|E

Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes.

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{first brought}} rainfall to coastal parts of Georgia and South Carolina.

Several boats broke free from their moorings near Salisbury and were subsequently destroyed after passing downstream. The schooner Hattie A. Marsh encountered strong winds from the hurricane along the Delaware coast, while strong waves washed it ashore the rocky coastline.

5|$|Throughout Mexico, {{the floods}} {{killed at least}} 379people, {{according}} to the federal government, and as many as 600 according to relief agencies; the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters later estimated there were 636deaths, and damage in Mexico was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos). Nationwide, the floods damaged or destroyed 90,000houses, which left about 500,000people homeless. Flooding caused thousands of landslides, many in more populated areas than the flooding in 1944. The floods also caused 39rivers to overflow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> of floods and landslides destroyed bridges, houses, widespread crop fields, schools, and electrical networks. Impact was worst in Puebla, where damage totaled $240million (2.1billion pesos) and many roads were washed out. Landslides in the state killed 107people in Teziutlán. Elsewhere in the country, the floods washed crocodiles into the streets of Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco, and in Oaxaca, the rainfall occurred after an earthquake left thousands homeless. Flooding also extended into Central America in late September through early October, causing $40million (385million pesos) in crop damage and 70deaths.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople's {{cultural}} influence {{extended from}} Sicily to Russia. Armenia, as a border state between the Roman-Byzantine and Sasanian empires, {{was influenced by}} both. The exact relationship between Byzantine architecture {{and that of the}} Caucasus is unclear. Georgia and Armenia produced many central planned, domed buildings in the 7th century and, after a lull during the Arab invasions, the architecture flourished again in the Middle Byzantine Period. Armenian church domes were initially wooden structures. Etchmiadzin Cathedral (c. 483) originally had a wooden dome covered by a wooden pyramidal roof before this was replaced with stone construction in 618. Churches with stone domes became the standard type after the 7th century, perhaps benefiting from a possible exodus of stonecutters from Syria, but the long traditions of wooden construction carried over stylistically. Some examples in stone as late as the 12th century are detailed imitations of clearly wooden prototypes. Armenian church building was prolific in the late 6th and 7th centuries and, by the 7th century, the churches tend to be either central plans or combinations of central and longitudinal plans. Domes were supported by either squinches (which were used in the Sasanian Empire but rarely in the Byzantine) or pendentives like those of the Byzantine empire, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> of domed-cross plan with the hall-church plan could have been influenced by the architecture of Justinian. Domes and cross arms were added to the longitudinal cathedral of Dvin from 608 to 615 and a church in Tekor. Other domed examples include Ptghnavank in Ptghni (c. 600), a church in T'alinn (662-85), and the Cathedral of Mren (629-40).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the respiratory effects of buprenorphine, butorphanol, midazolam, and their combinations in healthy conscious rabbits. Six adult female New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized briefly with isoflurane by mask to allow placement of a catheter into the central ear artery. After a 60 -min recovery period, a baseline arterial sample was obtained. Animals then were injected intramuscularly with either 0. 9 % NaCl (1 mL), buprenorphine (0. 03 mg/kg), butorphanol (0. 3 mg/kg), midazolam (2 mg/kg), buprenorphine + midazolam (0. 03 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg), or butorphanol + midazolam (0. 3 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg). Arterial blood gases were evaluated at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 360 min after drug administration. All drug treatments caused significant decreases in respiratory rate, compared with saline. Buprenorphine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> of midazolam–butorphanol <b>and</b> midazolam–buprenorphine resulted in statistically significant decreases in pO 2. No significant changes in pCO 2 pressure were recorded for any treatment. Increases in blood pH were associated with administration of butorphanol, midazolam, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> of midazolam–butorphanol <b>and</b> midazolam–buprenorphine. In light of these results, buprenorphine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>combinations</b> of midazolam–buprenorphine <b>and</b> midazolam–butorphanol result in statistically significant hypoxemia in rabbits that breathe room air. The degree of hypoxemia is of questionable clinical importance in these healthy subjects.
