5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began to {{distance}} himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge.

The Army of the North, which was operating <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E

The pyramid was of fine workmanship using well-cut stone slabs. However, itw was poorly preserved and the southern part had partially collapsed.

5|$|Since {{wind speed}} is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy {{production}} is never {{as much as}} the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 15–50%; values <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> end of the range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements.|$|E

5|$|Ampelosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known titanosaurian sauropods from Europe. Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France have been assigned to A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a tooth and some vertebrae were examined. In 2005, a complete description was made by Le Loueff of all known material, allowing Ampelosaurus to be much better understood. All the material has been assigned to the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> end of the range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E
