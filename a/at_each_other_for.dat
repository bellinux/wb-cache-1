25|$|On April 4, {{after the}} two {{unfamiliar}} armies had exchanged messages and stared <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> a few days, da Gama formed his troops into an infantry square and marched against the Imam's lines, repelling successive waves of Muslim attacks with musket and cannon. This battle ended when Imam Ahmad {{was wounded in the}} leg by a chance shot; seeing his banners signal retreat, the Portuguese and their Abyssinian allies fell upon the disorganized Muslims, who suffered losses but managed to reform next to the river on the distant side.|$|E
25|$|The {{police and}} the gang fired <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> {{about a quarter of}} an hour. Then there was a lull but nothing could be seen {{for a minute or two}} because of the smoke. Superintendent Hare {{returned}} to the railway-station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, but Tom Carrington, artist for the Australasian Sketcher, stopped the haemorrhage with his handkerchief. Hare then ordered O'Connor to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to the battle but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be conveyed to Benalla by a special railway engine.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 190s, {{northern}} China {{was divided}} between two contending warlords, Yuan Shao and Cao Cao. Each had assimilated the smaller powers around them and made political arrangements with the larger powers elsewhere, and were increasingly looking <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> potential gains. Cao Cao had earlier secured the helpless Emperor Xian into his custody, a move that Yuan Shao regretted not to have made. After the successful conquest of Gongsun Zan's territories to the north, Yuan Shao turned to the south to prepare for an assault on Cao Cao in the summer of 199. In response, Cao Cao went on a patrol to the northern front and dispatched several armies to defend positions {{on the south side of}} the Yellow River in the eighth lunar month (September 8 - October 7) of 199. Among these was the placement of Yu Jin at Yan Ford (延津; north of present-day Yanjin County, Henan) with 2,000 troops. This position blocked Yuan Shao's direct approach over the ford toward Cao Cao's main defense lines at Guandu (官渡; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan).|$|E
2500|$|By this time, {{the night}} had become very dark and Pickett ordered the Confederate attack {{ended in the}} face of Custer's resistance. Colonel Munford later criticized Pickett for making this decision, stating the Confederates had lost [...] "a golden opportunity" [...] and that [...] "daylight {{had nothing to do with}} it." [...] Nonetheless, the {{opposing}} sides continued to fire <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> hours after dark.|$|E
2500|$|Various crises {{between the}} {{characters}} were featured {{over the following}} years, causing them to break up and reconcile numerous times. In the book Seeing Things: Television in the Age of Uncertainty, author John Ellis uses the couple's combustible relationship {{as an example of}} emotional intensity and pathos: [...] "A couple like Ricky and Bianca [...] can have constantly sniped <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> several episodes, for no apparent dramatic purpose except that it is the nature of their relationship. Then they will suddenly be confronted by a life-changing decision [...] There is suddenly a shift in emotional intensity for the audience. Every word now counts, and all the previous audience attitudes of irritation or even condescension to this 'not very bright couple' [...] become a feeling of utter absorption in their dilemma." [...] The BBC has reported that Bianca and Ricky's on-off romance [...] "captivated millions of fans", and in April 1997 attracted [...] "one of the biggest soap audiences ever", with 22million viewers tuning in to see them marry. In 2000, Owen stated that the storyline he most enjoyed in EastEnders was the build up and marriage to Bianca, because [...] "the public's enthusiasm for the event was a great motivation". In 2008, the Daily Mail branded Ricky and Bianca [...] "EastEnders most popular couple".|$|E

60|$|Then {{the lesser}} {{and the greater}} scamp looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and <b>for</b> {{a moment or two}} felt a warm, sympathetic, {{friendly}} emotion <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and quietly shook hands.|$|R
2500|$|Day of the Dead had {{its world}} premiere on June 30, 1985, {{and was given}} a limited release on July 3, 1985. The film saw its wide release on July 19, 1985. It opened to mixed reviews, with some critics {{complaining}} that the film was too dark, depressing, and slow. Roger Ebert, who reacted favorably to other films of Romero's Dead series, gave Day of the Dead {{one and a half}} stars; he praised the special effects but was put off by what he referred to as [...] "over-acting" [...] in the movie, specifically that all of the actors screamed <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> the entire film {{in a way that was}} not present in Romero's earlier films. BBC reviewer Almar Haflidason stated [...] "It benefits from a far larger budget than its predecessors, but suffers from a story as malnourished as the zombies that are chewing it up," [...] Haflidason would go on to give the film three out of five stars. As noted by the New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin [...] "Yes, there are enough spilled guts and severed limbs to satisfy the bloodthirstiest fan. But these moments tend to be clustered together, and a lot of the film is devoted to windy argument." [...] Allmovie reviewer Keith Phipps stated that: [...] "The last, to date at least, of George Romero's living dead films is in many respects the least interesting, although it's not for a lack of ambition." [...] Variety wrote that the film was the most unsatisfying of the original three films and that [...] "The acting here is generally unimpressive and in the case of Sarah's romantic partner, Miguel (Antone DiLeo Jr), unintentionally risible." ...|$|E

60|$|Wyllard strode up {{and down}} the room. When he sat down again with a clenched hand laid upon the table he and the seaman looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{steadily}} <b>for</b> a moment or two. Then the stranger made a significant gesture.|$|R

60|$|The {{two parties}} {{arrived at the}} stone upon which I was sitting almost simultaneously, as {{probably}} it had been arranged that they should do, and halted, staring <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> As <b>for</b> me, I sat still upon my stone and smoked on.|$|R
60|$|They looked <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{in silence}} <b>for</b> {{a moment or}} two, {{and there was a}} curious {{hardness}} in Wyllard's eyes. Then Hawtrey spoke again.|$|R

60|$|They sat {{hand in hand}} {{without looking}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> or {{speaking}} <b>for</b> a few minutes; in Maggie's mind the first scenes of love and parting were more present than the actual moment, and {{she was looking at}} Philip in the Red Deeps.|$|R
