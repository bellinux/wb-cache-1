40|$|The {{proposed}} cartel between Air New Zealand {{was rejected}} by the NZ Commerce Commission, supported on appeal by the High Court. The case was an important and interesting application of the Net Public Benefit test in competition policy, under which the <b>assessed</b> <b>costs</b> or detriments of a determined substantial lessening of competition (SLC) are weighed against any offsetting benefits, for the purposes of authorisation. In this paper quantification of the detriments is shown to depend on the identity of those affected - consumers/producers; New Zealand/Australian/foreign. Impacts on the long-run performance of markets and on related markets were claimed and are evaluated. The basic legitimacy of the public benefit test in this context is assessed, in terms both of the purpose of the NZ anti-trust legislation and of the economics of long-term market performance. The much simpler traditional SLC-focussed implementation of anti-trust might perform better overall. ...|$|E

SETTING: Data {{were collected from}} eight hospitals and from six blood centres operated by the Canadian Red Cross Society in four provinces. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs associated with four stages of transfusion [...] collection, production, distribution and delivery [...] in 1933 were <b>assessed.</b> <b>Costs</b> were divided into the following categories; personnel, purchases, external services, overhead, donors' time, patients' time (for autologous transfusion), wastage and infection. RESULTS: The mean overall cost of a transfusion performed on an inpatient basis was $ 210 per unit of red blood cells for an allogeneic transfusion and $ 338 per unit of blood for an autologous transfusion. The mean cost of an allogeneic transfusion performed on an outpatient basis was $ 280 per unit of red blood cells.

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} of autologous {{peripheral blood}} stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) compared with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Morbus Hodgkin (MH) was <b>assessed.</b> <b>Costs</b> were determined from the induction chemotherapy regimen up to 3 months after discharge from hospital following the transplantation. Quality of life {{was measured by the}} EuroQol, the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) and the SF- 36. Patients were randomised according to a 2 : 1 ratio to undergo either PBSCT or ABMT. 62 patients underwent PBSCT and 29 ABMT. Costs of the transplantation period were significantly lower in the PBSCT group (15 008 Euros) than in the ABMT group (19 000 Euros). Significant differences in quality of life were all in favour of PBSCT and emerged using the RSCL, both on 14 days after the transplantation and three months after discharge. We conclude that PBSCT is associated with lower costs and a better quality of life than ABMT for patients with refractory or relapsed NHL or MH. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} is to assess the {{relationship}} between body mass index (BMI) class and Medicare claims among young-old (65 - 69), old (70 - 74), and old-old (75 +) adults over a 10 -year period. METHOD: We <b>assessed</b> <b>costs</b> by BMI class and age group among 9, 300 respondents to the 1998 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with linked 1998 - 2008 Medicare claims data. BMI was classified as normal (18. 5 - 24. 9), overweight (25 - 29. 9), mild obesity (30 - 34. 9), or severe obesity (35 or above). RESULTS: Annualized total Medicare claims adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, education, and smoking history were 109 % greater for severely obese young-old adults in comparison with normal weight young-old adults (US$ 9, 751 vs. US$ 4, 663). Total annualized claim differences between the normal weight and severely obese in the old and old-old groups were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Excess Medicare expenditures related to obesity may be concentrated among severely obese young-old adults.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that natal philopatry {{is a prerequisite}} for the evolution of sociality. The life-history hypothesis maintains that longevity of adults results in extended territory tenure and thus limits breeding vacancies for offspring, which makes natal philopatry more likely. Here, we tested the importance of longevity for natal philopatry in females of a basal primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). This species is regarded as being solitary due to its foraging habits but while males disperse, female offspring in this species forgo dispersal and form long-term sleeping groups with their mothers. We tested whether high adult survival could be a cause for natal philopatry of female offspring. In addition, we <b>assessed</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits associated with space sharing between mothers and daughters and whether mothers actively increase survival of daughters by beqeauthal of territories, information transfer about resources or thermoregulation. Contrary to our predictions, adult females had low-survival rates. Space sharing appeared to improve survival of both, mothers and daughters. This could be a result of information transfer about sleeping sites and thermoregulatory benefits. Our results cast doubt on the idea that longevity predisposes species for social traits and provide support for benefits of philopatry...|$|E

Cost {{containment}} remains a dominant theme within the health care sector, and reliable information concerning the costs of alternative treatment strategies is therefore rele-vant. The various options for treating edentulousness are compared in this report. Dental implants were developed as an alternative means of support for conventional dentures, and their effectiveness has been well established during the last decade. Growing evidence of this effective-ness calls for research into the costs and outcomes of this treatment.

30|$|Interventional {{radiology}} {{is somewhat}} different from diagnostic imaging, since {{the results of}} interventional procedures can be considered directly as outcomes under existing models. They fit perfectly within the value-based healthcare framework: patients’ preferences can be <b>assessed,</b> <b>costs</b> can be measured and “value” calculated and {{compared to that of}} other therapeutic procedures. However, interventional radiology procedures are not performed in isolation. As already noted, their outcome is linked to the work of the other doctors who precede and follow the intervention and are thus subject to the quality of both the referral and follow-up. Furthermore, in the existing VBH framework, no “value” can be calculated regarding the correct choice, the quality and the results of the diagnostic examinations performed to decide on the feasibility of the procedure and to guide it, and these are often performed immediately before the intervention, in the same session, and often by the same radiologist. It is not only a matter of correct diagnosis; the details of how to perform the therapeutic procedure can often be chosen only from data obtained by specifically tailored diagnostic examinations. The quality of their results is therefore critical in determining the “value” of the following therapeutic procedure. These too have to be considered and metrics about them must be developed.|$|E
