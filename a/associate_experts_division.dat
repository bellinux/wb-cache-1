50|$|The 65th Division (Dai-rokujūgo Shidan) was an {{infantry}} {{division of the}} Imperial Japanese Army. Its call sign was the <b>Expert</b> <b>Division</b> (Sen Heidan).

40|$|Expert {{systems can}} be used to govern the {{intelligent}} control of vehicles, for example the Robotic Air Vehicle (RAV). Due {{to the nature of the}} RAV system the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system needs to perform in a demanding real-time environment. The use of a parallel processing capability to support the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system's computational requirement is critical in this application. Thus, algorithms for parallel real-time expert systems must be designed, analyzed, and synthesized. The design process incorporates a consideration of the rule-set/face-set size along with representation issues. These issues are looked at in reference to information movement and various inference mechanisms. Also examined is the process involved with transporting the RAV expert system functions from the TI Explorer, where they are implemented in the Automated Reasoning Tool (ART), to the iPSC Hypercube, where the system is synthesized using Concurrent Common LISP (CCLISP). The transformation process for the ART to CCLISP conversion is described. The performance characteristics of the parallel implementation of these expert systems on the iPSC Hypercube are compared to the TI Explorer implementation...|$|R
