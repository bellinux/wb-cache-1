40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show that within the context of Nigeria's {{development}} effort, financial development with respect to the banking system has <b>aided</b> <b>investment</b> and economic development to a greater extent than is generally recognised. This study, therefore, sets itself the task of a detailed examination of the structure of the Nigerian banking system as a service producing industry, the analysis of the economic performance of the banking system arid the prescribing of policies and regulations to improve the banking system's structure and performance. The structure of the Nigerian banking system is reflected in its historical pattern of growth, ownership, the network branch expansion, assets and liabilities composition and the legal and regulatory framework. The economic performance is reflected in output, profitability and the efficiency with which the banks have met some requirements indeispensable for economic development such as the contribution to saving-investment process and the provision of adequate finance to various sectors of the economy. A banking system, as a service industry, suffers from output measurement problem. Surrogates were used to measure the output of the Nigerian banking systems. The profitability of the banking system was measured by the ratios of profit after tax/capital and profit after tax/assets. The determinants of the Nigerian banking system's lending and profitability performance are based on the hypothesis: the demand, policy and structure variables significantly affect the performance of the Nigerian banking system. The evidence from the analysis indicates xii that policy and demand factors were more important in influencing the performance of the banking system. The bank market structure as measured by the bank offices rather than the deposits concentration ratio was significant in influencing the Nigerian banking system's performance. The study i rounded up by prescribing policies and regulations to improve the structure and performance of the Nigerian banking system...|$|E

40|$|Few {{issues of}} {{economic}} development arouse such deep emotions or controversies as {{the role of the}} foreign sector. Most orthodox economists believe that foreign <b>aid,</b> <b>investment,</b> technology and transnational corporations (TNC) are important contributory factors to economic development. On the other hand, the neo-Marxist paradigm suggests that the present system revolving around the foreign sector represents the continuation of domination over the developing by developed countries. Foreign <b>aid,</b> <b>investment,</b> technology and TNC are regarded as tools of neo-imperialism, the devices by which developed countries continue to retain control over the economies of the ex -colonies. The role of foreign aid in economic development is also criticised by some extreme right scholars who argue that foreign aid is neither necessary nor sufficient for economic development. In Section 1, foreign aid will be analysed both from the orthodox as well as from neo-Marxist positions. The main features of Australian recent foreign aid will be discussed in Section 2. The policy implications and some recommendations will be made in the final Section 3. Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Security and Poverty,...|$|R

Specifically, we investigate the robustness {{of the relationship between}} aid and physical capital investment in Less Developed countries (LDCs) using two different measures of aid and five measures of the policy environment. We find that external aid has a positive and significant impact on physical capital investment given the support of the sample data we use. This effect is robust to the measurement of aid as well as the policy environment. However, the character of the positive relationship between <b>aid</b> and <b>investment</b> varies with the combination of the aid measure and the policy environment.

40|$|The authors'study of <b>aid,</b> <b>investment,</b> and {{policies}} in Africa {{leads them to}} four principal conclusions: 1) The traditional links between <b>aid,</b> <b>investment,</b> and growth are not robust. Aid does not necessarily finance investment and investment does not necessarily promote growth. 2) Differences in economic policies can explain much {{of the difference in}} growth performance. Poor quality of public services, closed trade regimes, financial repression, and macroeconomic mismanagement explain Africa's poor record. 3) Foreign aid cannot easily promote lasting policy reform in countries where there is no strong domestic movement in that direction. Country ownership of reform is more important than donor conditionally. 4) These three conclusions imply that societies themselves must take the lead in putting growth-enhancing policies in place. When this happens, foreign aid can play a powerful supporting role, bringing ideas, technical assistance, and money. The combination of private investment, good policies, and foreign aid is quite powerful. Where do we stand in the search for the key to growth in Africa? Because past"keys"to growth in Africa have failed, the authors are cautious about claims to a new key. But even if aid-cum-private-investment-cum-policy reform falls short of being the one and only key to growth, disbursing aid into good policy environments would be an improvement on current practices.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies reveal that effectiveness of aid on growth is ambiguous. The authors consider <b>aid</b> proliferation-excess <b>aid</b> <b>investment</b> relative to recurrent cost-as a potential cause that undermines aid effectiveness, because aid projects can only produce sustainable benefits when sufficient recurrent costs are disbursed. They consider the donor's budget support as {{a device to}} supplement the shortage of the recipient's recurrent cost and to alleviate the misallocation of inputs. However, when donors have self-interested preferences {{for the success of}} their own projects over those conducted by others, they provide insufficient budget support relative to aid, which results in aid proliferation. Moreover, aid proliferation is shown to be worsened by the presence of more donors. Copyright � 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation � 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
