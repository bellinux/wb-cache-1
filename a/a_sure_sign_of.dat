5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a {{fruitful}} and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII's first {{marriage}} had {{its origins in}} 1502 when his elder brother, Arthur, died. Their father, Henry VII, then betrothed Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon, to the future king. The betrothal immediately raised questions related to the biblical prohibition (in Leviticus 18 and 20) against marriage to a brother's wife. The couple married in 1509 and {{after a series of}} miscarriages, a daughter, Mary, was born in 1516. By the 1520s, Henry still did not have a son to name as heir and he took this as <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> God's anger and made overtures to the Vatican about an annulment. He gave Cardinal Wolsey the task of prosecuting his case; Wolsey began by consulting university experts. From 1527, in addition to his duties as a Cambridge don, Cranmer assisted with the annulment proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Shen Teh is {{rewarded for}} her hospitality, as the gods {{take it as}} <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> goodness. They give her money and she buys a humble tobacco shop which they intend as both gift and test: will Shen Teh be able to {{maintain}} her goodness with these newfound means, however slight they may be? If she succeeds, the gods' confidence in humanity would be restored. Though at first Shen Teh seems {{to live up to the}} gods' expectations, her generosity quickly turns her small shop into a messy, overcrowded poorhouse which attracts crime and police supervision. In a sense, Shen Teh quickly fails the test, as she is forced to introduce the invented cousin Shui Ta as overseer and protector of her interests. Shen Teh dons a costume of male clothing, a mask, and a forceful voice to take on the role of Shui Ta. Shui Ta arrives at the shop, coldly explains that his cousin has gone out of town on a short trip, curtly turns out the hangers-on, and quickly restores order to the shop.|$|E

50|$|In the {{philosophy}} of David Hume, the way society perceives genius {{is similar to the}} way society perceives the ignorant. Hume states that a person with the characteristics of a genius is looked at as a person disconnected from society, as well as a person who works remotely, at a distance, away {{from the rest of the}} world. On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed <b>a</b> <b>surer</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish, than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.|$|R

2500|$|The dermis {{generating}} the horn is {{anchored to the}} boss by interpenetration between rugosities – various irregularities of bone, which it creates by deposition. This tissue is a specialisation of dermal armour, which, whenever it attaches to bone, deposits the rugosities to strengthen the attachment. The author states that rugosity is [...] "a bony signature of dermal armor". Cranial rugosity is an indication, but not <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign,</b> <b>of</b> a horn. If, on the other hand, an annular (ring-shaped) pattern is visible in the rugosity, it is due to [...] "stress concentration {{at the edges of}} horns" [...] and is [...] "the signature for epidermal horns".|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the {{presence}} of mopane worms is defoliation of mopane woodland - sometimes around ninety per cent of leaves. Fenced-in browsing animals may rely on the mopane, and on other trees favoured by the caterpillars, as {{an important part of}} their diet. Some farmers therefore view the mopane worm as competition for their livestock, and attempt to eradicate the [...] "pest" [...] with insecticides and the like. However, the caterpillar season is short, and the trees sprout the new, tender foliage which browsers prefer, so this problem can be managed in other ways, for example, by working to mutual benefit with the local caterpillar harvesters who will control the worms by harvesting them.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "afternoon" [...] series {{suggested}} a great preponderance of mere catch words, showing how slowly I {{was able to}} realise the meaning of abstractions; the phrases intruded themselves before the thoughts became defined. It occasionally occurred that I puzzled wholly over a word, and made no entry at all; in thirteen cases either this happened, or else after one idea had occurred the second was too confused and obscure to admit of record, and mention of {{it had to be}} omitted in the foregoing Table. These entries have forcibly shown to me the great imperfection in my generalising powers; and I am sure that most persons would find the same if they made similar trials. Nothing is <b>a</b> <b>surer</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> high intellectual capacity than the power of quickly seizing and easily manipulating ideas of a very abstract nature. Commonly we grasp them very imperfectly, and cling to their skirts with great difficulty.|$|R

To ask such a question is to do historiography of philosophy; its task is not to figure out whether what is being claimed is true and whether how it is argued for is valid. Rather, the task is to decipher what is being claimed; after all, how are we to say whether a given proposition is true or an argument sound, if we don’t know what the proposition says or the argument is in the first place...|$|R
2500|$|The double-besomed jetted (slit) hip pocket is {{the only}} style {{understated}} enough to complement the dinner jacket. [...] Flap pockets are not considered appropriate for formal attire's refined minimalism due to their busier and bulkier design and are simply an attempt by tuxedo manufacturers to save money by using standard suit patterns (although sometimes they will trim the edges of a flap pocket so that the flap can be tucked in or removed if desired). [...] Besom welts can be of self fabric or trimmed with the lapel's silk facing, though classic menswear scholar Nicholas Antongiavanni suggests that for the English this latter touch [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> hired clothes." [...] The dinner jacket should also have a welt breast pocket to hold a pocket handkerchief, which should generally be self-faced rather than covered with silk.|$|E
2500|$|The channel's {{association}} with the Lambie-Nairn branding agency began in [...] 1991 following on from when Alan Yentob became controller of BBC2 in 1987. Upon taking up office, Alan realised that a review needed {{to be carried out}} of the TWO. The research carried out a start of the review found that viewers saw the TWO as [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "Old Fashioned", with it having a highbrow effect. To rectify this, Lambie Nairn was hired to create a new identity. The 1986 ident was replaced by the start of the highly successful series of idents involving a sans serif '2'. The idents themselves were very simple, such as Paint or Water and this changed people's perception of the channel, despite the fact that only the idents had changed. These new 2's had corporate branding on BBC2 for the first time, allowing cross channel continuity to be easily done. It also brought a unified feel to the channel. These new idents also changed the style of idents. Previously the ident was a single scene that would introduce all types of programmes. The fact that there were multiple idents allowed variation (at one point, there were 40), and for different idents to introduce different genres of programme. Also, special idents were created for themed nights and for special events such as Christmas. <b>A</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> success for these idents is that they survived the rebrand following the new BBC corporate logo in 1997. The idents simply displayed the new logo, while more idents were added to the batch.|$|E
2500|$|R.L. Shaffer of IGN {{identified}} [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as a [...] "tear-jerking poetic ballad." [...] Film Genre 2000: New Critical Essays author Wheeler W. Dixon {{believes that}} the song's lyrics are about the couple's [...] "implicit promise of regeneration through love." [...] 29 lines in length, {{all of which are}} exactly five syllables, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is a love song about a couple's transformation from friends into [...] "something more". The film's theme song, its lyrics [...] "capture the essence of the film" [...] by describing the relationship between Beauty and the Beasts two main characters, specifically citing ways in which the two have changed each other for the better and finally learned to accept their differences and mistakes. According to Jake Cole of Not Just Movies, the first stanza begins [...] "in earnest, and the subtlety of it has the ironic effect of being overpowering." [...] Beginning with Lansbury singing the lyrics [...] "Tale as old as time, true as it can be," [...] JoBlo.com wrote that the song [...] "offers <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> romance between the Beauty and her Beast." [...] Meanwhile, Songfacts believes that [...] "The message of the song is that a couple can be 'as old as time' no matter how different they are." [...] According to Chris Lucas of Moviepilot, Ashman's lyrics describe the couple's [...] "hesitation and surprise at falling in love unexpectedly," [...] while author Thomas S. Hischak wrote in The Disney Song Encyclopedia that the song is [...] "about how two tentative hearts are united in love." [...] Featuring the line [...] "Barely even friends, then somebody bends, unexpectedly," [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune {{believes that the}} ballad [...] "makes the case for all lovers to look past their partners' faults and into their hearts," [...] while Cole wrote, [...] "Ashman goes for the truth ... we don't know we're in love until we spend time with someone and unforced adjustments make the pieces fall into place." [...] The Emperor's Old Groove: Decolonizing Disney's Magic Kingdom author Brenda Ayres cited the song as an [...] " [...] that a reciprocal power relationship has developed between Belle and the Beast ... confirm 'his transformation, her legitimacy, and their powerful unity." [...] According to the lyricist's website, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] summarizes the way in which [...] "Belle tames the beast and finds the happy ending she has dreamed about." [...] The Meanings of [...] "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook author Jerry Griswold believes that the song's opening line [...] "tale as old as time" [...] alludes to the fact that Belle's story is an ancient, timeless one [...] "deliberately situated within the context of other traditional tales;" [...] hers is simply [...] "the newest incarnation" [...] of it. The Translation of the Songs in Disney's [...] "Beauty and the Beast": an example of Manipulation author Lucía Loureiro Porto agrees that although the song [...] "does not tell any story, it is made of phrases that imply that love is as old a feeling as mankind." [...] According to Perry Seibert of AllMovie, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is [...] "as sappy as Ashman ever got as a lyricist." [...] Seibert believes that the song [...] "acknowledges its own banality ... without minimizing or mocking its inherently sweet description of true love."

6000|$|We may {{place this}} reform {{towards the end}} of the year 1750, or the {{beginning}} of 1751, when his mind was agitated by the busy discussion which his first Discourse excited, and by the new ideas of literary power which its reception by the public naturally awakened in him. [...] "It takes," [...] wrote Diderot, [...] "right above the clouds; never was such a success."[210] We can hardly have <b>a</b> <b>surer</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man's fundamental sincerity than that his first triumph, the first revelation to him of his power, instead of seducing him to frequent the mischievous and disturbing circle of his applauders, should throw him inwards upon himself and his own principles with new earnestness and refreshed independence. Rousseau very soon made up his mind what the world was worth to him; and this, not as the ordinary sentimentalist or satirist does, by way of set-off against the indulgence of personal foibles, but from recognition of his own qualities, of the bounds set to our capacity of life, and of the limits of the world's power to satisfy us. [...] "When my destiny threw me into the whirlpool of society," [...] he wrote in his last meditation on the course of his own life, [...] "I found nothing there to give a moment's solace to my heart. Regret for my sweet leisure followed me everywhere; it shed indifference or disgust over all that might have been within my reach, leading to fortune and honours. Uncertain in the disquiet of my desires, I hoped for little, I obtained less, and I felt even amid gleams of prosperity that if I obtained all that I supposed myself to be seeking, I should still not have found the happiness for which my heart was greedily athirst, though without distinctly knowing its object. Thus everything served to detach my affections from society, even before the misfortunes which were to make me wholly a stranger to it. I reached the age of forty, floating between indigence and fortune, between wisdom and disorder, full of vices of habit without any evil tendency at heart, living by hazard, distracted as to my duties without despising them, but often without much clear knowledge what they were."[211] ...|$|R

5000|$|Edge, {{one of the}} principals, has {{for some}} time wanted to {{thoroughly}} [...] "spring-clean" [...] the whole place {{and get rid of}} Rock, his granddaughter, and Birt, partly to secure the sage's cottage for the use of additional school staff. In other matters, she is more hesitant. When in the morning some girls report Mary and Merode missing, pointing out that neither of their beds has been slept in, Edge turns out to be very reluctant to use the official channels to inform relatives, the school supervisor, or the local police. Naturally it occurs to her and her colleague Baker that Mary and Merode might have eloped with two young men ("At the station much of their time was taken up with young women adrift, who, after fourteen days, returned brown and happy from a fortnight with a boy by the ocean."), but, rather than fearing the worst, they assume the girls will be back for that night's entertainment, a ball in honour of the academy's founder—without men of course. At the same time Edge turns down some of the staff's requests to be allowed to go swimming in the nearby lake, which is interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>sign</b> that one <b>of</b> the girls' bodies could turn up any time floating in the water.|$|R

50|$|The War Between the States {{has just}} ended as {{the action in}} this work begins, {{following}} five Union soldiers as they {{return to their homes}} in the Ozarks of northern Arkansas, matter-of-factly planning a resumption of their pre-War existences. However, many residents from the village of Winslow and its surrounding region are averse to offering a helping hand to Yankees, Arkansas having {{been a member of the}} Confederacy. Nonetheless, some Winslow citizens are working to close the nation's divisiveness and it is to them that the returning veterans must look for support. Ongoing animosity between both factions in a recent war provides interesting material for a film; unfortunately, this one is not composed well with a result that it fails to develop interest for viewers. Veteran director of Westerns Joseph Kane is called from retirement as an attempt to rescue this faltering production, but he is not enough to offset a stale script and a great deal of deficient acting. Although it should properly be designated as a Southern rather than as a Western, some old hands of the latter genre are present, including Walter Brennan in his last feature film outing, John Russell, Myron Healey, and Dan White, each of whom plays creditably, although unavailingly, given the screenplay shortcomings. Locals, along with stuntmen, fill many of the parts, while members of a remarkable quartet composed of the lead females either are barely able to read their lines or overact to <b>an</b> absurd extent, <b>sure</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> too few takes and a lack of direction. Cinematographer Mario Tosi creates a visually sensuous environment, one that correctly utilizes natural light; the sound mixing, however, is eccentric. The Ozark location is extraordinarily beautiful, and Tosi takes full advantage of its luxuriance so that in each scene, notwithstanding the action's failure to consistently draw in the viewer, there remains much to enjoy in the pictoral sense; 'tis less than providential that for Kane's swan song, the landscape steals the show.|$|R
