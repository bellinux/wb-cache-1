25|$|Piper {{believes}} in justification by faith alone apart from any works, and his teachings emphasize {{the need for}} the active and inevitable perseverance of the believer in faith, sanctification, and enduring sufferings, which he believes is evidence of God's saving grace. According to Piper, a once-professing Christian who does not faithfully persevere until the end demonstrates that he was mistaken about his election and was never <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>believer</b> in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Milan Bandić heavily used {{religion}} {{as an issue}} in the campaign, calculating that Josipović's agnosticism would be a turn-off for a largely Catholic country as Croatia. He constantly repeated the only one he fears is God and that he was raised as <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>believer</b> and a humble Christian, also making claims that he has the support of the Catholic Church. Josipović largely ignored Bandić's attempts saying he would be the president of all Croatians no matter their religious beliefs. The incumbent president Stjepan Mesić was elected twice despite his atheism. However, the Bandić campaign used all tactics to force the issue, even distributing fliers in front of churches after the Sunday mass across the country urging believers to choose between the cross and a red star, referencing communism.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for the A.V. Club, noting that while the episode wasn't subtle, it did [...] "a good job expanding the show's world, and playing off of undercurrents and themes which have been built in throughout DS9 first season." [...] He described Winn as the [...] "most unsettling of enemies, <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>believer</b> whose faith doesn't prevent her from manipulation and deceit". [...] Handlen described the character of Vedek Winn as [...] "terrific". In her analysis of the episode, Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation said she thought the episode was [...] "pretty fantastic" [...] when she originally watched it. Upon re-watching it years later, she thought it had improved even further. Green described the episode as [...] "a no-holds-barred story about the hypocrisy of religious leaders which seems less influenced by the Scopes Trial than by contemporary creationist politicians." [...] She described Fletcher as one of her favourite actresses and thought that she portrayed Vedek Winn as the older sister of Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.|$|E

500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>believer</b> in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying I was getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{presented a}} {{legend of the}} Fairy Flag's origin. This legend concerned a MacLeod who went on a Crusade to the Holy Land. On his journey homewards, the MacLeod attempted to cross a dangerous mountainous pass on the borders of Palestine. Here, he met a hermit who gave him food and shelter. The hermit warned the MacLeod of a dangerous spirit that guards the pass, which had never failed to destroy <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>believer.</b> However, {{with the aid of}} a piece of the True Cross and certain directions from the hermit, the MacLeod is able to defeat the [...] "She Devil"—who is called [...] "Nein a Phaipen, or Daughter of Thunder". In reward for conveying some secrets that the spirit wanted some friends to know, she revealed to the MacLeod [...] "the future destinies of the Clan". The writer of the c.1800 manuscript stated that this knowledge was said to have been held by this man's family until its extinction. The spirit then gave the Macleod her girdle, telling him to convert it into a banner. The MacLeod then used his spear as a flag pole. The writer of the c.1800 manuscript stated that the spear was by then since lost, and that the secrets conveyed to MacLeod were lost forever. The writer also gave his own opinion on the origin of the Fairy Flag. The writer stated that the flag most probably originated as a banner used in the Holy Land, and that it was conveyed back home by the character portrayed in the legend.|$|E

2500|$|As {{has been}} mentioned, the {{doctrine}} of the Investigative Judgment {{is an integral part of}} the Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the sanctuary. <b>As</b> <b>true</b> <b>believers</b> are found righteous in the judgment, their sins are removed or [...] "blotted" [...] from record by the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. This is believed to have been foreshadowed by the work of the High Priest in the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). The investigative judgment is the final phase of Christ's atoning work, which began on the cross and continued after his ascension in the Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.|$|R

2500|$|Tsar Ivan IV (reigned 1547-1584) {{took this}} {{matter to the}} ecclesiastical court and was {{immediately}} advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty. [...] Ivan IV, as <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>believer</b> in witchcraft, was deeply convinced that sorcery accounted {{for the death of}} his wife, Anastasiia in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken. [...] Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the Oprechnina (1565-1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles. [...] Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the Time of Troubles (1598-1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.|$|E

Bukharin himself speaks of his [...] "peculiar duality of mind" [...] in his last plea, which led to [...] "semi-paralysis of the will" [...] and Hegelian [...] "unhappy consciousness", which presumably stemmed from the reality of ruinous Stalinism (although he could not of course say so in the trial) and the threat of fascism (which required kowtowing to Stalin, who became the personification of the Party).|$|R
2500|$|By {{this point}} in the Depression many intellectuals were flirting with Socialist causes, and Ornitz tried to {{interest}} Caspary by giving her the Communist Manifesto, The Daily Worker and other materials.

[...] She would help raise funds for causes and sign petitions but never actually become <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>believer.</b> [...] Nonetheless, one of the last things her mother would do before she died was to scold her for associating with [...] "filthy reds". [...] Upon returning to Greenwich village, Caspary was invited to join the Communist party by a very prominent playwright, and did so, though under the alias of 'Lucy Sheridan'. [...] Caspary found the Party's code of secrecy to be contrary to her search for truth and questioning of values, which had led her to join in the first place. [...] Though claiming to never actively trying to recruit anyone, she admits performing Party chores such as fund-raising and hosting the fortnightly Confidences Club meetings at her home, which were mostly for socializing.|$|E

Cole defended this decision saying, he felt the song never got the push it deserved, and {{he wanted it to}} reach more people. Another song that was previously released on another project The Warm Up, was [...] "Lights Please". Cole explained this song was the track that won over his manager Mark Pitt and Jay-Z. The interlude, was revealed to be a quick skit where Cole talks about the day he found out Jay-Z wanted to sign him. As soon as Cole got the good news he was pulled over and ended up spending the night in jail for parking violations. Even so, he explains that it was [...] "the easiest time ever" [...] because he knew success was coming around the corner. The track [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] opens with a sample from the documentary, Backstage where Jay-Z is talking about finding that one great artist that he'll sign. [...] "Dollar and a Dream III" [...] was revealed, produced by Kyle Justice, the third in the [...] "Dollar and a Dream series" [...] following the two from his first two mixtapes. In an interview with VIBE Cole admitted that he originally wanted Jay-Z to appear on the song [...] "God's Gift" [...] rather than [...] "Mr. Nice Watch." [...] He continued saying, [...] "Everything worked out, I'm <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>believer</b> that everything happens for a reason. Like, when he did that, it made way more sense than my song.
