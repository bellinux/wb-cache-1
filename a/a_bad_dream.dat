5|$|The game {{begins when}} the player assumes {{the role of}} a {{stranger}} who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard tells him that a dragon has captured the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave. Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick's footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord. The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes that in order to restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the hero is given a dialogue choice – to side with the Dragonlord or to challenge him. If players choose the former, the game ends, the hero is put to sleep, and the game freezes; however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>dream.</b> If players choose to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.|$|E

On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman?

[...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>dream</b> — but it's not <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>dream,</b> it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
500|$|Spider-Man creator Stan Lee {{praised the}} storyline {{and what he}} {{perceived}} as the courage its creators showed in so drastically changing a popular and well-established character.

The Spider-Man newspaper strip adopted the [...] "One More Day" [...] retcon in its version of [...] "Brand New Day" [...] (along with [...] "The Wedding!", one of just three stories to appear in both the Spider-Man comic book and newspaper strip), but reader reaction to the erasing of Peter and Mary Jane's marriage was so negative that Lee, who writes the strip, opted to conclude the story by revealing {{that it was in}} fact <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>dream.</b> As such, Peter remains married to Mary Jane in the newspaper strip continuity.|$|E
500|$|Many sources {{claim that}} the 42-reel version was only ever {{intended}} to be a rough cut, and that Von Stroheim chose to cut it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924, with the intention of screening it with intermissions over two nights. The director had difficulty cutting the film down, telling his friend Don Ryan, [...] "I could take out sequences and thus get the job over in a day. That would be child's play. But I can't do it. It would leave gaps that could only be bridged through titles. When you do such a thing you have illustrated subtitles instead of a motion picture." [...] Von Stroheim later claimed that at this time the Goldwyn Company wanted him to shoot a scene of McTeague waking up in his dentist chair, showing the entire film to have been <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>dream.</b> While von Stroheim was editing the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who {{was the head of the}} Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel version of Greed by January 21, 1924. She ordered even more cuts to be made on January 29, but then left for Rome in early February to oversee the production of Ben-Hur and was uninvolved in the film's editing for several months.|$|E

Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken Uher tape recorder to record the sound of his baby daughter Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch felt to be particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch stated that [...] "Peggy's niece was having <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>dream</b> one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way.

No he was on the bare floor, because when I tried to move him, his skin came off. His skin was bloody and stuck to the floor and when I tried to lift him up it just peeled his skin off. He was in the last stages of syphilis. He died less than a week afterwards. Now that was my first introduction to what was badly needed in that institution.|$|R
