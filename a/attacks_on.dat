50|$|Two further thousand-bomber raids were {{conducted}} over Essen and Bremen, but neither so utterly shook both sides as {{the scale of}} the destruction at Cologne and Hamburg. The effects of the massive raids using a combination of blockbuster bombs (to blow off roofs) and incendiaries (to start fires in the exposed buildings) created firestorms in some cities. The most extreme examples of which were caused by Operation Gomorrah, the <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Hamburg, (45,000 dead), <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Kassel (10,000 dead), the <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Darmstadt (12,500 dead), the <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Pforzheim (21,200 dead), the <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Swinemuende (23,000 dead) and the <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Dresden (25,000 dead).|$|R

5|$|The Germans had {{maintained}} the <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> airfields in south-western England {{which they had}} started the previous day. On 12 August, most of the Kentish airfields had been attacked; and on 13 August, the Germans concentrated on the second line airfields south of London. The concentration on Detling and Eastchurch was a failure, as both were Coastal Command stations and bore no relation to Fighter Command. The Germans may have reasoned that if bases such as Manston, Hawkinge and Lympne were neutralised through the <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> 12 August, then Fighter Command may have had to move onto these airfields. In fact, the bombing of 12 August had failed to knock out these strips, and Adlertag had failed to destroy or render Detling or Eastchurch nonoperational. Owing to poor intelligence, weather conditions, and RAF resistance, <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> other targets had failed or been unsuccessful.|$|E
