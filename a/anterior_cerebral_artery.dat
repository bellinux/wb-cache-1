25|$|Cerebral aneurysms, {{also known}} as {{intracranial}} or brain aneurysms, occur most commonly in the <b>anterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery,</b> {{which is part of}} the circle of Willis.

500|$|In general, the {{decision}} between clipping and coiling is {{made on the}} basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10mm) aneurysms of the <b>anterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> and anterior communicating artery (together the [...] "anterior circulation"), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent absolute risk reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery. The main drawback of coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.|$|E

2500|$|In cingulate or subfalcine herniation, {{the most}} common type, the {{innermost}} part of the frontal lobe is scraped under part of the falx cerebri, the dura mater {{at the top of}} the head between the two hemispheres of the brain. Cingulate herniation can be caused when one hemisphere swells and pushes the cingulate gyrus by the falx cerebri. This does not put as much pressure on the brainstem as the other types of herniation, but it may interfere with blood vessels in the frontal lobes that are close to the site of injury (<b>anterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery),</b> or it may progress to central herniation. [...] Interference with the blood supply can cause dangerous increases in ICP that can lead to more dangerous forms of herniation. [...] Symptoms for cingulate herniation are not well defined. [...] Usually occurring in addition to uncal herniation, cingulate herniation may present with abnormal posturing and coma. [...] Cingulate herniation is frequently believed to be a precursor to other types of herniation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{undertook}} {{this study}} to evaluate the hypothesis that most microemboli signals in patients with artificial heart valves are gaseous, assuming that microemboli counts in <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> would progressively decline with increasing distance from the generating heart valve. Methods: A total of 10 outpatients with CarboMedics (Sulzer Carbomedics Inc., n = 5) and ATS prosthetic heart valves (n = 5) in the aortic (n = 8), mitral (n = l), or both aortic and mitral positions (n = l) were recruited. Monitoring was performed simultaneously over the middle and <b>anterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> and the common carotid artery for 30 minutes with the 2 MHZ transducers of a color duplex scanner (common carotid artery) and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography (intracranial arteries). All data were harvested in an eight-channel digital audio tape recorder, and microembolic signal counts were evaluated online by two separate observers. Results: Significantly higher microembolic signal counts were recorded in the common carotid artery (112 [75 to 175]) compared with the middle and <b>anterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> (30 [18 to 36], p < 0. 0001). Interobserver variability was satisfactory (k = 0. 81). Conclusions: Our results strongly argue for gaseous underlying embolic material in patients with artificial heart valves because bubbles are bound to implode with time.
