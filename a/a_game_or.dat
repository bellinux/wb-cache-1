5|$|A {{player who}} commits three major {{penalties}} (including fighting) {{during a game}} is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> <b>or</b> for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.|$|E
5|$|Sanctions {{for such}} infractions may be levied on {{individuals}} or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points {{from a team}} that enters financial administration. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>or</b> had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>or</b> activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E

Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games, and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game. Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams.|$|E

Wetch was soon hooked, spending as much time as possible in a local pool room called the Rack & Cue, playing eight ball and nine ball for 20 cents <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>or</b> more.

25|$|Releases of {{software}} titles often {{come in two}} forms. The full form is a full version of <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>or</b> application, generally released as CD or DVD-writable disk images (BIN or ISO files).

In a game rip, generally all game video is removed, and the audio is compressed to MP3 or Vorbis, which must then be decoded to its original form before playing. These rips are very rare today, as most modern broadband connections can easily handle the full files, and the audio is usually already compressed by the original producer in some fashion.|$|E
