5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Pallas has <b>a</b> <b>moon.</b> <b>A</b> <b>moon</b> about 1 kilometer in diameter was suggested based on occultation data from an occultation on 29 May 1978, and another one separated from Pallas by 750 kilometers and 175 kilometers in diameter itself was suggested in 1980, but later shown incorrect in 1983 occultation observations. Considering the level at which Pallas has been studied and observed since it was discovered, it is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas.|$|E

5|$|For {{a stable}} orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) {{in order to have a}} stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, the Lunar Republic Society, which {{promotes}} the exploration, settlement, {{and development of}} the Moon, named <b>a</b> <b>Moon</b> crater after Jackson. In the same year, for Jackson's 51st birthday, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. In 2010, two university librarians found that Jackson's influence extended to academia, with references to Jackson in reports concerning music, popular culture, chemistry and an array of other topics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{event of}} <b>a</b> black <b>moon</b> is <b>an</b> {{artefact}} {{of how the}} Gregorian calendar or the seasons map onto lunations. There is no physical or geometric difference between <b>a</b> black <b>moon</b> and other instances of <b>a</b> new <b>moon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term black <b>moon</b> {{refers to}} <b>an</b> {{additional}} new <b>moon</b> {{that appears in}} a month or in a season. It may also refer to the absence of <b>a</b> full <b>moon</b> or of <b>a</b> new <b>moon</b> in <b>a</b> month.|$|R
50|$|She is {{commonly}} depicted with <b>a</b> crescent <b>moon,</b> {{often accompanied by}} stars; sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used. Often <b>a</b> crescent <b>moon</b> rests on her brow, or the cusps of <b>a</b> crescent <b>moon</b> protrude, horn-like, from her head, or from behind her head or shoulders.|$|R
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) travel to Andoria, <b>a</b> <b>moon,</b> seeking {{the help of the}} Aenar—an offshoot race of the Andorians—one of whom has been taken by the Romulans to pilot a drone vessel (first seen in the previous episode).|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of moon systems {{is driven by}} tidal forces. <b>A</b> <b>moon</b> will raise a tidal bulge in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> is revolving {{in the same direction}} as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the r{{evolution of}} the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began on}} 5 April 1971 with the desert near Las Vegas {{doubling}} for the South African scenes, followed by filming in the Great Basin Desert, Nevada in May for scenes in which Bond drives <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> buggy. On 7 June production moved to Pinewood Studios for filming at sets of the returning Ken Adams; his sets spread through four of Pinewood's stages. Filming also {{took place in}} London, Dover, Southampton, Amsterdam and the south of France; principal photography finished 13 August 1971.|$|E

5|$|Radiohead's sixth album, Hail to the Thief (2003), mixed {{rock and}} {{electronic}} music with lyrics {{inspired by the}} War on Terror, and was the band's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. <b>A</b> <b>Moon</b> Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down {{to command}} the next {{available}} moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment {{would have gone to}} Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command <b>a</b> <b>Moon</b> mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.|$|E
5|$|The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is Japan's space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and {{aviation}} research, {{and leads}} development of rockets and satellites. It is {{a participant in}} the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe Akatsuki was launched May 20, 2010, and achieved orbit around Venus on December 9, 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include: developing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter to be launched in 2016; and building <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> base by 2030.|$|E
50|$|The king, {{confused}} by the two conflicting accounds of who this man was, decided to put Subramanian to the test. Therefore, he asked Subramanian whether today was <b>a</b> full <b>moon</b> day or <b>a</b> new <b>moon</b> day. At that time, Subramanian was still absorbed in meditation on the Divine Mother, seeing her shining face in his mind. Subramanian, seeing the Goddess' face and mistaking it for the moon, responded to the king {{saying that it was}} <b>a</b> full <b>moon</b> day when it was actually <b>a</b> new <b>moon</b> day. The king, deciding that Subramanian must be mad, ordered that he be burnt at dusk if the moon failed to appear.After some time, the king’s army awakened Subramanian and ordered him to come with them to be executed for his madness. On returning to ordinary consciousness, Subramanian realized that he had mistaken the face of the Divine Mother for the full moon, making him say it was <b>a</b> full <b>moon</b> day when, in actuality, it was <b>a</b> new <b>moon</b> day.|$|R
25|$|Example: If the epact is 27 (xxvii), <b>an</b> ecclesiastical new <b>moon</b> {{falls on}} every date labeled xxvii. The ecclesiastical full moon falls 13 days later. From the table above, this gives <b>a</b> new <b>moon</b> on 4 March and 3 April, and so <b>a</b> full <b>moon</b> on 17 March and 16 April.|$|R
50|$|In astronomy, a {{fortnight}} is half a synodic month, {{equivalent to the}} mean time between <b>a</b> full <b>moon</b> and <b>a</b> new <b>moon</b> (and vice versa). This is equal to 14.77 days.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} published {{discovery of}} <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> {{other than the}} Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, saw a surge {{in the number of}} moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.|$|E
5|$|The episode's title {{refers to}} an astronomical {{alignment}} of three celestial objects, usually the sun, the Earth, and <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> or planet. Mulder and Scully's behavior in the episode was written specifically by Carter to alert the show's audience that Mulder and Scully would not become a romantic partnership. In addition, the episode contained various fan in-jokes, such as Scully getting upset because Mulder is always the driver, which was inspired by nitpicking from fans.|$|E
5|$|The novel, {{like the}} video game it is based on, begins as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace, {{discovering}} an unexpected massive ringworld hidden by <b>a</b> <b>moon</b> in orbit around a gas giant.
