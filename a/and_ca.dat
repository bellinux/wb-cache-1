40|$|Embryonic {{development}} requires generating cell types at {{the right}} place (spatial patterning) and the right time (temporal patterning). Drosophila neuroblasts undergo stem cell-like divisions to generate an ordered sequence of neuronal progeny, making them an attractive system to study temporal patterning. Embryonic neuroblasts sequentially express Hunchback, Krüppel, Pdm 1 /Pdm 2 (Pdm), <b>and</b> Castor (<b>Cas)</b> transcription factors. Hunchback and Krüppel specify early-born temporal identity, but the role of Pdm <b>and</b> <b>Cas</b> in specifying temporal identity has never been addressed. Here we show that Pdm <b>and</b> <b>Cas</b> regulate late-born motor neuron identity within the NB 7 - 1 lineage: Pdm specifies fourth-born U 4 motor neuron identity, while Pdm/Cas together specify fifth-born U 5 motor neuron identity. We conclude that Pdm <b>and</b> <b>Cas</b> specify late-born neuronal identity; that Pdm <b>and</b> <b>Cas</b> act combinatorially to specify a temporal identity distinct from either protein alone, <b>and</b> that <b>Cas</b> repression of pdm expression regulates the generation of neuronal diversity...|$|R

Stability of catalase in liver supernatants was compared normal (C 3 H/C(as) <b>C(as))</b> <b>and</b> mutant mice which were designated acatalasemia (C 3 H/C(bs) C(bs)), hypocatalasemia (C 3 H/C(cs) C(cs)) and acatalasemic heterozygote (C 3 H/C(as) C(bs)). In both treatments of LIS and guanidine, catalase of C(as) C(as) was most stable, C(bs) C(bs) were unstable, and catalase of C(cs) C(cs) <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs) showed midle stability between the stability of <b>C(as)</b> <b>C(as)</b> <b>and</b> C(bs) C(bs) in this order.

After incubation at various temperatures changing from 30 ℃ to 60 ℃ for 10 min, C(as) C(as) was most stable, <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs), C(cs) C(cs) and C(bs) C(bs) were unstable in this order. After acid and alkali treatments in the range of pH 5. 5 to 9. 0, relative activities of C(cs) C(cs) <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs) were similar to that of C(as) C(as), but C(bs) C(bs) was less stable than C(as) <b>C(as),</b> C(cs) C(cs) <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs) in the same range.

40|$|AbstractThe gastrulating {{vertebrate}} embryo develops three germlayers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Zebrafish endoderm differentiation {{starts with}} the activation of sox 17 by casanova (cas). We report that spg (pou 2 /Oct 4) is essential for endoderm formation. Embryos devoid of maternal and zygotic spg function (MZspg) lack endodermal precursors. Cell transplantations show that spg acts in early endodermal precursors, <b>and</b> <b>cas</b> mRNA-injection into MZspg embryos does not restore endoderm development. spg <b>and</b> <b>cas</b> together are both necessary and sufficient to activate endoderm development, and stimulate expression of a sox 17 promoter-luciferase reporter. Endoderm and mesoderm derive from a common origin, mesendoderm. We propose that Spg <b>and</b> <b>Cas</b> commit mesendodermal precursors to an endodermal fate. The joint control of endoderm formation by spg <b>and</b> <b>cas</b> suggests that the endodermal germlayer may be a tissue unit with distinct genetic control, thus adding genetic support to the germlayer concept in metazoan development...|$|R

It lacked a turret, with the main armament, a short 75mm cannon, in a sponson on the right side. By later standards it would therefore have been an assault gun instead of a tank. The vehicle was considered a very imperfect design, because of a poor layout, insufficient fire-power, a cramped interior and inferior mobility due to an overhanging nose section, which had been designed to crush through the belts of barbed wire but in practice caused the tank to get stuck.

25|$|The {{exact number}} of {{vertebrae}} is unknown due to several {{gaps in the}} holotype's spine. The sacrum consisted of 6 fused sacral vertebrae.

The tail comprised about half of the body's total length; as in other dinosaurs, it counterbalanced the body and contained the massive caudofemoralis muscle, which was responsible for forward thrust during locomotion, pulling the upper tigh backwards when contracted. The tail of Ceratosaurus was characterized by comparatively high neural spines (upwards directed bony processes of the caudal vertebrae) and elongated chevrons (bones located below the tail vertebrae), giving the tail a deep profile in lateral view. Uniquely among theropods, Ceratosaurus possessed a row of small, elongated and irregularly formed osteoderms (skin bones) running down the middle of its neck, back and most of its tail. Apart from the body midline, the skin contained additional osteoderms, as indicated by a 6 × 7cm large plate found together with the holotype specimen; the position of this plate on the body is unknown.|$|E

To simulate a commercial application, the experiment was repeated under natural infections, applying PHs at different doses by spray on detached berries.

Src activity is known to be required for the migration of a number of cell types. p 130 Cas was reported to be essential for cell migration and actin fila-ment reorganization. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases were also reported to be critical regulatory factors for growth and migration of VSMC. However, precise intracellular mecha-nisms involving c-Src, p 130 <b>Cas,</b> <b>and</b> MAP kinases in Ang II-stimulated migration of VSMC have not been well elucidated.
