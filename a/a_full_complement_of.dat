It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to mortgage it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public.

The wetlands being a transition ecosystem between land and water are characterised by high diversity of flora and fauna. Some of these wetlands are important habitats for varied number of waterfowls. This chapter attempts to give a highlight on the diversity of Lake Victoria wetland birds, their relationship to aquatic ecosystems and their conservation strategy. Most {{of the information that}} is documented in this chapter originates from pilot study area as identified during the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) Activity Implementation. These study areas are centred at Simiyu and Rubana Riverine Wetland System and the Mwanza Gulf and the Kitaji Wetland System, which is situated in Musoma town. Birds can provide a lot of information with respect to measure of the health of the environment because of their sensitivity to changes in characteristics of the aquatic ecosystems.

5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates whether {{undertaking}} {{a rotation}} of pine plantation on abandoned farmland facilitates {{the return of}} native species. Plant functional traits were used {{as a means of}} assessing the effects of land-use change on vegetation. We explored the relationships among plant traits, time since harvesting and environmental variables for the vegetation found in Pinus radiata plantations after clear-felling. Vegetation was monitored 1 - 3. years following harvesting and repeated eight years later. We compared species richness, composition and traits to those in reference native forest and abandoned farmland. There was a significant temporal shift in attribute associations of harvested plantations towards those in native forest and a move away from plant attributes common to the pre-plantation use of abandoned farmland. Cluster analysis produced ten emergent groups of plant functional traits for 144 plant species. After harvesting, attribute associations were typical of therophytes and included high specific leaf area (SLA), small stature, arbuscular or non-mycorrhizal associations and small, wind-dispersed seed. These were predominantly introduced species that were dominant in abandoned farmland. The repeat survey identified an obvious decrease in therophytes and an increase in species with low SLA, ant dispersal, large seed and ectomycorrhizal associations. This was largely due to an increase in native Myrmecochorous shrubs. Similar attributes were also shared by Ericoid heaths but these species failed to recolonise harvested sites. Relationships among plant traits of species and environmental variables changed over time with a greater proportion of the variance in attribute associations explained by prevailing site conditions (e. g. type of ground cover, edaphic properties) with increasing time since harvesting. There were no relationships among plant attribute associations and stem density or basal area of planted overstorey species suggesting that planting of tubestock seedlings of native overstorey species does not effectively promote the development of native vegetation. The persistence of introduced grasses in areas of former plantation, recruitment failure of native species and a ready supply of introduced species from surrounding land uses suggest that additional rehabilitation measures will be required to promote the return <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fuller</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> native species...|$|R

One mechanism proposed to account for this neuroprotection is the upregulation of neurotrophic factors. Several neurotrophic factors, including Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), {{have been shown to}} upregulate in response to exercise. In order to determine if exercise-induced neuroprotection is dependent upon BDNF, we compared the neuroprotective effects of voluntary exercise in mice heterozygous for the BDNF gene (BDNF+/ 2) with strain-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Stereological estimates of SNpc DA neurons from WT mice allowed 90 days exercise via unrestricted running demonstrated complete protection against the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. However, BDNF+/ 2 mice allowed 90 days of unrestricted exercise were not protected from MPTP-induced SNpc DA neuron loss. Proteomic analysis comparing SN and striatum from 90 day exercised WT and BDNF+/ 2 mice showed differential expression of proteins related to energy regulation, intracellular signaling and trafficking.

The male responds {{to the presence of}} the pheromone with rapid, oriented locomotion. Contact with the female (or other males or larvae) elicits wing-raising and other responses characteristic of male courtship behavior. Males of other species within the genus Periplaneta also respond to a female-produced pheromone, but with less intensity than P. americana. Cross-species testing shows that P. brunnea males respond to the Periplaneta pheromone with the same intensity elicited by the P. brunnea pheromone. A second reaction group containing P. australasiae, P. fuliginosa, and P. japonica also responds to the P. americana pheromone and their conspecific pheromones, but with a low intensity characteristic of these species. Alteration of the antennal morphology of P. americana males can be experimentally induced by manipulating the level of juvenile hormone during development. Males with <b>a</b> <b>full</b> adult <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> olfactory receptors all respond behaviorally to the pheromone.

Based on an analysis of sequence data for the Ty 1, Ty 2 and hybrid Ty 1 / 2 families, we develop a novel 'genomic demography' model to estimate long-term transposition and excision rates and to estimate how long ago these elements entered the yeast genome. We find that rates of excision and transposition have averaged 7. 2 - 8. 7 x 10 (- 8) per generation over evolutionary time. Two separate models provide upper- and lower-bound estimates for the age of the system, suggesting that the first elements entered the genome between approximately 50 million and 250 million generations ago...|$|R
