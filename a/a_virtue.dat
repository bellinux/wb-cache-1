5|$|Hope is {{traditionally}} considered by Christians as a theological virtue (<b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> {{associated with the}} grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.|$|E
5|$|King {{shows how}} enslaved {{children}} were educated for survival and resistance. This education was usually informal and parental and {{taught how to}} deal with slaveowners and their abuse. King also named literacy and religion's role in their education. Kids were taught mutual cooperation as <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> between slaves. Few slaves had formal education and those who did were artisans. Those educated or given religious training were only by the fortune of their owner's interests. King's stories tell of children in domestic, farm, and industrial work, who spent their free time in celebrations, dances, games, folk rituals, and hunting.|$|E
5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as <b>a</b> <b>virtue.</b> Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may strive for truth, it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E

5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered <b>a</b> <b>virtue.</b>|$|E
25|$|While many {{religions}} and philosophers view humility as <b>a</b> <b>virtue,</b> {{some have been}} critical of it, seeing it as opposed to individualism.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas {{defined the}} four {{cardinal}} virtues as prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude. The cardinal virtues are natural and revealed in nature, {{and they are}} binding on everyone. There are, however, three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity. Thomas also describes the virtues as imperfect (incomplete) and perfect (complete) <b>virtues.</b> <b>A</b> perfect <b>virtue</b> is any virtue with charity, charity completes <b>a</b> cardinal <b>virtue.</b> <b>A</b> non-Christian can display courage, {{but it would be}} courage with temperance. A Christian would display courage with charity. These are somewhat supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God: ...|$|R

25|$|Humility, {{in various}} interpretations, is {{widely seen as}} <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> which centers on low self-preoccupation, or unwillingness to put oneself forward, so it is in many {{religious}} and philosophical traditions, it contrasts with narcissism, hubris {{and other forms of}} pride and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.|$|E
25|$|Russell made language, or more specifically, how we use language, {{a central}} part of philosophy, and this {{influenced}} Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gilbert Ryle, J. L. Austin, and P. F.

5000|$|Virtus was <b>a</b> {{specific}} <b>virtue</b> in Ancient Rome. It carries {{connotations of}} valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, perceived as masculine strengths (from Latin vir, [...] "man").

25|$|Consequentialism {{can also}} be contrasted with aretaic moral {{theories}} such as virtue ethics. Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be {{the primary focus of}} our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, Philippa Foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> such as benevolence.|$|E
25|$|In vivo, {{chymotrypsin}} is a {{proteolytic enzyme}} (Serine protease) {{acting in the}} digestive systems of many organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a hydrolysis reaction, which despite being thermodynamically favorable occurs extremely slowly {{in the absence of}} a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin are peptide bonds in which the amino acid N-terminal to the bond is a tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin will also hydrolyse amide bonds in vitro, <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.|$|E
25|$|The main {{drainage}} to {{the north}} of Sail runs to Coledale. This is a long uninhabited valley which exits into the floodplain of the Derwent at the village of Braithwaite. Near its head are two successive steps of crag, each bearing a waterfall. The southern flanks of the fell are drained by Sail Beck and its tributaries, flowing south west between the slopes of Wandope and Knott Rigg to Buttermere village. Sail thus stands on the main watershed of the North Western Fells, <b>a</b> <b>virtue</b> not shared by the higher Grasmoor.|$|E
