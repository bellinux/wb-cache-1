40|$|Abstract: Information {{technology}} (IT) {{has brought}} {{significant changes in}} people’s lives. As {{an important part of}} the IT industry, data centres (DCs) have been rapidly growing in both the number and size over the past 40 years. Around 30 % to 40 % of <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> in DCs is used for space cooling, thus leading to very inefficient DC operation. To identify ways to reduce the energy consumption for space cooling and increase the energy efficiency of DCs’ operation, a dedicated investigation into the energy usage in DCs has been undertaken and a novel high performance dew point cooling system was introduced into a DC operational scheme. Based on the cooling load in DCs, a case study was carried out to evaluate the energy consumptions and energy usage effectiveness when using the novel dew point cooling system in different scales of DCs in various climates. It was found that by using the novel dew point cooling system, for 10 typical climates a DC can have a much lower power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1. 10 to 1. 22 compared to that of 1. 7 to 3. 7 by using existing traditional cooling systems, leading to significantly increased energy efficiency of the DC operation. In addition, the energy performance by managing the cooling air supply at the different levels in DCs, i. e., room, row and rack level, was simulated by using a dynamic computer model. It was found that cooling air supply at rack level can provide a higher energy efficiency in DCs. Based on the above work, the energy saving potential in DCs was conducted by comparing DCs using an the novel dew point cooling system and the optimum management scheme for the cooling air supply to that using traditional air cooling systems and the same supply air management. <b>Annual</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>consumptions</b> for the two cases were given.

40|$|In this study, {{a series}} of {{laboratory}} measurements was conducted on residential air handling units (AHUs) and air conditioners to characterize their performance at typical installed conditions. In addition, performance models of blowers and air conditioners were developed from the laboratory measurements and integrated with building energy simulations to predict the energy consumption and the life cycle cost of ductworks with respect to different climates (Chicago, IL and Austin, TX), duct materials (e. g., sheet metal and flex ducts), flow resistances, and blower types (e. g. PSC and ECM blowers). The experimental results showed that PSC and ECM blowers have distinct airflow, power, and efficiency performance in response to increases in the external static pressure (ESP). The building energy simulation results showed that increasing the duct flow resistance from 0. 3 to 0. 9 in. w. g. (75 to 225 Pa) decreased airflow rates of PSC blowers and consequently decreased the <b>annual</b> blower <b>electricity</b> <b>consumptions</b> by 11 % for the Austin home and 16 % for the Chicago home. However, in systems with ECM blowers the same increase in the duct flow resistance increased the <b>annual</b> blower <b>electricity</b> <b>consumptions</b> by about 60 % for both the Austin home and the Chicago home, primarily because ECM blowers maintained constant airflow rates over a range of pressures. For the same increase in the duct flow resistance, the <b>electricity</b> <b>consumptions</b> of condensing units in systems with PSC blowers increased by 2. 7 % for the Austin home and 5. 5 % for the Chicago home, while the electricity increase in systems with ECM blowers were less dramatic, being 1. 6 % for the Austin home and 1. 5 % for the Chicago home. Also, the simulation results indicated that although the cost-effectiveness of a specific duct design is shown to be heavily dependent on initial duct fabrication and installation costs, the use of lower flow resistance ductworks generally leads to lifetime savings {{in the presence of}} supply and return leakages of 10 %.
