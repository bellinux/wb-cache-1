40|$|Abstract — When a {{microgrid}} {{and distributed}} generation resources are {{disconnected from the}} grid for protection reasons, the restoration of microgrid (restoring distributed generation resources to feed the loads in microgrid) causes to increase the reliability of microgrid. When a fault occurs in the main grid, the reliability of islanded microgrid will be increased. In this paper a novel method for restoration of the microgrid is proposed when the fault occurred in the main grid. Therefore, we {{can take advantage of}} selling power energy during the fault. In addition, because of increasing in reliability, the price of energy will be increased. This paper selected a microgrid with two type of distributed generation resources, power electronic based distributed generation and small gas turbine with synchronous generator. Another {{purpose of this paper is}} to reduce restoration time. The proposed algorithm for <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> is provided. This paper selected a microgrid system in medium voltage. The limitation voltage and frequency is according to IEEE 1547 standards, and simulation will be done by EMTP-RV with <b>automatic</b> and constant <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> separately...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a denoise-and-forward (DNF) two-way relay network (TWRN) with non-coherent differential binary phase-shift keying modulation, where a battery-free relay node harvests {{energy from the}} received radio frequency (RF) signals and uses the harvested energy to help the source nodes for information exchange. Based on the power splitting (PS) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> (TS) receiver architectures, power splitting relaying (PSR) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> relaying (TSR) protocols at relay are studied. In order to investigate the effect of power allocations on two source nodes, power splitting coefficient and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor at relay on performance, the two proposed protocols are analyzed and the bit error rate (BER) expressions of end-to-end system are derived. Based on these expressions, the optimal power of sources, the power splitting ratio and the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor are obtained via the numerical search method. The simulation and numerical results provide practical insights into the effect of various system parameters, such as the power splitting coefficient, the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor, sources to relay distances, the noise power, and the energy harvesting efficiency {{on the performance of}} this TWRN. In addition, the results show that the PSR protocol outperforms the TSR protocol in terms of throughput under various network geometries.|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the forms using design concepts that were Directioncombined to create a Finding (DF) antenna sys-single direction-finding tems {{require the use of}} antenna system covering small aperture antenna the wide bandwidth of arrays, especially on sub- 1 MHz to 18 GHz marines and small aircraft where space is limited. Recently, Astron was asked to provide the smallest possible DF antenna array for a submarine mast. However, to achieve this small array the multiple antennas for each band of frequencies must be brought closer together on the diameter and overlapped with the other frequency bands to decrease the height (see Fig. 1) for a typical, multi-band, DF array covering 1 to 18, 000 MHz. Unfortunately, these desirable features, such as decreasing its volume, cause cross-coupling and degradation of each antenna’s RF pattern causing serious errors in the angle to the target. Astron was fortunate to have previously completed three phase 1 and 2 SBIR programs to resolve the basic problems of: • Closer spacing of antennas to assure a miniaturized DF antenna array without effecting accuracy of target location. • Miniaturizing of antenna elements to decrease DF antenna array height. • Increasing frequency bandwidth coverage of the antenna elements, thus minimizing the number of frequency bands of antenna coverage required. This further reduces the height and weight of the final DF antenna systems. • Miniaturized beam forming networks with automatic self testing to provide more efficient and rapid DF capability. This includes the miniaturized Butler Matrix, low noise amplifiers, adaptive calibration networks, and <b>automatic,</b> real <b>time,</b> RF <b>switching</b> subsystems.

30|$|Wireless energy {{transfer}} through radio frequency (RF) signals {{has emerged as}} the promising and effective solution to supply power and prolong the lifetime of energy-constrained wireless networks. Since RF signals can carry both information and energy, it has recently attracted a lot of attention on research activities, especially on investigating simultaneously wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [1 – 3]. In [4], an energy constrained relay node using amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol was considered based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> and power splitting receiver architectures, respectively. Specifically, the authors investigated both the delay-limited and the non-delay-limited transmission and derived the analytical expressions for the outage probability and ergodic capacity, respectively. Later on, the same authors extended the analysis to the throughput and ergodic capacity of DF relaying systems in [5]. Based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> receiver architecture, the authors in [6] proposed adaptive <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols for RF energy harvesting and information transmission for both AF and DF networks. They obtained analytical expressions of the achievable throughput for both the continuous and the discrete <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols. It is pointing out that these authors only consider half-duplex relaying mechanism, where relay node cannot receive and transmit data simultaneously in the same frequency band.|$|R
40|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>time</b> {{increment}} {{selection scheme}} for numerical analysis of long-term response of geomaterials is presented. The scheme is simple, rational and stable. Governed {{by a simple}} empirical expression, it can adaptively adjust the time increments depending on the strain rate-dependent temporal history of the material response. The proposed expression requires only a few parameters whose selection is a trivial task since they have a small effect on accuracy but {{have a significant effect}} on computational efficiency. This generalization has been made possible because of the enforcement of certain predefined control criteria to avoid extreme conditions. If any of the control criteria is satisfied, the computation is restarted by going a few time steps back to ensure the smoothness of the computed responses and time increments are again continuously adjusted through the governing equation provided. Performance of the <b>automatic</b> <b>time</b> increment selection scheme is investigated through finite element analyses of the long-term consolidation response of clay under different geotechnical profiles and loading conditions. Both elastic and elasto-viscoplastic constitutive relations are considered, including the consideration of the destructuration effects of geomaterials. Numerical results show that the performance of the <b>automatic</b> <b>time</b> increment selection scheme is reasonably excellent. While offering reasonable accuracy of the numerical solution, it can ensure temporal stability at optimal computational efficiency. In addition to the Euler implicit method, the <b>automatic</b> <b>time</b> increment selection scheme also performs well even when the explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed for the integration of time derivatives...|$|R
