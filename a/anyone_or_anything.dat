A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a serpent, a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, mistletoe.

The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the serpents act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) is insight or {{knowledge}} of {{the true nature of}} existence. The Buddhist tradition regards ignorance (avidyā), a fundamental ignorance, misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality, as one of the basic causes of dukkha and samsara. By overcoming ignorance or misunderstanding one is enlightened and liberated. This overcoming includes awakening to impermanence and the non-self nature of reality, and this develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and liberates a being from dukkha and saṃsāra. Prajñā is important in all Buddhist traditions, and is the wisdom about the dharmas, functioning of karma and rebirths, realms of samsara, impermanence of everything, no-self in <b>anyone</b> <b>or</b> <b>anything,</b> and dependent origination.|$|E
