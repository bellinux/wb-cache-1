500|$|Kilburn twice {{accompanied}} the England team on overseas tours to Australia: in 1946–47 and 1954–55. During the former tour, {{he became a}} founder member of the Cricket Writers' Club. He served as its secretary, chairman and later became an Honorary Life Member. He also became the only journalist elected as a life member at Yorkshire, and opened the newly built press box at Headingley Cricket Ground in 1988. In his final years, he became blind—his sight began to fail shortly after his retirement— but according to Wisden, [...] "Jim Kilburn remained an upright, dignified man until he died". Outside of his work, Kilburn played golf to a reasonable standard, and was married with three children. Derek Hodgson writes: [...] "All his work will be valued as an accurate insight into social attitudes {{in the first half}} of this century. Jim Kilburn intended always to write about cricket but in fact he told us <b>all</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more." [...] He wrote ten books on cricket, and contributed regularly to The Cricketer magazine and to Wisden.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, Martin {{began working}} with a new Parlophone signing, the Beatles, whose second feature film, Help! (1965), {{reflected}} the West's increased interest in Indian culture. While discussing the extent of this influence {{by the middle of}} that decade, author Ray Newman quotes from the book The New London Spy by Hunter Davies, who wrote: [...] "Indian restaurants, Indian food, Indian shops, Indian cinemas, Indian concerts, Indian plays, yoga, gurus and contemplation are now <b>all</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> part of the London scene that when a grey Bentley drew into a Swiss Cottage petrol station recently and a 6ft. 6 in. Sikh stepped out wearing a purple turban, green raw silk coat, white jodhpurs, gold slippers and an oriental dagger with a gem-studded hilt, the Irish attendant did not bother to take more than a passing glance." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the debacle}} of the Katt affair in 1730, the Crown Prince lived in virtual house arrest in Rheinsberg; by 1733, after visiting his {{recalcitrant}} son, Frederick William eased {{the restrictions on}} the prince's life, and sent him on the Imperial military campaign in the Rhineland. Bredow was assigned by Frederick William I to teach the Crown Prince [...] "order and economy" [...] (Ordung und Haushaltung). [...] He was not only an [...] "observer", assigned to watch over the prince and report back to the king any problems, and presumably to report back to the king, Bredow developed a good mentoring relationship with Frederick. He stayed with the Crown Prince from early 1734 through December, when Frederick returned to Berlin. Bredow traveled between the front, Berlin, and Bayreuth several times. In February of that year, Frederick wrote to his sister: [...] "Captain Bredow has scared us <b>all</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> especially me, {{when he said he}} found you so altered he did not recognize you and that you would not eat anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. You have no idea what this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, my body is my enemy and my hands are cunts. Nonetheless it means the world to me, thank you <b>all</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> I am truly blessed. [...] Sporadic status updates continue to be posted on Smith's Facebook page, which readily accepts friend requests of fans.|$|E

60|$|The {{wisdom of}} telling him {{was at once}} apparent. His face {{positively}} shone with triumph! He became quite calm, and the fierce glare, which had alarmed them <b>all</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> died out of his eyes. The confession was a triumph for him. He was gratified.|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad, undoubtedly," [...] replied Hamilton, [...] "but {{sorry to}} part from our old companions there.

60|$|It was, however, after <b>all,</b> not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as a {{redresser}} of grievances and {{a friend}} of the oppressed, but as a man that Benicia regarded her companion, for she knew that she loved him. She said nothing, and in a minute or two he spoke again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not think, Captain Cuffe, you've got {{the story}} exactly right. Captain Rule didn't go on the mountain, a'ter <b>all,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to see the aunt as to see the niece at the aunt's dwelling; if one would eend right in a story, he must begin right." ...|$|E
6000|$|He dived {{into the}} {{recesses}} of his memory again, peered about him {{for a minute or}} two, and brought back nothing.

6000|$|Whether {{that great}} {{tenderness}} towards sectaries, which now <b>so</b> <b>much</b> prevails, be chiefly {{owing to the}} fears of Popery, or to that spirit of atheism, deism, scepticism, and universal immorality, which <b>all</b> good men <b>so</b> <b>much</b> lament? ...|$|R
60|$|A great rage took {{possession}} {{of his soul}} as {{he thought of the}} girl whom he had tried to ruin being after <b>all</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better off than himself, and he vowed that he would work her ill.
