From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse. In order to avoid damage from direct handling, parts are secured in custom jigs carried on self-powered wheeled vehicles.|$|R

50|$|In wrought ironwork, the overthrow, {{particularly}} {{popular in the}} Baroque era commencing in the 17th century, refers to the crowning section of ornamental wrought ironwork which forms a decorative crest above a wrought-iron gate; the overthrow provides some stabilizing structure tying together supporting piers {{on either side of}} the swinging sections. The piers may be masonry or of <b>assembled</b> <b>sections</b> of wrought iron. Aside from this stabilizing feature, the overthrow was largely freed of constraints of barring passage of animals or people. Consequently, the iron master was free to express his fancy. Overthrows often feature monograms or cyphers, armorial crests or supporters, and even fully realized coats of arms.|$|R
5000|$|In 19th century Australia a {{large number}} of {{prefabricated}} houses were imported from the United Kingdom. The method was widely used in the construction of prefabricated housing in the 20th century, such as in the United Kingdom as temporary housing for thousands of urban families [...] "bombed out" [...] during World War II. <b>Assembling</b> <b>sections</b> in factories saved time on-site and the lightness of the panels reduced the cost of foundations and assembly on site. Coloured concrete grey and with flat roofs, prefab houses were uninsulated and cold and life in a prefab acquired a certain stigma, but some London prefabs were occupied for much longer than the projected 10 years.|$|R
5000|$|These systems {{consist of}} slab {{formwork}} [...] "tables" [...] that are reused on multiple stories {{of a building}} without being dismantled. The <b>assembled</b> <b>sections</b> are either lifted per elevator or [...] "flown" [...] by crane from one story to the next. Once in position the gaps between the tables or table and wall are filled with [...] "fillers". They vary in shape and size {{as well as their}} building material. The use of these systems can greatly reduce the time and manual labor involved in setting and striking the formwork. Their advantages are best utilized by large area and simple structures. It is also common for architects and engineers to design building around one of these systems.|$|R

5000|$|While the two prototypes were {{assembled}} at de Havilland's Hatfield site, {{final assembly}} of all production aircraft {{would take place}} at the Broughton factory near Chester until the 1990s. By the 2000s, the fuselage, wings and tailfin of the aircraft were still being assembled and partially equipped in the Broughton site, now being owned and managed by Airbus UK; various sub-assemblies were also produced in Airbus UK's Buckley facility. From 1996 onwards, the <b>assembled</b> <b>sections</b> and components were shipped to Wichita, Kansas in the United States, to undergo final assembly. Writing in 1993, Flying Magazine said of the type [...] "In numerical terms, the 125 series is the most successful British commercial aircraft ever built, and the world's longest in-production business jet".|$|R
50|$|Starting in Hamburg-Finkenwerder on the River Elbe, {{the ship}} loads {{the front and}} rear {{sections}} of the fuselage, from where they are shipped to the United Kingdom. The wings, which are manufactured at Filton in Bristol and Broughton, Flintshire in North Wales, are transported by barge to Mostyn docks, where the ship adds them to its cargo. In Saint-Nazaire in western France, the ship trades the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger, <b>assembled</b> <b>sections,</b> some of which include the nose. The ship unloads in Bordeaux. Afterwards, the ship picks up the belly and tail sections by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA in Cádiz in southern Spain, and delivers them to Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, and by the oversize road convoys of the Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit from there to the assembly hall in Toulouse.|$|R
50|$|Airbus - Saint-Nazaire {{is one of}} the European {{centers of}} Airbus, {{responsible}} for the fitting out of fuselage sections. Originally a factory built for SNCASO, it is located at Penhoët, immediate north of the sites of Chantiers de l'Atlantique. An additional facility was built in Gron in 1980. For the Airbus A380, the Airbus Roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ship Ville de Bordeaux brings fuselage sections from Hamburg, Germany for larger, <b>assembled</b> <b>sections,</b> some of which include the nose. The ship then unloads these sections plus wings from Filton, Bristol and Broughton in North Wales at Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, Gironde, and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse. New wider roads, canal systems and barges were developed to deliver the A380 parts. After assembly, the aircraft are flown to Hamburg, XFW to be furnished and painted.|$|R
50|$|Rafts were <b>assembled</b> in <b>sections.</b> Each {{section was}} made up of round or squared timbers, all of the same length except for the outside, or “boom logs,” which {{extended}} aft a few feet to enclose the following section. Thus the sections were coupled together. A fairly typical raft would be one of three, four or five sections, each section having timbers twenty to thirty feet in length.|$|R
500|$|To {{assist in}} moving objects around the {{exterior}} of the station during EVAs, Mir featured two Strela cargo cranes mounted to the sides of the core module, used for moving spacewalking cosmonauts and parts.

50|$|From {{the late}} 1960s {{to the late}} 1970s, the Skol 6-Day cycle race was held here. An indoor velodrome of 166 metres was <b>assembled</b> from <b>sections</b> each September. This was Britain's first indoor velodrome. Top {{professional}} riders from the European 6-Day circuit came to London, including Eddy Merckx, Peter Post, Patrick Sercu and many others. British riders such as World pursuit champion Hugh Porter and British Champion Tony Gowland rode with distinction.|$|R

50|$|Skeletal towers {{became very}} popular with the United States Congress, because they cost {{less than half the}} price of a stone or brick tower of the same height. Since they were <b>assembled</b> from {{prefabricated}} <b>sections,</b> they could be built quickly, even at remote locations. If necessary, they could also be disassembled and shipped to a new location.|$|R
50|$|The Tabula Peutingeriana is {{the only}} known {{surviving}} map of the Roman cursus publicus, the state-run road network. The map itself was created by a monk in Colmar in modern-day eastern France in 1265. It is a parchment scroll, 0.34 m high and 6.75 m long, <b>assembled</b> from eleven <b>sections,</b> a medieval reproduction of the original scroll.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Walk {{required}} {{a great deal}} of planning and coordination: the route had to mapped, checked and marked on the ground, support crews and equipment assembled, transport arranged, child-care, first aid and medical personnel coordinated and a mobile catering system put together, able to serve 200-500 people at a time. For the most part, sections of the Walk were co-ordinated 'tag-team' style, with new coordination teams <b>assembled</b> for <b>sections</b> of the Walk.
