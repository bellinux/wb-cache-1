This chapter presents the different tasks that are related to the recognitionof tables <b>and</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> the associated well-known methods and remaining challenges. Three main tasks are pointed out: the detection of tables in heterogeneousdocuments; the classification of tables <b>and</b> <b>forms,</b> according to predefinedmodels; and the recognition of table <b>and</b> <b>form</b> contents. The complexity of thesethree tasks is related to the kind of studied document: image-based document ordigital-born documents.
