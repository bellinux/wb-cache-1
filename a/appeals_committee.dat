5|$|By 1932, {{there was}} an {{increasing}} movement for government control. By mid-1934 when Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia called for a Catholic boycott of all films, and Raymond Cannon was privately preparing a congressional bill supported by both Democrats and Republicans which would introduce Government oversight, the studios decided they had had enough. They re-organized the enforcement procedures giving Hays and the recently appointed Joseph I. Breen, a devout Roman Catholic, {{head of the new}} Production Code Administration (PCA), greater control over censorship. The studios agreed to disband their <b>appeals</b> <b>committee</b> and to impose a $25,000 fine for producing, distributing, or exhibiting any film without PCA approval. Hays had originally hired Breen, who had worked in public relations, in 1930 to handle Production Code publicity, and the latter was popular among Catholics.* Jeff & Simmmons, pg. 55.* Ross, pg. 270. Joy began working solely for Fox Studios, and Wingate had been bypassed in favor of Breen in December 1933. Hays became a functionary, while Breen handled the business of censoring films.|$|E

The unions were paying little attention to issues, for example, like in-service training for teachers and refresher courses.

25|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for North American and European release in July, {{the game was}} suspended by Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive when it was refused classification in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and given an Adults Only (AO) rating in the United States. As Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony Computer Entertainment do not allow AO titles on their systems, this effectively (if not technically) would have banned {{the game in the}} US as well. In response to these ratings problems, Rockstar censored the game, blurring the screen during the game's executions and removing the scoring system, where players were awarded for particularly brutal killings. This edited version was rated M in the US by the ESRB and was released on 29 October. However, the BBFC still refused to classify the edited version for UK release. Rockstar appealed their decision, and ultimately, the Video <b>Appeals</b> <b>Committee</b> voted that the game could be released with an 18 certificate.|$|E
25|$|Manhunt 2 was {{originally}} scheduled for North American and European release in July 2007, {{but the game}} was suspended by Take-Two (Rockstar's parent company) when it was refused classification in the United Kingdom, Italy and Ireland, and given an Adults Only (AO) rating in the United States.

In response to this, Rockstar edited the game, blurring the screen during the game's executions and removing the scoring system.

500|$|On June 11, 2009, the NCAA Committee on Infractions sanctioned Alabama for [...] "major violations" [...] of NCAA {{policies}} {{as a result}} of athletes who received improper benefits in 16 of 19 NCAA sports, including football. As a penalty, the football program was forced to vacate 21 victories from the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons in addition to being placed on three years probation, ending in June 2012. The university stated that none of the textbooks or materials identified in the investigation were used for profit, and that the athletes involved who still had eligibility remaining were to pay restitution for the additional materials identified as part of the inquiry. Alabama appealed the ruling to the NCAA Infractions <b>Appeals</b> <b>Committee</b> in late June, but was unsuccessful; the Committee upheld the sanctions in March 2010.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the opening}} day of the Church of Scotland's General Assembly, Thursday 21 May, an attempt was made to change the order of {{business}} by hearing the Locharran-Skye overture before the Rennie case, against the legal advice of the Overture and <b>Appeals</b> <b>Committee.</b> [...] The attempt to change the order of business was interpreted by some as being designed to strengthen the cause of those opposed to Rennie's appointment. Speaking to his motion, Peter Parks argued that it would be illogical to decide a specific case without having already established the principle against which the case would be tested. The General Assembly was unconvinced and comfortably defeated Parks's motion, having been persuaded that it would be unjust to hear the overture first due to the danger of anachronism.|$|E

This challenge superseded the VAC decision that the game could be classified, and halted any possibility of it going on sale. On 24 January 2008, the BBFC won their case in the High Court. Presiding Justice Mitting agreed with the BBFC's argument that the VAC had erred when considering whether the game could be considered harmful to minors. Whereas the VAC interpreted this as [...] "actual harm", the BBFC and Mitting believed it referred to [...] "potential harm and risk of harm". The BBFC also argued that the VAC based its decision on whether or not the game would have a [...] "devastating effect on society", and argued that this [...] "harm threshold" [...] was too high. Mitting ordered that the same seven member panel review their findings, and whatever decision they reach the second time would stand.
