At the same time, economical and ecological requirements as well as passenger comfort demands have been increased. In particular the high fuel costs force the airframers to discuss new aircraft concepts and to change the aircraft architecture design. Especially the bleedless architecture of the more electrical aircraft promises further opti-mization potential. However, in the current aircraft architecture bleed air is used to get compressed and fresh air for the cabin air conditioning, in the more electrical aircraft ar-chitecture the lack of bleed air has to be compensated by additionally inducted air.

Defensive armament was improved by the installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5-inch) machine gun in a semi-open dorsal turret equipped with a wind deflector shield to protect the gunner and another 12.7-millimeter machine gun in a retractable ventral turret.

Experiments were carried out in two models of same size 18 cm by 15 cm by 15 cm {{with or without a}} movable wall. A total of 16 tests were carried out with different ceiling vent sizes and ventilation arrangement. Different propanol pool fires of diameters 0. 11 m to 0. 2 m were set up. Volume of propanol varied from 30 ml to 500 ml to give different burning durations. Two pool fires of same volume of fuel and diameter were used in each test, one put in the model and the other burnt outside. The flame lengths of the two fires inside and outside the room model were measured and compared. Two fire regimes under limited ventilation were observed in this scale modeling studies. Firstly, the pool fire inside the model burnt for a longer time with a taller flame when there is no ventilation provided to the model. At the later stage of the fire, the flame height inside the model stretched by over 20 % taller than that for the pool fire outside the model. This fire scenario of having tall flame for a long time is very hazardous and should be considered in designing natural vents. Secondly, providing ventilation at the side wall of the model might induce swirling motion inside. Air will be supplied into the model to burn the pool fire faster with short duration. The flame swirled up to a tall height fast but not stretching up slowly as in the case with limited ventilation.

40|$|The strong {{competition}} between the leading civil aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus and new economical and ecological constraints have lead to new aircraft concepts and to a change of the aircraft architecture design. In particular the bleedless architecture of the more electrical aircraft promises new optimization potential. However, in the conventional aircraft architecture bleed air is generated by the compressor of the engines, in the more electrical aircraft architecture the lack of bleed air has to be compensated by additionally inducted air. Furthermore, when {{taking into account that}} the conventional centralized hydraulic system shall also be replaced by electrical actuators or local hydraulic units, then, more <b>additional</b> cooling <b>air</b> from the outside atmosphere has to be inducted to fulll the new additional cooling requirements of the equipment. The higher amount of required fresh and cooling air can only be provided by either <b>additional</b> <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> or up-scaled <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> Both approaches have a crucial effect on the overall efficiency of the aircraft in particular in regard to the additional produced drag of the new or up-scaled <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> Even in the early design phase of the aircraft the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> type has to be specified, and details of the geometrical design and the placement of <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> have to be fixed. However, a design freeze is only possible when sophisticated evaluation techniques have been applied which guarantuee for certain intake types optimal positions in regard to performance and integration. Only then an efficiency benefit in comparison to conventional aircraft architecture can be obtained. Nevertheless, constraints might inhibit proposed locations, which, in fact, means taking into account performance losses on the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> side. Therefore, further optimization potential has to be opened i. e. by using additional ow manipulating devices in combination with the chosen <b>air</b> <b>intake.</b> Thus, the main objective of the presented research work is to evaluate the potential of vortex generators for the enhancement of the efficiency of <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> In the presented work essential aspects of the air-intake design and the effect of vortex generators on the ow eld will be discussed.

40|$|The {{development}} of aircraft in civil aviation {{has led to}} higher cruise flight altitude and Mach number. At the same time, economical and ecological requirements as well as comfort demands are increasing. This requires a new concept for the aircraft design, {{which may be the}} more electrical aircraft. In the proposed more electrical aircraft, all auxiliary systems are electric powered. This substitutes the pneumatic and hydraulic systems used in current aircrafts. The propulsion turbines of the next generation of aircraft will be designed for higher efficiency and durability. The bleed air outlets in a turbine decrease the efficiency and, by inducing vibrations on the blades, also significantly the durability of the engine. Moreover, the distribution of hydraulic fluid from the engine requires tubing throughout the aircraft, requiring fixed space and adding additional weight. Therefore, the increase in both efficiency and durability will be achieved by the electrification of the aircraft, which eliminates both bleed air and centralized hydraulic fluid distribution. In current aircraft, the bleed air is used partly to get compressed and warm air for the cabin air conditioning. In the next generation aircraft, the cabin air has to be provided by an <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> in combination with a compressor and an air conditioning system. The conventional centralized hydraulic system has to be replaced by electrical actuators or local hydraulic units. These components require also cooling air from the outside atmosphere, which has to be inducted by <b>additional</b> <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> Current civil transport aircraft commonly use NACA-type <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> The proposed new system design of the more electrical aircraft is characterized by the distribution of the consumers throughout the aircraft, which have to be cooled. This may require a wider variety of <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> Therefore a new design process including different types of <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> has to be established. This work addresses the methods for the intake design process. One method to distinguish aerodynamic design methods is to categorize by the dimensions of the approach. One-dimensional approaches are most commonly used and combine streamline theory with empirical factors. They are used in preliminary design, as a relatively accurate estimation. In many cases, correction factors are used to extend the applicability of the method to describe the flow situation more realistically. Since empirical factors are used, the accuracy of these approaches is limited by the accuracy and portability of these factors usually obtained through experimental investigations. The objective of this work is to develop a method for preliminary <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> design. The focal point of the considerations is the intake design for supplying a compressor used in a civil transport aircraft at cruise flight condition at Mach 0. 82 and an altitude of 39000 ft. Different intake types are investigated in order to identify an optimal configuration in terms of high pressure recovery as well as for low additional drag force on the aircraft. The main objective of the design process of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> is to maximize the total pressure recovery from the free-stream air in order to minimize the required compressor power. The method for preliminary intake design is supposed to be one-dimensional and applicable to various intake types. The effects of varying boundary layer thickness, mass flow rate, and flight altitude are taken into account. Furthermore, parameters that specify the geometry of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> are evaluated with regard to optimal performance. The chosen method is implemented into a software tool, which allows the calculation of different <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> and the comparison of those with regard to the requirements. This new calculation tool allows for prediction of intake performance in an early design stage. Dependencies between total pressure recovery, drag, and mass flow of the different intake types are investigated...|$|R
