5|$|Traditional {{algorithms}} for sequence alignment {{and structure}} alignment are not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> circular permutations between proteins.

5|$|Many {{sequence}} alignment {{and protein}} structure alignment algorithms {{have been developed}} assuming linear data representations and as such are not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> circular permutations between proteins. Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models. As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches and are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> topology-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations of dynamic programming. The table below {{is a collection of}} such methods.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{binarization}} algorithm for degraded document {{images is}} proposed. The method {{is based on}} positive and negative pixel energies using the Laplacian of an image.

The given approach is applied to cases of sophisticated, challenging documents and other application scenarios like whiteboard and chalk images...|$|R
30|$|The {{framework}} was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> positively <b>detect,</b> in real-time, content based anomalies for the datasets.

40|$|Although arc {{suppression}} coil systems are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detected</b> high impedance ground faults by monitoring the neutral voltage, there are other system abnormalities which can also cause {{a change in the}} neutral voltage. The causes of abnormal neutral voltages in {{arc suppression}} coil systems are analysed and criteria are developed to differentiate between them based on the phase angle and magnitude of the neutral voltage. Using the criteria developed in this paper, modern computerised protection systems will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> automatically take appropriate action based on the type of system abnormality, immediately, when a system abnormality occurs. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{algorithms}} {{are classified}} {{according to the}} type of input they require. Sequence-based algorithms require only the sequence of two proteins in order to create an alignment. Sequence methods are generally fast and suitable for searching whole genomes for circularly permuted pairs of proteins. Structure-based methods require 3D structures of both proteins being considered. They are often slower than sequence-based methods, but are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> circular permutations between distantly related proteins with low sequence similarity. Some structural methods are topology independent, meaning that they are also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> more complex rearrangements than circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|Sharks have keen {{olfactory}} senses, {{located in}} the short duct (which is not fused, unlike bony fish) between the anterior and posterior nasal openings, with some species <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> as little as one part per million of blood in seawater.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{tympanum}} and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now {{thought that they were}} not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls, like Dendrerpeton, could not hear airborne sound but would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.|$|E

5000|$|In biology, {{especially}} marine biology, recruitment {{occurs when}} juvenile organisms survive {{to be added}} to a population, by birth or immigration, usually a stage whereby the organisms are settled and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>detected</b> by an observer.|$|R
5|$|In 1797, Louis Nicolas Vauquelin {{received}} {{samples of}} crocoite ore. He produced chromium trioxide (CrO3) by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid. In 1798, Vauquelin {{discovered that he}} could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven, {{for which he is}} credited as the discoverer of the element. Vauquelin was also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> traces of chromium in precious gemstones, such as ruby or emerald.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} have found nitrates in ice cores from Antarctica at depths corresponding to the known supernovae of 1006 and 1054 AD, {{as well as from}} around 1060 AD. The nitrates were apparently formed from nitrogen oxides created by gamma rays from the supernovae. This technique should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> supernovae going back several thousand years.|$|E
5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, {{the sting}} is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.|$|E
30|$|The {{framework}} was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> positively <b>detect</b> anomalies {{that were}} determined apriori {{by the owner}} of the datasets. In particular, the framework determined a large set of anomalous readings which occurred when Powersmiths indicated a massive sensor failure.|$|R
50|$|Qualitative {{inorganic}} {{analysis is}} now used {{only as a}} pedagogical tool. Modern techniques such as atomic absorption spectroscopy and ICP-MS are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>detect</b> the presence and concentrations of elements using a very small amount of sample.|$|R

5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
5|$|In both {{navigation}} modes, Air-Cobot is also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect,</b> track, {{identify and}} avoid obstacles {{that are in}} its way. The laser data from laser range sensors and visual data from the cameras {{can be used for}} detection, monitoring and identification of the obstacles. The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional laser data, while identification is easier in the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from laser data can be used to delimit work areas in the image.|$|E
5|$|Most insects, except {{some species}} of cave crickets, {{are able to}} {{perceive}} light and dark. Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes. Many species are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> light in the infrared, ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths. Color vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years ago.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} for contour detection with Convolutional Neural Networks. A multi-scale CNN learning framework is designed to automatically learn the most relevant features for contour patch detection. Our method uses patch-level measurements to create contour maps with overlapping patches. We show the proposed CNN is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> large-scale contours in an image efficienly. We further propose a guided filtering method to refine the contour maps produced from large-scale contours. Experimental results on the major contour benchmark databases demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed technique. We show our method can achieve good detection of both fine-scale and large-scale contours. Comment: IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing 201...|$|R

Simple algorithms for static camera movement detection was implemented and then improved to cope with moving cameras. Results show that finding movement within a moving image at real time can be done with reasonable outcome and that post-processing can improve the quality of that outcome. This makes it <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detecting</b> movement from moving cameras at real time on rugged laptops, controlling for instance an unmanned aircraft vehicle...|$|R

Furthermore, the impact of our autonomous laughter-aware agent on the humor experience of the user and interaction between user and agent is evaluated by sub- jective and objective means. Preliminary {{results show that the}} laughter-aware agent increases the humor experience (i. e., felt amusement of the user and the funniness rating of the film clip), and creates the notion of a shared social experience, indicating that the agent is useful to elicit posi- tive humor-related affect and emotional contagion...|$|R
5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|Six {{clusters}} were imaged in 2007: the Abell clusters 1689, 1995, 2142, 2163, 2261 and 2390, {{which have}} redshifts between 0.091 and 0.322. For {{the largest and}} brightest four of these—Abell 1689, 2261, 2142 and 2390—comparisons were made with X-ray and Subaru weak lensing data to study the cluster layout and radial properties, specifically of the mass profiles and baryon content.

5|$|Some organisms, such as sharks, are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> {{and respond}} to changes in {{electric}} fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves {{to serve as a}} predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.|$|E

5|$|The greater noctule bat {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Microchiroptera and uses echolocation. Echolocation is a perceptual system where echoes are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. Echolocation allows bats to compare the outgoing pulse with returning echoes which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With echolocation, bats are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect,</b> localize and classify their prey in complete darkness. The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when it is completely dark. The greater noctule bat has keen hearing and sense of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|McMillan's abrupt {{departure}} {{was caused}} by the outbreak of World War II in Europe. In November 1940, he began working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he participated in the development and testing of airborne microwave radar during World War II. He conducted tests in April 1941 with the radar operating from an old Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber. Flying over the Naval Submarine Base New London with Luis Walter Alvarez and Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, they showed that the radar was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> the conning tower of a partly submerged submarine. MacMillan married Elsie Walford Blumer in New Haven, Connecticut, on June 7, 1941. Her father was George Blumer, Dean Emeritus of the Yale Medical School. Her sister Mary was Lawrence's wife. The McMillans had three children: Ann Bradford, David Mattison and Stephen Walker.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} discovery, {{separate}} teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, {{and the other}} by Gregory W. Henry, were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> a transit of the planet {{across the surface of}} the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau's team measured a 1.7% drop in HD209458's brightness, which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry's team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star's face.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{reports a}} novel {{integrated}} circuit for fluorescence sensing. The circuit implements a differential readout architecture {{in order to}} reduce the overall noise figure. The circuit has been fabricated in a commercially available 0. 5 µm CMOS technology. Preliminary results show that the reset noise is reduced by a factor of 1. 42 and the readout noise by a factor of 9. 20 when the pixel is operated in differential mode versus singleended mode. Spectral responsivity characteristics show that the photodiodes are most sensitive at 480 nm. Using a commercially available emission filter, the sensor was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reliably <b>detect</b> a concentration of Fura- 2 as low as 39 nM.
