500|$|Ferb {{comes from}} a blended family, a premise the creators {{considered}} underused in children's programming and which reflected Marsh's own upbringing. [...] Ferb's birth mother is never revealed, but the series shows that both Ferb and his father Lawrence hail from the United Kingdom. Lawrence married Ferb's stepmother Linda after meeting her at a 1990s concert by the (fictitious) band Love Händel. Marsh considers explaining the family background [...] "not important to the kids' lives. They are a great blended family and that's <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know." [...] Ferb and his family live in the fictional town of Danville, in a large, suburban neighborhood. Throughout their summer vacation, Ferb and Phineas conceive outrageous schemes to defeat boredom while sitting lazily beneath a tree in their backyard. Phineas mainly conceives each project while Ferb spearheads its construction. Their activities are usually beyond the capability of a typical child and have included toy design (in [...] "Toy to the World"); treasure-hunting (in [...] "The Ballad of Badbeard"); engineering (in [...] "It's About Time!"); and restaurant management (in [...] "Chez Platypus"). Ferb's stepsister, Candace, is always {{trying to get the}} two in trouble with their mother for their schemes, but is never able to. Ferb hardly ever speaks but he is shown to talk at random times with a British accent. Ferb had a long speech in the episode [...] " [...] The Lizard Whisperer".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} to draw {{comparisons}} with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes (soap operas without professional actors), such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks-Smith [...] in a review {{of the first}} series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play [...] "foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome". Banks-Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968: [...] "Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> ask?". Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television, [...] "Don't they know what they're doing? [...] It's The Year of the Sex Olympics! Nigel Kneale was right!". When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003, Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that [...] "in many respects Kneale was right on the money [...] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train-wreck on live TV".|$|E

The Wright Brothers used a yaw string on their 1902 glider tied on their front mounted elevator.

The group added that the 2011-2012 Syrian uprising could also only be resolved through dialogue. They warned against any military intervention in Syria by the West or by Israel in Iran. They added that a war with Iran would have [...] "disastrous consequences." [...] China's Trade Minister Chen Deming said that the [...] "rise [...] of crude oil has impacted all countries.

2500|$|The series' main {{characters}} {{live in a}} blended family, a premise the creators considered underused in children's programming and which reflected Marsh's own upbringing. Marsh considers explaining the family background [...] "not important to the kids' lives. They are a great blended family and that's <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know." [...] The choice of a platypus as the boys' pet was similarly inspired by media underuse, {{as well as to}} exploit the animal's striking appearance. The platypus also gives them freedom to [...] "make stuff up" [...] since [...] "no one knows very much about them." [...] An additional reason for choosing a platypus allowed them to own that [...] "mental real estate", so that if a person thinks [...] "platypus", they'll associate it with [...] "Agent P", just as an ogre is now commonly associated with Shrek.|$|E

[...] The chief thing to be noted here is President Roosevelt's tacit recognition of class animosity in the industrial world, and his fear, which language cannot portray stronger, that this class animosity may spread to the political world. Yet this is the very policy which the socialists have announced in their declaration of war against present-day society--to capture the political machinery of society and by that machinery destroy present-day society.|$|E

As a matter of fact the very thought of killing anything amid such pure surroundings was repugnant to him. To this feeling a big white hare which foolishly sat up to stare at him within fifteen minutes after he had left the cabin undoubtedly owed its life. Slowly the rifle had been raised until the sights rested squarely between the two innocent staring eyes. Then it had been as slowly lowered. [...] "I can't do it, puss.

Who differentiate, who qualify and complicate, who make mean unnecessary elaborations, and so divide mankind. If it were not for the weakness and wickedness of the priests, every one would know and understand God. Every one who was modest enough not to set up for particular knowledge. Men disputed whether God is Finite or Infinite, whether he has a triple or a single aspect. How should they know? <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know is the face he turns to us. They impose their horrible creeds and distinctions. None of those things matter. Call him Christ the God or call him simply God, Allah, Heaven; it does not matter. He comes to us, we know, like a Helper and Friend; that is all we want to know. You may speculate further if you like, but it is not religion. They dispute whether he can set aside nature. But that is superstition. He is either master of nature and he knows that it is good, or he is part of nature and must obey. That is an argument for hair-splitting metaphysicians. Either answer means the same for us. It does not matter which way we come to believe that he does not idly set the course of things aside. Obviously he does not set the course of things aside. What he does do for certain is to give us courage and save us from our selfishness and the bitter hell it makes for us. And every one knows too what sort of things we want, and for what end we want to escape from ourselves. We want to do right. And right, if you think clearly, is just truth within and service without, the service of God's kingdom, which is mankind, the service of human needs and the increase of human power and experience. It is all perfectly plain, it is all quite easy for any one to understand, who isn't misled and chattered at and threatened and poisoned by evil priests and teachers." ...|$|E
