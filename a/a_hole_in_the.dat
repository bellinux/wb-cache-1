5|$|The civil {{leadership}} of the resistance, represented by lawyer Sven Arntzen, demanded Quisling be treated like any other murder suspect and, on 9 May, Quisling and his ministers turned themselves in to police. Quisling was transferred to Cell 12 in Møllergata 19, the main police station in Oslo. The cell was equipped with a tiny table, a basin, and <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall for a toilet bucket.|$|E

5|$|The current {{concrete}} {{stairs to}} the keep are modern, and the original medieval stairway, made from timber and stone, would have incorporated a drawbridge just before the castle doors.

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage. Capt. Willis of the Lucinda saw no one other than Jackalow (whom he blamed for the collision) on board the Spray, and Jackalow refused to be rescued and taken aboard the Lucinda. Willis observed that {{the deck of the}} Spray was strewn with bedding and other articles from the cabin.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{encounters}} Chinese agent Wai Lin, {{who is also}} {{investigating the}} matter and the two agree to work together. They discover that Carver had used the GPS encoder to push the British ship off course and into Chinese waters to incite a war for ratings. With the British fleet {{on their way to}} China, Bond and Wai Lin find Carver's stealth ship, board it and prevent the firing of a British cruise missile at Beijing. They blow <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.|$|E
5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{upper part of the}} ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} a {{classified}} S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, tensions among the agents are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to double-cross Coulson and secure the 0-8-4 for her government. Together, the agents devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing the agents to subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training. Skye secretly confirms her allegiance to the hacktivist group the Rising Tide.|$|E
5|$|Following the victory, Maryland {{patrolled the}} {{southern}} approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks. On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a kamikaze aircraft surprised and struck Maryland. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turrets No. 1 and 2, piercing the forecastle, main, and armored decks and blowing <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4-inch steel, causing extensive damage and starting fires. In all, 31 men {{were killed and}} 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed but still functional.|$|E
5|$|Following this action, Frederick sent Wunsch into Saxony with a {{corps of}} 10,00012,000 men {{in his first}} {{independent}} command. There he participated in the Battle of Hoyerswerda with General Frederick August Finck. Prince Henry, in overall command of the army, surprised von Daun at Hoyerswerda by punching <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Austrian defensive line. This success gave Frederick the first good news he had had in weeks and confirmed to Frederick that Wunsch had been worthy of the trust placed in him.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, {{a scarlet}} ibis {{escaped from the}} zoo and went on the loose in the city after a {{squirrel}} had chewed <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> netting {{at the top of}} its cage. Keepers noticed it was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 miles away in Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006 Krka {{was damaged}} during an {{overhaul}} at the Šibenik Shipyard. While being lowered to the sea, the winch of the syncrolift {{pulled out of}} the concrete causing the ship to fall down, creating <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed to have <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jugal {{which appears to}} be a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Polyaenus's {{accounts}} {{have led}} some modern historians to tentatively propose the following {{synthesis of the}} battle. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greek line. On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|Rififis heist {{scene was}} based on an actual {{burglary}} that took place in 1899 along Marseille's cours St-Louis. A gang broke into the first floor offices of a travel agency, cutting <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floor and using an umbrella to catch the debris in order to make off with the contents of the jeweler's shop below. The scene where Tony regretfully chooses to kill César for his betrayal of the thieves' code of silence was filmed as an allusion to how Dassin and others felt after finding their contemporaries willing to name names in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. This act was not in the original novel.|$|E
5|$|Some ticks attach quickly {{while others}} wander {{around looking for}} thinner skin such as is found on the ears of mammals. Depending on the species and the life stage, {{preparing}} to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. They extract blood by cutting <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host's epidermis, into which they insert their hypostome, and keep the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.|$|E
