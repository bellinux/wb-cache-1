5|$|According to Dance, Clemens was {{requested}} by 20th Century Fox as a love interest for Ellen Ripley. Director David Fincher initially intended to reunite Paul McGann, Richard E. Grant and Ralph Brown (from Withnail and I) with Grant playing Clemens, but Grant declined the role. Despite Alien 3 poor critical reception, Dance {{said in a}} 2014 Daily Beast interview that he considered the film superior to <b>Aliens</b> <b>and</b> its potential was hampered by 20th Century Fox. According to the actor, his role as Clemens exposed him to American audiences {{and led to a}} prominent role as Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The <b>Aliens</b> <b>and</b> Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they saw as a challenge—their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, he called the tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small. Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out.|$|E

5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, <b>aliens,</b> <b>and</b> other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E

Taking {{on the role of}} the robot, Alien 8, the player must explore the large starship in order to ensure that the cryogenic life support systems preserving the biological crew are re-activated.

The circuits are variously shaped as cubes, pyramids, domes or cylinders.|$|E
