It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings.

It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to <b>advance</b> <b>ignition</b> timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detonation}} (knocking) {{in the internal}} combuction engines, especially in the Otto (petrol) engine, that makes some damages, low fuel economy and performance. Until now, the detonation problem has not been solved completely. In this paper, the problem had been studied to discover the new method, how to reject detonation without any changes of engine structure, easy to install and can be activate immediately. The detonation phenomenon have been explained by three theory, that are auto ignition theory, detonation theory and flame vibration, that make noise, detonation (knocking) and damages of some equipments. The detonation can be cause by many things, such as high compression ratio, low grade of fuel, bad combustion camber, low turbulence, large spark advance (timing). For the conventional ignition system, a governor and a vacuum advancer control the ignition timing. It is reliable mechanism, but can not work properly at all conditions. Most of them make detonation occur at low speed and low endurance of the contact breaker. The last technology, electronically device with detonation sensor replace the conventional system. Combination ignition system, the new system, integration of conventional and electronically system, can control the detonation, by making correction of the spark <b>advance</b> (<b>ignition</b> timing) automatically in all condition of speed and load (throttle), using fuzzy logic reasoning (calculation) in the microcontroller.

40|$|A zero-dimensional {{modelling}} {{study has}} been conducted using wrinkled flame theory for flame propagation to understand the in-cylinder pressure behaviour with time in a reciprocating internal combustion engine. These are compared with experiments conducted on the engine operated on biomass derived from producer gas and air mixture. The required inputs on the laminar burning velocity and turbulence parameters are obtained from separate studies. The data related to laminar burning velocity for producer gas and air mixture at thermodynamic conditions typical of unburned mixture in an engine cylinder were obtained from one-dimensional flame calculations. The turbulence parameters were obtained by conducting a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics study on a bowl-in-piston geometry to simulate motored or non-firing conditions. The above mentioned data {{were used in the}} zero-dimensional model to make pressure-time (p-θ) computation over the complete engine cycle, for a range of test cases at varyingompression ratio (CR) and ignition timing. The computational results matched reasonably well with experimental p-θ curves at <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> timing at all CRs. The error in computed indicated power (IP) at <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> setting (18 °- 27 ° CA) is around 3 - 4 per cent for CR = 17. 0 and 11. 5, and between 6 and 9 per cent for CR = 13. 5.

40|$|To fully {{understand}} the elementary reactions behind the ignition of automotive fuels {{the interaction between the}} fuel components must be known. The ignition initiation is most often caused by loss of an H radical from a reactive fuel molecule, for example n-heptane. The formed alkyl radical is prone to react with oxygen under lean conditions. However, it can also abstract hydrogen from other fuel molecules, hence activating more unreactive species. This type of reactions is called cooxidation reactions and including it in combustion mechanisms improve ignition delay predictions {{in a wide range of}} experiments, for Primary Reference Fuel mixtures and toluene/heptane mixtures. Example of such reactions are C 7 H 15 • + C 8 H 18 = C 7 H 16 + C 8 H 17 • C 7 H 15 OO• + C 8 H 18 = C 7 H 15 OOH+ C 8 H 17 • Adding cooxidation reactions also significantly improves prediction of the general trend of auto-ignition phasing as function of operating conditions in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition, HCCI, engine combustion. The effect of NO addition on engine combustion has also been studied in this work. A novel strategy to control ignition onset in HCCI engines is to retain exhaust gases in the cylinder to control the cylinder temperature. While this not only controls the engine temperature it also introduces NOx in the cylinder. The NO will <b>advance</b> <b>ignition</b> onset by several crank angle degrees at concentrations below 10 ppm. This is because NO activates HO 2 in the reaction: HO 2 • + NO = OH• + NO 2. At higher concentrations the ignition onset is not as advanced and in the PRF case even retarded. This is because NO has cool flame-inhibiting effects. Kinetic modelling can also be used to predict combustion efficiency in catalytic combustors for power generation. It was shown that at high pressures the number of free sites decreases which limits the combustion efficiency. Thus a hybrid concept could be used where only a fraction of the air and fuel is burned catalytically. QC 2010110...|$|E
40|$|With the {{electricity}} consumed by air-conditionings increasing sharply {{and the vast}} popularization use of natural gas in our country, the investigations on natural gas engine-driven heat pump (GHP) are now come in for people’s attention. The GHP is an equipment that can provide heating in winter and cooling in summer, which uses natural gas engine as source of power, and makes fully use of waste heat of engine and environment energy of low quality. The GHP has the advantages of high efficiency, low charge, energy saving and environment protection, in favor of reforming the balance of electricity and gas. It can be applied in small and medium-sized shopping malls, hotels, office buildings, entertainment sites, hospitals, residences, schools, and those locations using air-conditionings. The technology of GHP is relatively mature in several developed countries such as Japanese, America, and some European countries, and the application is also very prevalent. In our country, the GHP has not acquired enough recognition, due to many restrictions such as energy policy, technology and economy environment, energy supply status and price. To accelerate the process {{of research and development}} in China, this paper conducted a general theoretical investigation on the GHP. The main contents of this paper are as follows: According to the equipment developed by our laboratory and Haier Group, an integrated mathematic model of natural gas engine-driven heat pump was established, which laid the foundation for character analysis and optimum matching of the system. Though it is a new-style installation providing heating and cooling, the main components (engine, compressor, heat exchanger, and so on) of GHP have developed for many years, and the research of foundational theories is quite integrated. According to these theories, the GHP was simulated through establishing the numerical models of main components. The model of GHP is composed of two parts, namely engine and heat pump model. The model of engine also contains exhaust gas heat exchanger. The model of heat pump is made up of four parts, including scroll compressor, thermal expansion valve, condenser and evaporator. Using the mathematical model, the runtime characteristics of natural gas engine were simulated and analyzed by changing the parameters such as <b>advance</b> <b>ignition</b> angle, compression ratio, and excess air ratio, which provided bases for optimum design and control of natural gas engine. The results of simulation indicate that the primary energy ratio (PER) of the GHP is obviously higher than other conventional heating and cooling equipments, and the part load performance of the GHP is excellent. The characteristic analysis and optimum matching of the GHP are main study objects of this paper with computer simulation as main tools. The methods and conclusions may be helpful for investigation and design of the GHP. 随着电力空调引发的电力危机和天然气在我国的广泛使用，以天然气驱动的燃气热泵逐渐受到重视。燃气热泵（GHP）是以燃气发动机为动力源，充分利用发动机废热以及低品位环境热量，实现冬季采暖、夏季制冷的空调供热装置。燃气热泵空调具有机组效率高，制热能力强，运行费用低，节能环保的优点，有利于改善电力与燃气的峰谷平衡，可广泛应用于中小型商场、宾馆、办公楼、娱乐场所、医院、住宅、学校等需要空调的场所。燃气热泵技术在日本、美国及欧洲等发达国家已比较成熟，应用也非常普遍。在我国，由于受到能源政策、技术经济环境、能源供应状况及价格等因素的制约，燃气热泵技术直到近年才得到一定的重视。 本文对燃气热泵进行了较为全面的数值模拟研究，旨在推动该技术在国内的研发及推广应用。主要研究内容如下： 以本实验室和海尔集团合作开发的燃气热泵机组为原型，建立了燃气热泵各部件及总系统的数学模型，利用该模型，对系统性能进行了模拟计算与分析，为后续的优化匹配及智能控制研究奠定了基础。燃气热泵虽然是一种新型的供热空调装置，但其所用的主要部件（发动机、压缩机、换热器等）都经过了多年的发展完善，基础理论研究亦相当完备，具有完整的基础理论体系。燃气热泵仿真是以这些基础理论为依据，通过对各主要部件建模，并将各部件模型有机耦合，联立求解，实现对整个装置性能的模拟。 燃气热泵仿真模型由两大部分构成，即发动机模型和热泵模型。其中发动机部分还包括烟水换热装置；热泵模型包括涡旋式压缩机、热力膨胀阀、冷凝器、蒸发器 4 个子模型。利用该数学模型，对天然气发动机的性能进行了模拟计算，研究了点火提前角、压缩比、过量空气系数等参数对发动机性能的影响，为天然气发动机的优化设计和控制提供了理论依据；对整个机组的性能进行了研究，结果表明燃气热泵的一次能源利用率高于其它常用的供热空调装置，并且具有良好的变容量调节能力和优越的部分负荷性能。 本文以计算机仿真为主要研究工具，以性能分析、优化匹配为主要研究目的，所采用的方法和得出的结论可供燃气热泵研究和设计时参考...|$|E

40|$|Spark plugs {{have been}} igniting {{combustible}} mixtures like {{those found in}} automotive engines for over a century, and {{the principles of the}} associated ignition techniques using thermal plasma (inductive or capacitive sparks) have remained relatively unchanged during that time. However, internal combustion engines are increasingly operating with boosted intake pressures (i. e. turbo- or super-charged) in order to maintain power output while simultaneously reducing engine size and weight, and they are also operating with increased recirculated exhaust gas dilution to reduce the production of harmful nitrogen oxides. This “downsizing” to increase fuel economy compounded with diluting to decrease emissions leads to challenges in both obtaining traditional ignition and promoting sufficiently fast combustion under this operating paradigm. In conjunction with appropriate electrode design, transient non-thermal plasma can exploit certain non-equilibrium chemistry and physics to bypass these challenges and ultimately promote more reliable ignition and faster combustion. Applied and fundamental experimental investigations of two different <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> techniques are presented: 1) corona discharges igniting gasoline/air/exhaust mixtures in a boosted direct- injection single cylinder research engine and 2) repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharges igniting methane/air mixtures in a constant volume chamber. The engine experimental results show significant decreases in fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide emissions under boosted operation, and both experiments demonstrate more robust ignition and faster flame development. The constant volume chamber results in particular raise important questions about the relative contributions of chemistry and transport to the experimentally observed combustion enhancement. These results highlight the critical importance of electrode design in <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> techniques—the shape and position of electrodes greatly influences the hydrodynamics of developing flame kernels into fuel-air charges.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{the amount of}} dilution applied can be extended while maintaining normal engine operation in a GDI engine. Adding exhaust gases or air to a stoichiometric air/fuel mixture yields several advantages regarding fuel consumption and engine out emissions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to reduce fuel consumption by means of diluted combustion, an <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> system and adjusted valve timing. Tests were performed on a Volvo four-cylinder engine equipped with a dual coil ignition system. This system made it possible to extend the ignition duration and current. Furthermore, a sweep was performed in valve timing and type of dilution, i. e., air or exhaust gases. While maintaining a CoV in IMEP x. Using air as a diluter resulted in a 6 % fuel consumption benefit over exhaust gas dilution, mainly due to the enhanced combustion efficiency arising from higher oxygen concentrations. However, the lower oxygen concentration when using exhaust gases as a diluter led to 50 % lower engine out NO x levels at the dilution limit...|$|R

Company has extensive experience in fuel management systems and other equipment for military and commercial aircraft. A separate corporate entity, Industrial Controls Division was formed due {{to a number of}} non-aerospace spinoffs. One example is a "custody transfer" system for measuring and monitoring liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG is transported aboard large tankers at minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit. Value of a single shipload may reach $ 15 million. Precision's LNG measurement and monitoring system aids accurate financial accounting and enhances crew safety. Custody transfer systems have been provided for 10 LNG tankers, built by Owing Shipbuilding. Simmonds also provided measurement systems for several liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) production and storage installations. Another spinoff developed by Simmonds Precision is an <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> system for industrial boilers that offers savings of millions of gallons of fuel, and a computer based monitoring and control system for improving safety and reliability in electrical utility applications. Simmonds produces a line of safety systems for nuclear and non-nuclear electrical power plants...|$|R

40|$|An {{essential}} element of the HiPER project is the design of high gain targets, compatible with high repetition-rate operation {{and that can be}} mass produced at low cost. HiPER WP 9 (Work Package 9 Requirements analysis for the fusion programme) studied schemes based on direct laser irradiation and <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> (fast ignition and shock ignition), which have potentials for gain in excess of 100 at laser energy of about 1 MJ. To begin with, a very simple target was designed, which could allow for ignition demonstration with a few hundred kJ laser, and can be scaled at higher energy and gain. The ignition requirements have been determined, and crucial issues have been identified. This led to select shock ignition as the main option, since it turns out that all the relevant issues could be tested experimentally at existing facilities in the present decade. WP 9 investigated irradiation schemes, target symmetry and stability issues, sensitivity to parameter changes, requirements for beam delivery and focusing and target positioning. Current work is directed towards increasing target robustness, scaling to greater energy, and designing targets for full scale demonstration...|$|R
40|$|Air-cooled utility {{engines are}} often {{equipped}} with cams {{designed to ensure}} maximum charging efficiency, but the resulting valve lift and timing often correlates to poor engine performance at low speeds and light loads, which manifests itself in poor combustion stability and elevated pollutant emissions. The poor performance at low-speeds and lightloads {{can be attributed to}} the presence of high levels of exhaust gas residuals (EGR) trapped in the cylinder. In this project the combustion stability and pollutant emissions of an air-cooled utility engine were investigated at low speeds and light loads with high residual fractions. An incylinder sampling valve was used to measure the amount of residual fraction in the charge. Varying the cam phasing, opening and closing times of both cams, effected a change in the amount of residual gas retained. A Fast Flame Ionization Detector (FFID) was used to measure the cycle-resolved hydrocarbon emissions from the combustion process, and a standard five-gas analytical emissions bench measured steady-state emissions. In addition, spark timing and different fuel mixture preparation techniques were tested to investigate their influence on combustion progress. The different fuel preparation systems included a stock carburetor, a carburetor-mounted liquid fuel injection (CMLFI) system, and a homogeneous mixing system (HMS). The residual fraction was found to be relatively insensitive to the fuel mixture preparation system, but was to a moderate degree sensitive to the ignition timing. The residual fraction was found to be strongly affected by the amount of valve overlap and engine speed. The measured residual fraction was compared to three models used for EGR prediction in order to quantify their applicability to utility engines. The three models used for comparative analysis include: Yun and Mirsky [16], Fox, Cheng and Heywood [12], and an ideal gas model. None of the three EGR models investigated was able to accurately predict the residual fraction over the entire range of conditions tested. Cylinder pressure-derived parameters were used to evaluate combustion performance parameters for cycle-to-cycle analysis of the investigated operating conditions. The CMLFI showed a slight improvement in performance relative to the other fuel preparation systems. <b>Advancing</b> <b>ignition</b> improved the cyclic variability of the tested conditions, with an exception at very light load operation at low speeds. The combustion stability was found to be sensitive to increasing amounts of overlap. The carburetor produced higher steady-state emissions, unburned hydrocarbons (uHC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx), than the other fuel preparation systems. <b>Advancing</b> <b>ignition</b> and decreasing engine speed increased the measured uHC concentrations. The resulting uHC increased with increasing valve overlap. A strong prior cycle effect was found in the cycleresolved hydrocarbon concentrations at high residual fraction...|$|R
