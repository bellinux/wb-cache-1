5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh {{more than twice as much}} as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The <b>average</b> <b>weight</b> for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta. There do not appear to be any intermediate forms where pale crag martins and rock martin populations breed close to each other in Somalia and Ethiopia.|$|E

50|$|The {{numbers that}} are often {{included}} {{in the names of}} PEGs indicate their <b>average</b> molecular <b>weights</b> (e.g. a PEG with n = 9 would have an <b>average</b> molecular <b>weight</b> of approximately 400 daltons, and would be labeled PEG 400.) Most PEGs include molecules with a distribution of molecular weights (i.e. they are polydisperse). The size distribution can be characterized statistically by its <b>weight</b> <b>average</b> molecular <b>weight</b> (Mw) and its number <b>average</b> molecular <b>weight</b> (Mn), the ratio of which is called the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn).

50|$|When characterizing polymers, it is {{important}} to consider the polydispersity index (PDI) as well the molecular weight.

Six of these new clones have been officially sanctioned by the French government. The vine is semi-upright in habit with 3-5 lobed leaves.

25|$|Newfoundland went decimal in 1865, {{but unlike}} the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it decided to adopt a unit based on the Spanish dollar {{rather than on the}} U.S. dollar, and there was a slight {{difference}} between these two units. The U.S. dollar was created in 1792 {{on the basis of the}} <b>average</b> <b>weight</b> of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. As such, the Spanish dollar was worth slightly more than the U.S. dollar, and likewise, the Newfoundland dollar, until 1895, was worth slightly more than the Canadian colonial dollar.|$|E

40|$|GAGs are {{produced}} by extraction and purification from different animal tissues. These preparations are composed of polysaccharide chains with broad structural heterogeneity and molecular size dispersion. The biological and pharmacological properties of natural polysaccharides {{as well as their}} derivatives are strictly related to their molecular mass and size distribution. As a consequence, a rapid, reliable and reproducible method to determine glycosaminoglycan molecular mass is necessary. High-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) typically permits the determination of the number of <b>average</b> molecular <b>weight</b> (Mn), <b>weight</b> <b>average</b> molecular <b>weight</b> (Mw) and polydispersity. HPSEC separation, and the number of <b>average</b> molecular <b>weight</b> (Mn), the <b>weight</b> <b>average</b> molecular <b>weight</b> (Mw), the Z <b>average</b> molecular <b>weight</b> (Mz) and the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) were calculated for several natural polysaccharides purified from different tissues and sources, such as hyaluronic acid, a fructose-containing polysaccharide with a chondroitin backbone, various chondroitin sulfate samples, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin and its two components, slow moving and fast moving heparin. HPSEC was also used to evaluate the progress of a controlled chemical depolymerization process of chondroitin sulfate induced by free radicals in the presence of copper salt...|$|R
25|$|For {{the best}} quality, yields {{need to be}} kept in check as the vine is notably {{vigorous}} and prone to overproduction. In Chianti, most quality conscious producers limit their yields to 3 pounds (1.5 kg) of fruit per vine. Wine made from high-yielding vines tend to produce wines with light color, high acidity, and less alcohol, which are likely to oxidize ("brown") prematurely due to a lower concentration of tannins and anthocyanins (anti-oxidants). Fully developed grapes are typically 19mm long x 17mm wide, with an <b>average</b> <b>weight</b> of 3 grams.|$|E
25|$|The coldbloods of Germany {{were already}} well-suited {{to the new}} demands of farming given their immense power, and the Ostfriesen had to prove it could offer these same qualities. The one {{advantage}} for the warmbloods was their versatility. They were subsequently bred to have greater depth, breadth and strength, {{at the expense of}} the dryness, nerve, expression and gait qualities for which they had previously been selected. From 1908 to 1940, the average height of Ostfriesisches decreased 4cm while <b>average</b> <b>weight</b> increased from 630kg to 760kg. Other regions began to breed heavy warmbloods: Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, Bavaria, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, and Silesia. While they were founded on their own stock, horses from Oldenburg and Ostfriesland were sold there each year to help them realize their goals.|$|E
25|$|Newfoundland {{starts to}} release its own coinage. In 1865, the one-cent, five-cent, ten-cent, twenty-cent and two dollar coins were released. It was a decimal coinage that {{represented}} fractions of the Spanish dollar unit {{that was used}} in British Guiana. This had the benefit of making one penny sterling exactly equal to two new Newfoundland cents. This was seen as a compromise between those who wanted Newfoundland to adopt the British system and those who wanted Newfoundland to adopt the American system. The Spanish dollar unit was slightly greater in value than the US dollar unit. This was because in 1792 when the US dollar was created, Alexander Hamilton at the treasury had weighed an average sample of worn out Spanish dollars, and the US dollar was defined based on that <b>average</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E

40|$|Consumption of fat diet causes {{deposition}} of fat into skeletal muscles and alcohol increases fat deposition. This study determined effects of fat diet, wine and ethanol on changes of skeletal muscles of rats.
