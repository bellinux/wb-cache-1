40|$|Abstract: What we {{urgently}} need at {{the beginning}} of the twenty first century is <b>a</b> Christological <b>vision</b> <b>that</b> can shape and inform a new and powerful way of helping humankind to interpret their place within the universe. <b>A</b> Christological <b>vision</b> <b>that</b> is unintelligible and uninteresting can have a profoundly deleterious soteriological implication: the orbit of God’s saving grace will not be wide enough to encompass the universal place of humankind. Arthur Peacocke’s move is clear and to the point: only when the foundations and universal scope of God’s grace are fully established for all of creation, then and only then can the importance of God’s specific work in Jesus the Christ be established...|$|R

25|$|The {{beginnings}} of this health ministry {{are found in}} <b>a</b> <b>vision</b> <b>that</b> White had in 1863. The vision {{was said to have}} occurred during a visit by James and Ellen White to Otsego, Michigan to encourage the evangelistic workers there. As the group bowed in prayer at the beginning of Sabbath, Ellen White reportedly had a vision of the relation of physical health to spirituality, of the importance of following right principles in diet and in the care of the body, and of the benefits of nature's remedies—clean air, sunshine, exercise and pure water. Previous to this vision, little thought or time had been given to health matters in the church, and several of the overtaxed ministers had been forced to become inactive because of sickness. This revelation on June 6, 1863 impressed upon the leaders in the newly organized church the importance of health reform. In the months that followed, as the health message was seen {{to be a part of}} the message of Seventh-day Adventists, a health educational program was inaugurated. An introductory step in this effort was the publishing of six pamphlets of 64 pages each, entitled, Health, or How to Live, compiled by James and Ellen White. An article from White was included in each of the pamphlets. The importance of health reform was greatly impressed upon the early leaders of the church through the untimely death of Henry White at the age of 16, the severe illness of Elder James White, which forced him to cease work for three years, and through the sufferings of several other ministers.|$|E
