40|$|A {{public policy}} {{response}} to global competition {{is the creation}} of a geographic concentration of innovative activity (regional innovation systems [RIS]) that will enhance metropolitan economic development through knowledge spillovers, product development, and new firm spin-offs. This article identifies three types of RIS in the thirteen southern states based on a cluster analysis of twenty indicators of innovative and entrepreneurial activity. Next, regression analysis is used to determine if the 1990 - 2000 growth rates of nonmetro county population, employment, and earnings were related to proximity to <b>an</b> <b>RIS</b> after controlling for other county characteristics associated with local economic development. The research findings indicate that nonmetro counties near <b>an</b> <b>RIS</b> experienced more rapid population and employment growth; however, changes in nonmetro growth rates varied by type of regional innovation system. In addition, proximity to <b>an</b> <b>RIS</b> had a stronger impact on nonmetro population change than on nonmetro job growth. Copyright 2006 Blackwell Publishing. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{concept of}} a novel {{reactive}} impedance surface (RIS) as a substrate for planar antennas, that can miniaturize the size and significantly enhance both the bandwidth and the radiation characteristics of an antenna is introduced. Using the exact image formulation for the fields of elementary sources above impedance surfaces, it is shown that a purely reactive impedance plane with a specific surface reactance can minimize {{the interaction between the}} elementary source and its image in the RIS substrate. <b>An</b> <b>RIS</b> can be tuned anywhere between perfectly electric and magnetic conductor (PEC and PMC) surfaces offering a property to achieve the optimal bandwidth and miniaturization factor. It is demonstrated that RIS can provide performance superior to PMC when used as substrate for antennas. The RIS substrate is designed utilizing two-dimensional periodic printed metallic patches on a metal-backed high dielectric material. A simplified circuit model describing the physical phenomenon of the periodic surface is developed for simple analysis and design of the RIS substrate. Also a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) full-wave analysis in conjunction with periodic boundary conditions and perfectly matched layer walls is applied to provide comprehensive study and analysis of complex antennas on such substrates. Examples of different planar antennas including dipole and patch antennas on RIS are considered, and their characteristics are compared with those obtained from the same antennas over PEC and PMC. The simulations compare very well with measured results obtained from a prototype IH miniaturized patch antenna fabricated on <b>an</b> <b>RIS</b> substrate. This antenna shows measured relative bandwidth, gain, and radiation efficiency of a T U 7, a R S�f�, and a WH 7, respectively, which constitutes the highest bandwidth, gain, and efficiency for such a small size thin planar antenna.

40|$|To {{operate in}} a RIS (River Information Services) {{environment}} certain 'tools' will be needed. RINAC deals with a concept of the bridge (wheel-house) of an inland navigation vessel, to operate in <b>an</b> <b>RIS</b> environment. RINAC stands for River Information, Navigation And Communication system, and describes an architecture of the future bridge of an inland vessel {{as a result of}} a study in the Fourth Framework Program of the European Commission. This architecture is based on the two most important tasks of an inland navigation skipper. The first one comprises the tactical tasks like monitoring the traffic environment and making manoeuvring decisions. The RIS concept will assist the skipper to complete the traffic image aboard with additional information in particular on places where the onboard radar cannot oversee the situation. The second task of the skipper is called the strategic task. This includes gathering information from the fairway for voyage planning, cargo loading etc. Reporting dangerous goods is another strategic task that will be part of the RIS concept. The Human Machine Interface, the way how to work with this tool, and how to present the information, forms a part of this study. RINAC describes also the communication requirements as integrated part of the RINAC set-up. Tactical communication must be real time and meet very high reliability and availability of standards. It deals with safety and navigation. Communication for strategic purposes is less time critical and can be obtained from public communication networks. Communication must be transparent for the user. The system decides how data exchange will take place and which available communication means and protocols will be used.

Indeed, this activity has experienced significant and explosive growth positioning Chile {{in the last ten years}} as the second largest exporter of this product with 30 % of the international market after Norway (50 %). The salmon industry is mainly located in the Los Lagos region and has become a key strategic economic sector to promote the regional development. In order to understand about the potential emergence of industrial cluster or, eventually, a Regional Innovations System (RIS) based on this competitive low technology industry, it is important to understand to what extent innovation activities are the result of individual processes and to what measure new knowledge creation is being the result of dynamic and interactive processes where there is a systematic use of structural regional conditions. For example, the presence and emergence of linked and coordinated actors, proximity, specific knowledge and norms that arise from the path of an economic regional specialization as well as the result of the exploitation and absorption of regional externalities through knowledge spillovers. The present Chilean case study is based on a qualitative and quantitative methodology in order to analyse the existence and the stage of development of specific variables that are required to comprehend the evolution of <b>a</b> <b>RIS.</b> Most of the information has been collected through the application of interviews to regional stakeholders and a survey was applied to representative salmon industry firms, obtaining a preliminary and panoramic vision of the most important variables configuring <b>a</b> <b>RIS.</b> From the analysis carried out by this research, the results show that the consolidation of the low-tech Salmon Cluster in the Los Lagos region has not developed the principal factors permitting the consolidation of <b>a</b> <b>RIS.</b> On the contrary, regarding <b>a</b> <b>RIS</b> approach to analyze the national and regional innovation policies, the functional organization and the history of the salmon industry in Los Lagos and the view of the main regional actors, public and private institutions, there are important gaps in terms of the regional conditions to generate innovation.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on regional innovation systems (RISs) {{has shown that}} Prague {{is a prime example}} of a fragmented metropolitan RIS. Fragmented innovation systems are characterized by a strong endowment of knowledge and innovation infrastructure elements, but they suffer from a lack of local networking, cooperation, and knowledge transmission. The aim of this paper is to investigate the nature and geography of innovation, knowledge sourcing, and collaboration in the emerging and still embryonic biotechnology industry in the Prague metropolitan region. The key questions to be answered are whether this general feature of Prague’s innovation system (ie its fragmented structure and the lack of local networking) can also be found in a knowledge-intensive sector, such a biotechnology, or whether sectoral drivers are more significant and the generalized ‘local buzz and global pipelines’ model can also be applied to Prague biotech firms.

A particular focus is directed at the interaction of these employees both within their own enterprises and with individuals and institutions outside them, along with the types of knowledge being involved, and their function in the innovation process. Two research questions are posed: (1) What sort of interaction takes place between individuals inside and outside of an SME when it innovates, within the context of <b>an</b> <b>RIS?</b> and (2) What types of knowledge are involved in this interaction, how are they developed and shared, and what is their function in the innovation process? The study is designed as a qualitative, explorative case study of nine small- and medium-sized enterprises in a Norwegian region. Interaction with customers was identified as the most significant form of interaction driving innovation, and practical knowledge was judged more important than scientific knowledge. This practical knowledge, moreover, was seen as comprising not only production skills but also the practical lifeworld knowledge of customers, and cooperative skills.

However, 4 pooled FV studies revealed modest increases in energy when FV were increased, suggesting inconsistencies in energy; however this could be due to heterogeneity between studies.

Whilst much interest has focused on general FV consumption, the health benefits of single fruit andlor vegetables may differ, and it is therefore of interest to examine the potential of individual foods and compounds contained within this food group.
