50|$|The National Republican Air Force (Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana or ANR) was the {{air force}} of Italian Social Republic and also the air unit of National Republican Army in World War II. Its {{tactical}} organization was: 3 Fighter Groups, 1 <b>Air</b> <b>Torpedo</b> Bomber Group, 1 Bomber Group and other Transport and minor units. The ANR worked closely with German Air Force (Luftwaffe) in Northern Italy even if the Germans tried, unsuccessfully, to disband the ANR forcing its pilots to enlist in the Luftwaffe.|$|E
50|$|The Howell torpedo {{used by the}} US Navy in {{the late}} 19th century {{featured}} a heavy flywheel {{that had to be}} spun up before launch. It was able to travel about 400 yd at 25 kn. The Howell had the advantage of not leaving a trail of bubbles behind it, unlike compressed <b>air</b> <b>torpedoes.</b> This gave the target vessel less chance to detect and evade the torpedo, and avoided giving away the attacker's position. Additionally, it ran at a constant depth, unlike Whitehead models.|$|R

50|$|The main {{developments}} in this laboratory were the <b>air</b> <b>torpedo</b> L 40, {{which could be}} dropped from any height and speed up to 700 km/h, the Dornier Do 335 high-speed aircraft and the Hexenkessel (Witch's Cauldron) project, which aimed to develop a highly effective detonation charge {{for use in a}} warhead of a surface-to-air missile. Coal dust was launched in a grenade, and dispersed by an explosive charge. The subsequent very large explosion was to achieve a high effectiveness. In 1943 the first test with a 60 kilogram thermobaric bomb was carried out.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark 5 was a [...] "hot-running" [...] (powered by heated <b>air)</b> <b>torpedo,</b> {{as opposed}} to {{previous}} Whitehead designs, which were [...] "cold-running". It was similar in performance to the Bliss-Leavitt torpedoes of that era. Around 500 units were produced by the Naval Torpedo Station and Vickers Limited. The Mark 5 had variable speed; at a high speed of 40 knots, it had a range of 1000 yards. A low speed of 27 knots allowed the weapon a range of 4000 yards; at medium speed of 36 knots, its range was 2000 yards. This variable speed was set before loading the torpedo in its tube by adjusting the reducing valve.|$|E

50|$|Irwin helped screen attack {{carriers}} giving direct {{air support}} to the invasion of Iwo Jima, 19 - 23 February 1945, then pounded Okinawa. She joined in the preinvasion bombardment of Okinawa 27 - 31 March, fighting off repeated attacks from planes, torpedo boats, and suicide craft. On 30 March Irwin repelled three Japanese torpedo boats, sinking one, damaging another, and forcing the other to flee. As Marines stormed the shores of Okinawa 1 April 1945, she shot down a twin-engined bomber and rescued one enemy survivor from this victim. For 2 months, Irwin bombarded enemy artillery positions, machine gun emplacements, troop concentrations, caves and suicide boat hiding places. She shot down a suicide torpedo bomber 12 April 1945, and scored another kill the 16th as she covered the landings on Ie Shima. Another enemy suicide plane was shot down 21 May. Irwin figured in another mercy mission the night of 16 June 1945 when she assisted in the rescue of survivors from destroyer Twiggs (DD-591), sunk by combined <b>air,</b> <b>torpedo,</b> and suicide attacks.|$|E

The explosive utilized was compressed guncotton which was fired by a detonator placed at the point of the torpedo and ignited by percussion when the torpedo hits a resisting body.|$|R
5000|$|The three cruisers left Dakar on 18 September, {{intending}} to go south to Libreville, {{but they were}} intercepted by Allied forces, including the heavy cruiser [...] Montcalm and Georges Leygues outran the Allied ships and returned to Dakar, where they helped to defend the port against the unsuccessful British and Free French attack (Operation Menace) on 23-25 September 1940.

50|$|James Otto Richardson (18 September 1878 - 2 May 1974) was an admiral in the United States Navy {{who served}} from 1902 to 1947. As Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (CinCUS), he protested against the {{redeployment}} of the Pacific {{portion of the}} fleet forward to Pearl Harbor, believing that a forward defense was neither practical nor useful, and that the Pacific Fleet would be the logical first target {{in the event of}} war with Japan, vulnerable to <b>air</b> and <b>torpedo</b> attacks. He was subsequently relieved of command in February 1941. His concerns were to be proved justified in December.|$|R
50|$|In May 1941, he was Mentioned in Despatches for his {{initiative}} in sending a Maryland aircraft to reconnoitre for the German battleship Bismarck after poor weather had prevented RAF reconnaissance. He also ordered 828 Naval <b>Air</b> Squadron's Albacore <b>torpedo</b> bombers to Sumburgh, {{ready for a}} strike on Bismarck should she come within range, but she did not.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1939 she was {{involved}} in testing of the effectiveness of a [...] "bubble-free" [...] torpedo system which occurred in Naples.

5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea <b>air</b> and a <b>torpedo</b> blast {{to the side of the}} ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|R
