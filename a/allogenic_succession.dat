40|$|We {{analyzed}} the factors driving succession and the structure, and dynamics of vegetation on sandand gravel bars {{in order to}} clarify the differences in vegetation succession in rivers with different river bed substrates. Woody plant communities (dominated by Salix), perennial herb communities (dominated by Miscanthus),and annual plant communities (dominated by Persicaria) appeared in that order from upstream to downstreamon the sandbar. The results of DCA ordination based on vegetation data reflected a successional trend. Thisresult suggests that sandbars grow in a downstream direction. Various vegetation types different in successionalstage, such as grassland, young stands of Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora), two-layered stands of young andmature pines, and mature pine stands also occurred on gravel bars, but the vegetation in earlier successionalstage was established upstream, which is the opposite to the direction found on sandbars. Those resultsdemonstrate that {{the dynamics of the}} bed load itself could be a factor affecting vegetation succession in rivers. In fact, sands suspended by running water were transported downstream over the vegetated area of sand barand thereby created new areas of sandbar on the downstream end of the sandbar. Meanwhile, gravel, whichis heavy and thereby is shifted by strong water currents, accumulated on the upstream end of the vegetatedarea, and thus created new areas of gravel bar in that direction. These results showed that <b>allogenic</b> processesdrive vegetation <b>succession</b> on sand and gravel bars in streams and rivers...|$|R
40|$|Basiphilous pioneer {{species are}} among the most {{endangered}} plant species in The Netherlands. They find most of their refuges in young coastal dune slacks, especially on the Wadden Sea islands. For the purpose of nature management {{it is important to know}} which processes control the presence of basiphilous pioneer communities, and to learn about the nature of slacks harbouring the concerning successional sequences. In a large dune slack on the Island of Terschelling, we assessed soil nutrient status and tested for nutrient limitation in four chronosequential stages: 2, 6, 37 and ca. 80 yr of age. Stage 2 harboured a basiphilous pioneer vegetation; in the stages 3 and 4 a dense vegetation of dwarf shrubs and grasses occurred. Soil organic matter and nutrient concentrations in each stage were measured in 1991. In 1992 and 1993 fertilizers were applied to all stages to detect nutrient limitation. Rates of accumulation of organic matter, nutrients and above-ground biomass were estimated. When interpreted as successional stages, the different stages represent a sequence as expected on the basis of general successional theory. There was a peak in yearly nutrient accumulation between the 6 - and 37 -yr old stage and a steady state after ca. 80 yr. Between the first two and the latter two stages a shift occurred from <b>allogenic</b> to autogenic <b>succession</b> which correlated with a shift in emphasis from available nutrients to light availability as limiting resources. Basiphilous pioneer species suffered only deficiency of nitrogen, probably because of their low phosphorus requirements. It is concluded that in dune slack habitats, in addition to a low nutrient availability in general, a very low phosphorus availability favours basiphilous pioneer species to species showing co-limitation of nitrogen and phosphorus as found in some grasses and dwarf shrubs. A comparison between the effects of lime addition and the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus additions suggests that, in the early stages, soil buffering increases the availability of nitrogen and inhibits the availability of phosphorus. Sod cutting is an effective technique for restoring basiphilous pioneer vegetation, when slacks are acidified only superficially and buffering-mechanisms can be reactivated. Yearly mowing and removing of standing crop may prolong the lifespan of basiphilous pioneer vegetation, when soil acidification has not yet dropped below pH 6. ...|$|R

They can also increase nutrient content of the soil in certain areas, or shift soil about (as termites, ants, and moles do) creating patches in the habitat.

40|$|Impoundment of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) in the 1930 s created {{large areas}} of biologically diverse and {{productive}} backwater habitat. These areas may be threatened by rapid sediment accumulations that promote increased rates of <b>allogenic</b> <b>succession.</b> Aquatic habitat change in selected backwater areas trom Pool 4 to Pool 19 of the UMR was analyzed for a 25 -year period (1975 to 2000) using color infrared aerial photography and geographic information system (GIS) software. The objective was to describe aquatic habitat changes and {{determine the extent to}} which these changes were consistent with <b>allogenic</b> <b>succession.</b> Four cover classes were recognized, representing a transition from open water to terrestrial vegetation. Several changes were observcd that were consistent with <b>allogenic</b> <b>succession</b> including a transition of emergent vegetation to grasses, forbs and/or woody vegetation. Other changes did not follow this trend including persistencc of open water/submersed vegetation and conversion of emergent vegetation to open water.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying {{community assembly}} and promoting temporal succession are often overlooked in microbial ecology. Here, we studied an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence, spanning {{over a century}} of ecosystem development, to understand bacterial succession in soil. We used 16 S rRNA gene-based quantitative PCR to determine bacterial abundance and multitag 454 pyrosequencing for community composition and diversity analyses. Despite 10 -fold lower 16 S rRNA gene abundances, {{the initial stages of}} soil development held higher phylogenetic diversities than the soil at late succession. Temporal variations in phylogenetic beta-diversity were greater at initial stages of soil development, possibly {{as a result of the}} great dynamism imposed by the daily influence of the tide, promoting high immigration rates. <b>Allogenic</b> <b>succession</b> of bacterial communities was mostly driven by shifts in the soil physical structure, as well as variations in pH and salinity, which collectively explained 84. 5 % of the variation concerning community assemblage. The community assembly data for each successional stage were integrated into a network co-occurrence analysis, revealing higher complexity at initial stages, coinciding with great dynamism in turnover and environmental variability. Contrary to a spatial niche-based perspective of bacterial community assembly, we suggest temporal niche partitioning as the dominant mechanism of assembly (promoting more phylotype co-occurrence) in the initial stages of succession, where continuous environmental change results in the existence of multiple niches over short periods of time...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{impact of}} {{discharging}} an oxidation pond effluent into a wetland in the Waitangi Forest (Northland) {{was assessed by}} comparing the water, soil, and vegetation of this wetland (the sewage wetland) with that of an adjacent wetland not receiving effluent (the reference wetland). The hydroperiod of the two wetlands differs markedly with the sewage wetland now permanently flooded whereas the reference wetland is subject to summer drawdown. Marked {{differences were found in}} gross chemical indicators such as pH and redox potential between the soils of the 2 wetlands. Extreme differences were also found in the nutrient chemistry of the soils and this was related to differences in water chemistry. This was especially the case for the plant available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. Typically the sewage wetland soil contained ammonium and inorganic phosphorus two orders of magnitude greater than that of the reference wetland. Major differences were noted also in the plant communities of the two wetlands. The sedge Eleocharis sphacelata and the bulrush Typha orientalis dominated communities covering {{a large part of the}} sewage wetland, whereas the reference wetland contained a much more diverse Baumea-Isachne grassy sedge community. Historical information indicated that the sewage wetland had similar hydrological, chemical, botanical characteristics to the reference wetland before discharge of the effluent commenced. It is concluded that most of the vegetation community changes that have occurred may be interpreted in terms of <b>allogenic</b> <b>succession</b> but that future community changes will have a strong autogenic component...|$|E
40|$|During the Sedimentation of the {{platform}} carbonate deposits of the Korallenoolith Formation (middle Oxfordian to early Kimmeridgian) small buildups ofcorals formed in the Lower Saxony Basin. These bioconstructions are restricted to particular horizons (Untere Korallenbank,ßorigenuna-Bank Member etc.) and represent patch reefs and biostromes. In this study, the development of facies, fossil assemblages, spatial distribution of fossils, and reefs of the ßorigenuna-Bank Member (upper Middle Oxfordian) in the Süntel Mts and the eastern Wesergebirge Mts is described; the formation of reefs is discussed in detail. Twelve facies types are described and interpreted. They vary between high-energy deposits as well winnowed oolites and quiet-water lagoonal mudstones. Owing to the significance of biota, micro- and macrofossils are systematically described. The reefs are preserved in growth position, are characterized by numerous corresponding features and belong to a certain reef type. According to their size, shape and framework, they represent patch reefs, coral knobs (sensu James, 1983), coral thrombolite reefs (sensu Leinfelder et al., 1994) or “Klein- and Mitteldickichte” (sensu Laternser, 2001). Their growth fabric corresponds to the superstratal (dense) pillarstone (sensu Insalaco, 1998). As {{the top of the}} ßorigenuna-Bank displays an erosional unconformity (so-called Hauptdiskontinuität), the top of the reefs are erosionally capped. Their maximum height amounts to at least the maximum thickness of the ßorigenuna-Bank which does not exceed 4 metres. The diversity of coral fauna of the reefs is relatively low; a total of 13 species is recorded. The coral community is over- whelmingly dominated by the thin-branched ramose Thamnasteria dendroidea (Lamouroux) that forms aggregations of colonies (77 ?. dendroidea thickets). Leafy to platy Fungiastrea arachnoides (Parkinson) and Thamnasteria concinna (Goldfuss) occur subordinately, other species are only of minor importance. In a few cases, the reef-core consisting of Th. dendroidea thickets is laterally encrusted by platy F. arachnoides and Th. concinna colonies, and microbial carbonates. This zonation reflects probably a succession of different reef builders as a result of changing environmental conditions (<b>allogenic</b> <b>succession).</b> Moreover, some reefs are overlain by a biostrome made of large Solenopora jurassica nodules passing laterally in a nerinean bed. Mikrobial carbonates promoted reef growth and favoured the preservation of reef organismn in their growth position or in situ. They exhibit a platy, dendroid, or reticulate growth form or occur as downward-facing hemispheroids. According to their microstructure, they consist of a peloidal, clotted, or unstructured fabric (predominately layered and poorly structured thrombolite as well as clotted leiolite) (sensu Schmid, 1996). Abundant endo- and epibiontic organisms (bivalves, gastropods, echinoids, asteroids, ophiuroids, crabs etc) are linked to the reefs. With regard to their guild structure, the reefs represent occurrences at which only a few coral species serve as builder. Moreover, microbial carbonates contribute to both building and binding of the reefs. Additional binder as well as baffler are present, but not abundant. According to the species diversity, the dweller guild comprises by far the highest number of invertebrate taxa. The destroyer guild chiefly encompasses bivalves. The composition of the reef community was influenced by the habitat structure of the Th. dendroidea thickets. Owing to the increase in encrusting organisms and other inhabitants of the thickets, the locational factors changed, since light intensity and hydrodynamic energy level and combined parameters as oxygen supply declined in the crowded habitat. Therefore a characteristic succession of organisms is developed that depends on and responds to changing environmental conditions („community replacement sequence“). The succession allows the differentiation of different stages. It started after the cessation of the polyps with boring organisms and photoautotrophic micro-encrusters (calcareous algae, Lithocodium aggregatum). Following the death of these pioneer organisms, encrusting and adherent organisms (serpulids, „Terebella“ species, bryozoans, foraminifers, thecideidinids, sklerospongid and pharetronid sponges, terebratulids), small mobile organisms (limpets), and microbial induced carbonates developed. The final stage in the community replacement sequence gave rise to small cryptic habitats and organisms that belong to these caves (cryptobionts, coelobites). The habitat conditions especially favoured small non-rigid demosponges (“soft sponges”) that tolerate reduced water circulation. Reef rubble is negligible, so that the reefs are bordered by fossiliferous micritic limestone passing laterally in micritic limestone. Approximately 10 % of the study area (outcropping florigemma-Bank) corresponds to reefal deposits whereas the remaining 90 % encompass lagoonal inter-reefal deposits. The reef development is a good example for the interaction between reef growth, facies development and sea-level changes. It was initiated by a sea-level rise (transgression) and corresponding decrease in the hydrodynamic energy level. Colonization and reef growth took place on a coarse-grained Substrate composed of oncoids, larger foraminifers and bioclasts. Reef growth took place in a calm marine lagoonal setting. Increasing abundance of spherical coral morphs towards the Northeast (section Kessiehausen, northwestem Süntel Mts) reflects higher turbidity and a facies transition to coral occurrences of the ßorigenuna-Bank Member in the adjacent Deister Mts. The reef growth was neither influenced by stonns nor by input of siliciclastic deposits, and took place in short time - probably in only a thousand years under most probably mesotrophic conditions. The mass appearance of solenoporids and nerineids in {{the upper part of the}} ßorigenuna-Bank Member point to enhanced nutrient level as a result of regression. In addition, this scenario of fluctuations in nutrient availability seems to be responsible for the cessation of reef corals. The sea level fall reached its climax in the subaerial exposure and palaeokarst development of the florigemma-Bank. The reef building corals are typical pioneer species. The blade-like, flattened F. amchnoides colonies are characterized by their light porous calcium carbonate skeleton, which is a distinct advantage in soft bottom environment. Thus, they settled on soft bottom exposing the large parts of its surface to the incoming light. On the other hand, in response to their light requirements they were also able to settle shaded canopy structures or reef caves. Th. dendroidea is an opportunistic coral species in very shallow, well illuminated marine environment. Their thin and densely spaced branches led to a very high surface/volume ratio of the colonies that were capable to exploit incoming light due to their small thamasterioid calices characterized by “highly integrated polyps”. In addition, sideward coalescence of branches during colony growth led to a wave-resistant framework and favoured the authochthonous preservation of the reefs. Asexual reproduction by fragmented colonies promoted reef development as Th. dendroidea thickets laterally extend over the sea floor or new reefs have developed from broken fragments of parent colonies. Similar build ups with Th. dendroidea as a dominant or frequent reef building coral species are known from the Paris Basin and elsewhere from the Lower Saxony Basin (Kleiner Deister Mts). These buildups developed in well-illuminated shallow water and encompass coral reefs or coral thrombolite reefs. Intra- and inter-reef deposits vary between well-winnowed reef debris limestone and mudstones representing considerably calmer conditions. Solenoporid, nerineids and diceratides belong to the characteristic fossils of these occurrences. However, diceratides are missing in theflorigemma-Bank Member. Th. dendroidea differs in its colonization of low- to high-energy environment from recent ramose scleractinian corals (e. g., Acropora and Porites sp.). The latter are restricted to agitated water habitats creating coral thickets and carpets. According to the morphologic plasticity of Th. dendroidea, thick-branched colonies developed in a milieu of high water energy, whereas fragile, wide- and thin-branched colonies prevail in low-energy settings. Due to its relatively rapid growth, Th. dendroidea was able to keep pace with increased Sedimentation rates. 68 benthonic foraminiferan species/taxa have been recognized in thin sections. Agglutinated foraminifers (textulariids) predominate when compared with rotaliids and milioliids. Numerous species are restricted to a certain facies type or occur in higher population densities, in particular Everticyclammina sp., a larger agglutinated foraminifer that occurs in rock building amounts. Among the 25 reef dwelling foraminiferal species, a few were so far only known from Late Jurassic sponge reefs. Another striking feature is the frequency of adherent foraminiferal species. Fauna and flora, in particular dasycladaleans and agglutinated foraminifers, document palaeobiogeographic relationships to the Tethys and point to (sub) tropical conditions. Moreover, in Germany this foraminiferan assemblage is yet uncompared. In Southern Germany similar tethyan type assemblages are not present in strata as young as Middle Tithonian. Während der Sedimentation der Plattformkarbonate des Korallenoolith (Mittleres Oxfordium bis Unteres Kimmeridgium) entstanden im Niedersächsischen Becken auch kleine Biokonstruktionen aus Korallen. Sie sind an wenige Horizonte (u. a. Untere Korallenbank und florigemma-Bank) gebunden und bilden Fleckenriffe und Biostrome. In dieser Arbeit wird die fazielle Ausbildung der florigenwia-Bank (höheres Mittleres Oxfordium) einschließlich des Liegenden und Hangenden im Süntel und östlichen Wesergebirge unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Riffe untersucht. Es werden 12 Faziestypen beschrieben, deren Spektrum zwischen hochenergetischen, gut ausgewaschenen Kalkoolithen und niederenergetischem lagunären Kalklutit variiert. Aufgrund der großen Bedeutung biogener Komponenten erfolgt ebenso eine systematische Bearbeitung der Mikro- und Makrofossilien. Die Riffe sind weitgehend autochthon überliefert. Sie weisen eine Vielzahl übereinstimmender Merkmale auf und gehören einem Rifftyp an. Es sind Fleckenriffe und Riffknospen (sensu James, 1983), Korallen-Thrombolith-Riffe (sensu Leinfelder et al., 1994) bzw. Klein- und Mitteldickichte (sensu Latemser, 2001). Ihr autochthones Riffgefüge entspricht dem superstratalen (dense) Pillarstone (sensu Insalaco, 1998). Die Riffe werden nach oben durch eine Erosionsfläche (Hauptdiskontinuität) begrenzt. Ihre ursprüngliche Höhe dürfte kaum die maximale Mächtigkeit der florigenwia-Bank von 4 m überschritten haben. Die buschförmige Thamnasteria dendroidea (Lamouroux) dominiert die Korallenfauna und bildet heckenartige Vorkommen (Th. dendroidea-Gestrüppe). Fungiastrea arachnoides (Parkinson) und Thamnasteria concinna (Goldfuss) mit horizontalplattiger Wuchsform sind ebenfalls wichtige Riffbildner, andere Korallenarten sind nur untergeordnet vertreten. Aus der seitlichen Inkrustierung der Th. dendroidea-Gestrüppe durch F. arachnoides- und Th. concinna-Stöcke resultiert eine Zonierung der Riffe, die wahrscheinlich eine zeitliche Aufeinanderfolge von sich an einem Standort ablösenden Riffbildner- Vergesellschaftungen als Folge von Umweltveränderungen widerspiegelt (allogene Sukzession). Typisch ist zudem die Überlagerung der Riffe durch große Solenoporayz/rass/ca-Knollen. Mikrobielle Karbonate haben den Aufbau der Riffe erheblich unterstützt, indem sie die Korallenstöcke inkrustieren. Sie treten in flächiger, dendroider und reticulater Wuchsform sowie als Hemisphäroid-Mikrobialithe auf und haben eine peloidale oder dichte Mikrostruktur (vorwiegend lagige und strukturarme Thrombolithe sowie klumpige Leiolithe) (sensu Schmid, 1996). Die Riffe waren der Lebensraum einer artenreichen Fauna endo- und epilithischer Organismen sowie epi- und endofaunaler Benthonten (Muscheln, Schnecken, Seeigel, Seesterne, Schlangensterne, Krebse u. v. m.). In bezug auf ihre Gildenstruktur stellen sie gute Beispiele für Vorkommen dar, in denen nur wenige Korallenarten als Riffbildner auftreten und mikrobielle Karbonate eine Doppelfunktion als Bildner und Binder erfüllen. Weitere Binder und auch Sedimentfänger haben keine Bedeutung. Die Bewohner-Gilde ist durch Artenreichtum gekennzeichnet. Als Zerstörer waren vor allem Bohrmuscheln aktiv. Der Aufbau der Riffgemeinschaft wird erheblich durch die Th. dendroidea-Ge strüppe, die eine charakteristische Mikrohabitat- Struktur aufweisen, beeinflusst. Infolge der biogenen Anlagerung veränderten sich in den Gestrüppen die Standortbedingungen für die Besiedler, da Lichtintensität und Hydrodynamik abnahmen und sich an die Wasserbewegung gekoppelte Parameter, z. B. Sauerstoffzufuhr, verschlechterten. Deshalb ist eine charakteristische Abfolge stets wiederkehrender Organismen, die an die jeweiligen Lebensbedingungen angepasst sind, ausgebildet („community replacement sequence“ bzw. autogene Sukzession). Die Sukzession lässt sich in Stadien einteilen und wird nach dem Absterben der Korallen- Polypen durch Bohrorganismen und photoautotrophe Mikroinkmstierer (u. a. Kalkalgen) eingeleitet. Den Pionierorganismen folgen weitere inkrustierende oder auf Hartsubstrat angeheftete Organismen (Serpeln, Terebellen, Bryozoen, Foraminiferen, Thecideen, sklerospongide und pharetronide Schwämme, Terebrateln), vagile Benthonten (Napfschnecken) sowie durch die Aktivität von Mikroben erzeugte mikrobielle Karbonate. Auch Napfschnecken haben sich als vagile Benthonten durch morphologische Anpassung („Kleinwiichsigkeit“) die Gestrüppe als Lebensraum erschlossen. Im finalen Stadium boten kryptische Mikrohabitate eine Nische für Coelobiten. Zu ihnen gehören kleine Demospongier mit unverbundenen Megaskleren („Weichschwämme“), die als aktive Filtrierer geringe oder fehlende Wasserzirkulation tolerieren. Die Riffe lieferten während ihres Wachstums kaum Schutt. Sie sind von fossilreichem mikritischen Kalkstein umgeben, der seitlich rasch in nahezu fossilleeren mikritischen Kalkstein übergeht. Etwa 10 % der Fläche des Untersuchungsgebietes entspricht Rifffazies, die restlichen 90 % entsprechen lagunären Zwischenriffablagerungen. Das Auftreten der Riffe ist an eine bathymetrische Vertiefung des Ablagerungsraumes (Transgression) und an das Nachlassen der Hydrodynamik gekoppelt. Riffwachstum setzte auf grobkörnigem Lockersubstrat ein. Die Riffe entwickelten sich unter weitgehend uniformen Ablagerungsbedingungen in einem sehr flachen, niederenergetischen Ablagerungsraum mit instabilen Karbonatschlammböden. Durch die größere Häufigkeit von knollig-kugeligen Korallenwuchsformen in der Lokalität Kessiehausen sind im nordöstlichen Süntel höhere Wasserenerergieverhältnisse und fazielle Übergänge zu Korallenvorkommen der/ 7 origemma- Bank im Deister dokumentiert. Das Riffwachstum fand unbeeinflusst von Sturmereignissen und siliziklastischem Eintrag vom Festland statt. Es erfolgte in geologisch kürzester Zeit - wahrscheinlich in ca. 1000 Jahre. Insgesamt sind mesotrophe Bedingungen während des Riffwachstums anzunehmen. Im höheren Abschnitt der florigemma-Bank zeichnet sich durch die Massenentfaltung von Solenoporen und Nerineen eine Erhöhung der Nährstoffkonzentration infolge Regression ab. Sie ist wohl auch für das Absterben der Riffkorallen verantwortlich. Die regressive Phase erreichte mit dem Trockenfallen und der Paläoverkarstung derflorigemma-Bank ihren Höhepunkt. Die riffbildenden Korallen sind ausgewiesene Pionierformen. Die horizontal-foliosen, aufgrund des maschenartigen Aufbaus sehr leichten Kolonien der formkonservativen F. arachnoides sind hochtolerant gegenüber instabilem Substrat. Sie wachsen direkt auf Weichboden und nutzen die volle Lichtintensität oder besiedeln dank ihres geringen Lichtbedarfs auch überhängende Riffbereiche und Riffhohlräume. Th. dendroidea ist eine opportunistische Koralle des lichtdurchfluteten Flachwassers. Durch ihre filigranen Äste weisen die ramosen Kolonien ein besonders großes Oberfläche/Volumen-Verhältnis auf. Ihre kleinen thamnasterioiden Kelche mit „hochintegrierten Polypen“ waren vorzüglich befähigt, Licht „einzufangen“. Seitliches Verschmelzen der Äste während des Koloniewachstums rief ein wellenresistentes Riffgerüst hervor und begünstigte die in situ-Überlieferung der Riffe. Vegetative Vermehrung durch Fragmente trug erheblich zu ihrem Erfolg bei, indem sich die Riffe seitlich ausbreiteten oder neue Riffe initiiert wurden. Vergleichbare Vorkommen, in denen Th. dendroidea wichtiger Riffbildner ist, die Korallenfauna dominiert oder nahezu monospezifische Gestrüppe aufbaut, sind aus dem Pariser Becken und dem Kleinen Deister (Niedersächsisches Becken) bekannt. Sie entstanden im intensiv lichtdurchfluteten Flachwasser von nur wenigen Metern Wassertiefe und repräsentieren Korallen-Riffe oder Korallen-Thrombolith-Riffe. Assoziierte Sedimente variieren zwischen gut ausgewaschenem Riffschuttkalkstein und niederenergetischem Kalklutit. Solenoporen, Nerineen und Diceraten zählen zu den charakteristischen Fossilien dieser Vorkommen, letztere fehlen in der florigemma-Bank. Th. dendroidea unterscheidet sich durch die Besiedlung nieder- bis hochenergetischer Habitate von formverwandten rezenten Steinkorallen (z. B. Acropora- und Porites- Arten). Letztere sind an wellenexponierte Standorte adaptiert, wo sie Korallenhecken aufbauen. Im hochenergetischen Milieu wurde die Bruchempfindlichkeit durch die Ausbildung robuster, derbästiger Th. dendroidea-Kolonien reduziert, während an niederenergetischen Standorten filigrane, diinnästige Kolonien vorherrschten. Infolge raschen vertikalen Wachstums hielten die Kolonien einiger Vorkommen auch mit hohen Sedimentationsraten schritt. In Dünnschliffen ließen sich 68 Foraminiferenarten/-taxa nachweisen. Agglutinierende, darunter zahlreiche Formen mit großem, komplex gebauten Gehäuse, dominieren gegenüber Hyalinschalern und Milioliden. Zahlreiche Arten sind durch eine ausgeprägte Milieuabhängigkeit gekennzeichnet oder kommen in hohen Individuendichten vor. Es sind 25 riffbewohnende Arten belegt, von denen einige bisher nur aus oberjurassischen Schwammriffen bekannt waren; bemerkenswert ist die Vielzahl von an Hartsubstrat festgehefteten Arten. Fauna und Flora, insbesondere Dasycladaceen und sandschalige Foraminiferen, zeigen enge paläobiogeographische Beziehungen zur Tethys auf, woraus sich (sub) tropische Bedingungen folgern lassen. Für die Zeit des Oxfordium ist diese Foraminiferenfauna innerhalb von Deutschland einmalig. In Süddeutschland stellen sich vergleichbare tethyale Faunen erst im Mittleren Tithonium ein...|$|E
