5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the <b>aorta,</b> {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single <b>aorta,</b> but most also have a second, usually smaller, <b>aorta</b> serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral <b>aorta.</b> The ventral <b>aorta</b> delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal <b>aorta,</b> into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral <b>aorta</b> has divided in two; one half forms the ascending <b>aorta,</b> while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E
5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the <b>aorta</b> through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The <b>aorta</b> is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} {{the effects of}} a non-antioxidant ﬂavonoid ﬂavone on {{vascular}} reactivity in Wistar–Kyoto (WKY) rat isolated <b>aortae.</b> Whether ﬂavone directly modulates vascular reactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic-WKY rat isolated <b>aortae</b> was also determined. Thoracic aortic rings were mounted in organ chambers and exposed to various drug treatments in the presence of ﬂavone (10 �M) or its vehicle (DMSO), which served as control. Pretreatment with ﬂavone enhanced relaxant effects to endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) and attenuated contractile effects to � 1 -receptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) in WKY <b>aortae</b> compared to those observed in control aortic rings. Flavone had no effect on relaxations to ACh in WKY <b>aortae</b> incubated with either l-NAME or methylene blue, but enhanced relaxations to ACh in WKY <b>aortae</b> incubated with indomethacin or partially depolarized with KCl. Relaxations to ACh are totally abolished in both control or ﬂavone pretreated endothelium-denuded WKY <b>aortae.</b> Flavone attenuated the inhibition by �-NADH of AChinduced relaxation in WKY <b>aortae,</b> but it had no signiﬁcant effect on the transient contractions induced by �-NADH nor the pyrogallol-induced abolishment of ACh-induced relaxation in WKY <b>aortae.</b> Flavone enhanced endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in both endothelium-intact and -denuded WKY <b>aortae.</b> Flavone enhanced relaxation to ACh and SNP as well as attenuated contractile effects to PE in SHR and diabetic <b>aortae,</b> a ﬁnding similar to that observed in normal WKY <b>aortae.</b> From these results, we conclude that ﬂavone modulates vascular reactivity in normal as well as hypertensive and diabetic <b>aortae.</b> These effects of ﬂavone results probably through enhanced bioactivity of nitric oxide released from the endothelium...|$|R

40|$|Extracellular {{inorganic}} pyrophosphate (ePPi) is {{an important}} endogenous inhibitor of vascular calcification, {{but it is not}} known whether systemic or local vascular PPi metabolism controls calcification. To determine the role of ePPi in vascular smooth muscle, we identified the pathways responsible for ePPi production and hydrolysis in rat and mouse <b>aortas</b> and manipulated them to demonstrate their role in the calcification of isolated <b>aortas</b> in culture. Rat and mouse <b>aortas</b> contained mRNA for ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (NPP 1 – 3), the putative PPi transporter ANK, and tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). Synthesis of PPi from ATP in <b>aortas</b> was blocked by β,γ-methylene-ATP, an inhibitor of NPPs. <b>Aortas</b> from mice lacking NPP 1 (Enpp 1 −/−) did not synthesize PPi from ATP and exhibited increased calcification in culture. Although ANK-mediated transport of PPi could not be demonstrated in <b>aortas,</b> <b>aortas</b> from mutant (ank/ank) mice calcified more in culture than did <b>aortas</b> from normal (ANK/ANK) mice. Hydrolysis of PPi was reduced 25 % by β,γ-methylene-ATP and 50 % by inhibition of TNAP. Hydrolysis of PPi was increased in cells overexpressing TNAP or NPP 3 but not NPP 1 and was not reduced in Enpp 1 −/− <b>aortas.</b> Overexpression of TNAP increased calcification of cultured <b>aortas.</b> The results show that smooth muscle NPP 1 and TNAP control vascular calcification through effects on synthesis and hydrolysis of ePPi, indicating an important inhibitory role of locally produced PPi. Smooth muscle ANK also affects calcification, but this may not be mediated through transport of PPi. NPP 3 is identified as an additional pyrophosphatase that could influence vascular calcification...|$|R
5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral <b>aorta,</b> which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal <b>aorta</b> supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal <b>aorta.</b>|$|E

40|$|Male Sprague-Dawley rats were {{infused with}} 50 microg/kg/day of ouabain for 4 weeks {{to address the}} {{question}} whether prolonged exposure to the drug affects blood pressure, the in vitro contractile responses to agonists and high K+ of their <b>aortae,</b> and the influence of endothelium on these responses. Systolic blood pressure was not affected by ouabain treatment. The responsiveness of endothelium-intact <b>aortae</b> from ouabain-treated rats to endothelin- 1 increased, that to phenylephrine decreased, and that to high K+ was unchanged, as compared with control. The responses of endothelium-free <b>aortae</b> to endothelin- 1, phenylephrine, and high K+ were lower in ouabain-treated than in control rats. The removal of endothelium increased the response to phenylephrine and decreased that to high K+ in either control or ouabain-treated rat <b>aortae,</b> whereas it did not affect the response to endothelin- 1 in control rat <b>aortae</b> and decreased it in ouabain-treated rat <b>aortae.</b> The response to caffeine was unaffected by either ouabain treatment or endothelium removal. Thus rat ouabain long-term treatment induces opposing effects on the responsiveness of their intact <b>aortae</b> to an alpha-adrenergic agonist and endothelin- 1. If these effects observed in the ex vivo experiments occur also in vivo on rat microvasculature, they could balance out and contribute to the lack of effect on systolic blood pressure of prolonged ouabain treatment...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the responses of}} thoracic <b>aortae</b> to adrenergic contraction and endothelium-dependent relaxation following chronic exposure to cold in rats. Two groups (CA, cold-acclimated for 12 weeks at 5 °C; WA, warm-acclimated for 12 weeks at 24 °C) of 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. After anesthesia, the thoracic <b>aortae</b> (4 mm long) were isolated and the vascular tension was measured with a force transducer. The dose-response relations for aortic responses to norepinephrine (NE), phenylephrine (PE) and acetylcholine (Ach) were determined and compared between the CA and the WA groups. In the CA rats, the thoracic <b>aortae</b> became more sensitive to Ach-induced vasorelaxation. The vascular sensitivities to NE- or PE-induced contraction in the thoracic <b>aortae</b> were lowered. Chronic exposure to cold decreased NE- and PE-induced vasoconstrictive responses and increased Achinduced vasorelaxative response of the isolated thoracic <b>aortae,</b> which were suggested {{to be due to}} enhanced release of NE-induced endothelium-derived relaxing factor by up-regulating endothelial α 1 -adrenoceptors...|$|R

This study sought to identify gender differences in cytokine and chemokine expression in an experimental rodent AAA model. Male and female rodent <b>aortas</b> were perfused with either saline (control) or elastase to induce AAA formation. Aortic diameter was determined and aortic tissue was harvested on postperfusion days 4 and 7. Cytokine and chemokine gene expression was examined using focused gene arrays. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify aortic leukocyte infiltration. Data were analyzed by Student's t -tests and ANOVA. Elastase-perfused female rodents developed significantly smaller aneurysms compared to males by day 7 (93 10 vs. 201 25, P 0. 003). Elastase-perfused female <b>aortas</b> exhibited a fivefold decrease in expression of the BMP family and ligands of the TNF superfamily compared to males. In addition, the expression of members of the TGF and VEGF families were three to fourfold lower in female elastase-perfused <b>aortas</b> compared to males. Multiple members of the interleukin, CC chemokine receptor, and CC ligand families were detectable in only the male elastase-perfused <b>aortas.</b> Female elastase-perfused <b>aortas</b> demonstrated a corollary twofold lower neutrophil count (females: 17. 5 1. 1 PMN HPF; males: 41 5. 2 neutrophils HPF, P 0. 01) and a 1. 5 -fold lower macrophage count (females: 12 1. 1 macrophages HPF; males: 17. 5 1. 1 macrophages HPF, P 0. 003) compared to male elastase-perfused <b>aortas.</b> This study documents decreased expression of multiple cytokines and chemokines and diminished leukocyte trafficking in female rat <b>aortas</b> compared to male <b>aortas</b> following elastase perfusion.

40|$|Background/Aims: beta(2) -adrenoceptor (beta(2) -AR) {{activation}} induces {{smooth muscle}} relaxation and endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) release. However, whether endogenous basal beta(2) -AR activity controls vascular redox status and NO bioavailability is unclear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate vascular reactivity in mice lacking functional beta(2) -AR (beta 2 KO), {{focusing on the}} role of NO and superoxide anion. Methods and Results: Isolated thoracic <b>aortas</b> from beta 2 KO and wild-type mice (WT) were studied. beta 2 KO <b>aortas</b> exhibited an enhanced contractile response to phenylephrine compared to WT. Endothelial removal and L-NAME incubation increased phenylephrine-induced contraction, abolishing the differences between beta 2 KO and WT mice. Basal NO availability was reduced in <b>aortas</b> from beta 2 KO mice. Incubation of beta 2 KO <b>aortas</b> with superoxide dismutase or NADPH inhibitor apocynin restored the enhanced contractile response to phenylephrine to WT levels. beta 2 KO <b>aortas</b> exhibited oxidative stress detected by enhanced dihydroethidium fluorescence, which was normalized by apocynin. Protein expression of eNOS was reduced, while p 47 (phox) expression was enhanced in beta 2 KO <b>aortas.</b> Conclusions: The present results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} enhanced NADPH-derived superoxide anion production is associated with reduced NO bioavailability in <b>aortas</b> of beta 2 KO mice.

40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that the subendothelium of rabbit <b>aortae</b> de-endothelialized with a balloon catheter rapidly becomes covered with a monolayer of platelets; after 60 min few additional platelets accumulate and although most platelets are lost from the injured surface by 4 days, {{there is a substantial}} delay before re-endothelialization. We examined the dynamics of platelet accumulation on rat <b>aortae</b> de-endothelialized with a balloon catheter to determine if the response to this type of injury is similar to rabbit <b>aortae.</b> When 51 Cr-platelets were injected prior to aortic de-endothelialization, 25, 500 +/- 2, 750 platelets/mm 2 accumulated on rat subendothelium in the first 15 min. After 60 and 92 h, fewer platelets remained on the surface (13, 740 +/- 2, 400 and 5, 020 +/- 1, 330 platelets/mm 2, respectively). When 51 Cr-platelets were injected into rats 30 min after injury, platelet accumulation in a 30 -min period was 8, 610 +/- 1, 230 platelets/mm 2. By 4 days rat <b>aortae</b> did not accumulate newly injected platelets significantly in a 30 -min period, but in a 24 -h period 20, 600 +/- 3, 490 platelets/mm 2 accumulated. Morphologically, the non-endothelialized areas of rat <b>aortae</b> were almost completely covered with platelets 4 days after injury. Fourteen days after injury, rat <b>aortae</b> did not accumulate newly injected platelets and, morphologically, no platelets were present on the surface which was almost re-endothelialized. Thus, in rats, as with rabbits, platelets rapidly accumulate on de-endothelialized <b>aortae</b> and the ability to attract newly introduced platelets is considerably reduced shortly after injury. In contrast to rabbits, however, de-endothelialized <b>aortae</b> in rats remain attractive to new platelets up to 4 days following injury, but less so than at the time of injury.

Methods and Results—We examined endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation/vasorelaxation of coronary arterioles and <b>aortas</b> in control mice, diabetic mice (Leprdb), and Leprdb treated with adiponectin or neutralizing antibody to TNF- (anti–TNF-). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine in both coronary arterioles and <b>aortas</b> was blunted in Leprdb compared with control mice. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to sodium nitroprusside was comparable. Adiponectin and anti–TNF- improved acetylcholine-induced vasodilation of coronary arterioles and <b>aortas</b> in Leprdb without affecting dilator response to sodium nitroprusside. Adiponectin protein expression was significantly reduced, and TNF- protein expression was significantly greater, in coronary arterioles and <b>aortas</b> of Leprdb compared with control mice. Immunofluorescence staining results indicate that adiponectin was colocalized with endothelial cells. Anti–TNF- treatment upregulated adiponectin protein expression in Leprdb coronary arterioles and <b>aortas.</b> Adiponectin administration reduced TNF- protein expression in Leprdb.

MethodsAortic specimens were obtained from patients undergoing prophylactic surgical repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 9) and type A dissection (n = 7), along with control patients dying of causes unrelated to aortic disease (n = 5). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages, and markers of apoptosis were assessed in the <b>aortas</b> of patients with ascending aortic aneurysm and dissection.

In addition, <b>aortas</b> of patients with aneurysms or dissections had more CD 68 + cells (P =. 01 and P =. 005, respectively).

40|$|The {{responses}} to noradrenaline (NA) of the <b>aortae</b> of various hypertensive rats, namely the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), the low blood pressure SHR (LBP-SHR), {{and the left}} renal artery stenosed LBP-SHR (LRAS-LBR-SHR), were compared {{to those of the}} normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The <b>aortae</b> of the hypertensive rats were significantly more responsive (P less than 0. 05) to 10 (- 8) M NA. However, the reverse was true for higher doses of NA. The ED 50 values for the <b>aortae</b> of WKY, LBP-SHR, SHR and LRAS-LBP-SHR were 20, 8. 5, 7. 8 and 8 nM respectively. The NA-contracted <b>aortae</b> of the LRAS-LBP-SHR were significantly less responsive (P less than 0. 05) to the relaxant action of histamine and acetylcholine (ACh) compared to those of the WKY. This observation was not made in the <b>aortae</b> of the LBP-SHR. The maximal relaxation (% of the maximal contraction induced by 10 (- 8) M NA) observed in the <b>aortae</b> of WKY, LBP-SHR and LRAS-LBP-SHR were, respectively, 72 +/- 2, 66 +/- 6, 39 +/- 7 for ACh and 50 +/- 3, 36 +/- 4, 27 +/- 3 for histamine. In <b>aortae</b> where the endothelium had been removed by collagenase treatment, histamine induced a dose-related contraction. The rank order of this dose-related contraction was WKY greater than LBP-SHR greater than SHR greater than LRAS-LBP-SHR with the corresponding maximal tension (g) 0. 89 +/- 0. 04, 0. 59 +/- 0. 04, 0. 36 +/- 0. 04, 0. 19 +/- 0. 05.

40|$|Elastin fibers in the <b>aortas</b> of control, lathyritic, copper-supplemented, and copper-deficient chicks were {{examined}} histochemically and chemically for aldehyde content. Diminished staining for aldehydes was {{obtained in the}} fibers from the <b>aortas</b> of lathyritic and copper-deficient chicks. Chemical studies of elastin isolated from the <b>aortas</b> of control and lathyritic chicks showed an apparent loss of lysine residues in control elastin {{to be associated with}} an increase in aldehyde content providing evidence that lysine is converted to an aldehyde-containing intermediate during biosynthesis of desmosine and isodesmosine. Approximately 6 aldehyde groups were present for every 1000 amino acids in elastin isolated from the <b>aortas</b> of control animals, while the corresponding number in lathyritic elastin was 4. At least two types of aldehydes, saturated and α,β-unsaturated, appear to be associated with elastin, suggesting the presence of more than one intermediate between lysine and the desmosines...|$|R
