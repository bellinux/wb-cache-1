5|$|The {{original}} idea, {{known as}} The Un-Natural World was {{of an urban}} fox living in Brixton called Nelson, who was so used to {{living in the city}} that he had lost <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> being an animal. It also featured a cat, Marion, who was trying to encourage Nelson to be more animal-like.|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Jealous of Kim's {{attraction}} to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick {{the lock on}} his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that his period of isolation has left Edward without <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of Ryō as a cross-dressing idol has been praised by one reviewer who {{called him the}} cutest out of the three playable idols because of both his appearance and his personality. Miyokawa suggested that Ryō may have been created to lessen <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> awkwardness that male players would feel from playing as female idols, but upon playing his scenario, Miyokawa noted that the player is naturally {{able to get into}} the story, in part due to the comical events surrounding Ryō's story that deal with him cross-dressing.|$|E
5|$|The article follows Gibson's {{observations}} of the architecture, phenomenology and culture of Singapore, and the clean, bland and conformist impression the city-state conveys during his stay. Its title and central metaphor—Singapore as Disneyland with the death penalty—is {{a reference to the}} authoritarian artifice the author perceives the city-state to be. Singapore, Gibson details, is lacking <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> creativity or authenticity, absent of any indication of its history or underground culture. He finds the government to be pervasive, corporatist and technocratic, and the judicial system rigid and draconian. Singaporeans are characterized as consumerists of insipid taste. The article is accentuated by local news reports of criminal trials by which the author illustrates his observations, and bracketed by contrasting descriptions of the Southeast Asian airports he arrives and leaves by.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{analysis}} happens in some metric space; {{the most commonly}} used are the real line, the complex plane, Euclidean space, other vector spaces, and the integers.

25|$|The year 1910 saw the {{foundation}} of the National Hockey Association (NHA), precursor to the NHL, and Lalonde joined the Montreal Canadiens for their first season. Lalonde scored the first-ever goal for the Montreal Canadiens. Halfway through the season, the Habs traded him to the Renfrew Creamery Kings, for whom Lalonde led the league in scoring. He rejoined the Canadiens for the 1911 season—professional hockey was only then developing <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> teams retaining the rights to their players—during which he had several stick battles and provoked the ire of opposing fans.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} Greek text is legible {{on the whole}} (see {{transcription}} on the right), much of it remains incomprehensible due to grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, such as they were frequent in magical amulets, and some letter sequences cannot be made <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of.</b> Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked {{in order to raise}} his arms against someone or something, probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient epigraphic and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil is genuine and not a modern forgery.|$|E
25|$|In 17th Century Japan, the Doctor's {{attempt to}} save the life of samurai Katsura Sato, a friend of Izzy, left the man {{inadvertently}} immortal and thus robbed of both an honourable death and <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> empathy. The Master later came for Sato, when he was mentally vulnerable, and gave him a fake religion to focus his mind on; Earth's history was altered as Sato, renamed Lord Morningstar, and his Church of the Glorious Dead conquered the planet, creating a technological advanced, highly brutal planet of jihadists. The Doctor, Izzy and Kroton wandered into their invasion of the museum planet Paradost; while the Doctor faced the Master over the Glory, Izzy and Kroton spent weeks on the occupied world. The Doctor was defeated, only for the Master discover he was not able to access the Glory, as instead Kroton and Sato had been the ones prophesised to battle for it. Kroton won the Glory, the Master was purged from the TARDIS and history was reverted, and the Doctor and Izzy took a well-earned break.|$|E
25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and early 1920s, tribal revolt led by Kurdish {{chieftain}} Simko Shikak swept across Iranian Kurdistan. Although elements of Kurdish nationalism {{were present in}} the movement, historians agree they were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was a major issue in Simko's movement, and he had to rely heavily on conventional tribal motives. Government forces and non-Kurds were not the only ones to have allegedly been attacked, the Kurdish population was also robbed and assaulted. The fighters do not appear to have felt <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds. Kurdish insurgency and seasonal migrations in the late 1920s, along with long-running tensions between Tehran and Ankara, resulted in border clashes and even military penetrations in both Iranian and Turkish territory. Two regional powers have used Kurdish tribes as tool for own political benefits: Turkey has provided military help and refuge for anti-Iranian Turcophone Shikak rebels in 1918–1922, while Iran did the same during Ararat rebellion against Turkey in 1930. Reza Shah's military victory over Kurdish and Turkic tribal leaders initiaded with a brutally repressive era toward non-Iranian minorities. Government's forced detribalization and sedentarization in the 1920s and 1930s resulted with many other tribal revolts in Iranian regions of Azerbaijan, Luristan and Kurdistan. In particular case of the Kurds, this repressive policies partly contributed to developing nationalism among some tribes.|$|E
25|$|A 9,378-car run of two-door XJ coupés with a pillarless hardtop body {{called the}} XJ-C was built between 1975 and 1978. The car was {{actually}} launched at the London Motor Show in October 1973, but it subsequently {{became clear that}} it was not ready for production, and the economic troubles unfolding in the western world at this time seem to have reduced further <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgency about producing and selling the cars: it was reported that problems with window sealing delayed production. XJ coupés finally started to emerge from Jaguar show-rooms only some two years later. The coupé was based on the short-wheelbase version of the XJ. The coupé's elongated doors were made out of a lengthened standard XJ front door (the weld seams are clearly visible under the interior panels where two front door shells were grafted together with a single outer skin). A few XJ-Cs were modified by Lynx Cars and Avon into convertibles with a retractable canvas top, but this was not a factory product. Lynx conversions (16 in total) did benefit of powered tops. Both six and twelve-cylinder models were offered, 6,505 of the former and 1,873 of the latter. Even with the delay, these cars suffered from water leaks and wind noise. The delayed introduction, the labour-intensive work required by the modified saloon body, the higher price than the four-door car, and the early demise promulgated by the new XJ-S, all ensured a small production run.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the titles}} of Robert Frost’s {{collections}} of poetry, including North of Boston, appear to ground his work in a precise location and a known community, the poems themselves belie <b>any</b> secure <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> geography and <b>any</b> secure <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> attachment. Many of the poems were, in fact, composed in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire shortly before {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, and they reveal an acute awareness of British, as well as American, literary traditions and ideals. This essay looks at how Frost created the New England of his poems, subtly establishing lines of continuity with British and American Romanticism while simultaneously harbouring profound philosophical doubts about inherited models of poetic subjectivity and imagination. The place of poetry, for Frost, is seen to be a place in which the play of mind is, itself, the most pressing subject matter...|$|R
