5|$|When the {{national}} flag is raised or lowered and the anthem is played, persons in military or paramilitary uniforms who are outdoors don their head dress {{and face the}} flag. If they are in formation under the orders of a commander, only the commander salutes; otherwise, all service personnel salute. Saluting is unnecessary if service personnel are indoors when a flag raising or lowering ceremony takes place.

5|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{began in}} Britain's Australasian colonies {{at the close}} of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of New Zealand granting women the right to vote in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage (the right to vote <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> for parliamentary office) in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in 1861, Johnston was fifteen years old and {{attending}} Highland Military College in Newburg, New York. He remained in school through 1862, but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York. De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company. He was not able to assume command because of his age, and his family also felt he was too young for service. However, in the winter of 1863, he threatened to travel to Washington, D.C. <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> for examination for an officership with a colored regiment.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi {{due to the}} latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi {{refused to}} touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the {{marriage}} hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad—the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley—to wear a dhoti <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> before her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group of police officers in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E
5|$|Model {{first came}} to Hitler's {{attention}} before World War II, but their relationship did not become especially close until 1942. His tenacious style of fighting and dedication to the Nazi cause won him plaudits from Hitler, who considered him {{one of his best}} field commanders and repeatedly tasked him with retrieving desperate situations. However, their relationship had broken down {{by the end of the}} war after Model was defeated at the Battle of the Bulge. In April 1945, with the Third Reich's defeat imminent, Model committed suicide rather than be captured <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> trial for war crimes.|$|E

5|$|One {{night during}} {{preparations}} for the expedition, the hermai, heads of the god Hermes on a plinth with a phallus, were mutilated throughout Athens. This was a religious scandal and {{was seen as a}} bad omen for the mission. Plutarch explains that Androcles, a political leader, used false witnesses who accused Alcibiades and his friends of mutilating the statues, and of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries. Later his opponents, chief among them being Androcles and Thessalus, Cimon's son, enlisted orators to argue that Alcibiades should set sail as planned <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> trial on his return from the campaign. Alcibiades was suspicious of their intentions, and asked to be allowed to stand trial immediately, under penalty of death, in order to clear his name. This request was denied, and the fleet set sail soon after, with the charges unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have also}} seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the Free Will Movement. In this view, the {{character}} of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During {{the course of the}} novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> up for its antislavery principles.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandstone}} formations {{from which}} Silver Reef gets its name were formed when tectonic stresses forced long, longitudinally aligned sections of Navajo Sandstone to buckle <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> on their sides, {{giving them the}} appearance of ocean reefs. Over {{long periods of time}} silver ore, sediments, and vegetation were carried in water runoff from the Chinle Formation to the White, Buckeye, and East reefs. The ore settled as deposits and the vegetation became petrified. The Silver Reef Mining District's geologic resources consist mainly of silver deposits, with smaller deposits of copper, gold, lead, and uranium oxide. Iron oxide deposits in the soil rocks cause a red coloration, and dinosaur tracks from the early Jurassic period have been found in the area.|$|E

The video begins showing the Tokyo skyline and parkour artists standing on rooftops. As the spoken introduction starts, Madonna {{is shown in}} her wig dancing {{in front of a}} number of neon signs which contain the words Madonna and Jump in Japanese. The song continues with the dancers jumping from buildings and running through the lanes of the city. Madonna dances to the music and swivels around metallic rods in and around her, of the same design present in her tour. Before the final chorus, the dancers cease their parkour routines <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> on a lamppost.|$|E
5|$|With the {{groundbreaking}} of the SoMa Towers project in 2012, the city entered another era of building construction. The {{largest of the}} recent developments under construction are the W Bellevue Hotel (500 Lincoln Square) and 400 Lincoln Square; both of these buildings constitute the southward expansion of Lincoln Square <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> approximately 450 feet (137 m) tall. Buildings exceeding the current 450 foot (137 m) height limit have been proposed and the city is considering raising height limits to 600 feet (183 m) to permit taller skyscrapers in the Downtown core. As of 2015, there are 24 additional buildings under construction and planned for construction in Bellevue.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E

5|$|Emus {{begin to}} settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep {{continuously}} but rouse themselves {{several times during the}} night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.|$|E
5|$|The flag, when {{carried in}} a {{procession}} or parade or with another flag or flags, {{should be on the}} marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E
