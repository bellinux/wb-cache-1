5|$|In the 1970s, {{when the}} New York City Subway {{was at an}} <b>all-time</b> <b>low,</b> {{following}} the general trend of a decrease in ridership, the amount of passengers using the Union Turnpike station decreased by 2,700,000 passengers. As part of the MTA's 1975–1981 transit program, station lighting at Kew Gardens was improved. In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway {{was at an}} <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> Ridership {{had dropped}} to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the subway was very poorly maintained during that time, and delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} Hollywood stars {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1932, {{after nine}} pictures, Tracy {{remained}} virtually {{unknown to the}} public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a rise in his weekly rate to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, with Me and My Gal (1932) setting an <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932), a prison drama co-starring Bette Davis. Tracy was hopeful {{that it would be}} his break-out role, but despite good reviews this failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, {{relationships}} between the band members continued to decline. The band's live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times. Matt Pryor's wife had recently given birth to their first child, and being away from his family had made him irritable and standoffish. After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance hit an <b>all-time</b> <b>low,</b> with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs.|$|E

5|$|By 1918, {{civilian}} morale in occupied Belgium {{reached an}} <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> The early {{successes of the}} Ludendorff Offensive {{in the spring of}} 1918 were believed to have made liberation virtually impossible in the foreseeable future. However, during the Hundred Days Offensive, the Allied and Belgian armies launched a series of successful offensives on the Western Front. The Belgian army, restricted to the Yser salient since 1914, advanced as far as Bruges. German forces on the front in Belgium launched a wide retreat. On 11 November 1918, the German army signed an armistice. The ceasefire did not, however, lead to the immediate liberation of Belgium and sporadic fighting continued. The Belgian army gradually advanced into the country, behind the evacuating German occupying force.|$|E
5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the United States to the 15th, and coal production was at an <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E

5|$|The main {{shopping}} centre in Sale, the Square Shopping Centre, {{was constructed in}} the 1960s. Following the Trafford Centre's opening in 1998, {{it was expected that}} the centre would suffer, but it has since prospered. In 2003 the Square Shopping Centre underwent a £7million refurbishment, {{a major part of the}} redevelopment of Sale's town centre. It was sold for £40M in 2005, by which time the Square had experienced an increase in trade and demand for tenancy that had led to an increase of 70% in rental income. The town's economy expanded to the extent that in 2007, at a time when the rest of south Manchester was oversupplied with office space, Sale's available office and commercial space was at an <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> because of high demand.|$|E
5|$|The {{team has}} not {{qualified}} {{for a major}} competition since 1998. German coach Berti Vogts became the first foreign manager of the team in 2002, but his time in charge was generally seen as a failure and the FIFA World Ranking declined to an <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of 88 in March 2005. Walter Smith and Alex McLeish achieved better results, with the ranking improving to an all-time high of 13 in October 2007, but both were only briefly in charge before returning to club management. George Burley and Craig Levein both had worse results with the team and were eventually sacked. Results improved somewhat under Gordon Strachan, but {{he was unable to}} secure qualification for a tournament.|$|E
5|$|On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles {{took over}} the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the {{development}} of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an <b>all-time</b> <b>low.</b> A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{game of the}} new {{stands on}} 3 May 1962 was a Rosenborg {{friendly}} against Dunfermline Athletic. Freidig moved to Eberg idrettsanlegg when it was completed ahead of the 1965 season. A new stadium spectator record was set in the cup semifinal against Brann in 1967, which was watched by 25,551 people. Rosenborg qualified for the 1968–69 European Cup and met SK Rapid Wien in the first round. The game was spectated by 22,492 and remains the record for UEFA tournaments. Per-season average attendance for Rosenborg's league matches lay between five and ten thousand people during the 1970s and early 1980s, with an <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of 2,549 in 1978, when Rosenborg played in the Second Division. The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships four times, in 1963, 1967, 1973 and 1983. Lerkendal hosted the Women's Cup Final in 1986, where Sprint-Jeløy beat Trondheims-Ørn. Strindheim IL played in the top division in 1984 and 1995, both times playing their home games at Lerkendal. Kvik remained at Lerkendal until the upgrades started in 2000, after which they moved to Øya stadion. Bodø/Glimt played their home game in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup against Werder Bremen at Lerkendal, attracting 1,425 spectators.|$|E
5|$|With every {{subsequent}} improvement made to {{the ground}} since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the Taylor Report recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to all-seaters. This meant that £3–5million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a cantilever roof to link {{with the rest of}} the ground had to be drastically altered. This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the front of the other three stands, not only increased the cost to around £10million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to an <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of around 44,000. In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive £1.4million of a possible £2million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, {{the club}} won their third Portuguese Cup and {{qualified}} for the 1968–69 Cup Winners' Cup. As in previous years, {{they were unable to}} get past the second round, losing 4–1 on aggregate to Slovan Bratislava. Porto's last participation in the Fairs Cup, in 1969–70, also ended in the second round, with a defeat against holders Newcastle United. Domestically, Porto finished the league in an <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> ninth place, thus failing to qualify for European competition in the 1970–71 season. They returned the following season to participate in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Cup, which officially replaced the Fairs Cup, but their debut against Nantes led to another premature exit. Porto returned to this tournament in four of the following five seasons, the exception being 1973–74, when it failed qualification for European competitions. In the first of those seasons (1972–73), Porto reached the third round of a European competition for the first time, but were eliminated by Dynamo Dresden. They beat Barcelona in the first round, in what was the teams' first European encounter and the only time Porto eliminated the Spanish side from European competitions. In the 1975–76 UEFA Cup, Porto were again eliminated in the third round, but in the process they beat Luxembourg's Avenir Beggen with a club record home (7–0) and aggregate (10–0) win scores. In {{the first round of the}} following season's UEFA Cup, Porto were matched with Schalke 04. After a tie in the first leg, Porto squandered a 2–0 lead in the second leg, conceding three goals in the last 15 minutes, which resulted in their elimination.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, wolves {{were never}} fully exterminated, {{because of the}} area's {{contiguity}} with Asia and its large forested areas. However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century. Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century and, by the mid-twentieth century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland. Wolves in the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region's contiguity with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains, mountains and farmlands. Wolves in Hungary occurred in only half the country around the start of the 20th century, and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin. Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,600 from 1955–1965. An <b>all-time</b> <b>low</b> was reached in 1967, when the population was reduced to 1,550 animals. The extermination of wolves in Bulgaria was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1,000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100–200 in 1964. In Greece, the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 1930. Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from Albania to the former Yugoslavia. Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 1923, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in Kocevje, Slovenia. The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stadion {{served as}} the home ground of {{association}} football club Malmö FF between 1958 and 2008. The team moved to the stadium on its opening in 1958, leaving its original home ground at Malmö IP to do so. The first Malmö FF match at the new ground was played on 8 August 1958; in an Allsvenskan fixture, Malmö FF took on their cross-town rivals, IFK Malmö, who had also moved to the stadium from Malmö IP. Played in front of 17,368 fans, the game ended with a 4–4 draw. IFK were relegated from Allsvenskan in 1962, and have not returned to the first tier since, but the club continues to play at Malmö Stadion nonetheless. Malmö FF experienced an average attendance of around 13,000 for the first ten years at the stadium; average crowds then dropped to below 10,000 {{by the end of}} the 1970s. By the 1990s, attendances were at an <b>all-time</b> <b>low,</b> with less than 5,000 people on average coming to Malmö FF matches. The club therefore let Malmö Stadion for the newly renovated Malmö IP in 1999, IFK Malmö followed in August the same year. By this time IFK Malmö were playing in Division 2, then the third tier in the Swedish league system. During their seasons in Allsvenskan, IFK Malmö had attracted an average attendance of around 10,000 spectators between 1957–58 and 1962. IFK Malmö's attendance at Malmö Stadion reached its peak during the 1960 season when the club finished as runners-up in Allsvenskan and attracted 12,787 spectators on average to the stadium. The attendance had decreased to around 1,000 spectators per match in 1999 when the club had dropped in the league.|$|E

50|$|Some {{researchers}} dissent {{from the}} official Major League Baseball record and claim that the pitcher with the <b>all-time</b> <b>lowest</b> earned run average is Tim Keefe, who had an earned run average of 0.86 in 1880 while appearing in 12 of his team's 83 games and pitching 105 innings (with a win-loss record of 6-6). But a purported record based on so few innings pitched is highly misleading. Over the years, {{more than a dozen}} part-time pitchers have pitched 105 or more innings and had an earned run average lower than 0.86. Major League Baseball recognizes many records from the 19th century — including Will White's 1879 record of 680 innings pitched, Charles Radbourne's 1884 record of 59 wins, and Pud Galvin's 1883 record for 75 games started, but does not recognize Keefe as the pitcher having the <b>all-time</b> <b>lowest</b> single season earned run average.|$|R
