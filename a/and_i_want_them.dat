6000|$|... "Mamma, {{you will}} keep {{stitching}}, stitching away. Put down the sewing; I am an enemy to it. It cumbers your lap, and I want {{it for my}} head; it engages your eyes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> for a book. Here is your favourite--Cowper." ...|$|E
500|$|Courtney Love: [...] "The {{dress is}} still very current. People still design off that silly dress. The truth is I used to wear those dresses more than slips, but those dresses never got as famous as slips <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to have their due." ...|$|R

60|$|That {{is a long}} story, which I {{must tell}} you {{something}} about some other time. Now I want you to look at something else: and that is, the rocks themselves, in which the rings are. They are very curious in my eyes, and very valuable; for they taught me a lesson in geology when I was quite a boy: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to teach it to you now.|$|E
6000|$|The king, who {{was feeling}} much {{ashamed of the}} rage {{he had been in}} with his dear wife, consented at once, and she said: 'No doubt others would make them ride or shoot, or {{something}} of that sort, but every one learns these things.

6000|$|Fanny {{was just}} {{then in the}} mood to feel the beauty of this, for the sincerest emotion she had ever known was {{beginning}} to make her dissatisfied with herself, and the aimless life she led. [...] "Men must respect such girls as these," [...] she thought; [...] "yes, and love them too, for in spite of their independence, they are womanly. I wish I had a talent to live for, if it would do as much for me as it does for them. It is this sort of thing that is improving Polly, that makes her society interesting to Sydney, and herself so dear to every one. Money can't buy these things for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had some}} trouble {{just before you}} came on board. Mr. Van Blott wanted some things done one way <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> another.

6000|$|... "You don't understand, Billy," [...] said White, with {{an uneasy}} laugh. [...] "Some of us fellows {{who try to}} paint have big notions about Art. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to paint a picture some day that people would stand before and forget that {{it was made of}} paint. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to creep into them like a bar of music and {{mushroom}} there like a soft bullet. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>'em</b> to go away and ask, 'What else has he done?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>'em</b> to find a thing; not a portrait nor a magazine cover nor an illustration nor a drawing of a girl--nothing but the picture. That's why I've lived on fried sausages, and tried to keep true to myself. I persuaded myself to do this portrait for the chance it might give me to study abroad. But this howling, screaming caricature! Good Lord! can't you see how it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got a {{new plan}} now, but {{it seems as if}} father took a {{pleasure}} in discouraging all my plans. I know that Bartley's shut up, somewhere, in some asylum, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to send detectives to all the asylums in the United States and in Canada,--you can't tell how far off he would wander in that state,--and inquire if any stray insane person has been brought to them. Doesn't it seem to you as if that would be the right way to find him? I want to talk it all over with you, Mr. Halleck, for I know you can sympathize with me; and if need be I will go to the asylums myself; I will walk to them, I will crawl to them on my knees! When I think of him shut up there among those raving maniacs, and used as they use people in some of the asylums--Oh, oh, oh, oh!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Swift {{performed}} many acoustic cover versions {{during her}} North American tour. In each city, she {{paid tribute to}} a homegrown artist.

[...] He also mentioned Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde (1966) as a particular influence. Ranaldo stated that [...] "these songs were allowed to breathe because they weren't sent through the fan machine. When Sonic Youth writes music, we write everything in a very communal way. It doesn't matter who brought something in initially, it all gets transformed by the band. In this case, I was making decisions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> {{to have a certain}} kind of simplicity. They ended up more personal for that reason." ...|$|R

5000|$|Kristen May stated {{about making}} the record: [...] "When we started writing this record, we had a common hardship. Their singer had quit, and my {{previous}} band had broken up. As writers, we weren't really sure how to move forward. At the same time, we all had this shared feeling of hope and a second chance. Music came out of those experiences from coming together and persevering through whatever doubts and trials we faced in our lives. It felt like home once we began making music." [...] She also stated: [...] "I hope it's an album people can listen to for years to come. We put our hearts and souls into it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to hear that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Duff has {{described}} {{the change in the}} album's musical direction in an interview with MTV in 2015, citing [...] "The album is a range of stuff. I would say definitely in the beginning when I started writing, it was pretty heavy, coming out of my past year of - life. It's changed since then, which is good because I think that the overall theme too - me, personally, I'm not this super heavy girl. You know? I'm one for the sunshine, so it's shifted a lot and it feels a lot better to me." [...] From the interview, it was also mentioned that a track titled [...] "This Heart' which was about her son, {{was going to be on}} the album and was also speculated as the title. The track however never made the final cut. Duff has said regarding the album's lyrical content, [...] "I definitely want people to feel like they're getting a glimpse into my life and what I'm made of. I am a normal girl who has had a not-so-normal life. I feel like my fans have stuck with me because they can relate to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to. I want them to feel like we could go out and have a fun night together. I want them to know that my heart has been broken, but it's not the end of the world. Life goes on. I want them to feel like I'm there for them. I want them to feel happy. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to know that I care and that I have cared about them all this time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Robert Zemeckis {{has stated}} {{previously}} that A Christmas Carol {{is one of}} his favorite stories dealing with time travel. Carrey has described the film as [...] "a classical version of A Christmas Carol ... There are a lot of vocal things, a lot of physical things, I have to do. Not to mention doing the accents properly, the English, Irish accents ... I want it to fly in the UK. I want it to be good <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to go, 'Yeah, that's for real.' We were very true to the book. It's beautiful. It's an incredible film." [...] Also, the Scrooge puppet seen in The Polar Express, which was also directed by Robert Zemeckis served as the basis for Ebenezer Scrooge in this movie.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} 300 writer Frank Miller said, [...] "The inaccuracies, {{almost all of}} them, are intentional. I took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for a reason. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> these guys to move <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>'em</b> to look good. I knocked their helmets off a fair amount, partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans, in full regalia, were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle. Another liberty I took was, they all had plumes, but I only gave a plume to Leonidas, to make him stand out and identify him as a king. I was looking for more an evocation than a history lesson. The best result I {{can hope for is}} that if the movie excites someone, they'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating." ...|$|R
6000|$|Grace laughed. [...] "Two {{or three}} basketsful would be enough, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>them</b> for myself. <b>I</b> {{went to see}} Mrs. Waite and found her old father {{crippled}} by rheumatism.
