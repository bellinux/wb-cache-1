The solid chords played by the soloist {{at the opening of}} the concerto may in fact have been Siloti's idea, as they appear in the first (1875) edition as rolled chords, somewhat extended by the addition of one or sometimes two notes which made them more inconvenient to play but without significantly altering the sound of the passage. Various other slight simplifications were also incorporated into the published 1879 version. Further small revisions were undertaken for a new edition published in 1890.|$|R

Methodological considerations when attempting dream interpretation are reviewed, and some images that are claimed to relate to mental and physical health and well-being are listed. The use of dream analysis in psychological diagnosis and intervention is discussed, both with regard to professional therapists and to individuals at home.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the levels of PA and its {{relationship}} with other risk factors among the working population of the Ryazan Region. Material and methods. The MERIDIAN­RO study was conducted as a prospective cohort with cross­sectional and retrospective study in­ cluded a sample of biochemical, ECG and a survey using a standardized questionnaire. The level of physical activity was assessed by ques­ tionnaire CINDI and then was revised by questionnaire IPAQ. In a study from 2011 it included 1, 622 people (in 1220 – a city, 402 – village) aged 25 – 64 years (mean age – 43, 4 ± 11, 4 years), of which 42. 6 % were male, 53. 8 % – female. Results. The level of low PA in the Ryazan Region, measured by questionnaire IPAQ was 22. 9 % (24. 3 % in urban and 18. 4 % in rural areas, p = 0. 014). With multinomial logistic regression were established association between the PA and the low presence of higher education (OR 3. 63; 95 % CI 2, 26 – 5, 85, p = 0. 0001, Wald 28. 172), smoking (OR 1. 32, 95 % CI 1, 01 – 1, 72, p = 0. 045, Wald 4, 031) and elevated levels of Lp (a) more than 30 mg/dl (OR 1. 38, 95 % CI 1, 04 – 1, 83, p = 0. 024, Wald 5. 119). It was also revealed a high demand for <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>improving</b> the PA (74. 5 %). Conclusion.

However, he had already distanced himself from his compatriots by his reputation for egotism and outspokenness, and jealousy of his enormous salary as Director-General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. His military counterpart, General MacMunn, wrote that he: [...] "irritated everyone who came across him or worked for him". Buchanan later wrote a critical book about the military campaign and his own part in turning it around, The Tragedy of Mesopotamia (1938).|$|R
