5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (<b>acetoacetate)</b> and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine <b>acetoacetate</b> testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketone bodies}} are {{possibly}} anticonvulsant in themselves; in animal models, <b>acetoacetate</b> and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism {{that increase the}} energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, {{and the number of}} mitochondria is increased. This may help the neurons to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a neuroprotective effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, <b>acetoacetate</b> and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E

The enantiomeric purity was found to be 80 % (3 a, 3 b, 4 b) and 65 % (4 a), respectively.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigated}} the versatility {{and the potential}} applications {{of different kinds of}} alkylidene malonates, <b>acetoacetates,</b> malonamides and acetoacetoamides. Our research group devoted great attention to this kind of compounds since alkylidenes can be considered important intermediates in the synthesis of several scaffolds, to be inserted into molecules of potential biological and pharmaceutical interest. The increasing use of alkylidenes is due to their ability to react as unsaturated electrophiles and to the possibility to exploit them as intermediates for the introduction of different kind of functionalities. The preparation of alkylidene malonates, <b>acetoacetates,</b> malonamides and acetoacetoamides is presented in chapter 1. This section deals with different preparation methods of alkylidenes that we developed during the last few years and to the technologies involved for each synthetic protocol. The reactivity that allowed to use the alkylidenes as intermediates in the synthesis of scaffolds for biologically active compounds is shown in chapter 2. In particular, we will discuss the most important reactions used to obtain the desired molecules, and we will focus on the most interesting aspects of these latter ones. Finally, chapter 3 will illustrate the potential applications and the related syntheses of potential bioactive compounds. The synthesized molecules find application in several fields and for this reason we considered each class of compounds in its related branch of interest. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{first full}} {{description}} of diabetic ketoacidosis {{is attributed to}} Julius Dreschfeld, a German pathologist working in Manchester, United Kingdom. In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in London, he drew on reports by Adolph Kussmaul as well as describing the main ketones, <b>acetoacetate</b> and β-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination. The condition remained almost universally fatal until the discovery of insulin in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29 percent, and by the 1950s it had become less than 10 percent. The entity of cerebral edema due to DKA was described in 1936 {{by a team of}} doctors from Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of <b>acetoacetate</b> (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E
5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, <b>acetoacetate</b> and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty acids octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E

25|$|However acetyl-CoA can be {{converted}} to <b>acetoacetate,</b> which can decarboxylate to acetone (either spontaneously, or by <b>acetoacetate</b> decarboxylase). It can then be further metabolized to isopropanol which is excreted in breath/urine, or by CYP2E1 into hydroxyacetone (acetol). Acetol can {{be converted}} to propylene glycol. This converts to formate and acetate (the latter converting to glucose), or pyruvate (by two alternative enzymes), or propionaldehyde, or to L-lactaldehyde then L-lactate (the common lactate isomer). Another pathway turns acetol to methylglyoxal, then to pyruvate, or to D-lactaldehyde (via S-D-lactoyl-glutathione or otherwise) then D-lactate. D-lactate metabolism (to glucose) is slow or impaired in humans, so most of the D-lactate is excreted in the urine; thus D-lactate derived from acetone can contribute significantly to the metabolic acidosis associated with ketosis or isopropanol intoxication. L-Lactate can complete the net conversion of fatty acids into glucose. The first experiment to show conversion of acetone to glucose was carried out in 1951. This, and further experiments used carbon isotopic labelling. Up to 11% of the glucose can be derived from acetone during starvation in humans.|$|E

5000|$|Levi and Zanetti {{extended}} the Knorr synthesis in 1894 {{to the use}} of acetylacetone (2,4-pentanedione) in reaction with ethyl 2-oximinoacetoacetate. The result was ethyl 4-acetyl-3,5-dimethylpyrrole-2-carboxylate, where [...] "OEt" [...] = R1 = R3 = Me, and R2 = COOEt. The 4-acetyl group could easily be converted to a 4-ethyl group by Wolff-Kishner reduction (hydrazine and alkali, heated); hydrogenolysis, or the use of diborane. Benzyl or tert-butyl <b>acetoacetates</b> also work well in this system, and with close temperature control, the tert-butyl system gives a very high yield (close to 80%). N,N-dialkyl pyrrole-2- and/or 4-carboxamides may be prepared by the use of N,N-dialkyl acetoacetamides in the synthesis. Even thioesters have been successfully prepared, using the method. As for the nitrosation of &beta;-ketoesters, despite the numerous literature specifications of tight temperature control on the nitrosation, the reaction behaves almost like a titration, and the mixture can be allowed to reach even 40 °C without significantly impacting the final yield.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} towards new cyclic isosteres {{of functional}} {{groups and the}} optimization of their synthesis {{have been one of}} the basis of this work. In particular, the attention was paid to three different heterocycles: isoxazolines, isoxazolidinones and 3, 4 -dehydro-beta-prolines. The synthetic protocols developed for them are based on the electrophylic properties of alkylidene <b>acetoacetates,</b> malonates, acetoacetamide esters and malonamides. Their preparation is found on Knöevenagel condensation and a microwaves-assisted protocol. For this last topic, two applications are microwave-assisted protocols for the Yonemitsu-type trimolecular condensation and for the one-pot two-steps synthesis of alkylidene acetoacetamide esters for the preparation of dehydropeptides. The reactivity towards indoles, amines and diprotected hydroxylamines is reported. 1, 4 -Michael addition of C- and N-nucleophyles to alpha,beta-unsaturated electrophyles is the ground for the synthesis of isoxazolines and isoxazolidinones, differently substituted. Then, the Luche-reduction of these unsaturated intermediates was investigated and the consequent enzymatic resolution for the enantioselective preparation of 3, 4 -dehydro-beta-prolines. Applications of the synthesized heterocycles in molecules with biological target are the synthesis of Linezolid analogues and peptidomimetic integrin ligands. Finally, the synthesis of red-shifted self-assembled nanoparticles as tools for bioimaging is reported...|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} {{synthesis}} of pyridine derivatives {{was described in}} 1881 by Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch. The Hantzsch pyridine synthesis typically uses a 2:1:1 mixture of a β-keto acid (often <b>acetoacetate),</b> an aldehyde (often formaldehyde), and ammonia or its salt as the nitrogen donor. First, a double hydrogenated pyridine is obtained, which is then oxidized to the corresponding pyridine derivative. Emil Knoevenagel showed that asymmetrically-substituted pyridine derivatives can be produced with this process.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonspecificity}} of Jaffe's reaction causes falsely elevated creatinine {{results in}} the presence of protein, glucose, <b>acetoacetate,</b> ascorbic acid, guanidine, acetone, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (mainly streptomycin), ketone bodies, α-keto acids, and other organic compounds. Ammonium is also an interferent; if the sample is plasma, care needs to be taken that ammonium heparin has not been used as an anticoagulant. Nonspecificity is markedly decreased in urine samples since urine creatinine levels are much higher than blood and it generally does not contain significant levels of interfering chromogens.|$|E
500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (<b>acetoacetate</b> and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the liver}} {{oxaloacetate}} can be wholly or partially diverted into the gluconeogenic pathway during fasting, starvation, a low carbohydrate diet, prolonged strenuous exercise, and in uncontrolled {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus. Under these circumstances oxaloacetate is hydrogenated to malate which is then removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into glucose in the cytoplasm of the liver cells, from where it is released into the blood. In the liver, therefore, oxaloacetate is unavailable for condensation with acetyl-CoA when significant gluconeogenesis has been stimulated by low (or absent) insulin and high glucagon concentrations in the blood. Under these circumstances acetyl-CoA is diverted {{to the formation of}} <b>acetoacetate</b> and beta-hydroxybutyrate. <b>Acetoacetate,</b> beta-hydroxybutyrate, and their spontaneous breakdown product, acetone, are frequently, but confusingly, known as ketone bodies (as they are not [...] "bodies" [...] at all, but water-soluble chemical substances). The ketone bodies are released by the liver into the blood. All cells with mitochondria can take ketone bodies up from the blood and reconvert them into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used as fuel in their citric acid cycles, as no other tissue can divert its oxaloacetate into the gluconeogenic pathway in the way that this can occur in the liver. Unlike free fatty acids, ketone bodies can cross the blood-brain barrier and are therefore available as fuel for the cells of the central nervous system, acting as a substitute for glucose, on which these cells normally survive. The occurrence of high levels of ketone bodies in the blood during starvation, a low carbohydrate diet, prolonged heavy exercise and uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus is known as ketosis, and, in its extreme form, in out-of-control type 1 diabetes mellitus, as ketoacidosis.|$|E
2500|$|Resorcinol {{crystallizes}} from benzene as colorless needles {{that are}} readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide. It reduces Fehling's solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, {{as does the}} isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcin. These properties are what give it its use as a colouring agent for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160°C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorlgnder); when fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, {{in the presence of}} dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145°C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200°C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine. With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. [...] It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin 2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid. In alcoholic solution it condenses with sodium <b>acetoacetate</b> to form 4-methylumbelliferone.|$|E
50|$|Ketogenesis {{produces}} one ketone body per two acetyl-CoA. Two acetyl-CoA condense to form acetoacetyl-CoA via thiolase.

Another option here is <b>acetoacetate</b> can spontaneously degrade to acetone and carbon dioxide.

50|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, the {{conversion}} of <b>acetoacetate</b> into acetone and carbon dioxide by <b>acetoacetate</b> decarboxylase is a final irreversible step in the ketone-body pathway that supplies the body with a secondary source of energy. In the liver, acetyl co-A formed from fats and lipids are transformed into three ketone bodies: acetone, <b>acetoacetate,</b> and D-β-hydroxybutyrate. <b>Acetoacetate</b> and D-β-hydroxybutyrate are exported to non-hepatic tissues, where they are converted back into acetyl-coA and used for fuel.
