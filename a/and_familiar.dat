5|$|Carolina wrens sing {{year round}} and {{at any point}} during the daytime, with the {{exception}} of performing during the most harsh weather conditions. The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes, and although the male's song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition. While singing, the tail of the birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and túrtee-túrtee-túrtee <b>and</b> <b>familiar</b> names and phrases such as sweet heart, sweet heart, come to me, come to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting.

Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable <b>and</b> <b>familiar.</b> Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing <b>and</b> <b>familiar</b> folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
5|$|The superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus), {{also known}} as the superb blue-wren or colloquially as the blue wren, is a {{passerine}} bird of the family Maluridae, common <b>and</b> <b>familiar</b> across southeastern Australia. The species is sedentary and territorial, also exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism; the male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle, and tail, with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous, as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. Six subspecies groups are recognized: three larger and darker forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler forms from mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island.|$|E
