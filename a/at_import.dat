Barges can be loaded directly close to the point of manufacture, and discharged within a couple of hundred kilometres of the final point of delivery.

[...] It {{has been argued that}} the case against import substitution industrialisation is not that it is bound to fail, but that subsidies and tax incentives do the job better. [...] It has also been pointed out that, in any case, trade restrictions could not be expected to correct the domestic market imperfections that often hamper the development of infant industries.|$|E

We explore and compare three different approaches: using lexical functions in the f-structure, modelling collocations in the σ-projection, and modelling them through transfer rules. 21 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Though no perfect {{method to}} {{quantify}} the increase in revenue can be relied upon, yet there are clear evidences which suggested that substantial increase in revenue was registered due to improved custom processes. I will quote only one instance. Before WeBOC the exemption of withholding tax was used to be granted on submitting hard copy of exemption certificate to the PRAL key punch operator, who entered that number manually and importer used to get exemption. A large number of fake exemption certificates were detected in the past. In WeBOC system the exemption and concessions were being entered on line by the Commissioner (IRS). Commissioner Withholding Tax, Karachi had acknowledged the fact in a meeting that in new automated system collection of withholding tax <b>at</b> <b>import</b> stage had increased more than 15-20% (to the tune of 15-20 billion rupees) after its implementation. A chunk of this amount is attributed to automation.|$|E

From videos that present the agency of objects in relation to consumers, to the consideration of the space of labor through interventions into sites of emergent industries and globalized consumption, performative and farcical rhetoric, exaggerated uses of prosumer editing and motion graphics tools, and reverent appropriations of advertising imagery—these makers explicitly engage dream factory capitalism.|$|E
30|$|In Table 5, {{we present}} the average share of {{exports and imports}} from 1970 to 2006 at the 1 -digit level of the Harmonized System. Looking at export shares first, we verify the {{downward}} trend in Agriculture and the slight increase in Processed Food. Furthermore, we observe that the shares of Mineral Products, Chemical Products, Plastics, and Transport increase in time. In contrast, Textiles, Footwear, and Leather become less important. Looking <b>at</b> <b>imports</b> shares, the main categories are Chemical Products, Machinery, and Transport Equipment. Clearly, Argentina exports mainly primary products and agro-manufactures, with an increasing participation in minerals and fuels, and imports instead capital goods and inputs.|$|R

50|$|The Federal Board of Revenue (more {{commonly}} {{known by its}} initials as FBR) is a semi-autonomous federal agency of Pakistan {{that is responsible for}} enforcing fiscal laws and collecting revenue for the government of Pakistan. FBR has the responsibility for(i) formulation and administration of fiscal policies,(ii) levy and collection of federal duties, taxes and other levies, and (iii) quasi-judicial function of deciding Customs & taxation cases and appeals. FBR is perhaps the largest federal department in Pakistan. FBR primarily operates through its main collection arms comprising Customs collectorates, Regional Tax Offices (RTOs) and Large Taxpayer Units (LTUs) across the country. FBR has two major wings: the Inland Revenue & Customs. The Inland Revenue Service (formerly known as Income Tax Department) administers domestic taxation including Sales Tax, Income Tax and Federal Excise Duties. The Pakistan Customs Service administers import duties and other taxes collected <b>at</b> <b>import</b> stage, as well regulates international trade with regard to prohibitions & restrictions imposed by the government. For the purpose of collection of revenue and pursuing tax evaders, FBR's powers & functions also include but are not limited to: carrying out inquiries and audits/investigations into the tax affairs, commanding arrests, attachment as well as public auction of movable and immovable assets of a non-compliant. In December 2016, FBR further appointed around 198 inspectors for broadening of tax base and intelligence functions.Tariq Mahmood Pasha is the current chairman of FBR.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to conventional, dynamical entanglement, in which particles with definite identity have uncertain properties, in so-called statistical entanglement, which arises between indistinguishable particles because of quantum symmetry rules, even particle identities are uncertain. The Bell and Kochen-Specker theorems imply that quantum properties either lack realism or possess {{it with a}} caveat of contextuality or nonlocality. In the matter of identity of multi-particle states of indistinguishable particles, these contrasting ontological attitudes are mirrored by the "bundle" vs. haecceity views. We offer some arguments aimed <b>at</b> <b>importing</b> the above theorems {{to the issue of}} identity in quantum theory, with the conclusion (under certain assumptions) that indistinguishable particles either lack individualism or possess a definite identity with a caveat of contextuality or nonlocality.
