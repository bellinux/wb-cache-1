5|$|Jackson {{worked as}} an {{engineer}} in several NASA divisions: the Compressibility Research Division, Full-Scale Research Division, High-Speed <b>Aerodynamics</b> Division, and the Subsonic-Transonic <b>Aerodynamics</b> Division. She ultimately authored or co-authored 12 technical papers for NACA and NASA. She worked to help women and other minorities to advance their careers, including advising them how to study {{in order to qualify}} for promotions.|$|E
5|$|According to 20th-century folklore, {{the laws}} of <b>aerodynamics</b> prove the {{bumblebee}} should be incapable of flight, as {{it does not have}} the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary.|$|E
5|$|British {{researchers}} {{had found that}} the amount of electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive; and that externally mounted light projectors (following the Canadian approach) unacceptably disturbed the aircraft's <b>aerodynamics.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1952, McDonnell's Chief of <b>Aerodynamics,</b> Dave Lewis, was {{appointed}} by CEO Jim McDonnell to be the company's preliminary design manager. With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest {{need for a new}} and different aircraft type: an attack fighter.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aerodynamics</b> of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is {{extracted}} from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the <b>aerodynamics</b> of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the lift {{generated}} by butterflies is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory <b>aerodynamics.</b> Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} could see the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the night sky, the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British researchers found {{that the amount of}} electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's <b>aerodynamics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, with its high average speed, the teams set up their cars to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible. Williams introduced a revised FW23 specification for Montoya after one was used by Ralf Schumacher in Belgium. Williams equipped the earlier aerodynamic package on Ralf Schumacher's car on Sunday morning. Benetton brought a new front wing and Ferrari debuted a new engine specification with improved <b>aerodynamics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{are due to}} its 61-inch {{titanium}} wide chord fan, 3D <b>aerodynamics</b> designed new {{core and}} low-pressure turbine with single crystal high-pressure turbine and Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Fan blades are reduced from 38 to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5 series such as a double-annular combustor as an option.|$|E
5|$|Most {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} {{did not differ from}} the previous two titles. Wipeout is based on a futuristic anti-gravity setting where pilots would race against each other or computer-controlled AI opponents to finish in the highest position possible. Wipeout gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels; rather than using <b>aerodynamics</b> to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1946, {{five days}} after the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-300 and the Yak-Jumo made their first flights, the Council of Ministers ordered that the Yakovlev OKB begin design of a new {{aircraft}} similar to the Yak-Jumo, using the RD-10 engine with improved <b>aerodynamics.</b> This generally resembled the original aircraft, but the wings were entirely redesigned with laminar flow airfoils, the tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted.|$|E
5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} education focused on racial biology, population policy, culture, geography and especially physical fitness. The curriculum in most subjects, including biology, geography and even arithmetic, was altered to change the focus to race. Military education became the central component of physical education and education in physics was oriented toward subjects with military applications, such as ballistics and <b>aerodynamics.</b> Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A330-800neo {{will retain}} the {{fuselage}} {{length of the}} A330-200, with cabin optimisation allowing up to six additional seats. It will feature new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines with a 10:1 bypass delivering , improved <b>aerodynamics</b> including A350-style winglets increasing the span by 3.7m to 64m, and is scheduled to enter service in early 2018. It should cover 7500nm (13,900km) with 257 passengers (406 max).|$|E
5|$|The Mach-Zehnder interferometer's {{relatively}} large and freely accessible working space, and its flexibility in locating the fringes {{has made it}} the interferometer of choice for visualizing flow in wind tunnels, and for flow visualization studies in general. It is frequently used {{in the fields of}} <b>aerodynamics,</b> plasma physics and heat transfer to measure pressure, density, and temperature changes in gases.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in <b>aerodynamics</b> experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the <b>aerodynamics,</b> and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
5|$|Herd's {{knowledge}} of <b>aerodynamics</b> and Bruce McLaren's experience with Ford's sports car racing programme combined to spur the team into experimenting with aerodynamic bodywork. The M2A was {{fitted with a}} rear wing that produced downforce – downwards pressure on the car and tyres which allows faster cornering – and reduced lap times by three seconds at a test at Zandvoort circuit in November 1965, {{two and a half}} years before the Brabham and Ferrari teams eventually debuted wings in a Grand Prix. The team intended to use the wing on the M2B, but the engine problems that occurred prevented this.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers, Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} wing and stabilator trailing edges to improve <b>aerodynamics,</b> strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E
5|$|Myers {{designed}} {{a new type}} balloon vessel based on Carlotta's discoveries of <b>aerodynamics</b> and how airship bodies acted in the sky. Carlotta {{was the first woman}} to use a maneuverable airship. She used a cloth screw-sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform. The platform car device weighted 11 pounds. This {{was the first time that}} an ordinary spherical balloon could be controlled by a person. Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta's findings. For a more efficient steerable airship vessel he made his next balloon gas bag bottom flat so that it would act like an inclined plane.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered <b>aerodynamics,</b> culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E
5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, {{occurred}} at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936. After successful initial trials, the ATsN system was installed for the State acceptance trials in August 1937 and the AM-34RNB engines were fitted during the tests. Gromov reported that the rudder was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified {{a problem with the}} <b>aerodynamics</b> of the radiators and nacelles. To solve this problem, the outer engines' radiators were moved into deep ducts under the inner nacelles and the rudder was enlarged and redesigned with a smooth skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules and}} scoring in ski flying are mostly {{the same as}} they are in ski jumping, and events under the {{discipline}} are usually contested as part of the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but the hills (of which there are only five remaining, all in Europe) are constructed to a different standard in order to enable jumps of up to 66% longer in distance. There is also a stronger emphasis on <b>aerodynamics</b> and harnessing the wind, as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of engineering devoted {{to the analysis of}} wind effects on the natural and built environment. It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as tornadoes, hurricanes and storms which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, <b>aerodynamics</b> and a number of specialist engineering disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models. It involves, among other topics, how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering.|$|E
5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are inflated. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good <b>aerodynamics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coandă {{described}} a different, more sturdy {{system for the}} attachment of the wings, which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines {{on the sides of}} the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids, removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve <b>aerodynamics.</b> Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of <b>aerodynamics</b> is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{technical}} developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using {{three of their}} development tokens while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine tokens. As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their tokens, with both Honda and Ferrari having four tokens remaining and Renault having twelve tokens left for later in the season. Because of these changes both Mercedes cars were on their third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars were on their fourth power units. Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them {{to start at the}} back of the grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced earlier in the season ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better <b>aerodynamics</b> and lower drag for the high-speed Monza circuit.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced <b>aerodynamics</b> of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects <b>aerodynamics</b> or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its quietness, {{well-appointed}} and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, <b>aerodynamics,</b> fuel economy and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove the}} {{soundness}} of the IAe 33 design, two gliders built under contract by another expatriate, Reimar Horten, were constructed {{and used for}} <b>aerodynamics</b> testing in 1948–1949, including flights by Tank himself. These tests revealed significant problems with lateral stability, resulting in modifications to the tail {{to address this problem}} before construction began on two prototype airframes. Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Perón envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples. The first airframe (No. 01) reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.|$|E
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on <b>aerodynamics</b> at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his 28th pole position of his career, and his fourth at the circuit, with a time of 1:17.514. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard, who was three-tenths of a second off Michael Schumacher's pace. Häkkinen qualified third, and stated that his team made changes to his car's set-up having been unhappy with his car in previous sessions. Ralf Schumacher qualified fourth, and said he was pleased with revisions to his car's <b>aerodynamics.</b> Barrichello struggled with the handling of his car taking fifth position and stated that Coulthard prevented him from setting a faster lap time. Frentzen, Fisichella, Button, Salo and Irvine rounded out the top ten positions. Wurz missed out on qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second. Trulli qualified 12th having struggled with oversteer, ahead of Diniz, Alesi, Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa and Villeneuve. Johnny Herbert for Jaguar qualified 17th despite spinning late in the session, and was followed by Zonta, Nick Heidfeld and Jos Verstappen. The Minardi drivers qualified last; Marc Gené outqualified his teammate Gastón Mazzacane by two-tenths of a second.|$|E
5|$|The Eidgenössische Flugzeugwerke Emmen N-20 was a semi-tailless {{swept wing}} jet {{similar to the}} U.S. Navy's Vought F7U Cutlass with four engines mounted {{internally}} in the wings, fold-out canards to improve its <b>aerodynamics</b> at slow speeds, and a maximum designed airspeed of 1200km/h, a remarkable velocity for an aircraft of the early 1950s. The FFA P-16 was a single-engine straight-wing aircraft for which a contract for production of 100aircraft was awarded in 1958, but after the second crash of a pre-production model, the order was canceled. The aircraft had met all Swiss Air Force requirements for an STOL attack fighter capable of carrying heavy loads, and the crash was widely considered a pretext for the Swiss parliament to reverse itself. In addition, {{by the middle of}} 1958, influenced by NATO concepts, the LVK had redefined the Swiss doctrine of air power from close air support to counter-air operations. Further, the strategic concepts governing Swiss defense doctrine had shifted to a dynamic (mobile) defense that included execution of air missions beyond the Swiss border and the possibility of carrying nuclear weapons, for neither of which the P–16was suitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the <b>aerodynamics</b> rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamic {{problems}} are classified by the flow environment or {{properties of the}} flow, including flow speed, compressibility, and viscosity. External <b>aerodynamics</b> {{is the study of}} flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the lift and drag on an airplane or the shock waves that form in front of the nose of a rocket are examples of external <b>aerodynamics.</b> Internal <b>aerodynamics</b> is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal <b>aerodynamics</b> encompasses the study of the airflow through a jet engine or through an air conditioning pipe.|$|E
