It took nearly twenty years for the second {{official}} occurrence in NBA history. Andrei Kirilenko, on January 3, 2006, recorded a five-by-six against the Lakers. Though his numbers were not quite <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> Olajuwon's, Kirilenko performed the feat in regulation.|$|E
25|$|The team's {{second season}} was not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> the first. Tugnutt battled {{injuries}} {{and ended up}} sharing time with young netminder Marc Denis. GM Doug MacLean {{decided that it was}} time to give Denis the opportunity to be the sole starter on the club, and traded Tugnutt to the Dallas Stars.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch {{was more}} of an {{off-side}} player whose drives and cut strokes were regarded as among the best of his day; but his leg-side play was reputedly not so strong, and his ability against good spin bowling was not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> it might be. Also, he was believed to be lacking in command against top-class pace bowling on difficult wickets; if conditions, were perfect, however, his batting often followed suit.|$|E

25|$|The Tahirids were a local clan {{based in}} Rada'a. While {{they were not}} <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> their predecessors, they were still keen builders. They built schools, mosques, and {{irrigation}} channels, as well as water cisterns and bridges in Zabid, Aden, Rada'a, and Juban. Their best-known monument is the Amiriya Madrasa in Rada' District, which was built in 1504. The Tahiride were too weak either to contain the Zaydi imams or to defend themselves against foreign attacks. The Mamluks of Egypt tried to attach Yemen to Egypt and the Portuguese led by Afonso de Albuquerque, occupied Socotra and made an unsuccessful attack on Aden in 1513.|$|E

25|$|Earl A. Young (born March 31, 1889 – May 24, 1975) was an American architect, realtor and {{insurance}} agent. Over {{a span of}} 52 years, he designed and built 31 structures in Charlevoix, Michigan but was never a registered architect. He worked mostly in stone, using limestone, fieldstone, and boulders he found throughout Northern Michigan. The homes are {{commonly referred to as}} gnome homes, mushroom houses, or Hobbit houses. His door, window, roof and fireplace designs were very distinct because of his use of curved lines. Young's goal was to show that a small stone house could be <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> a castle. Young also helped make Charlevoix the busy, summer resort town that it is today.|$|E
5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{gave the}} song a {{favorable}} review, writing that [...] "this song isn’t <b>as</b> vocally <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> some of Shelton’s best ballads, {{but not every}} song needs to be 'She Wouldn't Be Gone.' There’s a warmth to the production that complements his genuine intentions." [...] Dukes felt that [...] "some will say the synthesized guitars go a little too far, but most will argue he pushes this moment just far enough." ...|$|R

25|$|In {{a review}} of The Orange Box, IGN stated that {{although}} Half-Life 2 has already been released through other mediums, the game itself is still enjoyable on a console. They {{also noted that the}} physics of Half-Life 2 are very impressive despite being a console title. However, it was noted that the graphics on the Xbox 360 version of Half-Life 2 were not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> when the title was released on the PC. GameSpot's review of The Orange Box noticed that the content of both the Xbox 360 releases, and PlayStation 3 releases were exactly alike, the only issue with the PlayStation 3 version was that it had noticeable frame-rate hiccups. GameSpot continued to say that the frame rates issues were only minor but some consider them to be a significant irritation.|$|E
25|$|The {{foregoing}} examples {{present the}} Salticidae as textbook examples of active hunters; they would hardly {{seem likely to}} build webs other than those used in reproductive activities, and in fact, most species really do not build webs to catch prey. However, exceptions occur, though even those that do build capture webs generally also go hunting like other salticids. Some Portia species, for example, spin capture webs that are functional, though not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> some orb webs of the Araneidae; Portia webs are of an unusual funnel shape and apparently adapted to the capture of other spiders. Spartaeus species, on the other hand, largely capture moths in their webs. In their review of the ethology of Salticidae, Richman and Jackson speculate on whether such web building is {{a relic of the}} evolution of this family from web-building ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is diurnal and arboreal. The snake's gliding ability, {{while not}} <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> {{that of the}} paradise flying snake (C. paradisi), still makes it capable of moving {{from tree to tree}} with {{relative}} ease. These snakes are excellent climbers, being able move across even the smallest of branches and even straight up trees with few branches by using the edges of rough bark. They are frequently seen moving up a coconut palm, or up vertical rock faces in graceful curves, gripping the somewhat uneven surfaces with their scales. They tend to be nervous, fast-moving snakes, and will attempt to flee if disturbed, but will not generally hesitate to bite if handled. They are mildly venomous, but the venom is not considered to be dangerous to humans. It is intended to assist in subduing fast moving, arboreal prey.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{players with}} {{one year of}} service {{in the minor leagues}} were subject to a draft if they were not called up to the major leagues. The White Sox left McLain in the minor leagues, and he was {{selected}} off waivers by the Detroit Tigers on April 8, 1963. He progressed swiftly through the Tigers' minor league system, and made his major-league debut with them on September 21, 1963 at the age of 19. His major-league debut, against the Chicago White Sox, was almost <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> his minor-league debut, holding the White Sox to one earned run on seven hits. He also picked off two baserunners and hit a home run, which was the only home run of his major-league career. McLain is one of only six teenaged pitchers to hit a major-league home run since 1920, a list that includes Hall-of-Famers Don Drysdale and Jim Palmer.|$|E
25|$|Dench {{became the}} {{voice for the}} {{narration}} for the updated Walt Disney World Epcot attraction Spaceship Earth in February 2008. The same month, she was named as the first official patron of the York Youth Mysteries 2008, a project to allow young people to explore the York Mystery Plays through dance, film-making and circus. Her only film of 2008 was Marc Forster's Quantum of Solace, the twenty-second Eon-produced James Bond film, in which she reprised her role as M along with Daniel Craig. A direct sequel to the 2006 film Casino Royale, Forster felt Dench was underused in the previous films, and wanted to make her part bigger, having her interact with Bond more. The project gathered generally mixed reviews by critics, who mainly felt that Quantum of Solace was not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> the predecessor Casino Royale, but became another hit for the franchise with a worldwide gross of US$591 million. For her performance, Dench {{was nominated for a}} Saturn Award the following year.|$|E

Torn by winds, scarred by lightnings, deeply rooted, {{tenacious}} as tradition, unlovely as Egyptian mummies, fantastic, dwarfed and blackened, these unaccountable creatures clung to the ledges. The dead mingled horribly with the living, and when the wind arose--the wind that was robustly cheerful on the high hills--these hags cried out with low moans of infinite despair. It {{was as if they}} pleaded for water or for deliverance from a life that was a kind of death.|$|R

500|$|Critical {{response}} was generally positive with some reviews claiming {{the album was}} the best of the group's career. However, a few reviewers expressed reservations that Love Kraft was [...] "merely a very good Super Furry Animals effort" [...] and was not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> the band's previous records. The track [...] "Lazer Beam" [...] was released as a single and reached #28 in the UK Singles Chart.|$|E

Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in [...] "enough electronic marginal distinction {{to feed a}} coal town for a month" [...] and to compensate for how soulless the songs are, resulting in [...] "arid" [...] art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for The Independent, [...] "For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, OK Computer is not, finally, <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> The Bends, which covered much {{the same sort of}} emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates so readily in its own despondency." ...|$|E
5|$|Renaissance humanism {{recognised}} no {{mutually exclusive}} polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies {{in science and}} engineering are sometimes considered <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> and innovative <b>as</b> his artistic work.

500|$|Many critics {{felt that}} the special effects overshadowed other {{elements}} of the film. Canby stated that the film [...] "owes more to [...] than it does to the director, the writers or even the producer". Livingston felt that Trumbull and Dykstra's work on the film was not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> on Star Wars and Close Encounters due to the limited amount of production time. Godfrey called the effects [...] "stunning", but conceded that they threatened to overpower the story two-thirds of the way into the film.

500|$|Although {{there is}} no {{documentary}} evidence confirming the architects, all sources attribute most of Regency Square's buildings to the father-and-son partnership of Amon and Amon Henry Wilds, who moved to Brighton from nearby Lewes in 1815 and became two of Brighton's most important architects; they were extremely prolific, and were responsible for defining and developing the town's distinctive Regency style. [...] Although they worked extensively with fellow architect Charles Busby during the 1820s, historians agree {{that he was not}} involved in the overall design of Regency Square, at least not in its early stages: the buildings [...] "appear to lack his distinctive flair" [...] and are not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>as</b> those at the Kemp Town estate to the east of Brighton, which all three men were involved with.
