5|$|FreeBSD has a {{software}} repository of over 26,000 applications that are developed by third parties. Examples include: windowing systems, web browsers, email clients, office suites and so forth. In general, the project {{itself does not}} develop this software, only the framework to <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> programs to be installed, which {{is known as the}} Ports collection. Applications may either be compiled from source ("ports"), provided their licensing terms allow this, or downloaded as pre-compiled binaries ("packages"). The Ports collection supports the current and stable branches of FreeBSD. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work correctly with an up-to-date Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee {{recommended}} that MI6 should {{be subject to}} UK employment law. Since 2000, employees of MI6 have had the same employment rights as other British citizens, including written contracts and access to employment tribunals. However, MI6 refused to <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> procedures to be applied retroactively to Tomlinson's case. MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining another PII certificate since the Tomlinson case.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{region of}} the Solar System {{is home to the}} giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater {{distance}} from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> compounds to remain solid.|$|E

5|$|The site {{chosen for}} the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east, the {{entrance}} channel to Canning Dock {{to the north and}} by Duke's Dock to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard. Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of 'Navvies' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> boats to 'lay-up'.|$|E

25|$|Some Neo-Marxists {{believe that}} it would {{actually}} be best for periphery countries to cut all economic and political ties with the core countries. This would, in their opinion, allow the periphery countries to develop and industrialize {{at their own pace}} instead of being exploited and driven by core countries demands. Doing this would <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> countries to spend their money on industrializing and bettering themselves, rather than importing goods from core countries. It also would <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> countries to become more independent from the core countries, causing them to move to semi-peripheral status.|$|E

His kites were soon adopted for meteorology, and he was made a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society.|$|E

Because UniCamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> children to attend summer camp.|$|E
25|$|Building crystal radios was a craze in the 1920s, {{and again}} in the 1950s. Recently, hobbyists have started {{designing}} and building examples of the early instruments. Much effort goes into the visual appearance of these sets as well as their performance. Annual crystal radio 'DX' contests (long distance reception) and building contests <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> set owners to compete with each other and form a community of interest in the subject.|$|E

25|$|The {{smallest}} modification to the Standard Model, {{which only}} has left-handed neutrinos, is to <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> left-handed neutrinos to have Majorana masses. The {{problem with this}} is that the neutrino masses are surprisingly smaller {{than the rest of the}} known particles (at least 500,000 times smaller than the mass of an electron), which, while it does not invalidate the theory, is widely regarded as unsatisfactory as this construction offers no insight into the origin of the neutrino mass scale.|$|E
25|$|The Dukes of Normandy {{were quite}} happy to <b>allow</b> <b>these</b> Danish adventurers {{to use their}} ports for raids on the English coast.
