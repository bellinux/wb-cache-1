40|$|Mass {{transfer}} and voltage {{drop in the}} deposited <b>asbestos</b> <b>diaphragm</b> were studied with a miniature chlorine cell. The diaphragm was formed on the steel-mesh cathode with a vacuum, and the voltage drop in the compressed asbestos layer was large. The streaming potential through the diaphragm was very small because of the highly conductive electrolytic solution. The rate of development of the amalgam-type chlorine cell in the 20 years after World War II is surprising, and many articles have been and are being published on this subject. On the other hand, although the diaphragm-type chlorine cell accounts for a major share of the chlorine produced in the United States, comparatively few papers have been published on the diaphragm cell (1 - 4). In the diaphragm cell, the principal anode reactio...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{photoelectrochemical cell}} with self-organized TiO 2 {{nanotubes}} as photoanodes for hydrogen generationA photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell with an innovative design for hydrogen generation via photoelectrocatalytic water splitting is proposed and investigated. It {{consisted of a}} TiO 2 nanotube photoanode, a Pt/C cathode and a commercial <b>asbestos</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The PEC could generate hydrogen under ultraviolet (UV) light-excitation with applied bias in KOH solution. The Ti mesh {{was used as the}} substrate to synthesize the self-organized TiO 2 nanotubular array layers. The effect of the morphology of the nanotubular array layers on the photovoltaic performances was investigated. When TiO 2 photocatalyst was irradiated with UV-excitation, it prompted the water splitting under applied bias (0. 6 V vs. Normal Hydrogen Electrode, NHE.). Photocurrent generation of 0. 58 mA/cm(2) under UV-light irradiation showed good performance on hydrogen production. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study was performed using {{an array of}} solar panels to power asbestos and non-asbestos diaphragm type electrolytic cells whose anodes consisted of carbon rods and cathodes made up of stainless steel plate for the electrolysis of a 25 % w/w sodium chloride solution, {{with the aim of}} producing caustic soda. The asbestos and non-asbestos diaphragms served to hinder the formation of unwanted substances as well as permit reasonable production of the desired products. Quantitative analysis showed that the quantity and concentration of caustic soda produced varied with the current and voltage obtained from the solar panels which were dependent upon the intensity of the sun on any particular day and the length of time the panels were exposed to sunlight. The asbestos and non-asbestos diaphragm cells exhibited various characteristic performances, which is a reflection of their design, fabrication, composition and operation parameters. The non-asbestos diaphragm cell showed similar trend with the conventional <b>asbestos</b> <b>diaphragm</b> cell performances indicating higher yield of caustic soda per d. c. Watt. The research served as an encouraging inquisitive foundation into the possibility of producing caustic soda directly from solar powered electrolytic diaphragm cells in comparison with present conventional modes of electrochemical production...|$|E

5000|$|With Thomas Bird, Hargreaves {{developed}} {{a process for}} the electrolysis of brine using <b>asbestos</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> In 1893 the General Electric Parent Company was established to develop this process. Bird died in 1895 and 1899 the General Electrolytic Alkali Company was set up at Middlewich, with Hargreaves as a director and his son Luke as general manager. Hargreaves cells were also built in France, Norway and USA. [...] The process was in direct competition with the electrolysis of brine in mercury cells in the Castner-Kellner process but Hargreaves considered that mercury was too toxic a substance for workers to be exposed to.|$|R
50|$|Chlorine and sodium/potassium {{hydroxide}} {{are among}} the most produced commodity chemicals in the world. Modern production methods produce Cl2 and NaOH/KOH from the electrolysis of brine using a Nafion membrane between half-cells. Before the use of Nafion, industries used mercury containing sodium amalgam to separate sodium metal from cells or <b>asbestos</b> <b>diaphragms</b> to allow for transfer of sodium ions between half cells; both technologies were developed {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century. The disadvantages of these systems is worker safety and environmental concerns associated with mercury and asbestos, although economical factors also played a part. Nafion was the direct result of the chlor-alkali industry addressing these concerns; Nafion could tolerate the high temperatures, high electrical currents, and corrosive environment of the electrolytic cells.|$|R
40|$|The BAT {{reference}} document entitled ‘Production of Chlor-alkali’ forms {{part of a}} series presenting the results of an exchange of information between EU Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection, and the Commission, to draw up, review and, where necessary, update BAT {{reference document}}s as required by Article 13 (1) of the Directive 2010 / 75 /EU on industrial emissions. This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the production of chlor-alkali covers certain industrial activities specified in Sections 4. 2 (a) and 4. 2 (c) of Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, namely the production of chlor-alkali chemicals (chlorine, hydrogen, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide) by the electrolysis of brine. In particular, this document covers the following processes and activities: - the storage of salt; - the preparation, purification and resaturation of brine; - the electrolysis of brine; - the concentration, purification, storage and handling of sodium/potassium hydroxide; - the cooling, drying, purification, compression, liquefaction, storage and handling of chlorine; - the cooling, purification, compression, storage and handling of hydrogen; - the conversion of mercury cell plants to membrane cell plants; - the decommissioning of mercury cell plants; - the remediation of chlor-alkali production sites. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the chlor-alkali industry are the conversion and decommissioning of mercury cell plants, the conversion of <b>asbestos</b> <b>diaphragm</b> cell plants and the use of non-asbestos diaphragms, electricity consumption, and emissions of chlorine to air and water. The BREF contains seven chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the chlor-alkali industry and on the industrial processes and techniques used within this sector. Chapter 3 provides data and information concerning the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumption of raw materials, water and energy, and generation of waste. Chapter 4 describes the techniques to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of installations in the sector. In Chapter 5 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the chlor-alkali industry. Chapters 6 and 7 are dedicated to emerging techniques as well as to concluding remarks and recommendations for future work in the sector, respectively. JRC.

5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an <b>asbestos</b> (or polymer-fiber) <b>diaphragm</b> separates a cathode and an anode, {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are not}} burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|R

There are several variants of this process: the Le Sueur cell (1893), the Hargreaves-Bird cell (1901), the Gibbs cell (1908), and the Townsend cell (1904). The cells vary in construction and placement of the diaphragm, with some having the diaphragm in direct contact with the cathode.|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrated}} brine from seawater {{desalination plants}} is generally discharged {{directly to the}} sea. To reuse brine, diaphragm type chlor-alkali experiments were carried out to make alkaline solution and gases. For this purpose, a rectangular acrylic reactor, 66. 5 g/L of sodium chloride solution, a PTFE hydrophilic filter as <b>asbestos</b> free <b>diaphragm,</b> and IrO 2 coated titanium net or plate electrode were used. The experimental results show that sodium hydroxide concentration and chloride removal increased with higher current density, and had inverse linear correlations to the increasing flow rate. The theoretical maximum sodium hydroxide concentration in effluent was estimated as 4. 06 %. Chloride removal and electric conductivity have a linear correlation with the sodium hydroxide concentration in effluent. Hydroxyl ion production was affected by the surface area of electrode per unit volume and by diaphragm pore size. Back-migration of hydroxyl ions from the cathode to anode is the major reason for side-reactions that cause low faradaic efficiency, including oxygen production in the anode compartment. Over 99 % pure hydrogen was produced in the cathode compartment, and the current efficiency of hydrogen production was calculated as 92 - 99 %.
