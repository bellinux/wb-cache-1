By {{analyzing}} the bearing raceway ultra-lapping process and equipment, we {{can set up}} an <b>automatic</b> device <b>replacing</b> oilstone and <b>automatic</b> detection mechanism of machining precision. By adapting the modular method to define respectively various functions of the automatic cycle processing module, <b>automatic</b> device <b>replacing</b> oilstone module, detection module, machining precision of automatic machine automatic feeding module, machine automatic feeding module, network monitoring module, and analyzing those functions to find logical relationship between the modules, we aim at establishing communication between these modules. Through the use of embedded microprocessor and its application software, connected by the CNC system and the external host computer network, we can realize long-distance control and unmanned operation, long-distance processing program transmission, long-distance diagnosis and repair services, technical services, and coordinating and efficient operation of each functional module of ultra-lapping process, eventually establishing the bearing raceway lapping unmanned manufacturing system, improving the efficiency and stability of the equipment, saving human resources, creating conditions for constructing unmanned automatic production system for bearing...|$|R
