5|$|During {{one of the}} cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by the Edea in battle. This {{created a}} theory that Squall dies in battle. When <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> this, Kitase laughed at this and denied this theory. However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff would think of changing elements from the story.|$|E

40|$|Clinicians often <b>ask</b> {{pregnant}} women <b>about</b> tobacco smoking, but their practices of <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> other smoking and nicotine exposures are unknown. This study analysed how often clinicians <b>ask</b> {{pregnant women}} <b>about</b> {{their use of}} e-cigarettes, cannabis, chewing tobacco, and second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure. Two cross-sectional surveys were undertaken. A random sample of 500 General Practitioner (GP) members were invited from the National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NFATSIH) to complete an on-line survey, and 5571 GP and Obstetrician (OBS) members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) were sent a paper survey by mail. Questions on frequency of <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> the exposures used Likert Scales, later dichotomized to "often-always" and "never-sometimes". Logistic regressions estimated associations between clinician type and <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> cannabis, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and SHS. An adjusted model reduced potential confounders of location, guidelines, gender and population. n = 378 GPs and OBS participated (6. 2 % response). In total, 13 - 14 % <b>asked</b> "often-always" <b>about</b> e-cigarettes; 58 % cannabis; 38 % cannabis with tobacco; 27 % SHS, and 10 % chewing tobacco-compared to 95 % of the sample <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> cigarette smoking. After adjustment, the odds of RANZCOG GPs (OR 0. 34) and OBS (OR 0. 63) <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> cannabis were lower compared to NFATSIH GPs. Clinician type was non-significant for <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and SHS. Surveyed Australian GPs and obstetricians <b>asked</b> less frequently <b>about</b> e-cigarettes, chewing, SHS exposure, and cannabis, potentially missing important exposures for mother and child...|$|R

5|$|McCormack {{starred in}} the science-fiction film Alien Trespass (2009), in which he played Doctor Ted Lewis, who gets possessed by an alien marshal, Urp, after he crash-lands on Earth. When <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> his {{interpretation}} on the character, McCormack commented that his first instinct was to make Ted Lewis more alien, sounding like Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Pietro Vidoni had {{the support}} of members of the Flying Squadron as well as Christina of Sweden and her ally Azzolino. He was not opposed by either France or Spain as well.

3000|$|A {{key feature}} of the {{algorithm}} is how choose Candidates(· [...]) actually selects the regions to <b>ask</b> <b>about.</b> In contrast to Algorithm  2 which, in each round, randomly selects a region to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> (which we call the random spatial crowdsourcing), the algorithm we propose later will use a neighbourhood association heuristic to select regions to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> which will be called associative spatial crowdsourcing. We first discuss the performance of two versions of random spatial crowdsourcing below, one without a heuristic as above and another with a heuristic that embraces failure.|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} it is {{confirmed}} that in Bari Italian an intonational distinction is made between polar questions <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> new information (QUERY-YN moves in the HCRC Map Task coding scheme) and those <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> given information (prototypical CHECK moves in the same coding scheme). The former, where the speaker believes that the information is not shared and therefore mutually inactive, employ a rising pitch accent (L+H*). The latter, where the speaker believes that the information is mutually active, are expressed with a falling accent (H*+L or H+L*). The situation is more complicated for moves classified as CHECKS which are <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> information which has been mentioned earlier in the dialogue as opposed to the prototypical CHECKS where the information is given immediately before the current turn. These CHECKS, <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> textually accessible as opposed to given information, as well as those <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> something which can only be inferred from the context, can have either rising or falling pitch accents. The intonational variation is related to the degree of speaker confidence that confirmation being sought in the question will be provided...|$|R

5|$|After the team’s 44 finish, Michigan {{dismissed}} Harry Kipke as head coach. Anderson, {{described by}} Heikkinen as the “greatest line technician in football today,” also resigned as line coach. <b>Asked</b> <b>about</b> rumors that players {{did not like}} Kipke, Heikkinen said those reports were probably originated by disgruntled players who {{did not make the}} squad or were in other ways dissatisfied. However, just over a year later, in February 1939, Heikkinen led the opposition when Kipke ran for the University’s Board of Regents and campaigned actively for Kipke’s opponent.|$|E

The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E
