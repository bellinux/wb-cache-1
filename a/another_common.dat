5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>common</b> {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E

This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Theodore Gill {{elevated}} Hypoprion to {{the rank}} of full genus and also placed the Pondicherry shark in its own genus, Hypoprionodon, based on the relative positions of the dorsal and pectoral fins. Subsequent authors generally accepted Gill's first revision but not his second, and thus this species became known as Hypoprion hemiodon. In 1985, Jack Garrick followed up on earlier taxonomic work by Leonard Compagno and synonymized Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. <b>Another</b> <b>common</b> name for the Pondicherry shark is long nosed shark.|$|E

5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship.

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is <b>another</b> <b>common</b> surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|According to Packer, <b>another</b> <b>common</b> {{theme in}} Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
