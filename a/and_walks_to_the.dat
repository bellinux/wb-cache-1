After beginning to feel better, Vince realizes that he has a serious case of [...] "the runs", in which he gets out of bed <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bathroom, in which he is covered in campaign signs, that block his backside.

I'm pretty sure he's brain dead."; McMahon responds by saying [...] "thank God," [...] and then lays back down.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{revolves}} around a boxing match theme. Mill portrays an underground boxer, while Carey and Ross, presumably as promoters. Opening with {{the entrance of}} the trio, the video begins with a hooded Mill entering a large dark auditorium. As he walks towards the ring, Carey and Ross accompany him on each side. As the video progresses into the first verse, close-up shots of Mill during the match are shown, as a large audience cheers them on. Additionally, Mill can be seen rapping to the song's lyrics as the camera zooms on him during each round recovery. During the chorus, Carey makes a secondary appearance in a floor-length copper gown, while standing on a large golden and lightened platform. During Ross' verse, DJ Khaled makes a cameo appearance as the former is shown on the golden stage, as well as ringside. As the song progresses, Carey is shown as a [...] "ring girl", walking around with several numbered signs. Towards the end of the match, scenes are interspersed with Carey standing alone in the ring belting the remainder of the song. During the video's climax, confetti falls to the ground as she completes the song <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring's edge.|$|E
500|$|The party {{return to}} antiquity and defeat Dalton. King Zeal nears the {{fruition}} of his plan, but Melchior and Belthasar enter {{the time period}} to dissuade him. King Zeal leaves the Sun Stone, the trigger for the revival of Zeal, with a follower <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North Cape. He reveals that Lavos survived defeat in Chrono Trigger and clung {{to life in the}} Darkness Beyond Time. He used the Frozen Flame to revive King Zeal, manipulating him to take revenge on the heroes. He is now merging with Schala, as he has done with all the other [...] "Arbiters" [...] who have used the Frozen Flame throughout history. Lavos calls King Zeal, intending to merge with him as well and evolve to become the Dream Devourer (as seen in Chrono Trigger DS). The party convince Zeal's followers not to activate the Sun Stone, and pursue Zeal to the Darkness Beyond Time. King Zeal confronts them once more, revealing his will is stronger than that of Lavos; he'll merge, but become the dominant personality within the Dream Devourer and create a new Zeal using its vast power. The party defeat him and return to Chronopolis. They notice the planet's Gates are closing again, and depart to their homes, promising to stay in touch. Belthasar meanwhile reveals he has the Frozen Flame, which activates and informs him that Lavos is still alive and will become the Time Devourer, the enemy of Chrono Cross. It challenges Belthasar to a grand game, and he begins drawing up plans for Project Kid. The game closes with King Zeal, shown to be alive and imprisoned by Magus in 11,995B.C., who forces him to teach advanced temporal magic.|$|E

2500|$|J.R. {{has made}} {{so many people in}} Texas hate him with a passion, from men he's screwed over in business, to women he's screwed over in relationships, to family members he's angered, to a businesswoman whose husband {{committed}} suicide.

2500|$|Babo reminds Cereno that it’s {{time for}} his shave. [...] "Most negroes are natural valets and hairdressers; taking to the comb and brush congenially as to the castinets, and flourishing them {{apparently}} with equal satisfaction", springing from [...] "the docility arising from the unaspiring contentment of a limited mind". Babo suggests that Delano joins them in the cuddy to continue the conversation with Cereno, and Delano witnesses the shaving with an appreciative eye for Babo’s graceful skill as a barber and a hairdresser. Babo first searches [...] "for the sharpest" [...] razor, and Cereno [...] "nervously shuddered" [...] at the [...] "sight of gleaming steel". Delano himself, for a brief moment, cannot resist [...] "the vagary, that in the black he saw a headsman, and in the white, {{a man at the}} block." [...] Cereno is nervously shaking, and just when Delano curiously asks him how he could have spent over two months crossing a distance Delano himself would have sailed within a few days, then, whether caused by a sudden wave on the sea, or [...] "a momentary unsteadiness of the servant’s hand; however it was, just then the razor drew blood", and immediately [...] "the black barber drew back his steel". Delano precedes the two out of the cuddy <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainmast, where Babo joins him, complaining that Cereno cut his cheek in reproach for his carelessness, while Cereno’s own shaking caused the cut. Delano feels that slavery fosters ugly passions, and invites Cereno for coffee aboard the Bachelor’s Delight, which Cereno declines, offending Delano, who is also increasingly irritated by the lack of opportunity to have a private conversation without Babo within hearing distance.|$|E
