Asset Management systems have only been developed by counties with large populations, but even they have not reached the full potential of the system. This thesis discusses the importance of creating and maintaining an effective Asset Management system. Kansas counties were surveyed and asked a series of questions about their asset management systems, or lack thereof, as well as the successes and failures of these systems. The counties were asked how they prioritize maintenance, what software they are using, and what assets they have inventoried. 	The results of the questionnaire showed that counties with large populations have shown interest in implementing Asset Management systems and many have worked to implement such a system. Conversely, counties with small populations that do not have the resources have not implemented Asset Management systems. Recommendations for implementing appropriate Asset Management systems are made to counties in the three population ranges: i) less than 5, 000, ii) between 5, 000 and 50, 000, and iii) greater than 50, 000.

Auto-ID technologies such as barcodes, sensors and RFID can enable <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> with the required functionalities. The selection of the right Auto-ID technology depends on the specific application and the available investment funds. In the thesis, we are focusing on the application of RFID technology in asset management. ^ Compared to other Auto ID technologies, RFID is preferable {{when we need to}} automate heavily manual operations and where speed and accuracy are fundamental requirements. By using long range transponders, called RFID tags, information can seamlessly flow into the asset management system. By creating RFID read zones throughout the organization, the asset management system can determine the assets that have passed by the specified zones and through logical assumptions create almost real time location and state reports of all assets. Furthermore, such automation, given that it is finely tuned and integrated with the organization 2 ̆ 7 s environment and system, allows for the drastic decrease of data entry errors, usually found in all operations that are manually controlled and operated. ^ The reliability of RFID technology has improved immensely {{during the course of the}} last few years. However, as we are dealing with a new technology, there are still grey areas demanding further work. ^ In the present thesis we are dealing with the use of RFID in asset management applications. The asset management / RFID system needs to have an automatic, resilient and error free input from the RFID hardware into the asset management application. Additional requirements are accurately set up processes designed specifically for the organization 2 ̆ 7 s environment, software that can orchestrate those together and finally trained personnel to maintain the entire system. The benefits of implementing an automated data capturing system as RFID are many. However, there are also vulnerabilities due to the Radio Frequency peculiarities, which raise reliability questions and hinder the RFID deployment into asset management applications. ^ The objective of this thesis is the development of patterns describing the behavior of typical fixed RFID systems, so that, while developing a better understanding of RF peculiarities, we will add specificity in the design of RFID systems and will encourage their use in asset management applications. ...|$|E
