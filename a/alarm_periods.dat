40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an alarm {{system based on}} trend analysis. A trend is semi quantitative information, extracted on line, expressing the time evolution of a signal with several symbols such as {Increasing, Decreasing, Steady}. The trend description corresponds to an asynchronous abstraction of a digital signal. In this paper, trends extracted on line from physiological data are used to generate alarms for medical staff. The quantitative information of the trend is used to set off an alarm, while the qualitative information is used to recognize specific situations on line, such as device disconnections. The system was run on line and tested on 36 hours of data recorded on adult patients hospitalized in an Intensive Care Unit. Comparison with <b>alarm</b> <b>periods</b> set off by a traditional limit alarm system shows that {{the performance of the}} trend based alarm system overtakes those of a traditional limit alarm system, with 33 % of false alarms rejected without any clinically relevant alarms missed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Worldwide, dengue is an unrelenting {{economic}} and health burden. Dengue outbreaks {{have become increasingly}} common, which place great strain on health infrastructure and services. Early warning models could allow health systems and vector control programmes to respond more cost-effectively and efficiently. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The Shewhart method and Endemic Channel were used to identify alarm variables that may predict dengue outbreaks. Five country datasets were compiled by epidemiological week over the years 2007 - 2013. These data were split between the years 2007 - 2011 (historic period) and 2012 - 2013 (evaluation period). Associations between alarm/ outbreak variables were analysed using logistic regression during the historic period while alarm and outbreak signals were captured during the evaluation period. These signals were combined to form alarm/ outbreak periods, where 2 signals were equal to 1 period. <b>Alarm</b> <b>periods</b> were quantified and used to predict subsequent outbreak periods. Across Mexico and Dominican Republic, an increase in probable cases predicted outbreaks of hospitalised cases with sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPV) of 93...|$|E

Across Mexico and Dominican Republic, an increase in probable cases predicted outbreaks of hospitalised cases with sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPV) of 93 %/ 83 % and 97 %/ 86 % respectively, at a lag of 1 - 12 weeks. An increase in mean temperature ably predicted outbreaks of hospitalised cases in Mexico and Brazil, with sensitivities and PPVs of 79 %/ 73 % and 81 %/ 46 % respectively, also at a lag of 1 - 12 weeks. Mean age was predictive of hospitalised cases at sensitivities and PPVs of 72 %/ 74 % and 96 %/ 45 % in Mexico and Malaysia respectively, at a lag of 4 - 16 weeks. An increase in probable cases was predictive of outbreaks, while meteorological variables, particularly mean temperature, demonstrated predictive potential in some countries, but not all. While {{it is difficult to}} define uniform variables applicable in every country context, the use of probable cases and meteorological variables in tailored early warning systems could be used to highlight the occurrence of dengue outbreaks or indicate increased risk of dengue transmission...|$|E
40|$|During {{the seismic}} {{activity}} in 2000 in the Izu Islands region, Japan, an experimental study on earthquake prediction {{was carried out}} based on several empirical rules. For the imminent prediction, hypothesis A was applied from 15 to 28 July 2000 : that is, when earthquakes with similar magnitudes were observed at intervals of less than 2 hours, a larger event would occur within about 4 hours. The <b>alarm</b> <b>period</b> was then changed to 12 hours (hypothesis B), and the intervals {{of a pair of}} earthquakes and the <b>alarm</b> <b>period</b> were changed to 24 and 48 hours, respectively (hypothesis C). According to these assumptions, 13 cases out of 25 imminent predictions were successful. Shortterm predictions for an <b>alarm</b> <b>period</b> of several days to 21 days were also attempted from 7 July to 13 October 2000, with the following assumptions: when small earthquakes began to occur adjacent to the previously active area, it would be a precursory signal of a forthcoming larger event within several days (hypothesis D). In addition, when earthquakes with similar magnitudes occurred within 7 days, a larger event might be expected within 7 or 21 days (hypothesis E or E', respectively). Among the 13 short-term predictions, 8 were successful. Although the success rates were not high, such information would still be useful to prompt an examination of the available data from various observations or to prepare for the possible execution of a governmental disaster mitigation program. Accumulating such experience will also be useful for finding an effective prediction method and an appropriate expression to announce the forecast...|$|R
40|$|Alarm sounds {{triggered}} by biomedical equipment {{play a key}} role in providing healthcare in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This paper presents our work on automatic detection of acoustic alarms in a noisy NICU environment, where knowledge about the particular characteristics of each alarm class is integrated at different stages of the detection system. The feature extraction is based on applying, around alarm-specific frequencies, a method for detection of sinusoidal signals, which employs the normalised short-term magnitude and phase spectrum. Also, the ratios of magnitudes at those frequencies are taken as features. The system consists of a set of GMM-based detectors, each designed to deal with a specific alarm. Temporal structure of alarms, in terms of duration of signal and silence intervals in every <b>alarm</b> <b>period,</b> is incorporated by aggregating the frame-level posterior probabilities. The experimental evaluations are performed with a database recorded in a real-world hospital environment.

40|$|Stochastic {{modelling}} of {{sequences of}} seismic events {{in order to}} evaluate the long-term hazard is typically carried out by point processes; a wide literature exists on this topic. The hazard assessment is the final goal of a multi-step procedure in which {{the reliability of the}} final result depends strongly on the answers given to the intermediate issues. The first problem consists in determining data sets so as not to introduce biased features in the analysis (f. i. missing data could be confused with seismic gaps). The spatial aspect of the phenomenon makes use of geologic information which, in our case, allows us to subdivide the Italian territory in eight tectonically coherent regions formed, in their turn, by more seismogenic structures. The sequences of earthquakes generated by these structures are drawn from the Italian catalog and date back several centuries; hence we had to estimate the complete part of the corresponding data sets by determining, in the Bayesian framework, the changepoint between two Poisson processes modelling the number of events in the incomplete and complete part respectively. The part estimated as complete is then analysed by means of a physically-based model. We point out that a side result of the changepoint analysis consists in the occurrence rate, besides its distribution, of the Poisson model used as reference model in the final validation step of our study. In the second step of the analysis, in order to enrich the stochastic models present in the literature by recently developed geologic and geodetic measurements, we propose a new self-correcting-type process which compares the expected and the observed displacement obtained respectively by the unknown coseismic slip rate and by the sum of the slips caused by every earthquake, calculated from the moment magnitude. Assuming that the larger the difference D(t) between these displacements is, the larger the occurrence probability is because there is a slip deficit which could be covered by a forthcoming earthquake, we suppose that D(t) is the level of the physical process controlling the rate of a stochastic point process similar to a stress release process with stepwise exponentially increasing intensity function. Estimation is performed through MCMC methods. The initial displacement of the region is not statistically identifiable; we have therefore chosen to determine it by minimizing the area between the two curves representing the expected and the observed displacement. In this way the periods {{in which there is a}} slip deficit, that is when the expected slip is larger than the observed one, can be considered as <b>alarm</b> <b>periods</b> and we say that the events that occurred in those intervals correspond to right predictions, while the others would not be correctly forecast. Finally the model is validated on the basis of the Bayes factor by comparing it with the homogeneous Poisson process analysed at the first step...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years, tuart {{trees in the}} Yalgorup region of {{south-western}} Australia have been undergoing an <b>alarming</b> <b>period</b> of decline and dieback. Research into {{the cause of the}} decline indicates the possible involvement of a complex disease syndrome involving a number of unknown factors contributing to the overall reduction in health. Factors affecting nutrient supply and availability have been suggested as playing a role in the decline. Tuart belongs to the largest Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus but is taxonomically distinct, having no close relatives and thus forming a monospecific section (Ruthrof et al. 2002). The Symphyomyrtus species has a greater demand for calcium, magnesium, and probably potassium whereas Monocalyptus has a greater demand for magnesium. Such differences must have a physiological basis but as yet no explanation has been offered (Judd et al. 1996). The nutrient status of tuart has been largely unknown, creating a gap in our knowledge in the role of nutrient supply to healthy tuart trees. Therefore, there has been an obvious need to investigate the current nutrient status of both healthy and declining tuart in native plant communities along the Swan Coastal Plain and further determine the role of particular macro and/or micronutrients in the decline...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{acoustic}} {{and bottom}} trawl survey for cod, haddock and redfish {{were carried out}} in autumn 1988 in the Svalbard area together with an acoustic survey in the Barents Sea. The abundance indicies of cod decreased from 1987 to 1988 both in the Svalbard area and in the Barents Sea where the index has decreased since previous autumn and since last winter. The results for haddock show that the stock is almost not present in the Svalbard area {{and that it has}} decreased in the Barents Sea. The present stock situation of the redfish species Sebastes marinus in this northern part of the species' geographical distribution, show a decreasing trend since 1985 - 1986 slthough the aoustic sruvey give a higher index in 1988 compared to 1987. The abundance indices of S. mentella point to a more stable stock situation for this species after an <b>alarming</b> <b>period</b> of yearly decrease. Both the bottom trawl survey and the acoustic survey in 1988 confirm this. A huge variability in the indices of S. viviparus is probably caused by the fact that this survey only covers a minor part of the speciesæ geographical distribution.

If Call Control detected eight failures to set up calls within that eight minutes, then it force-changed all the side-conscious units onto the other side, locked that side in service and raised a prompt <b>alarm.</b> In <b>periods</b> of very low traffic, there would typically be fewer than eight call set-up attempts on {{the exchange}} in eight minutes and this would have prevented the above security system from working. The exchange was therefore provided with an automatic Test Call Unit, which originated a test call every 30 seconds. As well as thus enabling Call Control to detect eight failures in less than eight minutes (if all call-attempts were failing), the Test Call would raise its own prompt alarm if it detected 31 sequential call-attempt failures, indicating that neither security side of the exchange was able to connect calls.|$|R

40|$|With {{ubiquitous}} wireless connectivity {{and technological}} advances in mobile devices, we witness the growing demands and increasing market shares of mobile intelligent systems and technologies for real-time {{decision making and}} location-based knowledge discovery. Spatial Alarms are considered {{as one of the}} fundamental capabilities for intelligent mobile location based systems. Like time based alarms that remind us the arrival of a future time point, spatial alarms remind us the arrival of a future spatial point. Existing approaches for scaling spatial alarm processing are focused on computing alarm free regions (AFR) and <b>alarm</b> free <b>period</b> (AFP) such that mobile objects traveling within an AFR can safely hibernate the alarm evaluation process for the computed AFP, to save battery power, until approaching the nearest alarm of interest. A key technical challenge in scaling spatial alarm processing is to efficiently compute AFR and AFP such that mobile objects traveling within an AFR can safely hibernate the alarm evaluation process during the computed AFP, while maintaining high accuracy. In this paper we argue that on-demand computation of AFR is expensive and may not scale well for dense population of mobile objects. Instead, we propose to maintain an index for both spatial alarms and empty regions (AFR) such that for a given mobile users location, we can find relevant spatial alarms and whether it is in an alarm free region more efficiently. We also show that conventional spatial indexing methods, such as R-tree family, k-d tree, Quadtree, and Grid, are by design not well suited to index empty regions. We present Mondrian Tree − a region partitioning tree for indexing both spatial alarms and alarm free regions. We first introduce the Mondrian Tree indexing algorithms, including index construction, search, and maintenance.

Data analysis shows that none of the volunteers fully complied with the tilting recommendations. It also shows varied activity levels, both within and between patients, indicating their engagement in daily activities. The system is also able to estimate heart and respiration rate during passive activities (e. g., watching TV and/or resting). Also, high temperatures in summer were monitored while patients were outside, to prevent heatstroke events. All the monitored variables are acquired with unobtrusive sensors, producing no discomfort to the patient and providing valuable information for better care.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{deployment of}} the World Wide Web {{over the past few}} decades has connected people globally. The next logical step in this evolution was to connect people to their environment. As public interest in the aging infrastructure grew, so did the desire to make this infrastructure safer and more environmentally friendly. This required the development of low-power wireless sensor networks to monitor and control this infrastructure, the so-called Internet of Things. With the introduction of low-power communication standards rooted in the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mechanism, the ability to have sensors communicate robustly (99. 999 %) over long periods of time (10 years) using battery power, appears to have been largely achieved. This thesis is concerned with exploring three significant applications of these new communication networks. It also introduces two modeling tools useful in designing new applications for this space. A process automation solution centered around rotary valve position monitoring is presented first. The "peel-and-stick" MEMS device shows an accuracy of plus-or-minus 5 degrees for quarter-turn valves, and an accuracy of plus-or-minus 10 % of a turn was obtained with the multi-turn valves. This cost-effective solution is designed to be densely deployed on most of the plant's rotary valves. Next, the design and implementation of fence line perimeter security application is developed and verified. Combining a MEMS accelerometer with a hypothesis testing algorithm, all 91 known intrusions were detected with no false <b>alarms</b> over a <b>period</b> of approximately two months. Finally, a wireless gas leak detection and localization is evaluated from a sensory swarm perspective. This application highlights the detection challenges when working with noisy sensors. A gas plume detection rate higher than 90 % is demonstrated, with 7 false <b>alarms</b> over a <b>period</b> of three days and an average detection delay of 108 s. In terms of localization, the system estimated the leak locations to within three meters of the actual leak source. The design of the new system tools is controlled by the energy trade-off between transmitting and locally processing captured data. This has direct implications on the Quality of Service (robustness, delay, lifetime, etc.). An adaptable energy consumption model for TSCH networks is presented and then generalized to an application energy consumption model. These design-time tools allow developers to understand the feasibility of the new application and to refine its hardware and software design in order to meet predefined specifications. The application energy model is presented by taking a motor vibration application as an example, while combining the sensing and communication hardware with energy scavenging. The work done in this thesis is experimental in nature and care is taken to bring the proposed ideas as close to real implementations as possible: the hardware is built using commercial off-the-shelf components, the networks are configured for the application at hand, and algorithms are devised and validated in each setting...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the quickest change-point detection problem in pointwise and minimax settings for general dependent data models. Two new classes of sequential detection procedures {{associated with the}} maximal "local" probability of a false <b>alarm</b> within a <b>period</b> of some fixed length are introduced. For these classes of detection procedures, we consider two popular risks: the expected positive part of the delay to detection and the conditional delay to detection. Under very general conditions for the observations, we show that the popular Shiryaev [...] Roberts procedure is asymptotically optimal, as the local probability of false alarm goes to zero, with respect to both these risks pointwise (uniformly for every possible point of change) and in the minimax sense (with respect to maximal over point of change expected detection delays). The conditions are formulated {{in terms of the}} rate of convergence in the strong law of large numbers for the log-likelihood ratios between the "change" and "no-change" hypotheses, specifically as a uniform complete convergence of the normalized log-likelihood ratio to a positive and finite number. We also develop tools and a set of sufficient conditions for verification of the uniform complete convergence for a large class of Markov processes. These tools are based on concentration inequalities for functions of Markov processes and the Meyn [...] Tweedie geometric ergodic theory. Finally, we check these sufficient conditions for a number of challenging examples (time series) frequently arising in applications, such as autoregression, autoregressive GARCH, etc...|$|R
40|$|Small {{cetacean}} bycatch in gillnet fisheries may {{be reduced}} by deterring odontocetes from nets acoustically. However, different odontocete species may respond differently to acoustic signals from alarms. Therefore, in this study a striped dolphin and a harbour porpoise were subjected simultaneously to sounds produced by the XP- 10 experimental acoustic alarm. The alarm produced 0. 3 s tonal signals randomly selected from a set of 16 with fundamental frequencies between 9 and 15 kHz, with a constant pulse interval of 4. 0 s (duty cycle 8 %) and a Source Level range of 133 - 163 dB re 1 μPa (rms). The effect of the alarm was judged by comparing the animals' respiration rate and position relative to the <b>alarm</b> during test <b>periods</b> with those during baseline periods. As in a previous study on two porpoises with the same alarm, the porpoise {{in the present study}} reacted strongly to the alarm by swimming away from it and increasing his respiration rate. The striped dolphin, however, showed no reaction to the active alarm. Based on harbour porpoise audiograms and the specific audiogram of the striped dolphin in the present study, and the low background noise levels during the experiment, both animals must have heard the alarm signals clearly. This study indicates that cetacean species are not equally sensitive to human-made noise disturbance. Therefore, source levels of acoustic alarms should be adapted to the species they are supposed to deter. In addition, alarms should be tested on each odontocete species for which they are intended to reduce bycatch. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
6000|$|The wind, as I before said, blew freshly {{from the}} southwest. The night {{was very clear}} and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I {{stationed}} myself by the mast, {{on the deck of}} the cuddy. We flew along at a great rate--neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said crustily: [...] "I am going to sea--you may go home if you think proper." [...] Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in spite of his assumed nonchalance, he was greatly agitated. I could see him distinctly by the light of the moon--his face was paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something had gone wrong, and became seriously <b>alarmed.</b> At this <b>period</b> I knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the land--still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. [...] "By-and-by," [...] said he at length--"time enough--home by-and-by." [...] I had expected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand. [...] "For God's sake, Augustus," [...] I screamed, now heartily frightened, [...] "what ails you?--what is the matter?--what are you going to do?" [...] "Matter!" [...] he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of the boat--"matter--why, nothing is the--matter--going home--d--d--don't you see?" [...] The whole truth now flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was drunk--beastly drunk--he could no longer either stand, speak, or see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that, during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of intoxication--a state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect--the mental energy began to yield before its influence--and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours.|$|R
