5|$|The bay's shore, {{especially}} {{near the}} Colorado River delta, provides a habitat {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. The wildlife serves as a basis for the birding and fishing tourism, and is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the production of seafood, specifically shrimp and blue crab, which are the specialties of the area. The fertile land near the bay is ideal for farming, especially for the propagation of rice.|$|E
5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E

40|$|The period protein (PER) is <b>a</b> <b>essential</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the {{circadian}} {{clock in}} Drosophila melanogaster. Although PER-containing pacemaker cells have been previously {{identified in the}} brain, the neuronal network that comprises the circadian clock remained unknown. Here it is shown that some PER neurons are also immunostained with an antiserum against the crustacean pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH). This antiserum reveals the entire arborization pattern of these pacemaker cells. The arborizations of these neurons are appropriate for modulation of the activity of many neurons and they might interact with PER-containing glial cells. A putative physiological role of PDH in the circadian system is discussed...|$|R
5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (<b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1950, with the {{publication}} of Psychology of Colonization by Octave Mannoni, The Tempest was viewed more and more through the lens of postcolonial theory. This new {{way of looking at the}} text explored the effect of the coloniser (Prospero) on the colonised (Ariel and Caliban). Though Ariel is often overlooked in these debates in favour of the more intriguing Caliban, he is nonetheless <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> them. The French writer Aimé Césaire, in his play Une Tempête sets The Tempest in Haiti, portraying Ariel as a mulatto who, unlike the more rebellious Caliban, feels that negotiation and partnership is the way to freedom from the colonisers. Fernandez Retamar sets his version of the play in Cuba, and portrays Ariel as a wealthy Cuban (in comparison to the lower-class Caliban) who also must choose between rebellion or negotiation. Although scholars have suggested that his dialogue with Caliban in Act two, Scene one, contains hints of a future alliance between the two when Prospero leaves, Ariel is generally viewed by scholars as the good servant, in comparison with the conniving Caliban—a view which Shakespeare's audience may well have shared. Ariel is used by some postcolonial writers as a symbol of their efforts to overcome the effects of colonisation on their culture. For example, Michelle Cliff, a Jamaican author, has said that she tries to combine Caliban and Ariel within herself to create a way of writing that represents her culture better. Such use of Ariel in postcolonial thought is far from uncommon; the spirit is even the namesake of a scholarly journal covering post-colonial criticism.|$|E

Recent clinical and cell-based studies have revealed specific alterations of miRNA expression in cystic fibrosis (CF).

30|$|In the coculture {{established}} here, the vitamin-supplying heterotrophs {{must have}} an obligate dependency on the cyanobacterium S. sp. PCC 7002 for the fixed carbon. <b>As</b> <b>essential</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> membranes, fatty acids are important sources of carbon and energy in all living organisms. Once uptake by bacteria, fatty acids can be degraded via the β-oxidation pathway which include the conversion of acyl-CoA to enoyl-CoA, hydration, oxidation and thiolysis, resulting in the acyl-CoA minus two carbons and acetyl-CoA (Fujita et al. 2007). Through the metabolism analysis for three members in coculture, the genes encoding for the enzymes involved in the degradation pathway {{were present in the}} two heterotrophic bacteria whereas absent in the cyanobacterium (Fig.  4 b). The gene presence/absence pattern in the fatty acid degradation pathway are suggestive of a possibility that the fatty acid generated by the cyanobacterium might supply the carbon and energy source for the heterotrophies in the coculture.|$|R
