5|$|After {{transitioning}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a cover band, {{the group}} quickly gained {{popularity in the}} Puerto Rican reggae scene. Cultura Profética began performing in major reggae festivals and opening for Jamaican reggae musician Don Carlos. The band's first album, Canción de Alerta (1998), was recorded in the Tuff Gong studios at Jamaica with Errol Brown, frontman of Hot Chocolate and Bob Marley's sound engineer. The group was the first Spanish-language act to record in Marley's studios. The record discusses a number of social issues in Puerto Rico, including the importance of acknowledging the island's African influence.|$|E
5|$|Birdsong first {{appeared}} with the Supremes in Ballard's {{place at a}} benefit concert at the Hollywood Bowl on April 29, 1967. Following the performance, Gordy quickly learned that Birdsong was still contractually committed to the Blue Belles when that group's lawyers filed an injunction against him. In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy {{was able to buy}} out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober. Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa, with {{producer}} Sōjirō Motoki {{and fellow}} directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, Mikio Naruse and Senkichi Taniguchi, formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai). For this organization's debut work, and first film for Daiei studios, Kurosawa {{turned to a}} contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted it for the screen. The Quiet Duel starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with syphilis, a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> typecast as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally {{considered one of the}} director's lesser achievements.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 first ran in 1974. In April 1979, {{the joint}} venture had not {{received}} a single order in five years and was two weeks <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> dissolved. The program was saved when Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and Flying Tigers chose the CFM56 to re-engine their DC-8s and shortly thereafter it was chosen to re-engine the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet of the U.S. Air Force. The first engines entered service in 1982. Several fan blade failure incidents were experienced during the CFM56's early service, including one failure that was a cause of the Kegworth air disaster, and some engine variants experienced problems caused by flight through rain and hail. Both these issues were resolved with engine modifications.|$|E

5|$|As {{the game}} {{gradually}} moved <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, {{along with the}} need for the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 the Football League, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change colours {{in the event of a}} clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} as Notts County manager in May 1957, controversially replacing caretaker-manager Frank Broome. Broome, who had steered the club <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> relegated from the Second Division, was installed as his assistant manager. He found it tedious in making new signings due to financial {{constraints on the}} part of the club. He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton agreed to go without his wages for six months so as to improve the club's finances. County were though relegated at the end of the 1957–58 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of just three months pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract to fall back on, and nothing in writing.|$|E

He wanted to win a medal because of his long training routine. Mohamed was drawn in the men's 1500 metres second heat on 3 August, finishing 13th out of 14 athletes, with a time of three minutes and 46.16 seconds. He finished ahead of Yemen's Nabil Al-Garbi (three minutes and 55.46 seconds) but behind Jamale Aarrass of France (three minutes and 45.13 seconds) in a heat led by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Shaween (three minutes and 39.42 seconds).

5|$|Much of Redemption's {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted issues with the initial lack of a function to save game progress at any point, which meant that dying or technical issues with the game could necessitate them to reload a previous save, and then repeat up to 30 minutes of gameplay. CGW added that the repetitive gameplay meant that losing progress and having to repeat it was a particular downside. Next Generation, who provided {{the game with a}} score of 3 out of 5, said that Redemption was potentially only a few patches <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a 5 out of 5 game, if not for technical issues. PC Gamers review even included recommended instructions for cheats that worked around the technical flaws.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{he played}} for Team USA at the IIHF World Championships. Vanbiesbrouck posted a 6–3–0 record, {{defeating}} three of three top ranked teams in the world (Canada, Czech Republic and Sweden). He later noted that those three victories gave him the confidence to be successful at the NHL level. The Americans were the second seed following the preliminary round. However they failed to win a single game in the championship round and finished the tournament in fourth place. Individually Vanbiesbrouck {{was named to the}} Second All-Star team. Two years later he played in his second World Championship. He was unable to duplicate his prior success posting a 2–5–0 record, as Team USA finished in seventh place one position <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> relegated to Division I. During 1987 Vanbiesbrouck also participated in the Canada Cup, registering a 2–2–0 record with a 2.25 GAA. He registered the lowest GAA in the tournament, but the United States finished in fifth place. He played in two more World Championships in 1989 and 1991 going 1–2–1 and 3–4–2 respectively, as the US improved to sixth place in 1989 and finished just short of winning a medal in 1991 placing fourth. Vanbiesbrouck was named to the Canada Cup team in 1991, but spent the tournament as Mike Richter's back-up. He played only one game in the tournament defeating Finland 4–3. The United States finished the Canada Cup in second place losing the best of three championship to Canada 2–0.|$|E
