40|$|In this tutorial, {{we discuss}} {{self-excited}} <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> attractors for systems of differential equations. We considered {{the example of}} a Lorenz-like system derived from the well-known Glukhovsky [...] Dolghansky and Rabinovich systems, to demonstrate the analysis of self-excited <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> attractors <b>and</b> their characteristics. We applied the fishing principle to demonstrate the existence of a homoclinic orbit, proved the dissipativity and completeness of the system, and found absorbing and positively invariant sets. We have shown that this system has a self-excited attractor <b>and</b> a <b>hidden</b> attractor for certain parameters. The upper estimates of the Lyapunov dimension of self-excited <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> attractors were obtained analytically. Comment: submitted to EP...|$|R
