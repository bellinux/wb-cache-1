5|$|The last {{portion of}} the report dealt with {{eliminating}} the debt by utilizing <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> fund that would retire {{five percent of the}} debt annually until it was paid off.

5|$|Affeldt {{had three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> fastball (which is rare for a lefty), a curveball, and a split. His fastball travelled in the low nineties, and while his curveball was not fast, it had late breaking action and {{got a lot of}} swing-throughs. Affeldt induced groundballs at a high rate with his sinking fastball and could also get the strikeout when the situation called for it.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised the creation of <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E

5|$|Immortalité almost reached safety. On {{the morning}} of 20 October, Captain Jean-François Legrand was {{approaching}} Brest when he was spotted by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Fisgard. Fisgard, part of the inshore squadron of the Brest blockade, immediately offered battle. Immortalité initially attempted to flee but was forced to engage the faster Fisgard at 11:00. During the bitter, close–range action, Fisgard took severe damage and almost lost her opponent. Immortalité, which had lost a mast and was in <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> condition, surrendered at 15:00. Among the 115 casualties aboard Immortalité were Captain Legrand, his first lieutenant and General Monge (commander of the 250 soldiers on board), all dead. Fisgard, {{with the aid of}} other ships of the blockade squadron, successfully brought her prize into port.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the capture of}} Junon, Guadeloupe was the only French colony in the Caribbean not under attack; Martinique fell to the British on 24 February and Spanish forces continued their Siege of Santo Domingo. The French did make further attempts to resupply the islands; a major expedition was defeated off Guadeloupe in April, and elements of this force that reached the island were defeated and captured during June and July. With British forces distracted by the ongoing Reconquista in Santo Domingo, {{the focus of the}} campaign moved north, and it was not until a second major expedition arrived in December that significant British forces returned to the Leeward Islands for the final invasion of Guadeloupe. The influx of British reinforcements was too late for HMS Junon; on 13 December she had been cruising alone to the east of Antigua and been surprised by François Roquebert's squadron of four French frigates. Outnumbered and surrounded, Junon fought hard but was eventually forced to surrender after Captain John Shortland was mortally wounded. Reduced to <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> condition in the engagement, Junon was set on fire and abandoned by Roquebert, whose ships were intercepted five days later off Guadeloupe and defeated: two were destroyed and two others returned to France without landing their supplies.|$|E
5|$|Severely damaged, Tripoli {{struck her}} colors to {{indicate}} surrender. As Enterprise moved towards the vessel to accept its surrender, the Tripolitans hoisted their flag and fired upon Enterprise. The Tripolitans again attempted {{to board the}} American schooner, but were repelled by Enterprise broadsides and musketry. After another exchange of fire, the Tripolitans struck their colors a second time. Sterett once more ceased firing and moved closer to Tripoli. In response, Rous again raised his colors and attempted to board Enterprise. Enterprise accurate gunnery once more forced Tripoli to veer off. As the action continued, Rous perfidiously feigned a third surrender {{in an attempt to}} draw the American schooner within grappling range. This time, Sterett kept his distance, and ordered Enterprise guns to be lowered to aim at the polacca's waterline, a tactic that threatened to sink the enemy ship. The next American broadsides struck their target, causing massive damage, dismasting her mizzen-mast, and reducing her to <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> condition. With most of his crew dead or wounded, the injured Admiral Rous finally threw the Tripolitan flag into the sea to convince Sterett to end the action.|$|E
30|$|There is also {{a demand}} for {{downstream}} (sink-to-sensor) routing [8]. For example, <b>a</b> <b>sink</b> node sends <b>a</b> query to a specific sensor node upon receiving abnormal data from the sensor node, or <b>a</b> <b>sink</b> node sends <b>a</b> message to change the frequency of sensing in a specific domain.|$|R
30|$|Potential-based routing {{delivers}} data {{along the}} gradient {{of the potential}} field constructed over a wireless sensor network. A potential is a scalar value (like electric potential) and calculated by each sensor node from local interactions using the potential of its neighbors, its residual energy and that of its neighbors, or the hop count to <b>a</b> <b>sink</b> node. Smaller (larger) hop count from <b>a</b> <b>sink</b> node leads <b>a</b> higher (lower) potential to a sensor node. Thus, the gradient of a potential field means the direction to <b>a</b> <b>sink</b> node.|$|R
30|$|Transition t 6 {{describes}} <b>a</b> <b>sink</b> transition. <b>A</b> <b>sink</b> {{transition is}} <b>a</b> transition that can consume tokens {{but does not}} create them [14].

5|$|The Lucera, {{trying the}} same evasive tactic, {{was the next}} galley attacked; a Dutch galleot, which drove under full sail managed to ram her. The galley was struck between the {{mainmast}} and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own bowsprit, but in return completely demolished {{the stern of the}} galley. Vice-Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half-moon, and finished Lucera (Morning Star) off by ramming, tearing the galley apart. Meanwhile, Victory and two States' galleots were chasing two galleys; San Juan and Jacinto who were already in <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> state. With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them, the only option was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of Niewpoort. Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais. The galley San Luis, which bore Spinola himself and his thirty-six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as the tide was low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis, but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk. With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins in}} Gotham City where Batman {{attempts}} to thwart a crime {{but he is}} being pursued by the police force who consider him a villain. In Metropolis Superman {{is seen as a}} hero as he rescues <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> passenger boat. Lex Luthor, head of LuthorCorp, is allying himself with Soviet General Anatoly Ceridov who is mining and experimenting with kryptonite in Siberia. Luthor intends to stoke fears of an alien invasion and sell anti-alien defenses to world governments. What appears to be an alien spacecraft flies over United States airspace and is confronted by the air force and Superman, but is ultimately stopped by LutherCorp airplanes. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter-ego, discovers that Lex Luthor is blackmailing members of Wayne Enterprises' board of directors to steal technology designs, allowing him to beat Wayne Enterprises on military contracts. As Batman, Wayne infiltrates Luthor's mansion to gather evidence but also steals Luthor's sample of kryptonite which sets off alarms. Superman and Batman confront each other, suspicious of the other's motives, but both flee as security forces respond to the alarms. Wayne turns his board of directors into double agents, having them give faulty technology to Luthor. To demonstrate his defensive capabilities, Luthor has Ceridov launch nuclear missiles from Russia to the US but Luthor's faulty systems fail and Superman stops the missiles.|$|E
5|$|As was {{customary}} Collier {{received a}} promotion, to master and commander on 3 September 1799, and a command, the 18-gun sloop , on 21 October. Collier commanded the Victor {{for the next}} couple of years, escorting convoys and on one occasion a convoy of troop transports to the Red Sea, bringing troops to defeat the French forces in Egypt. He stopped briefly at Diego Garcia to take on supplies, whereupon he fell in with the 22-gun French corvette Flèche. The two ships fought a brief engagement on 1 September 1801, during which the Flèche damaged the Victors rigging and managed to escape. After repairing the damage, Collier searched the surrounding area before coming across his opponent on 5 September, sheltering in Mahé Roads. The channel was very narrow, and the wind unfavourable, but Collier managed to warp the Victor into the harbour, and with the aid of her staysails, closed on the French ship. After enduring raking fire for sometime, he was finally able to haul his ship around and the two vessels exchanged broadsides for over two hours. By then the Flèche was observed to be in <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> condition, and her captain ran her aground. A party of men were sent over from the Victor, but having boarded the French vessel, found her crew had set her on fire and then abandoned ship. The men were temporarily evacuated while further assistance was sent across, after which they re-boarded and managed to extinguish the fire. Just as this had been achieved, the Flèche slipped off the reef into deeper water and sank.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place {{a day or}} so after the events of Escape from New York. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of Escape from New York shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in <b>a</b> <b>sinking</b> crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E
