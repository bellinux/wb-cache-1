50|$|A perfect grip {{depends on}} which pitch the pitcher is throwing. For a normal fastball, it is {{beneficial}} to hold the ball firmly with <b>your</b> <b>fingertips,</b> but not so that the ball is pushed deep into your palm of your hand. In fastpitch softball, there are several types of grips for various pitches. There is not one correct way to hold or throw a pitch, {{it all depends on}} the pitcher. Some grips are easier for individuals due to the size of their hand while others find certain grips more difficult. This is why younger pitchers who haven't developed into their normal hand size start with more basic grips such as the fastball. The main pitches involved in fastpitch softball are as follows: fastball, change-up, curveball, drop ball, and rise ball. Other pitches include both the drop curve, and well as the drop screw.|$|R
