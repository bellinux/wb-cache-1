50|$|Volatile {{anaesthetic}} agents {{share the}} property of being liquid at room temperature, but evaporating easily for <b>administration</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> All of these agents share {{the property of}} being quite hydrophobic (i.e., as liquids, they are not freely miscible with water, and as gases they dissolve in oils better than in water). The ideal volatile anaesthetic agent offers smooth and reliable induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia with minimal effects on other organ systems. In addition it is odourless or pleasant to inhale; safe for all ages and in pregnancy; not metabolised; rapid in onset and offset; potent; and safe for exposure to operating room staff. It is also cheap to manufacture; easy to transport and store, with a long shelf life; easy to administer and monitor with existing equipment; stable to light, plastics, metals, rubber and soda lime; non-flammable and environmentally safe. None of the agents currently in use are ideal, although many {{have some of the}} desirable characteristics. For example, sevoflurane is pleasant to inhale and is rapid in onset and offset. It is also safe for all ages. However, it is expensive (approximately 3 to 5 times more expensive than isoflurane), and approximately half as potent as isoflurane.|$|E

This study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of morphine delivered by an AERx prototype with intravenous morphine. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were enrolled. Two subjects were administered four inhalations of 2. 2 mg morphine each at 1 -min intervals or 4. 4 mg over 3 min by intravenous infusion. Thirteen subjects were given twice the above doses, i. e., eight inhalations or 8. 8 mg intravenously over 7 min. Arterial blood sampling was performed every minute during administration and at 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min after administration. The effect of morphine was assessed by measuring pupil diameter and ventilatory response to a hypercapnic challenge. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were performed simultaneously using mixed-effect models. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic data after intravenous administration were described by a three-exponent decay model preceded by a lag time. The pharmacokinetic model for <b>administration</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> consisted of the three-exponent intravenous pharmacokinetic model preceded by a two-exponent absorption model.

40|$|Administration of {{therapeutic}} entities by inhalation opens new possibilities for drug entry into systemic circulation, but this requires {{passage through the}} alveolar epithelium. Little {{is known about the}} pulmonary metabolism of verapamil. Specifically, this cardiovascular drug suffers from extensive first pass metabolism. We therefore evaluated the metabolism of verapamil in cultured alveolar epithelium and compared findings with results after <b>administration</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> and intravenous routes. Specifically, cell culture of alveolar epithelium was characterized by gene expression of surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D, by immunohistochemistry of surfactant protein C, by staining for laminar bodies, and by gene expression of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases. During 6 days of culture expression, all cellular differentiation markers were obvious, albeit at different levels. With testosterone as substrate, we found alveolar epithelial cells to produce several stereo- and site-specific hydroxylation products. This provided evidence for metabolic competence of cultured alveolar epithelial cells. With verapamil as substrate, only limited production of metabolites was observed in cell culture assays, and similar results were recorded after <b>administration</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> and intravenous routes. Likewise, elimination of verapamil from lung tissue and plasma was similar by both routes of administration. In conclusion, administration of verapamil by inhalation-abrogated extensive first pass metabolism frequently seen after oral application, and this may well be extended to the development of drugs with similar pharmacokinetic defects...|$|E

40|$|Neuraminidase inhibitors are the {{mainstay}} of anti-influenza treatment. Oseltamivir is {{the most widely used}} drug but is currently available only as an oral formulation. Resistance spreads rapidly in seasonal H 1 N 1 influenza A viruses, which were universally resistant in 2008, because of the H 275 Y mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) gene. Oseltamivir is a prodrug for the active carboxylate metabolite. Ex vivo conversion in blood samples may have confounded early pharmacokinetic studies. Oseltamivir shows dose linear kinetics, and oseltamivir carboxylate has an elimination half-life (t(1 / 2) β) after oral administration in healthy individuals of approximately 7. 7 hours. Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated primarily by tubular secretion, and both clearance and tissue distribution are reduced by probenecid. The H 275 Y mutation in NA confers high-level oseltamivir resistance and intermediate peramivir resistance but does not alter zanamivir susceptibility. Zanamivir is available as a powder for inhalation, and a parenteral form is under development. Zanamivir distributes in an apparent volume of distribution approximating that of extracellular water and is rapidly eliminated (t(1 / 2) β of approximately 3. 0 hours).

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} effects of inhaled and {{systemic}} steroids on growth in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants with chronic lung disease (CLD). Methods: Sixteen babies with CLD randomly received inhaled budesonide (100 µg four times daily for 10 days via Aerochamber) or systemic steroids (dexamethasone 0. 5 mg/kg/day, reducing over nine days). Linear growth (lower leg length, LLL) was measured by knemometry twice weekly. Results: The gestational age, birth weight, postnatal age, and LLL velocity (LLLvel) were similar {{between the two groups}} at the start of treatment. At the end of the treatment period, LLLvel was reduced in the dexamethasone group (mean − 0. 01 mm/day) but had increased in the budesonide group (mean 0. 48 mm/day). Mean weight gain was non-significantly lower in the dexamethasone group (5. 8 g/kg/day) compared to the budesonide group (mean 12. 7 g/kg/day). Conclusion: Inhaled budesonide has less short term effects on growth than systemically administered dexamethasone. The management of chronic lung disease (CLD) remains amajor problem in neonatal intensive care. In many units,intubated babies with chronic oxygen dependency receive systemically administered dexamethasone. Meta-analysis of randomised trials has shown dexamethasone given systemi-cally facilitates earlier extubation 1; it does, however, have important side effects.

The addition of DL-carnitine (7 % w/w) to diet during the administration of ethanol markedly inhibited the accumulation of triglycerides, and significantly reduced the intensity of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome. Administration of carbon tetrachloride ((1. 3 ml/kg i. p.), however, although augmenting hepatic triglyceride accumulation, had no significant effect on the withdrawal syndrome. The results are interpreted as suggesting either that ethanol-induced liver dysfunction plays a part in dependence, or, more likely, that triglyceride accumulation reflects an ethanol-induced metabolic disorder which is itself related to the induction of dependence...|$|R

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are believed to}} be among the causative agents for lung cancer in smokers. PAHs require metabolic activation for carcinogenicity. One pathway produces diol epoxides that react with DNA, causing mutations. Because diol epoxides are converted to tetraols, quantitation of tetraols can potentially be used to identify smokers who may be at higher risk for lung cancer. Our approach uses [D 10]phenanthrene, a labeled version of phenanthrene, a noncarcinogenic PAH structurally analogous to carcinogenic PAH. Although smokers are exposed to PAH by inhalation, oral dosing would be more practical for phenotyping studies. Therefore, we investigated [D 10]phenanthrene metabolism in smokers after <b>administration</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> in cigarette smoke or orally. Sixteen smokers received 10 μg of [D 10]phenanthrene in a cigarette or orally. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for [D 10]r- 1,t- 2, 3,c- 4 -tetrahydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydrophenanthrene ([D 10]PheT), the major end product of the diol epoxide pathway, by gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The ratios of [D 10]PheT (oral dosing/inhalation) in 15 smokers were 1. 03 ± 0. 32 and 1. 02 ± 0. 35, based on plasma area under the concentration-time curve (0 -∞) and total 48 -h urinary excretion, respectively.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{are believed to}} be among the causative agents for lung cancer in smokers. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a prototypic carcinogenic PAH, which requires metabolic activation to elicit its detrimental effects. The major end product of its diol epoxide metabolic activation pathway is r- 7,t- 8, 9,c- 10 -tetrahydroxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (trans, anti-BaPT). Individual differences in exposure to, and metabolic activation of, carcinogenic PAH may influence cancer risk. Measurement of PAH metabolites in human urine could provide a direct way to assess individual differences in susceptibility to PAH-related cancer. We developed a sensitive and reliable method for quantitation of trans, anti-BaPT in human urine using gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-MS/MS). A unique phenotyping strategy using [D 10]PheT as probes have been developed, allowing direct assessment of metabolic activation of carcinogenic PAH in humans. We investigated [D 10]phenanthrene metabolism in smokers after <b>administration</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> in cigarette smoke or orally. Sixteen smokers received 10 µg [D 10]phenanthrene in a cigarette or orally.

The ratios of [D 10]PheT (oral dosing: inhalation) in 15 smokers were 1. 03 ± 0. 32 and 1. 02 ± 0. 35, based on plasma AUC 0 -&# 8734; and total 48 hr urinary excretion, respectively. Overall {{there was no significant difference}} in the extent of [D 10]PheT formation after the two different routes of exposure in smokers. Its application in clinical studies has approved, for the first time, that there is large inter-individual variation in PAH metabolic activation in smokers. One striking finding is that the formation of PAH diol epoxides, the ultimate carcinogen, occurs astonishingly rapidly in smokers, particularly after inhalation of cigarette smoke. The pharmacokinetics parameters of PAH metabolites in humans have also been presented. The results have established the basics for using [D 10]PheT as a biomarker for PAH metabolic activation in future large-scale risk assessment studies in smokers...|$|E

A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study was performed to investigate the effect of the potent loop diuretic, frusemide, administered <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> on the bronchoconstrictor response to neurokinin A (NKA) and histamine in 11 asthmatic subjects. METHODS: Subjects attended the laboratory on four separate occasions to receive nebulised frusemide (40 mg) or matched placebo 10 minutes prior to bronchial challenge with NKA and histamine in a randomised, double blind order. Changes in airway calibre were followed as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and responsiveness to the agonists was expressed as the provocative concentration causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 from baseline (PC 20). RESULTS: Compared with placebo, inhaled frusemide reduced the airway responsiveness to NKA in all the subjects studied, the geometric mean (range) values for PC 20 NKA increasing significantly (p < 0. 001) from 130. 3 (35. 8 - 378. 8) to 419. 9 (126. 5 - 1000) micrograms/ml after placebo and frusemide, respectively.

In order to establish the effect of PAF on bronchial reactivity, 6 normal subjects without bronchial hyperresponsiveness inhaled 400 micrograms of PAF in 10 divided cumulative doses. All subjects felt a hot flush and a slight tracheal irritation after the inhalation of PAF. Forced expiratory flows (FEF) were measured between each inhalation of PAF and did not change significantly. Bronchial reactivity to methacholine (MCH up to a dose of 2 mg) was determined 1, 7, 14 and 21 days after inhalation of PAF.

40|$|MDThe Problem : Corticosteroids may be {{necessary}} to control the symptoms of many patients with chronic bronchial asthma, their use, however, is frequently complicated by side effects, which are unpleasant for the patient and often worrying for the physician. Any measure, therefore, which would permit a useful anti-inflammatory effect of these drugs whilst minimising side effects would be of benefit to patients. It is for this reason that, for over twenty years, repeated attempts have been made with every corticosteroid as they have been introduced, to administer them directly onto the bronchial mucous membrane by inhalation in one form or another. These attempts have failed, probably because the steroids used have had potent systemic glucocorticoid effects following any route of administration. The use of inhaled beclomethasone- 17, 21 -dipropionate, however, is in marked contrast to the earlier experiences with inhaled corticosteroids, because the symptoms of bronchial asthma are controlled without important. corticosteroid induced side effects. The aim of this thesis is twofold, first, to establish by simple means, the properties of beclomethasone- 17, 21 - dipropionate in in an attempt to discover, the reasons why this corticosteroid should be successful when given by inhalation whilst others were not, and secondly, to discover whether the regular use of an inhaled corticosteroid may be complicated by any side effects, peculiar to this route of administration. Summary of the Present Work : The use of corticosteroids in the treatment of bronchial asthma, and, the attempts to reduce side effects by clinical means, including the local, inhaled use of corticosteroids are reviewed. The work of steroid chemists aimed at producing compounds where there may be some separation of antiinflammatory from other glucocorticoid effects is outlined. The literature on inhaled beclomethasone-l 7, 2 l-dipropionate is reviewed and contrasted with the earlier studies on inhaled corticosteroids. The properties of beclomethasone- 17, 21 -dipropionate in man are investigated. These original studies include an assessment of its topical anti-inflammatory potency on the skin; the effects following its <b>administration</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> by mouth, intra-nasally and intravenously on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (H. P. A.) axis, together with an investigation of its absorption, and metabolic fate after oral and intravenous administration are described. The effects of beclomethasone-l 7, 2 l 0 -dipropionate upon circulating white blood cells and fasting blood sugar levels have also been investigated. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} describing and reviewing the evidence in animals and in man concerned with potential toxic effects on the tissues of the respiratory tract. The incidence of bacterial infection in the lungs of patients treated with beclomethasone- 17, 21 -dipropionate has also been investigated. Increased colonisation of the oro-phaxynx with candida albicans, and, less frequently, clinical candidiasis is a complication of treatment with beclomethasone- 17, 21 -dipropionate. This, together with possible predisposing factors is assessed. It is concluded : one, that high topical activity together with lower systemic activity and metabolic inactivation of the swallowed portion of beclomethasone- 17, 2 l-dipropionate are the likely reasons why this corticosteroid, in the doses employed, controls bronchial asthma in most patients without causing important glucocorticoid. side effects. And two, although no clinical or experimental evidence exists at present to suggest that this drug is exerting any deleterious effect on the tissues of the respiratory tract, this cannot be excluded and continued vigilance is necessary. Oro-pharyngeal candidiasis is a complication of this treatment, but, at present, the advantages to the patient of reduced or no oral dosage with corticosteroids, outweighs the disadvantages of candidiasis, because this does not occur invariably, it is frequently symptomless, easily treated and has only occurred superficially...|$|E
40|$|<b>Administration</b> {{of drugs}} <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> opens new {{possibilities}} {{for entry into}} the systemic circulation and cultures of porcine pulmonary epithelial cells (PECs) {{may prove to be}} valuable in the prediction of pulmonary metabolism of drugs in humans. This paper, therefore, reports a method for the routine isolation and cultivation of PECs from slaughterhouse animals. On average 1. 5 x 10 (6) cells g(- 1) tissue were isolated by discontinuous density-gradient centrifugation. Cells were subsequently cultivated on collagen-coated plates and characterized by staining for alkaline phosphatase, by tannic acid staining of lamellar bodies and by surfactant protein (SP) expression at days 0, 3 and 6 in culture. Over 70 % of purified cells were positive for SP-C and tannic acid staining and thus defined as epithelial cells of alveolar origin (AECs). The AEC phenotype was also confirmed by specific binding of marker lectins (Maclura pomifera and Helix pomatia) and by studying gene expression and activity of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases. Testosterone, ethoxyresorufin, benzyloxyresorufin and verapamil mere used as substrates for cytochrome P 450 -catalysed oxidations and cultured cells were found to be differentiated as well as metabolically competent during cultivation. Therefore, this culture system enables in depth pulmonary biotransformation and toxicity studies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Administration</b> of {{antibiotics}} <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> can greatly improve drug targeting {{to the site}} of respiratory infections. In addition, dry powder inhalers are convenient and can reduce daily treatment burden. However, the powder mass that can be inhaled each time is limited and the formulation of highly-dosed antibiotics for inhalation requires the incorporation of a limited amount of excipient. The purposes of this study were i) to demonstrate the interest of pulmonary temocillin delivery to reach high temocillin concentrations locally in the lungs and ii) to prepare a spray-dried temocillin powder for inhalation using a minimal amount of generally recognized as safe excipients. Pulmonary delivery of temocillin allowed to reach higher and more sustained drug concentrations in the lungs than intravenous injection in mice, although a 10 -fold lower temocillin dose was delivered intratracheally than systemically. A spray-dried powder of pure temocillin presented a fine particle fraction of 9 % of the dose loaded in the inhaler. However, the incorporation of 0. 5 % to 20 % of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) in the powder increased the fine particle fraction 4 - to 5 -fold. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed that DPPC concentrated at the particle surface with its aliphatic chains laterally packed. The minimal amount of DPPC needed to improve the aerosol performance of temocillin opens interesting perspectives for this excipient in the formulation of antibiotic dry powders for inhalation...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are to settle and verify how trustful is the {{heterotopic}} transplantation of the heart in an experimental model utilizing the original technique of Abbott modified by Ono and Lindsey distinguishing from it for the administration of the anaesthesia and the preservation of the organ. In this type of operation is necessary to realize only two micro-surgical vascular anastomosis that represent the basis of any other micro-surgical operation of organ's transplantation in the rat. There have been used 30 rats of the Wistar stock of male sex and weighing about 200 - 300 grs. both as donor and as receiving. The anaesthesia consisted in the <b>administration</b> of methoxyflourane <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> during the operation. The heart is kept in a container with Stanford solution on ice. The 77 % of the cases (23 on 30) have been successful, even considering the ischaemic damage that has been evaluated examining the cardiac beat and the color of the organ. The study of Ono and Lindsey gave as result the success of the operation on 91 % of cases (147 on 161 operated), compared to the result obtained by us, on a smaller number of cases (77 % of success on 30 operated rats) permits to consider this experimental model to be utilizable even for further more complex studies...|$|R

In the present study, repeated inhalation exposures to DNCB were investigated using the same protocol as the single-challenge study: female Wistar rats were dermally sensitized with DNCB and subsequently challenged <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> exposure to 7 or 15 mg/m(3) DNCB twice a week for 4 weeks. Allergy-related apnoeic breathing was not observed. DNCB-specific IgG antibodies were found in the serum and [...] predominantly lymphocytic [...] inflammations were found in the nasal tissues and larynx. Similar effects were observed in animals repeatedly exposed <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> without previous dermal contact, indicating sensitization <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> The inflammation may be the upper respiratory tract analogue of hypersensitivity pneumonitis/allergic alveolitis. Possible progression of the airway inflammation upon long-term exposure should be investigated to support or dismiss discrimination between contact and respiratory allergens in relation to respiratory allergy.
