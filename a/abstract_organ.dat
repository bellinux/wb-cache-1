40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Organ</b> {{segmentation}} is {{a challenging}} problem on which significant {{progress has been}} made. Deformable models (DM) and graphical models (GM) are two important categories of optimization based image segmentation methods. Efforts have been made on integrating two types of models into one framework. However, previous methods are not designed for segmenting multiple organs simultaneously and accurately. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi organ segmentation approach by integrating DM and GM in a coupled optimization framework. Specifically, we show that region-based deformable models can be integrated with Markov Random Fields (MRF), such that multiple models ’ evolutions are driven by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. It brings global and local deformation constraints into a unified framework for simultaneous segmentation of multiple objects in an image. We validate this proposed method on two challenging problems of multi organ segmentation, {{and the results are}} promising. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Organ</b> {{transplantation}} requires lifelong antirejection therapy, {{which carries}} {{the risk of}} infection and cancer. A revolutionary approach is to transduce the organ graft with immunomodulatory genes to render them tolerated with no need of systemic immunosuppression. Prolonged allograft survival was achieved by adenovirus-mediated transduction of the cold-preserved kidney with sequences encoding CTLA 4 Ig, a recombinant fusion protein that blocks T cell activation. Organ expression of the transgene was achieved associated with mild infiltration of mononuclear cells in the transfected kidney. Mixed lymphocyte reaction {{as well as the}} production of both Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines were reduced. Thus, the gene transfer technique to prolong graft survival is indeed effective and safe and can induce donor-specific unresponsiveness.

40|$|<b>Abstract</b> <b>Organ</b> {{transplantation}} is {{the main}} alternative {{to the loss of}} vital organ function from various diseases. However, to avoid graft rejection, transplant patients are treated with immunosuppressive drugs that have adverse side effects. A new emerging approach to reduce the administration of immunosuppressive drugs is to co-treat patients with cell therapy using regulatory cells. In our laboratory, as part of a European project, we plan to test the safety of tolerogenic dendritic cell (TolDC) therapy in kidney transplant patients. In this mini-review, we provide a brief summary of the major protocols used to derive human TolDC, and then focus on the granulocyte macrophage-TolDC generated by our own team. Proof of safety of TolDC therapy in the clinic has already been demonstrated in patients with diabetes. However, in transplantation, DC therapy will be associated with the administration of immunosuppressive drugs, and interactions between drugs and DC are possible. Finally, we will discuss the issue of DC origin, as we believe that administration of autologous TolDC is more appropriate, as demonstrated by our experiments in animal models. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Abstract</b> <b>Organ</b> {{donation}} after cardiac or circulatory death (DCD) {{has been}} introduced to increase the supply of transplantable organs. In this paper, we argue that the recovery of viable organs useful for transplantation in DCD is not compatible with the dead donor rule and we explain the consequential ethical and legal ramifications. We also outline serious deficiencies in the current consent process for DCD with respect to disclosure of necessary elements for voluntary informed decision making {{and respect for the}} donor's autonomy. We compare two alternative proposals for increasing organ donation consent in society: presumed consent and mandated choice. We conclude that proceeding with the recovery of transplantable organs from decedents requires a paradigm change in the ethics of organ donation. The paradigm change to ensure the legitimacy of DCD practice must include: (1) societal agreement on abandonment of the dead donor rule, (2) legislative revisions reflecting abandonment of the dead donor rule, and (3) requirement of mandated choice to facilitate individual participation in organ donation and to ensure that decisions to participate are made in compliance with the societal values of respect for autonomy and self-determination. </p...|$|E

The study included works for organ solo which are primarily for pedals alone. A work with a few manual chords was not excluded, but a work which consistently uses the manuals, even in the most subsidiary role, was not included. The study was concerned with compositions which are intended for public performance. Exercises were omitted. FindingsThe efforts of thirty-three composers have produced thirty-nine compositions or collections of for pedals alone. One of the works makes exclusive use of clusters, three use dodecaphonic techniques, and four are from the Romantic Era. The remainder are compositions divided between twentieth-century moderate styles and twentieth-century conservative styles. Seventeen of the works require a pedal board with thirty-two pedals, eighteen of the works require at least thirty pedals, and three may be played on an instrument with twenty-five pedals. One work which does not use traditional notation could presumedly be played on any instrument. Thirteen works, one of which is in Langlais' collection of etudes, employ pre-existing tunes which are treated to variations or other compositional techniques.

40|$|<b>ABSTRACT.</b> <b>Organ</b> {{culture of}} blood vessel {{is a better}} {{technique}} to investigate {{the long-term effects of}} drugs. However, some functional changes may occur from freshly isolated vessel (Fresh). Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates smooth muscle differentiation and Ca 2 + mobilization. We thus investigated mechanisms of alteration in smooth muscle contractility after serum-free organ culture focusing on mTOR. Rat isolated mesenteric arteries were cultured for 5 days without (0 % serum) or with rapamycin. In 0 % serum, absolute contraction by KCl significantly decreased from Fresh, which was significantly rescued by rapamycin. In 0 % serum, mTOR expression significantly increased from Fresh, which was significantly rescued by rapamycin. In 0 % serum, expression of myocardin, a key regulator of smooth muscle differentiation markers, significantly decreased from Fresh, which was significantly rescued by rapamycin. However, the decrease in expression of contractile proteins, including SM 22 α and calponin, was not changed by rapamycin. Basal phos-phorylation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II significantly increased in 0 % serum, which was significantly rescued by rapamycin. In 0 % serum, absolute contraction by caffeine significantly decreased from Fresh, which was significantly rescued by rapamycin. In conclu-sion, expression of mTOR increased during serum-free organ culture of rat isolated mesenteric artery for 5 days, which may be at least partly responsible for the decreased smooth muscle contractility perhaps due to the decrease in the stored Ca 2 + in smooth muscle.

Energy and amino acid requirements for these birds were calculated {{on the basis}} of this and previous information. Day-old chicks were obtained from a commercial hatchery and were fed the diets designed according to National Research Council (NRC, 1977) recommendations. At weekly intervals 5 birds of each breed and sex were killed and the weights of various organs were recorded. Carcasses were homogenized and analyzed for protein and fat. The results are expressed as percent of live weight. Percent of feathers was significantly greater in the light cross than in broilers and in females than in males. There was no consistent breed or sex difference in liver, heart, and kidney weights. The intestine was relatively heavier in the broilers up to 4 weeks of age; this tendency was later reversed. The relative size of the spleen, gizzard, and proventriculus was greater in the light cross than in the broilers from 3 to 10 weeks of age. The concentration of carcass protein increased with age in both breeds and sexes and was significantly higher in the light breed than in the broilers. Carcass lipids increased with age in all cases. More fat was observed in the broilers than in the light breeds and in females than in males. The most remarkable increase in carcass fat started in the broiler females at the age of 7 weeks and continued until 10 weeks of age.

40|$|<b>Abstract</b> <b>Organ</b> {{donation}} after {{cessation of}} circulation and respiration, both controlled and uncontrolled, {{has been proposed}} by the Institute of Medicine {{as a way to}} increase opportunities for organ procurement. Despite claims to the contrary, both forms of controlled and uncontrolled donation after cardiac death raise significant ethical and legal issues. Identified causes for concern include absence of agreement on criteria for the declaration of death, nonexistence of universal guidelines for duration before stopping resuscitation efforts and techniques, and assumption of presumed intent to donate for the purpose of initiating temporary organ-preservation interventions when no expressed consent to donate is present. From a legal point of view, not having scientifically valid criteria of cessation of circulation and respiration for declaring death could lead to a conclusion that organ procurement itself is the proximate cause of death. Although the revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 2006 provides broad immunity to those involved in organ-procurement activities, courts have yet to provide an opinion on whether persons can be held liable for injuries arising from the determination of death itself. Preserving organs in uncontrolled donation after cardiac death requires the administration of life-support systems such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These life-support systems can lead to return of signs of life that, in turn, have to be deliberately suppressed by the administration of pharmacological agents. Finally, allowing temporary organ-preservation interventions without expressed consent is inherently a violation of the principle of respect for a person's autonomy. Proponents of organ donation from uncontrolled donation after cardiac death, on the other hand, claim that these nonconsensual interventions enhance respect for autonomy by allowing people, through surrogate decision making, to execute their right to donate organs. However, the lack of transparency and the absence of protection of individual autonomy, for the sake of maximizing procurement opportunities, have placed the current organ-donation system of opting-in in great jeopardy. Equally as important, current policies enabling and enhancing organ procurement practices, pose challenges to the constitutional rights of individuals in a pluralistic society as these policies are founded on flawed medical standards for declaring death. </p...|$|E

Though many studies have been performed in vitro to investigate the mechanisms of detection and adaptation to mechanical strains, the cellular strains remain unknown and results from different stimulation techniques cannot be compared. By combining experimental determination of cell profiles and elasticities by atomic force microscopy with finite element modeling and computational fluid dynamics, we report the cellular strain distributions exerted by common whole-cell straining techniques and from micromanipulation techniques, hence enabling their comparison. Using data from our own analyses and experiments performed by others, we examine the threshold of activation for different signal transduction processes and the strain components that they may detect. We show that modulating cell elasticity, by increasing the F-actin content of the cytoskeleton, or cellular Poisson ratio are good strategies to resist fluid shear or hydrostatic pressure. We report that stray fluid flow in some substrate-stretch systems elicits significant cellular strains. In conclusion, this technique shows promise in furthering our understanding of the interplay among mechanical forces, strain detection, gene expression, and cellular adaptation in physiology and disease...|$|R

40|$|Influenced by synesthesia, {{the creators}} of such ?visual musics? as <b>abstract</b> art, color <b>organs,</b> <b>abstract</b> film, and most {{recently}} visualizers, have attempted to illustrate correspondences between the senses. This thesis attempts to develop a framework for music visualization founded on emotional analogues between visual art and music. The framework implements audio signal spectrum analysis, mood modeling, and color theory to produce pertinent data for use in visualizations. The research is manifest as a computer program that creates a simple visualizer. Built in Max/MSP/Jitter, a programming environment especially for musical and multimedia processing, it analyzes data and produces images in real-time. The program employs spectrum analysis to extract musical data such as loudness, brightness, and note attacks from the audio signals of AIFF song files. These musical features are {{used to calculate the}} Energy and Stress of the song, which determine the general mood of the music. The mood can fall into one of the four general categories of Exuberance, Contentment, Depression, and Anxious/Frantic. This method of automatic mood classification resulted in an eighty-five percent accuracy rate. Applying color expression theory yields a color palette that reflects the musical mood. The color palette and the musical features are then supplied to four different animation schemes to produce visuals. The visualizer generates shapes and forms in a three-dimensional environment and animates them in response to the real-time musical data. The visualizer allows user input to actively direct the creation of a variety of different visualizations. This personalization of the synesthetic effects of the visualizer invites the viewer to actively consider his or her own unique associations and facilitates understanding of the phenomenon of synesthesia and sensory fusion...|$|R

Two phylogenetic approaches have been used to test whether regain of traits has occurred. One way is by comparison of nested, continuous-time Markov models of trait evolution, approaches that we term tree-based tests. A second way to demonstrate statistical support for trait regain is through use of node-based tests that employ explicit estimation of ancestral node states. Here, we estimate new molecular and morphological phylogenies and use them to examine the possibility of eye regain and dispersal between abyssal and shallow seas during the history of cylindroleberidid ostracods, a family of about 200 species, comprising both eyeless and sighted species. First, we confirmed that eye presence/absence is correlated with habitat depth. Parameter estimates from a phylogenetic model indicate that speciation is more rapid in deep-sea eyeless clades compared with shallow-water sighted clades. In addition, we found that tree-based statistical tests usually indicated reversals, including both transitions from deep to shallow seas and regain of eyes. In contrast, node-based statistical tests usually failed to show significant support for reversals. These results also hold for simulated phylogenies...|$|R

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> Automatic <b>organ</b> {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} yet challeng-ing problem for medical image analysis. The pancreas is an abdominal organ with very high anatomical variability. This inhibits previous seg-mentation methods from achieving high accuracies, especially compared to other organs such as the liver, heart or kidneys. In this paper, we present a probabilistic bottom-up approach for pancreas segmentation in abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, using multi-level deep convolutional networks (ConvNets). We propose and evaluate several variations of deep ConvNets {{in the context of}} hierarchical, coarse-to-fine classification on image patches and regions, i. e. superpixels. We first present a dense labeling of local image patches via P-ConvNet and near-est neighbor fusion. Then we describe a regional ConvNet (R 1 −ConvNet) that samples a set of bounding boxes around each image superpixel at different scales of contexts in a “zoom-out ” fashion. Our ConvNets learn to assign class probabilities for each superpixel region of being pancreas. Last, we study a stacked R 2 −ConvNet leveraging the joint space of CT intensities and the P−ConvNet dense probability maps. Both 3 D Gaus-sian smoothing and 2 D conditional random fields are exploited as struc-tured predictions for post-processing. We evaluate on CT images of 82 patients in 4 -fold cross-validation. We achieve a Dice Similarity Coeffi-cient of 83. 6 ± 6. 3 % in training and 71. 8 ± 10. 7 % in testing. ...|$|R

However, tracking and segmentation of complex, quickly changing motion patterns is challenging, {{certainly in the}} presence of occlusions. Neither state-of-the-art tracking nor motion segmentation approaches are able to deal with such cases. Thus far, motion capture systems or the like were needed which are complicated to handle and which impact on the movements. We propose a solu-tion based on a single video camera, that is not only far less intrusive, but also a lot cheaper. The limitation of tracking and motion segmentation are overcome by a new approach to integrate prior knowledge in the form of weak labeling into motion segmentation. Using the example of Cerebral Palsy detection, we seg-ment motion patterns of infants into the different body parts by analyzing body movements. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms cur-rent motion segmentation and tracking approaches. ...|$|R
