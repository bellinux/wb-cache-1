5|$|Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> Gungan exiled {{from his}} home and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting {{director}} Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco. Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character. Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{athletic}} record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>clumsy,</b> likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, {{as well as his}} perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E

Other human characters include Mrs. Twombly, owner of the shop and Blythe's boss, and Youngmee Song, Sue Patterson, and Jasper Jones, Blythe's schoolmates.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{regarded}} the second Pittsburgh convention {{as a serious}} threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} rear end of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with <b>a</b> <b>clumsy,</b> rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E
5|$|Practically {{every imaginable}} posture has been {{suggested}} for Plateosaurus in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed digitigrade bipedality with erect hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked quadrupedally, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, plantigrade feet, and laterally undulating the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured <b>a</b> <b>clumsy,</b> kangaroo-like hopping, {{a change of heart}} for which he was mocked by German zoologist Gustav Tornier, who interpreted the shape of the articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen lagerstätte, also favoured a reptilian posture. Müller-Stoll listed a number of characters required for an erect limb posture that Plateosaurus supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions were correct. However, most of these adaptations are actually present in Plateosaurus.|$|E

25|$|Harriman's campaign, however, {{was tied}} to the {{asserted}} innocence of the McNamaras. But the defense was in trouble: the prosecution not only had evidence of the McNamaras' complicity, but had trapped Darrow in <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> attempt to bribe one of the jurors. On December 1, 1911, {{four days before the}} final election, the McNamaras entered a plea of guilty in return for prison terms. Harriman lost badly.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} {{adaptation}} Dr. Who and the Daleks, Ian Chesterton is the boyfriend of Barbara, granddaughter of Dr. Who. Rather {{than the man}} of action from the TV series, this Ian is <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> idiot who manages to survive more through luck than any degree of competence. In Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD, the character of Ian is replaced by Tom Campbell, who performs much the same role as Ian in The Dalek Invasion of Earth.|$|E
25|$|Reading {{finished}} October with a {{home game}} against Newcastle United. Reading took the lead courtesy of a 53rd minute Dave Kitson goal but <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> Michael Duberry own goal in the 76th minute looked to have rescued a point for the Magpies, however a moment of tactical brilliance by Steve Coppell resulted in the winning goal. Shane Long was brought on in the 84th minute to promptly score the winning goal on his second touch of the ball.|$|E

25|$|Britannica by the 6th edition {{was in some}} regards hopelessly out of date. The {{supplement}} to the 3rd edition contained updates which {{were not included in}} it, and which had become dated themselves anyway, the 4th edition expanded the text somewhat but revised very little, and the 5th and 6th were just reprints of the 4th. The {{supplement to}} the 4th/5th/6th edition addressed the issue of updates in <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> way, often referring back to the encyclopedia, essentially making the reader look everything up twice. What was needed was a completely new edition from the ground up. This was to be accomplished with the magnificent 7th edition.|$|E
25|$|These {{developments}} led to 13 {{states and}} territories passing cousin marriage prohibitions by the 1880s. Though contemporaneous, the eugenics movement {{did not play}} much of a direct role in the bans. George Louis Arner in 1908 considered the ban <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> and ineffective method of eugenics, which he thought would eventually be replaced by more refined techniques. By the 1920s, the number of bans had doubled. Since that time, Kentucky (1943), Maine (1985) , and Texas (2005) have also banned cousin marriage. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws unanimously recommended in 1970 that all such laws should be repealed, but no state has dropped its prohibition.|$|E
25|$|Rebecca Sharp ("Becky") is a strong-willed, cunning, moneyless, {{young woman}} {{determined}} to make her way in society. After leaving school, Becky stays with Amelia Sedley ("Emmy"), who is a good-natured, simple-minded, young girl, of a wealthy London family. There, Becky meets the dashing and self-obsessed Captain George Osborne (Amelia's betrothed) and Amelia's brother Joseph ("Jos") Sedley, <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> and vainglorious but rich civil servant home from the East India Company. Hoping to marry Sedley, the richest young man she has met, Becky entices him, but she fails. George Osborne's friend Captain William Dobbin loves Amelia, but only wishes her happiness, which is centred on George.|$|E

25|$|The ceiling {{resembles the}} general {{form of the}} {{original}} but is a reconstruction from numerous repairs, particularly in 1928 and 1939. It is a compass ceiling with two tie beams. The 1706 ceiling was of “hand-riven oak” laid on rafters and collar beams. It {{has been replaced by}} a clapboard ceiling matching the general features of the north wing. The tie beams, that are marked with a lamb’s tongue and chamfer, are original while the roof trusses were replaced in the 1820s. The beam farthest north bears the figures “iiii” and the beam farthest south is <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> insertion. The porch trusses may be original. A new shingle roof was installed in 1954.|$|E
25|$|The union hired Clarence Darrow {{to defend}} the McNamaras. Darrow, however, {{concluded}} that the brothers faced a strong chance of receiving {{the death penalty for}} the crime; he therefore made <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> attempt, in broad daylight in downtown Los Angeles, to bribe one of the jurors. As it turned out, it was a trap and Darrow was arrested. Now more desperate than ever, he persuaded the McNamaras to plead guilty on the basis of an unwritten plea bargain that would have freed John. Once they pleaded guilty, however, the authorities denied that they had any deal at all. John McNamara served nearly ten years, while his brother spent his remaining years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Quadros {{resigned}} in 1961, {{the same year}} of his inauguration, in <b>a</b> <b>clumsy</b> political maneuver to increase his popularity. According to the constitution then in force, enacted in 1946, Goulart should have automatically replaced Quadros as president, but {{he was on a}} diplomatic trip to the People's Republic of China. A moderate nationalist, Goulart was accused of being a communist by right-wing militants, and was unable to take office. After a long negotiation, led mainly by Tancredo Neves, Goulart's supporters and the right-wing reached an agreement under which the parliamentary system would replace the presidential system in the country, where Goulart would be named head of state, and Neves would be named Prime Minister.|$|E
