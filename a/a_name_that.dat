5|$|Constantine the Great {{effectively}} {{became the}} emperor {{of the whole}} of the Roman Empire in September 324. Two months later, he laid out the plans for a new, Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the eastern capital of the empire, the city was named Nova Roma; most called it Constantinople, <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> persisted into the 20th century. On 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the Roman Empire, which was later permanently divided between the two sons of Theodosius I upon his death on 17 January 395, when the city became the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.|$|E

5|$|Dreyer {{returned}} to France to begin casting and location scouting. At {{the time in}} France, {{there was a small}} movement of artistic independently financed films, including Luis Buñuel's L'Âge d'Or and Jean Cocteau's The Blood of a Poet which were both released in 1930. Through Valentine Hugo, Dreyer met Nicolas de Gunzburg, an aristocrat who agreed to finance Dreyer's next film in return for playing the lead role in it. Gunzberg had arguments with his family about becoming an actor, so he created the pseudonym Julian West, <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> would be the same in all three languages that the film was going to be shot in.|$|E

Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name F. maxima for that species in the 1960 Flora of Panama.

5|$|Susie Bootja Bootja {{was born}} circa 1935 near Kurtal, or Helena Spring, {{south-west}} of Balgo, Western Australia; {{the country is}} called Kaningarra in her own language, <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> appears {{as the title of}} one of her art works. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. While sources vary as to Susie's skin name (some indicating Napangarti, others Napaltjarri), the similar birth dates, locations, and work history indicate that all are referring to the one individual.|$|E
5|$|B.spinulosa var.spinulosa: The {{nominate}} race is an autonym, <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> was automatically {{created for}} the original material of the species as the other subspecies were described. The original hairpin banksia, this plant is coastal in Queensland, seen in such places as Walshs Pyramid (near Cairns), Byfield National Park and the Blackdown Tableland, then again in New South Wales south of the Hawkesbury River, just north of Sydney, down the New South Wales South Coast and into Victoria. Northwards of the Hawkesbury River on Sydney's northern outskirts there is a gradation between this and B.spinulosa var.collina. It commonly has black, maroon or claret styles on gold spikes but all-gold inflorescences are seen, and leaves are generally narrower than other varieties at 1–2mm in width and have several serrations toward the apex only.|$|E

5|$|Later on August3, the JTWC issued {{their first}} {{advisory}} on the storm, classifying it as Tropical Depression 14W. Located {{to the west}} of a mid-level ridge, the depression was steered towards the north. Early the next day, the JTWC upgraded 14W to a tropical storm; the JMA later upgraded it to a tropical storm around 1200UTC. At that time, the storm received the name Meranti, <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> was contributed by Cambodia. Little intensification took place until August5, at which time convection became increasingly organized and underwent a brief period of rapid intensification. By 1200UTC, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded Meranti to a typhoon. Several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity; the JMA assessed it to have had winds of 140km/h (85mph 10-minute winds) while the JTWC assessed it to have attained Category 2 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 165km/h (105mph).|$|E
5|$|Starscream, {{having been}} humiliated {{at the hands}} of Megatron, infiltrates Shockwave's towers and sabotages his lab equipment. In the lab he finds Grimlock being held prisoner. He offers Grimlock freedom in {{exchange}} for his fealty, but Grimlock escapes by grabbing and throwing Starscream into the restraint controls, killing him. He reunites with his teammates Swoop, Slug, and Snarl; then proceeds to kill the defending Insecticons and the swarm leaders named Hardshell, Kickback and Sharpshot. Grimlock learns from Shockwave that their processors were tampered with, leaving Grimlock with a speech impairment. By way of his Space Bridge, Shockwave also found a new planet inhabited by large creatures; these were used to inspire all of their new alternate forms. Grimlock was further modified, and now cannot transform on command, but must be in a state of rage to do so. He recalls <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> Sharpshot gave them, the Dinobots, and claims it as their new team name. Then he notices another Space Bridge tower that Shockwave has constructed nearby. Grimlock fights his way to Shockwave, biting his left arm off and rigging the tower to explode. The crumbling tower falls, killing Grimlock and Shockwave in the process and the portal in Cybertron's orbit begins to decay as the remaining three Dinobots watch in horror.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a number of {{implants}} made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (<b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.|$|E

5|$|Medieval: Total War was {{originally}} announced by The Creative Assembly on 3 August 2001, with the working title of Crusader: Total War. Development {{of the game}} started shortly {{after the release of}} Shogun: Total War. Early in development it was decided to change the name to Medieval: Total War; this was to have <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> better reflected the scope of the game. In a press release, The Creative Assembly announced that the game would be published by Activision instead of Electronic Arts, the publisher of the previous games. The Creative Assembly also outlined the features of the game, including the game covering the medieval era from the 11th to 15th century, with players being able to participate in various historical scenarios of the time, such as the Hundred Years' War. Media releases over the subsequent months gave screenshots of the game, with more information on Medieval: Total War's features. The game uses an updated version of the game engine used in , allowing larger battles than previously possible with an increased troop limit of ten thousand. The improved game engine also allowed more battle maps than previously possible, now based upon where the conflicting armies are located on the strategy map. Other new battlefield enhancements included terrain detailed with villages and vegetation and improved castle siege mechanics, with players now having to focus on destroying the walls before assaulting and capturing the castle. The game features improved artificial intelligence from Shogun: Total War, with the individual unit AI and the tactical AI—which controls the overall army tactics—separated to more effectively control the opposing forces.|$|E
