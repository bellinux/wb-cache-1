Other sounds are defined {{by the way the}} tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{rotating}} {{winds of}} a tropical cyclone {{are a result}} of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator. Tropical cyclones are also almost completely absent from Earth’s southwestern quartersphere, mainly because the shapes of the African and South American continents permit the Benguela and Humboldt Currents to cover ocean basins as far north as 5˚N with excessively cool water. These powerful cold currents also produce much stronger vertical wind shear in the South Atlantic and Southeast Pacific, which typically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing into cyclones and prevent even the waters of the Brazil Current from being so hot as analogous western boundary currents or ocean gyres. Also, the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, along with the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool, are feature of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia.|$|E

40|$|During the {{amorphous}} ribbon production process, {{the mechanisms}} that cause uneven thickness and herringbone on two {{surfaces of the}} ribbon are very complicated. The high velocity rotating roller causes periodic air eddies near the surface and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> around the contact zone. The <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> might be the major reason that causes the non-uniformity thickness and the ripples. In this paper, a two-dimension model was developed to simulate the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> eddies and a three-dimensional simulation was performed for the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> field around the puddle zone. Simulation {{results show that the}} higher velocity of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> around the puddle edges is closely related to thicker ribbon rim. The continuous air eddies along the roller surface and the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuations along the roller width are the major reasons causing non-uniform convective heat transfer during ribbon solidification. The frequency of air eddy matches well with the nominal ripple frequency along the ribbon length, and the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuation coincides with the herringbone wavelength along the ribbon width.

40|$|The {{flat plate}} {{collector}} was produced for grain drying application. The performance {{tests were conducted}} with three type of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> using various <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. 1) Collector efficiency increases as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates increase. Among three types of <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> the order of efficiency is first, the reversed flow type, follwed by two-way flow type and the upper flow type. 2) The air temperature rise decrease as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates increase. Especially in the reversed <b>flow</b> type, <b>air</b> temperature rise beyond 15 ℃ is attained when he average solar radiation is 1. 2 cal/cm²min. Thus, {{the results indicate that}} the reversed flow type offers the best performance of the three types of <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b> (2) The mathematical model of the solar collector was developed as one part of solar grain drying simulation. Simulation results for the temperatures of the absorbing plate,the cover and the air showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data. It was demonstrated that this model was reasonably valid for simulation studies of rise drying. (3) Then, the simulation model was used to predict collector performance. The results were as follows: 1) Temperatures of the absorbing plate rise with an increase in the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates and with a decrease in the collector area. 2) Air temperature is raised as <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates decrease and the collector area increases. 3) Collector efficiency increases with an increase in <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. These conclusions agree well with the experimental results, showing that this model can be also used for the prediction of collector performance. (4) Simulation results showed the expression of the relationship between <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate and the energy collected to the each collection area. Thus, if <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate and collection area are assumed, energy collection can be calculated. Then, the relationship of energy collected and the collection area to <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates are shown in eqs. (21),(22).
