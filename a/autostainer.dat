40|$|INTRODUCTION: Among {{the several}} agents {{targeting}} the {{programmed cell death}} 1 (PD- 1) pathway, pembrolizumab is currently the only one approved {{for the treatment of}} patients with NSCLC in association with a companion diagnostic assay, the anti-PD-L 1 immunohistochemical (IHC) 22 C 3 PharmDx (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using the Dako <b>Autostainer</b> (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). However, the Dako platform is not present in each pathology department, and this technical limitation is a major problem for the diffusion of the PD-L 1 IHC predictive test for pembrolizumab. METHODS: The Italian Society of Anatomic Pathology and Cytopathology and the Italian Association of Medical Oncology in an independent, multicenter study compared the in vitro diagnostics PD-L 1 IHC 22 C 3 pharmDx test (Agilent) on the Dako <b>Autostainer</b> and the in vitro diagnostics Ventana PD-L 1 (SP 263) test on the Ventana BenchMark platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ).

30|$|To qualitatively {{measure the}} {{distribution}} of the GNPs as well as to provide a measure of MLC growth characteristics, MLC inserts were frozen in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound for sectioning. The frozen MLCs were then sectioned (Cryostat CM 1900; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) into 10 – 20 -µm-thick sections and placed onto slides for imaging. Tissue sections were stained with eosin to show the presence of ECM (<b>Autostainer</b> XL; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Stained tissue sections were imaged using the CytoViva HSI dark-field microscope. By examining the images acquired by HSI, a qualitative examination of the layer-by-layer penetration was deduced.|$|E
40|$|Two commercially {{available}} automated immunohistochemistry platforms, Ventana NexES and DakoCytomation <b>Autostainer</b> Universal Staining System, were compared for diagnosing sheep scrapie and cervid chronic wasting disease. Both automated platforms {{used the same}} antiprion protein monoclonal primary antibodies, but different platform-specific linker and amplification reagents and procedures. Duplicate sections of brainstem (at {{the level of the}} obex) and lymphoid tissue (retropharyngeal lymph node or tonsil) from the same tissue block were immunostained for the comparison. Examination of 1, 020 tissues from 796 sheep revealed 100 % concordance of results between the Ventana NexES and DakoCytomation platforms for diagnosing sheep scrapie from lymphoid tissue (103 / 103 positive; 405 / 405 negative) and brainstem (120 / 120 positive; 392 / 392 negative). Similarly, examination of 1, 008 tissues from 504 white-tailed deer revealed 100 % concordance between the Ventana NexES and DakoCytomation platforms for diagnosing chronic wasting disease from lymphoid tissue (104 / 104 positive; 400 / 400 negative) and brainstem (104 / 104 positive; 400 / 400 negative).

Primary antibodies to chromogranin A (MAB 319; Merck Millipore, Germany), synaptophysin (Sy 38, Dako), Ki 67 (AB 9260; Merck Millipore), and BAX (B- 9; sc- 7480; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) were used.|$|E
40|$|Gender {{influence}} on survival in mesothelioma {{has been observed}} in several large clinical series. However, this gender effect has not been investigated. Female patients often have less aggressive tumors and survive longer. However, few studies in the literature have explained the molecular basis of this finding. Understanding this difference at a molecular level may offer the hope of improving survival via hormonal manipulation. We investigate the expression of Ki- 67 and sex steroid receptors; estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) and androgen receptors (AR) to elucidate any pathognomonic difference that characterize this gender difference. Positive expression of markers was observed in 95 % (Ki- 67), 80 % (ER), 100 % (PR) and 65 % (AR) of patients. Expression of markers between gender showed a higher Ki- 67 in males (M= 1. 3 %, F= 0. 6 %), higher estrogen receptor in females (M= 0. 6 %, F= 1. 7 %) and higher progesterone receptor in females (M= 1. 0 %, F= 1. 4 %). Twenty patients were treated with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in our peritonectomy unit. Paraffin sections of the tumor specimens were retrieved for immunohistochemical analysis. The immunostaining was performed using monoclonal mouse anti-human antibodies on an <b>autostainer</b> (<b>Autostainer</b> Plus; Dako, Inc.). The intensity of the stains were quantified using the Image-Pro Plus (IPP) 4. 5 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).

40|$|For non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC), {{treatment}} with pembrolizumab {{is limited to}} patients with tumours expressing PD-L 1 assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the PD-L 1 IHC 22 C 3 pharmDx (Dako, Inc.) companion diagnostic test, on the Dako <b>Autostainer</b> Link 48 (ASL 48) platform. Optimised protocols are urgently needed for use of the 22 C 3 antibody concentrate to test PD-L 1 expression on more widely available IHC autostainers. We evaluated PD-L 1 expression using the 22 C 3 antibody concentrate in the three main commercially available autostainers Dako ASL 48, BenchMark ULTRA (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.), and Bond-III (Leica Biosystems) and compared the staining results with the PD-L 1 IHC 22 C 3 pharmDx kit on the Dako ASL 48 platform. Several technical conditions for laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) were evaluated in tonsil specimens and a training set of three NSCLC samples. Optimised protocols were then validated in 120 NSCLC specimens. Optimised protocols were obtained on both the VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA and Dako ASL 48 platforms. Significant expression of PD-L 1 was obtained on tissue controls with the Leica Bond-III <b>autostainer</b> when high concentrations of the 22 C 3 antibody were used. It therefore was not tested on the 120 NSCLC specimens. An almost 100 % concordance rate for dichotomized tumour proportion score (TPS) results was observed between TPS ratings using the 22 C 3 antibody concentrate on the Dako ASL 48 and VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA platforms relative to the PD-L 1 IHC 22 C 3 pharmDx kit on the Dako ASL 48 platform. Interpathologist agreement was high on both LDTs and the PD-L 1 IHC 22 C 3 pharmDx kit on the Dako ASL 48 platform. Availability of standardized protocols for determining PD-L 1 expression using the 22 C 3 antibody concentrate on the widely available Dako ASL 48 and VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA IHC platforms will expand the number of laboratories able to determine eligibility of patients with NSCLC for treatment with pembrolizumab in a reliable and concordant manner...|$|E
30|$|The epitope {{retrieval}} {{procedure for}} commercial antibodies was performed {{as described by}} the manufacturer. For TS 1, we performed heat-induced epitope retrieval in 10 mM Tris/ 10 mM EDTA-buffer, pH 9.0. For immunohistochemical staining, we used 5 μg/ml TS 1 and the dilution recommended by the manufacturers for the commercial antibodies. A minimum of one section from three to five tumours from each group was analysed immunohistochemically with TS 1, anti-Ki 67, anti-Bcl- 2. Sections were also analysed with each antibody, as follows: anti-somatostatin receptor subtype 2 antibody, one to three sections from each group; anti-human-p 53, three sections to confirm negativity; anti-human CD 133 / 1, one to two sections from each group; anti-human TTF- 1, three sections to confirm negativity; anti-synaptophysin, five sections; and anti-chromogranin-A, five sections. Appropriate positive controls were used for all antibodies. The immunohistochemistry was performed with the standard method of horseradish peroxidise and diamonobenzidine (DAB) in a Dako <b>autostainer</b> with the EnVision standard reagents. After the immunostaining, the nuclei were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted.|$|E
30|$|IHC was {{performed}} on TMAs using the Dako <b>autostainer</b> from the clinical immunohistochemistry laboratory at the Johns Hopkins Hospitals. Sections of TMAs were cut at 4 microns thickness and deparaffinized prior to incubation with primary antibodies. Heat antigen retrieval at 70 °C for 40 minutes was also used to enhance signal detection. Primary antibodies were diluted according to standard protocols and manufacturer suggestions. A mouse monoclonal antibody against human SALL 4 (clone 6 e 3, 1 : 400 dilution, SIGMA, St Louis, MO), and a mouse polyclonal antibody against human OCT 4 (clone C- 2, 1 : 200 dilution, ABCAM, Cambridge, MA) were used. IHC of nuclei was scored based on the intensity and percentage of stains using a semi-quantitatively three tiered scale: 0 = negative, 1 = focally and weakly positive (< 20 %), and 2 = positive (> 20 %). The IHC stains on TMAs were scored by ER, MHA and QKL. If there was a disagreement, the consensus was reached by discussion of the case among reviewers.

40|$|Inflammatory breast {{carcinoma}} (IBC) {{is a rare}} but aggressive tumour {{associated with}} poor outcome owing to early metastases. Increased expression of c-Met protein correlates with reduced survival and high metastatic risk in human cancers including breast carcinomas and is targetable by specific drugs, that could potentially improve the prognosis. In the present study, we compared c-Met expression in IBC (n= 41) and non-IBC (n= 480) immunohistochemically (Ventana Benchmark <b>autostainer)</b> in two tissue microarrays (TMA) along with PI 3 K and E-cadherin. The results were quantified through an automated image analysis device (SAMBA Technologies). We observed that (i) c-Met was significantly overexpressed in IBC as compared with non-IBC (P< 0. 001), (ii) PI 3 K was overexpressed (P< 0. 001) in IBC, suggesting that the overexpressed c-Met is functionally active {{at least through the}} PI 3 K signal transduction pathway; and (iii) E-cadherin was paradoxically also overexpressed in IBC. We concluded that overexpressed c-Met in IBC constitutes a potential target for specific therapy for the management of patients with poor-outcome tumours such as IBC.

40|$|Background: The {{role played}} by {{cytology}} in primary diagnosis is undeniable. With improved management protocols and targeted therapy, the need for accurate diagnosis has become mandatory. Immunochemistry and molecular techniques are increasingly being used on limited tissue samples. Aims: This {{study was conducted to}} find out the impact of immunocytochemistry (ICC) on cytology material in cytology practice. Materials and Methods: Immunochemistry was done on alcohol-fixed smears and cell-block preparations. It was done with i 6000 BioGenex <b>autostainer</b> using BioGenex reagents. Results: A total of 148 cases occurring over a period of 3 years (September 2010 -June 2013) were analyzed. Staining was done on cytology smears in 77 cases and on cell-block sections in 71 cases. ICC helped in diagnosis in 8 cases, confirmed the diagnosis in 26 cases, helped in subtyping in 60 cases, and helped in prognostication in 6 cases. ICC has altered the diagnosis in two cases. It was noncontributory in 43 cases, and the material was inadequate in three cases. Conclusion: In 102 cases (69 %), ICC proved to be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis and prognostication; hence, its use is recommended in practice to aid in cytology services...|$|E
40|$|Carcinomas of {{an unknown}} primary site (CUP) are {{heterogeneous}} tumours with a median survival of only 8 months. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are promising new drugs. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the expression of EGF-receptor, Her- 2 /neu, and c-Kit tyrosine kinases in CUP. Paraffin-embedded specimens were obtained from 54 patients with a CUP who were included in the GEFCAPI 01 randomised phase II trial. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the Dako <b>autostainer</b> with antibodies directed against HER- 2 /neu protein, EGFR protein, and c-Kit protein (CD 117). EGFR expression was found in 36 out of 54 samples (66 %). In contrast, Her- 2 /neu overexpression and c-Kit positivity were only detected in 4 and 10 % of patients, respectively. No significant association was found between the expression of the tyrosine kinase receptors and prognosis. EGFR expression was significantly associated with response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy: the response rates were 50 and 22 % in patients with EGFR-positive tumours and EGFR-negative tumours, respectively (P< 0. 05). This study shows that EGFR is frequently expressed in CUP. This finding may prompt clinical trials investigating EGFR inhibitors in this setting. In contrast, c-Kit expression and Her- 2 /neu overexpression occur infrequently in CUP. EGFR expression was correlated to tumour chemosensitivity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{interfacial}} membrane between {{bone and}} implant {{has been shown}} to be a key tissue in the process of aseptic loosening of total hip arthroplasty. The cells within the interfacial membrane produce numerous inflammatory mediators which, through complex mechanisms, cause periprosthetic osteolysis and aseptic loosening. Both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor α (TGFα) have similar biological functions. They have been found to stimulate bone resorption.  OBJECTIVE—To investigate the presence, cellular localisation, and extent of expression of EGF and TGFα in interfacial membrane retrieved from revision total hip arthroplasty and compare it with that in synovial membrane from primary total hip arthroplasty.  METHODS—Ten interfacial membranes and 10  synovial membranes were stained with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for EGF and TGFα. The staining process was done using the Lab Vision <b>Autostainer.</b> The results were measured by a semiautomatic VIDAS image analysis system.  RESULTS—Immunoreactivity for both EGF and TGFα was found in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, macrophages, and fibroblasts, both in interfacial membranes and synovial membranes. However, the number of EGF (980  (370)) and TGFα (1070  (360)) positive cells per mm 2 was greater in interfacial membranes than in the synovial membranes (220  (200), 270  (100); p< 0. 01).  CONCLUSION—It is suggested that owing to their increased expression in interfacial membrane, EGF and TGFα may have an important pathogenetic role in stimulating periprosthetic bone resorption in aseptic loosening of total hip arthroplasty. ...|$|E

Cells were spun down at 300 g for 5  min. The pellet was fixated with 1  ml 4.5  % formalin for 1  min through resuspension. After another centrifugation, the formalin was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200  μl liquid 3  % agarose gel. The gel pellets were dried overnight at room temperature, then the hardened gel cones {{were removed from the}} cups and cut lengthwise. These gels cones were put into tissue capsules for the pre-treatment and following paraffin embedding. Paraffin blocks were cut at 3  μm for immunohistochemistry. Sections were stained using a Dako <b>autostainer</b> with the Dako EnVision™ FLEX+ detection system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The system detects primary mouse and rabbit antibodies, and the reaction was visualised by EnVision™ FLEX DAB+ Chromogen. Using EnVision™ FLEX+ Mouse (LINKER) or EnVision™ FLEX+ Rabbit (LINKER) (Code K 8019), signal amplification of primary antibodies can be achieved.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the degree of interlaboratory agreement when HER- 2 /neu was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on archival primary breast cancer samples. IHC for HER- 2 /neu {{was performed on the}} same archival tissue sections from 394 invasive primary breast cancers in two different laboratories. Both laboratories used the primary antibody NCL-CB 11; however, different methods of immunostaining (antigen retrieval procedure and manual processing or no antigen retrieval and <b>autostainer</b> processing) as well as different scoring systems were used. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), considered as the correlation method for HER- 2 /neu status determination, was performed using the PathVysion kit and compared to the IHC results. Forty-eight of 394 analyzed tumors (12. 2 %) were scored as HER- 2 /neu positive in one laboratory, and 109 (27. 7 %) in the other laboratory where antigen retrieval was performed. Complete concordance in categorization of HER- 2 /neu status between the two laboratories was achieved in 333 of 394 cases (84. 5 %). FISH performed in 248 formalin-fixed samples revealed HER- 2 /neu gene amplification in 55 / 248 (22. 2 %). Concordance of FISH and IHC was found in 211 / 248 cases (85. 1 %) and 220 / 248 cases (88. 7 %) when the CB 11 antibody was used without and with antigen retrieval, respectively. Both IHC methods generated similar rates of false results, but with different positive predictive values.

40|$|Abstract Background Human β-defensins (hBD) are {{antimicrobial}} peptides {{that are}} an integral part of bone innate immunity. Recently, it could be shown that expression of hBD- 1, - 2 and - 3 were upregulated in cases of osteomyelitis of the jaws. In order to gain insight into the possible impairment of hBD metabolism in bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaws (BONJ), the present exploratory study was designed so as to determine the qualitative and quantitative expression of afore mentioned hBDs in BONJ and infected osteoradionecrosis (ORN), both of which represent inflammatory bone diseases. Methods Bone samples were collected from patients with BONJ (n = 20) and ORN (n = 20). Non-infected healthy bone samples (n = 20) were included as controls. Immunohistological staining in an <b>autostainer</b> was carried out by the (Strept-ABC) -method against hBD- 1,- 2,- 3. Specific positive vs. negative cell reaction of osteocytes (labeling index) near the border of bony resection was determined and counted for quantitative analysis. Number of vital osteocytes vs. empty osteocytes lacunae was compared between groups. Results hBD- 1,- 2 and - 3 could be detected in BONJ as well as ORN and healthy bone samples. Immunoreactivity against hBD- 2 and - 3 was significantly higher in BONJ than in ORN and healthy jaw bone samples. Number of empty osteocyte lacunae was significantly higher in ORN compared with BONJ (P = 0. 001). Conclusion Under the condition of BONJ an increased expression of hBD- 1,- 2,- 3 is detectable, similarly to the recently described upregulation of defensins in chronically infected jaw bones. It remains still unclear how these findings may relate to the pathoetiology of these diseases and whether this is contributing to the development of BONJ and ORN or simply an after effect of the disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Insulin-like {{growth factors}} (IGFs) {{are known to}} play {{important}} roles in cancer biology, prompting evaluation of drugs targeting type 1 IGF receptor (IGF- 1 R). However, there is considerable lack of consensus in immunohistochemical (IHC) studies of IGF- 1 R in human tumors, confounding attempts to assess the predictive and prognostic significance of IGF- 1 R expression and subcellular localization. Likely sources of variation include use of different IGF- 1 R polyclonal antibodies and methods for IHC. Here, we aimed to develop a robust IGF- 1 R IHC protocol using a monoclonal antibody, suitable for use in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Methods Using controls including samples of FFPE tissues and tumor cells of defined IGF- 1 R expression, we used IHC and western blotting to compare polyclonal antibody # 3027 with monoclonals # 9750 and # 14534 (Cell Signaling Technology). Results Compared with # 3027, the monoclonals exhibited superior discrimination between IGF- 1 R-high and IGF- 1 R-deficient cells in manual IHC, signal generated by # 9750 reflecting differences in IGF- 1 R expression detected by western blotting. In tissues, IGF- 1 R detected by # 14534 was predominantly plasma membrane-associated, while # 9750 detected IGF- 1 R in the plasma membranes, cytoplasm and nucleus of prostate and renal cancers, recapitulating appearances we described using previous lots of # 3027, and reflecting subcellular localizations reported using other techniques. Use of # 9750 and # 14534 in an <b>autostainer</b> showed adequate differentiation of high vs low IGF- 1 R cells, but did not recapitulate appearances of manually-stained tissues. We provide a detailed protocol for the preferred manual method using # 9750. Conclusion Standardization of IGF- 1 R IHC will promote {{understanding of the role}} of IGF- 1 R in tumor biology, and its potential as a candidate prognostic and predictive biomarker. </p...|$|E

PD-L 1 has been investigated as a potential biomarker to predict clinical response to nivolumab in clinical settings. We report an automated PD-L 1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as-say, which was developed to detect cell surface PD-L 1 in for-malin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tumor tissue specimens using Dako’s <b>Autostainer</b> Link 48. The primary antibody for this assay is a rabbit monoclonal anti-human PD-L 1 antibody, clone 28 - 8. The specificity of 28 - 8 for PD-L 1 was demonstrated by antigen competition and genetic deletion of PD-L 1 in tumor cell lines. The specificity of the PD-L 1 IHC assay was further evaluated {{in a collection of}} 30 normal human tissues. The PD-L 1 IHC assay was optimized for high sensitivity and precision in routine application. A pathology scoring and interpretation method specific to nivolumab clinical studies was adopted for the assay. The analytical performance of the assay was validated for application in the determination of PD-L 1 status in human NSCLC specimens. The clinical application of the assay and scoring method was further validated in 3 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certified labs. The assay is currently being investigated in a variety of clinical studies for use as an in vitro diagnostic to select and stratify patients for treatment with the anti-PD- 1 therapeutic antibody, nivolumab.

40|$|Background: Protocols for immunocytochemical {{staining}} (ICC) and {{in situ hybridization}} (ISH) of air-dried Diff-Quick or May-Grünwald Giemsa (MGG) -stained smears {{have been}} difficult to establish. An increasing {{need to be able to}} use prestained slides for ICC and ISH in specific cases led to this study, aiming at finding a robust protocol for both methods. Materials and Methods: The material consisted of MGG- and Diff-Quick-stained smears. After diagnosis, one to two diagnostic smears were stored in the department. Any additional smear(s) containing diagnostic material were used for this study. The majority were fine needle aspirates (FNAC) from the breast, comprising materials from fibroadenomas, fibrocystic disease, and carcinomas. A few were metastatic lesions (carcinomas and malignant melanomas). There were 64 prestained smears. Ten smears were Diff-Quick stained, and 54 were MGG stained. The antibodies used for testing ICC were Ki- 67, ER, and PgR, CK MNF 116 (pancytokeratin) and E-cadherin. HER- 2 Dual SISH was used to test ISH. Citrate, TRS, and TE buffers at pH 6 and pH 9 were tested, as well as, different heating times, microwave powers and antibody concentrations. The ICC was done on the Dako <b>Autostainer</b> (Dako®, Glostrup, Denmark), and HER- 2 Dual SISH was done on the Ventana XT-machine (Ventana / Roche®, Strasbourg, France). Results: Optimal results were obtained with the TE buffer at pH 9, for both ICC and ISH. Antibody concentrations generally had to be higher than in the immunohistochemistry (IHC). The optimal microwave heat treatment included an initial high power boiling followed by low power boiling. No post fixation was necessary for ICC, whereas, 20 minutes post fixation in formalin (4 %) was necessary for ISH. Conclusions: Microwave heat treatment, with initial boiling at high power followed by boiling at low power and TE buffer at pH 9 were the key steps in the procedure. Antibody concentrations has to be adapted for each ICC marker. Post fixation in formalin is necessary for ISH...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background TOP 2 A encodes for topoisomerase IIα, {{a nuclear}} enzyme that {{controls}} DNA topological structure and cell cycle progression. This enzyme is {{a marker of}} cell proliferation in normal and neoplastic tissues; however, little information is available about its expression in prostate cancer (PCa). Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was automated using mouse monoclonal antibody against TOP 2 A (clone SWT 3 D 1; DAKO, Carpenteria, CA, USA) at dilution 1 : 800 and Flex Plus detection system in <b>autostainer</b> 48 Ultra (DAKO). FISH was performed using TOP 2 A (17 q 21) / CEP 17 probe kit (Kreateck Biotechnology, San Diego, CA, USA). Biochemical and pathological data from 193 patients with PCa were retrieved for the analysis, whose significance was considered when p[*] Results TOP 2 A protein expression correlated with higher Gleason scores {{and higher levels of}} preoperative PSA (p [*]=[*] 0. 018 and p [*]=[*] 0. 011). Patients with higher levels of TOP 2 A presented shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) (p [*]=[*] 0. 001). In multivariate analysis, we found that TOP 2 A remained an independent prognostic factor of BRFS, with a relative risk of 1. 98 (p [*]=[*] 0. 001; 95 % CI, 1. 338 – 2. 93); thus, cases that expressed high levels of this enzyme had a shorter BRFS compared with TOP 2 A-negative or TOP 2 A-low cases. No alterations in TOP 2 A gene status nor correlation between FISH and IHC results were observed. Concerning fractal analysis, patients who expressed higher levels of TOP 2 A have angiolymphatic invasion and presented higher Gleason scores (p [*]=[*] 0. 033 and p [*]=[*] 0. 025, respectively). Also, patients with higher expression of TOP 2 A presented shorter BRFS (p [*]=[*] 0. 001). Conclusions This is the first study to perform TOP 2 A protein and gene digital assessment and fractal analysis in association with BRFS in a large series of PCa. Also, we show that TOP 2 A gene copy number alterations are not observed in this type of tumor. So, higher protein expression of TOP 2 A is not related to gene amplification in PCa. Furthermore, TOP 2 A protein assessment has prognostic importance and, due to its relation with poor outcome, TOP 2 A IHC evaluation in the biopsy can represent an important tool for selecting the most suitable surgical and clinical approach for patients with PCa. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background:Uterine {{papillary}} serous carcinoma (UPSC), {{also known}} as type II endometrial carcinoma, is an uncommon aggressive variant of endometrial carcinoma [1, 2]. Its tumorigenesis, {{as well as its}} clinical risk factors differ from the commonly occurring endometrioid carcinoma (EC) [3 - 5]. Typical pathologic factors also differ. Even with minimal myometrial invasion, lymph-vascular space invasion or tumor limited to polyps, UPSC {{has been found to be}} associated with widespread metastasis, recurrence, and poor survival [6]. Since UPSC may be difficult to differentiate from high grade endometrioid carcinoma, particularly in mixed carcinomas, immunohistochemical techniques may facilitate such diagnoses, and even potentially serve as prognostic factors. Three novel proteins, L 523 S ({{also known as}} KOC-K homology domain containing protein over expressed in cancer), an oncofetal RNA-binding protein; O 8 E (also known as CRxA- 01), a novel protein involved in T-cell regulation; and WT 1 (Wilm 2 ̆ 7 s Tumor) a tumor suppressor gene, have shown positive expression in various cancers [7 - 13]. Their expression and prognostic implication in UPSC is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate L 523 S, O 8 E and WT 1 expression in UPSC and EC. To correlate clinical-pathologic factors to these staining patterns. Methods: A search of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center database was performed for UPSC from 1998 to 2003, and for EC from 2002 - 03. The UPSC group consisted of 31 patients, and EC group of 63 patients. All cases were reviewed by the authors EK and BX. A tissue block containing the best representation of UPSC and EC was selected for each case, and stained for L 523 S, O 8 E, and WT 1, on a Dako <b>autostainer,</b> per protocol [13]. Histologic scoring of all stains were conducted by one examiner, EK. A retrospective chart review of each patient was performed to extract clinical and pathologic variables. Staining outcomes were tested using a Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Exact test, with significance level determined at α= 0. 05. Demographic variables of normal distribution were tested using a heteroscedastic T-test (2 -tail, α= 0. 05). Results: Significant differences were found for age (p= 0. 004) and BMI (p= 0. 016) between UPSC and EC. Racial distribution, gravidity, and parity were similar. EC patients had greater use of hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptives, and cigarette smoking. They also had greater occurrence of diabetes (38. 33...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic {{adenocarcinoma}} comprises 85 % of {{all cases}} of pancreatic malignancies. From a diagnostic standpoint, these tumors are readily diagnosed by fine needle aspiration, with an accuracy of greater than 90 %; however {{it is often difficult}} to ascertain whether these are primary or metastatic in nature. This study was undertaken to see the usefulness of CK 19, CA 19 - 9 and a newly described marker, SMAD 4 in confirming the pancreatic origin of these tumors. Briefly, SMAD 4 (DPC 4) is a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 18 q which has been shown to mediate the downstream effects of TGF-&# 946; superfamily signaling, resulting in growth inhibition. The loss of SMAD 4, which as been reported to occur in 55 % of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas may lead to up regulation of cell cycle proteins and hence increase cellular proliferation. In addition, SMAD 4 has been suggested to possibly have prognostic potential, with the presence of SMAD 4, indicating shorter survival after resection. Design Clinical data was reviewed to identify patients with proven, primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A total of 25 patients with diagnostic material from fine needle aspiration cell blocks, were retrieved from our files at Emory University Hospital. In addition cell blocks from clinically diagnosed non-pancreatic adenocarcinomas were also selected as controls for this study (10 cases of colonic adenocarcinoma, 10 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, 10 cases of breast ductal carcinoma and 10 cases of ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma). Formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from these were stained with SMAD 4, CK 19, and CA 19 - 9, using pressure cooker antigen retrieval, labeled polymer HRP (DAKO), and the DAKO <b>autostainer.</b> Results Immunohistochemical staining was reviewed based on intensity (negative, low-positive, and high-positive) and percentage of cells. In primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, CK 19 showed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity in 23 of 25 cases, CA 19 - 9 showed apical cytoplasmic staining in all 25 cases, and SMAD 4 showed nuclear staining in 20 of 25 cases. In the control group comprising of non-pancreatic adenocarcinoma SMAD 4 was negative (100 %) in all 10 cases of colonic and pulmonary adenocarcinoma. However 1 of 10 cases (10 %) of breast and ovarian adenocarcinoma did show low positivity nuclear staining. However the expression of CA 19 - 9 and CK 19 was more variable in these different non-pancreatic malignancies. Conclusion Pancreatic adenocarcinoma showed positive immunohistochemical staining for SMAD 4 in 80 %, CK 19 in 100 % and CA 19 - 9 in 100 % of the selected cases. These markers, when used as a panel, may confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in fine needle aspiration samples, and help in differentiating from metastatic adenocarcinoma. This may help in determination of appropriate surgical and chemotherapeutic options. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess {{parameters}} of local cellular immunity, expression of apoptosis-controlling proteins and some other receptors in various molecular subtypes of breast cancer (BC) with different clinical course and prognosis. 100 BC patients aged 30 – 76  years (59  ±  3. 4) were recruited. Tissues of tumor and peritumoral area were homogenized by MediMachine, subset contents of T, B, NK-lymphocytes were estimated by flow cytometer FACS CantoII. Percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 19, CD 16 / 56, were counted from total amount of CD 45 + lymphocytes. Sections of paraffin-embedded blocks were studied by immunohistochemical method with polyvalent HRP-DAB detection system. Staining was performed using Thermo Scientific <b>autostainer.</b> Tumor was considered p 53 -positive when > 25 % of tumor cell nuclei were positively stained, and bcl- 2 -positive when > 25 % of cells showed specific cytoplasmic staining. Expression of E-cadherin was assessed by the number of cells with positive membrane expression of this marker, taking into account intensity of the reaction. Expression of topoisomerase 2 α and androgen receptors was assessed by the number of tumor cells with positive nuclear expression of these markers; number of stained nuclei per 100 nuclei in 3 fields of view was counted. Results: Some differences characterizing tumor cells of molecular breast cancer subtypes were found. Tumor tissue contained higher amount of T-lymphocytes than blood (85. 9  ±  2. 36 % vs 60. 1  ±  4. 5 %, P <  0. 05) predominantly CD 3 +CD 8 + cells (34. 0  ±  1. 9 % vs 20. 3  ±  5. 36 %, P <  0. 05) but lower percentage of B- and NK-cells. In tissue of peritumoral area amounts of CD 3 + and CD 3 +CD 8 + cells were also higher, while CD 19 + level was lower than in blood. In the same samples content of CD 3 +CD 4 + was lower and amount of NK-cells was higher than in tumor tissue. Triple- negative subtype was characterized by maximal content of CD 3 + lymphocytes (92. 2  ±  1. 4 %), luminal A contained the highest amount of CD 3 +CD 16 / 56 + cells (10. 6  ±  1. 73 %) vs luminal B (4. 34  ±  1. 27 %) and triple-negative (4. 13  ±  1. 63 %). Her 2 + neu BC demonstrated high amount of NK-cells in peritumoral area but not in tumor. p 53 overexpression was equally often recorded in luminal B and Her 2 + subtypes of BC and slightly less frequently in triple-negative subtype. Accumulation of p 53 was 2 times less frequently detected in luminal A subtype in comparison with triple -negative cancer and 2. 5 and 2. 7 times less frequently in comparison with luminal B and Her 2 + BC, respectively. Study of bcl- 2 expression showed reducing the frequency of positive tumor cell staining in dependence on the receptor status of tumor: positive cases were several times less frequent in triple-negative and Her 2 + subtypes in comparison with luminal A and B subtypes. Luminal A subtype was characterized by the minimal p 53, topoisomerase 2 α and androgen receptor expression and maximal expression of bcl- 2 and E-cadherin. Luminal B subtype showed a high expression of p 53, bcl- 2 and androgen receptors and moderate expression of topoisomerase 2 α and E-cadherin. High expression of topoisomerase 2 α, low expression of androgen receptors and moderate expression of E- cadherin were registered in triple-negative BC. The maximal expression of topoisomerase 2 α and p 53, as well as low expression of bcl- 2 and E-cadherin, was observed in Her 2 + subtype. Conclusions: CD 8 + T-lymphocytes dominate in tumor tissue of BC. Besides, tumor tissue of luminal A BC contains more NK-cells than other subtypes. A number of differences in expression of apoptosis-controlling proteins was observed in various molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Luminal A BC was noted for the minimal p 53 expression and maximal bcl- 2 expression. Luminal B subtype had a high p 53 and bcl- 2 expression. In Her 2 + BC p 53 expression was maximal and bcl- 2 expression was low. The described differences allow assessing molecular subtypes of breast cancer and predicting the disease course from previously unexplored perspectives...|$|E
