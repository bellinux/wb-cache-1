5|$|The primary {{theme of}} the story is the {{conflict}} between anarchism and statism, the political and ethical dimensions of which are explored through the characters' dialogue. Though the attention the story received was limited prior to the author's death in 1982, it has since seen greater circulation in Philip K. Dick story collections, and has been reviewed and <b>analyzed</b> <b>for</b> its postmodern critique of technology and its political implications.|$|E

25|$|Halysidota tessellaris, {{also called}} the banded tussock moth, {{tessellated}} halisidota, and pale tiger moth, is in Erebidae. Like many related species, it has chemical defenses it acquires from its host plants, in this case, alkaloids (Weller et al., 1999, Hristov and Conner 2005), at least in adults.

25|$|Oscilloscopes {{are used}} to observe the change of an {{electrical}} signal over time, such that voltage and time describe a shape which is continuously graphed against a calibrated scale. The observed waveform can be <b>analyzed</b> <b>for</b> such properties as amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion and others. Modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly. Originally, calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument.|$|E
25|$|Platelet {{concentration}} is measured either manually using a hemocytometer, or by placing blood in an automated platelet analyzer using electrical impedance, {{such as a}} Coulter counter. The normal range (99% of population <b>analyzed)</b> <b>for</b> platelets in healthy Caucasians is 150,000 to 450,000 per cubic millimeter (a mm3 equals a microliter). or 150–400 × 109 per liter.

The study found that while Y-DNA corresponded to West Eurasian populations, the mtDNA haplotypes were an admixture of East Asian and European origin. The geographic location of where this admixing took place is suggested to be somewhere in Southern Siberia before these people moved into the Tarim Basin. Xiaohe is the oldest archaeological site yielding human remains discovered in the Tarim Basin to date.|$|E

All of the specimens belonged to maternal clades associated with either North Africa or {{the northern and southern}} Mediterranean littoral, indicating gene flow between these areas since the Epipaleolithic. The ancient Taforalt individuals carried the mtDNA haplogroups U6, H, JT and V, which points to population continuity in the region dating from the Iberomaurusian period.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, Cassini began {{a series}} of radio {{occultation}} experiments, to measure the size-distribution of particles in Saturn's rings, and measure the atmosphere of Saturn itself. For over four months, the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose. During these experiments, it flew behind the ring plane of Saturn, as seen from Earth, and transmitted radio waves through the particles. The radio signals received on Earth were <b>analyzed,</b> <b>for</b> frequency, phase, and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings.|$|E
25|$|To {{definitively}} diagnose ovarian cancer, {{a surgical}} procedure {{to inspect the}} abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure (laparotomy, incision through the abdominal wall) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for microscopic analysis. Usually, this includes a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be <b>analyzed</b> <b>for</b> cancerous cells. If cancer is found, this procedure {{can also be used}} to determine the extent of its spread (which is a form of tumor staging).|$|E
