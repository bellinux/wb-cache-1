5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} in income inequality. While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy. And with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to <b>a</b> <b>breakup</b> of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they wanted. His younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, by threatening it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent reaction against both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise the use of violence for political ends.|$|E
5|$|Unsatisfied {{with the}} low pay, in Kremenchuk Adler led an {{unsuccessful}} actors' strike. A series of intrigues almost led to <b>a</b> <b>breakup</b> with Sonya, but ultimately led both back into Rosenberg's troupe {{and led to}} their marriage in Poltava. When this particular troupe broke up, the Adlers were among the few players to remain with Rosenberg {{to form a new}} one that included the actress who later became famous under the name of Keni Liptzin. In Chernigov, Adler turned down the opportunity to act in a Russian-language production of Boris Gudonov. Around this time Goldfaden appeared again and, after using an elaborate intrigue to demonstrate to the Adlers that Rosenberg had no loyalty to them, recruited them to his own troupe, which at the time appeared to be headed for a triumphant entry into Saint Petersburg.|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of H_β emission {{is examined}} {{at the onset}} {{and in the course}} of auroral breakup, on the basis of meridian scanning data of photometers for H_β and green line along with all-sky photographs obtained at Syowa Station, Antarctica in 1971. The result shows that <b>an</b> auroral <b>breakup</b> starts at the poleward boundary of the pre-existing hydrogen arc, that <b>a</b> global <b>breakup</b> frequently starts when an electron auroral arc comes into contact with the pre-existing hydrogen arc, that the enhancement of H_β takes place in the region bounded by the westward travelling surge, the poleward shifting arc and the pre-existing hydrogen arc with a spatial negative correlation between electron aurora and hydrogen emission, and that the behaviour of <b>a</b> local <b>breakup</b> is substantially similar to that of <b>a</b> global <b>breakup</b> though it has no "contact" of electron aurora...|$|R

He rapes Sharon, and his true identity is revealed when he dies after driving off a cliff. Sharon becomes pregnant, with Matt possibly {{the father of}} her child. During an argument with Nick Sharon trips and falls, giving birth to a stillborn baby girl. After a paternity test, Nick is revealed to be the baby's father.

25|$|Many people {{experience}} loneliness {{for the first}} time when they are left alone as infants. It is also a very common, though normally temporary, consequence of <b>a</b> <b>breakup,</b> divorce, or loss of any important long-term relationship.

25|$|The Memorandum's {{defenders}} claims go as follows: {{far from}} calling for <b>a</b> <b>breakup</b> of Yugoslavia on Greater Serbian lines {{claimed to be}} in favor of Yugoslavia. Its support for Yugoslavia was however conditional on fundamental changes to end what the Memorandum argued was the discrimination against Serbia which was inbuilt into the Yugoslav constitution. The chief of these changes was abolition of the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to Norman Cigar, because the changes were unlikely to be accepted passively, the implementation of the Memorandum's program would only be possible by force.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{a strong}} and militant mass Socialist Party {{emerging}} in the US was linked by London with his prediction that the middle class would shrink as monopolistic trusts crushed labor and small- to mid-sized businesses. Instead the US Progressive Era led to <b>a</b> <b>breakup</b> of the trusts, notably {{the application of the}} Sherman Antitrust Act to Standard Oil in 1911. At the same time, reforms such as labor unions rights were passed during the Progressive Era, with further reforms during the New Deal of the 1930s. Further, economic prosperity led to dramatic growth of the middle class in the 1920s and after World War II.|$|E
