Measuring <b>advertising</b> <b>pressure</b> in online games by the theoretical and methodological framework for content analysis applied to the game pages visited by a group of Brazilian and Spanish children 9 to 11 years. This research showed that online games are occupied by a considerable amount of publicity, which repeatedly blocks access and disrupts key moments of young players with unwanted or not interesting messages. Like in television programming we must put more attention on quality and the amount of ads in online playing. So if there is a concern with the commercial content of children's programming on television similar reasons demand prompt and adequate attention to those games pages. Abusive ads damage advertiser’s reputation, affects gaming experiences and disturb the playtime.

40|$|Obesity {{started to}} appear {{as a public health}} problem {{at the end of the}} 20 th century; however, it is {{currently}} acquiring epidemic dimensions. In most cases this pathology is the result of inappropriate eating habits, which are becoming a major dietary, psychological and social problem in developed countries.

Eating behavior should be conceived in an all-round perspective, including the interaction of the characteristics of the subject (biological, psychological, cultural), with the food the subject can easily access and the environment around him/her (especially peer-group and <b>advertising</b> <b>pressure).</b> In view of these conditions, it remains clear that the treatment of these patients should be individual and integral.

This field experiment sought {{to examine the effects}} of a media source on agricultural producers' perceptions of credibility and agricultural advertising influence in a news story.

After reading the story, participants answered a series of questions on the credibility of the story and the likelihood of agricultural advertising influence on it. The source of the story significantly influenced readers' perception of credibility; specifically, readers of the farm media story ranked it as fairer, more trustworthy, and far less biased than readers of the mainstream media story. However, readers' rankings of the accuracy and completeness of the story were not significantly influenced by the source and were perhaps influenced more by the content. Agricultural producers also did not respond differently to questions about advertising influence when reading the news story under different media labels.

In adittion to this, the article talks about other researches which prove the restricted influence advertising exerts on children as regards food consumption and the factors which are necessary to affirm that there are direct causes to provoke obesity. The purpose of this essay is to analyze what type of product category exerts more <b>advertising</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and what kind of}} messages are used.

50|$|In {{the present}} day, bad breath {{is one of}} the biggest social taboos. The general {{population}} places great importance on the avoidance of bad breath, illustrated by the annual $1 billion that consumers in the United States spend on deodorant-type mouth (oral) rinses, mints, and related over-the-counter products. Many of these practices are merely short term attempts at masking the odor. Some authors have suggested that there is an evolutionary basis to concern over bad breath. An instinctive aversion to unpleasant odors may function to detect spoiled food sources and other potentially invective or harmful substances. Body odors in general are thought to play an important role in mate selection in humans, and unpleasant odor may signal disease, and hence a potentially unwise choice of mate. Although reports of bad breath are found in the earliest medical writings known, the social stigma has likely changed over time, possibly partly due to sociocultural factors involving <b>advertising</b> <b>pressures.</b> As a result, the negative psychosocial aspects of halitosis may have worsened, and psychiatric conditions such as halitophobia are probably more common than historically. There have been rare reports of people committing suicide because of halitosis, whether there is genuine halitosis or not.|$|R

5000|$|The word {{halitosis}} {{is derived}} from the Latin word halitus, meaning 'breath', and the Greek suffix -osis meaning 'diseased' or 'a condition of'. With modern consumerism, there has been a complex interplay of <b>advertising</b> <b>pressures</b> and the existing evolutionary aversion to malodor. Contrary to the popular belief that Listerine coined the term halitosis, its origins date to before the product's existence, being coined by physician Joseph William Howe in his 1874 book The Breath, and the Diseases Which Give It a Fetid Odor, although it only became commonly used in the 1920s when a marketing campaign promoted Listerine as a solution for [...] "chronic halitosis". The company was the first to manufacture mouth washes in the United States. According to Freakonomics: Listerine [...] "...was invented in the nineteenth century as powerful surgical antiseptic. It was later sold, in distilled form, as both a floor cleaner and a cure for gonorrhea. But it wasn't a runaway success until the 1920s, when it was pitched as a solution for [...] "chronic halitosis"— a then obscure medical term for bad breath. Listerine's new ads featured forlorn young women and men, eager for marriage but turned off by their mate's rotten breath. [...] "Can I be happy with him in spite of that?" [...] one maiden asked herself. Until that time, bad breath was not conventionally considered such a catastrophe, but Listerine changed that. As the advertising scholar James B. Twitchell writes, [...] "Listerine did not make mouthwash as much as it made halitosis." [...] In just seven years, the company's revenues rose from $115,000 to more than $8 million." ...|$|R

However, the real effect {{of the mass media}} on children is still not sufficiently clear to the pedagogical public. This thesis should help to understand how the children are affected by the influence of commercialization and by the <b>advertising</b> and marketing <b>pressures</b> that they are focused on them. This thesis will be arranged into two parts. The first one is the theoretical part. In this part we'll focus on the description of the influence of advertisement on pupils of the second degree of the primary school from the view of marketing, psychology of sale and related disciplines which deal professionally with this phenomenon. Moreover, the ethical dimension of the influence of advertisement on children especially the pupils of the primary schools between 11 and 15 will be studied too. We'll monitor the effect of the advertising in the form of television, radio, newspaper or leaflet advertisement as well as currently modern internet advertising. The second part, the practical one, is connected to the research made on primary schools. We'll try to find out, using the appropriate methods, the pupils' knowledge of advertisement. We'll monitor the nature of the advertisement that pupil's like and why they like it.

40|$|The {{provision}} of children's content {{should be a}} key constituent of the public service brand, but has often been viewed as a programme category at risk. Certainly in many countries children's television has moved from the 'scarcity' associated with terrestrial provision, to the 'plenty' of digital (see Ellis 2000). However {{in spite of a}} range of dedicated public service children's channels in Europe (CBeebies, Kika, Z@ppelin), domestically produced children's television in Europe is notoriously under-resourced if not marginalised. There is a pronounced reliance on imports (particularly on commercial television) notwithstanding the launch by US-owned multinationals (Disney, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network) of localised versions of their children's television channels in many European countries. Within the broader context of global developments in children's media, this paper starts by outlining the recent and rapid crisis in British children's television and the factors that caused it. This was a crisis, which caught broadcasters and producers by surprise in the middle of 2006, but reflects many of the challenges faced by the children's television sector in other countries. It clearly demonstrated how a combination of the lack of regulatory protection, a change in commercial priorities among broadcasters, <b>advertising</b> restrictions, budgetary <b>pressures</b> and the competitive environment at home and abroad all combined to reinforce the trend towards a contraction of domestic production. The crisis also served to underline the dominance of the BBC - both as a representative of public service principles, and as the dominant producer and commissioner in the market. With the reasons underpinning the crisis explained, the paper will then analyse how the children's television community responded to the crisis and with what effect. Based on interviews, contemporary accounts and documentary evidence the paper will chart the converging and diverging views of broadcasters, producers, regulatory authority Ofcom, and a range of advocacy groups which represent children's interests and the industry. What arguments were elaborated in favour of protecting children's television {{as an integral part of}} the public service media brand? Can lessons be learned about how best to ensure the origination of children's media within a public service environment? Can developments in the UK be used to provide insight into how children's media might develop further...|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} 1970 s {{the amount and}} {{intensity}} of advertising regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an agency of the federal government, increased exponentially. Among a great many actions taken by the FTC at this time was issuance of a new rule requiring advertisers {{to be able to}} provide scientifically-valid substantiation for all claims contained in advertising in regard to product safety, product performance, product quality and comparative pricing. The FTC required the substantiation to be in existence prior to the appearance of the ad. This 2 ̆ 2 prior substantiation 2 ̆ 2 rule has been in effect ever since. At the time this rule was announced, the author was a copywriter at a medium-sized advertising agency in Milwaukee. In the ensuing months, it seemed that most people in the advertising business were challenged repeatedly to create ads that met the new FTC rules and standards as they evolved. Every large client of the agency reacted by expanding the size and authority of their internal legal departments, and for some years it seemed far more important to create ads that would satisfy the attorneys and the FTC than to create ads that would sell products to consumers. Many in the advertising business, both in the agency and in the client organizations, wondered what all the fuss was about, since they would never have knowingly {{had anything to do with}} deceptive advertising. The author was convinced then (and is still convinced today) that the most effective regulation of <b>advertising</b> is competitive <b>pressure</b> in a free market, and the most compelling influence on an advertiser is the consumer. Was this new, highly-publicized regulatory pressure from the government really necessary? Was it likely to produce lasting and worthwhile results? Ultimately, that curiosity evolved into the motivation underlying this thesis: a desire to find out whether there really was a widespread problem of false or misleading advertising, and whether the FTC 2 ̆ 7 s regulation and influence has provided an effective solution Of course that is a very large question, and this is an M. A. thesis undertaken by one individual acting under time constraints and with limited financial resources. Accordingly, the present investigation explores one aspect of the impact of FTC regulation, by attempting to measure the effect of the 2 ̆ 2 prior substantiation 2 ̆ 2 rule on actual advertisements. Using established content analysis procedures, it compares certain characteristics of the advertising copy of new car magazine ads, selected from four full-year data points at 10 -year intervals, from 1966 through 1996. The study was designed to find content differences between automobile advertising that ran before the 2 ̆ 2 prior substantiation 2 ̆ 2 rule was announced (ads that appeared during the year 1966) and more recent advertising (ads that appeared in 1976, 1986 and 1996) that might have resulted from the presence of this rule...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{customization}} and {{one-to-one marketing}} strategies have greatly impacted business {{practices in the}} last decade. This has been true in advertising where marketers can effectively customize a message based {{on the nature of}} the receiver, deliver it in a cost-effective way, and obtain feedback regarding its effectiveness. The purpose of the present study by the Printing Industry Center (CIAS) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is to benchmark the amount of personalization and complexity of personalized advertising in the U. S. Two distinct populations, advertising agencies and marketing executives, were sampled to measure their current usage patterns and their underlying motivations for recommending personalization within the context of media planning and campaign execution. The objectives of the research were: 1. To define the dynamics between the advertising agency, the marketing executive, and the print services provider relative to media decisions and campaign direction. 2. To reveal the current preferences for print or non-print marketing programs and perspectives on the best media options for personalized campaigns. 3. To determine the amount of variable information or personalization used and the degree of complexity of the customized communication. 4. To understand the barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of a personalized communication strategy. 5. To determine who measures the effectiveness of a campaign and how it is done. The advertising agency respondents were drawn from The Red Book list, which contains detailed profiles of more than 13, 000 U. S. and international advertising agencies. A total of 250 advertising agencies completed a 30 - minute telephone interview in the spring of 2003. The marketing executive sample was drawn from the Dun and Bradstreet list and was restricted to financial services fi rms, manufacturers, and retail firms. A total of 1, 999 firms were contacted by phone to produce the 205 completed surveys. The results, by research objective, are: Dynamics Among Firms Impacting Media Choice • Over half (53 %) of marketing executives in the sample had used an advertising agency in the past year. Only 36 % reported that the advertising agency bought print on their behalf. • Approximately one-third of marketing executives printed almost all marketing materials internally. • Media choices for advertising revealed the integrated nature of campaigns. Magazines and newspapers led the way for both advertising agencies and marketing executives, making up 31 % and 35 % of their respective allocations. Collateral and direct mail made up a total of 23 % of advertising agencies’ media allocations and 31 % of marketing executives’ allocations. Advertising agencies spent a higher proportion of the media budget on broadcast television and radio than did the marketing executives. • The type of media purchased by advertising agencies varied according to their client base. Those that served primarily business-to-business (B 2 B) clients bought more collateral, direct marketing, and magazine advertising. Those that served primarily business-to- consumer (B 2 C) clients bought more broadcast TV, radio, and newspaper advertising. • Advertising agencies were asked to indicate up to five factors that drove the media choices for campaigns. Target market selection or demographic was the top factor at 71 %. Cost/budget was the second most important factor at 63 %; marketing strategy was third at 56 %. ROI target was important to 31 % of respondents. The least important specific factor driving media choices for campaigns was the need for a personalized message (14 %). Use of Personalization • An average of 23 % of the work completed by advertising agencies involved personalization. Nearly 20 % of advertising agencies had not produced a personalized campaign in the past year. An average of 33 % of marketing executives’ campaigns involved personalization. Only 3 % of the marketing executives had not produced a personalized campaign in the past year. • When asked, “To what degree are the messages customized?”, both advertising agencies and marketing executives responded that nearly half of their campaigns used the lowest level of complexity, the mail-merge option, including only a variable address and/ or salutation. Only 27 % of advertising agencies and 18 % of the marketing executives used graphics in the customized messages. • Over three quarters of advertising agency clients (79 %) who requested personalization were categorized as small, with annual revenues of $ 100 million or less. Nearly half of clients (47 %) who requested personalization were categorized as B 2 B companies. The two most common industry classifications for clients who requested personalization were manufacturing and retail, both at 40 %. The third most common industry classification for clients requesting personalization was financial at 34 %. • In response to the question of which types of media are best for personalization, 86 % of advertising agencies indicated that direct mail was the best. E-mail was rated as effective by 56 % and customized Internet pages were rated as effective by 35 %. Phone/call center/telemarketing was the lowest rated medium for personalization at 18 %. Barriers to Using Personalization • Nearly two thirds of both groups were aware of the new print technologies used for personalization. However, while over half of the advertising agencies said that they had shown samples to their corporate clients, only 36 % of the marketing executives reported that they had seen samples demonstrated by their agencies. • The biggest specific obstacles keeping advertising agencies from recommending personalization strategies to their clients were price and lack of a suitable database. For the marketing executives, the lack of resources (money, databases, people, or knowledge) and lack of need were the top obstacles mentioned. • The marketing executives were asked if they used a customer relationship management (CRM) system. Only 21 % indicated that they did. E x e c u t i v e Summary Copyright 2003 Printing Industry Center (CIAS) at RIT - All rights reserved. 4 However, almost all had a customer database. In managing the customer database, nearly 60 % used sales force management capabilities, 31 % used data mining, and 28 % used campaign management. Measuring Campaign Effectiveness • We found that advertising agency and marketing executive perceptions differed on this issue. Seventy-five percent of marketing executives said that they measured campaign results, whereas only 37 % of advertising agencies indicated that their clients, the marketing executives, measured the results. Sales leads, a change in sales, number of orders, and response to direct mail were used to measure results by 45 to 50 % of the marketing executives. In order for the demand for more complex levels of customized communications to grow, advertising agencies and their corporate clients must perceive the importance of personalization strategies in campaign planning. While there is still a need to build awareness, there is even greater need to communicate the cost/ benefi t advantages to customized communication.
