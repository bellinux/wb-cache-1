40|$|Horizontal {{directional}} drilling (HDD) involves pulling a new pipeline through a horizontal borehole. When installing a {{high density polyethylene}} (HDPE) pipe, <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> and strains develop as it is pulled into place. The potential service life of an HDPE pipe is likely controlled by these stresses and strains. Currently, pulling force equations are used to calculate maximum pulling force during an HDD installation. To better understand how <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> and strains developed in the pipe during and after installation, a pipe specimen was tested under a cyclic pulling force history. This simplified loading history involves a square wave with maximum <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> of 3. 8 MPa and minimum <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> of 0. 6 MPa. Axial strain accumulation during the experiment reached a peak of 0. 75 % {{at the end of}} the 60 minute simulation. The laboratory measurements were then compared with numerical simulations using both linear and nonlinear rheological models. Axial strain accumulation was best estimated using a nonlinear viscoelastic model. Subsequent to the simulated installation, the pipe samples were subjected to a constant axial strain condition while monitoring the development of axial tensions. After four days the axial tensions rose to 0. 94 MPa. Strain levels developed during this simulation of a typical HDD installation fall within performance limits used for conventional buried pipes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> during fixed-end torsion {{is indicative of}} deformation-induced anisotropy. Generally, these stresses {{can be associated with}} texture development. However, this cannot be said about the induced <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> in superplastic materials, since no or little texture is observed during superplastic deformation. In this work, we model the deformation-induced anisotropy by incorporating a generalized anisotropic dynamic yield function in a microstructure-based viscoplastic model. The anisotropic yield function is capable of describing the evolution of the initial state of anisotropy through the evolution of unit vectors defining the direction of anisotropy. The evolution of the direction of anisotropy is represented by a constitutive spin such that it is initially identical to the Eulerian spin, and as deformation continues, it tends towards an orthotropic spin. Experimental data on the Pb-Sn alloy is used to calibrate and verify the constructed model. It is shown that the model in conjunction with the anisotropic dynamic yield function is capable of predicting the actual trend of the induced <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> recorded in fixed-end torsion experiments...|$|R
40|$|Restrained warping is {{important}} for the torsion deformation and <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> of thin-wall open sections. However, this phenomenon is not included in commonly used frame analysis programs. This paper presents a simple method to include the effect of restrained warping of member ends in a frame analysis. In this method, prior to the frame analysis the structural designer increases the section torsion stiffness by a factor. After the analysis the structural designer obtains the extreme bi-moments and <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> from the computed torsion moment. The method is demonstrated in three examples. The importance of restrained warping is shown. Key words: Torsion, frame analysis, restrained warping, design method...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{validate}} {{the hypothesis that}} there exists an optimal <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> range to enhance tibial fracture healing. MethodsRabbits with a surgically induced V-shaped tibial fracture were separated into 2 main groups: the control group (C Group, n= 6) without application of any <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> stimulation postoperatively and the stimulation group (S Group, n= 90). The S Group was further divided into 20 subgroups (S 11 to S 54) in terms of 5 <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> stimulation levels (112. 8 kPa, 289. 8 kPa, 396. 5 kPa, 472. 7 kPa, and 602. 3 kPa) and 4 experimental endpoints (1, 3, 5 and 8 weeks after operation). A custom made circular external fixator was used to provide the <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> of the fracture sites. Based on X-ray observation, a fracture healing scoring system was created to evaluate the fracture healing process. ResultsAt 8 weeks after operation, there existed a “∩–shape” relationship between healing score and <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> stimulation level of fracture site. The optimal <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> stimulation ranged from 289. 8 kPa to 472. 7 kPa, accompanying the best fracture healing, i. e. the fracture line became indistinct or almost disappeared, {{and a lot of}} callus jointed the two fracture ends. Meanwhile, at 5 weeks after operation, corresponding to the relatively low healing scores, there was a fracture healing performance similar to that at 8 weeks. Besides, at 1 or 3 weeks after operation, for all the <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> levels (0 - 602. 3 kPa), no obvious healing effect was found. ConclusionsIt is implied from the stated X-ray observation results in this study that the potential optimal <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> stimulation and optimal fracture healing time are available. The <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> level of 289. 8 - 472. 7 kPa and fracture healing time of more than 8 weeks jointly comprise the optimal <b>axial</b> compression <b>stress</b> stimulation conditions to enhance tibial fracture healing...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis {{is concerned with the}} theory of thin-walled beams of open section. The aim is to formulate a general beam element for analysis of this type of structure. Thus a general stiffness matrix for the element, and a transformation matrix for loads and displacements with respect to centroid and shear centre were derived, by taking into consideration the value of-bimoment due to an axial force offset from the shear centre. Internal forces including bimoments, and global displacements including warping were calculated, and the stress distributions on the cross-sections of a beam at each-element node, were evaluated. The problem of buckling of thin-walled beams was treated using a finite strip program which was formulated to solve problems with the following combination of stresses: a) Linearly distributed <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> b) Uniform lateral stresses c) Uniform shear streses The results for beams of cruciform, box and channel sections, under uniform <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> and linearly distributed <b>axial</b> <b>stresses,</b> also accounting for flexural stresses, were conpared with other theoretical and some experimental results. The agreement was satisfactory. A series of, laboratory tests on beams of channel sections under compression were carried out.

50|$|Cyclic {{stress is}} {{frequently}} encountered in rotating machinery where a bending moment {{is applied to}} a rotating part. This is called a cyclic bending stress and the aerial lift above is a good example. However, cyclic axial stresses and cyclic torsional stresses also exist. An example of cyclic <b>axial</b> <b>stress</b> would be a bungee cord (see bungee jumping), which must support the mass of people as they jump off structures such as bridges. When a person reaches {{the end of a}} cord, the cord deflects elastically and stops the person's descent. This creates a large <b>axial</b> <b>stress</b> in the cord. A fraction of the elastic potential energy stored in the cord is typically transferred back to the person, throwing the person upwards some fraction of the distance he or she fell. The person then falls on the cord again, inducing stress in the cord. This happens multiple times per jump. The same cord is used for several jumps, creating cyclical stresses in the cord that could eventually cause failure if not replaced.|$|E

The previous equations considerably underestimate the concrete shear transfer capacity and the underestimation is notable for the interfaces subjected to additional <b>axial</b> <b>stresses.</b> The proposed model provides superior accuracy in predicting the shear friction strength, resulting in a mean between experimental and predicted friction strengths of 0. 97 and least scatter.

40|$|Purpose. Studying of {{influence}} of {{value of a}} backlash on a state of stress of a bolt of a single-shear bolt joint in a "shearing" zone. Methodology. Used a method of final elements and the 3 D contact model {{as much as possible}} approached to real geometry and conditions of load application. Findings. The bolt of a single-shear bolt joint always "works" not only on a shear, and on a bending. Contact interaction of a lateral surface of a bolt with edges of apertures calls in zones of contacts in a bolt additional negative <b>axial</b> <b>stresses</b> of peak character. Even at a cycle with a constant sign on the loading in a bolt at a surface there can be a zone with cyclically sign-variable <b>axial</b> <b>stresses,</b> and they are more destructive, than with a constant sign. It changes character of fatigue failure of a bolt. Originality. The reason of change of character of fatigue failure of a bolt is found out: separation instead of a shear. ????: ???????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ????????? ????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ????
