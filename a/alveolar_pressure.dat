40|$|The {{interrupter}} {{method for}} measuring respiratory system resistance involves interrupting flow at the airway opening and measuring the resultant changes in pressure. We have recently shown (J. Appl. Physiol. 65 : 408 - 414, 1988) that in open-chest mongrel dogs, under control conditions, the initial rapid pressure change (ΔPinit) reflects conducting airway resistance {{and the subsequent}} gradual pressure change (ΔPdif) reflects stress recovery of the tissues. We questioned whether the same interpretation would apply after induced constriction. Accordingly, we performed interruption experiments on anesthetized, paralyzed, tracheostomized, open-chest mongrel dogs during passive expiration, measuring pressure at the trachea and in three different alveolar regions with alveolar capsules.

5000|$|High {{frequency}} {{jet ventilation}} (HFJV) {{is provided by}} the Bunnell Life Pulse High-Frequency Ventilator. HFJV employs an endotracheal tube adaptor in place for the normal 15 mm ET tube adaptor. A high pressure [...] "jet" [...] of gas flows out of the adaptor and into the airway. This jet of gas occurs for a very brief duration, about 0.02 seconds, and at high frequency: 4-11 hertz. Tidal volumes ≤ 1 ml/Kg are used during HFJV. This combination of small tidal volumes delivered for very short periods of time creates the lowest possible distal airway and <b>alveolar</b> <b>pressures</b> produced by a mechanical ventilator. Exhalation is passive. Jet ventilators utilize various I:E ratios—between 1:1.1 and 1:12—to help achieve optimal exhalation. Conventional mechanical breaths are sometimes used to aid in reinflating the lung. Optimal PEEP is used to maintain alveolar inflation and promote ventilation-to-perfusion matching.

40|$|The {{interrupter}} {{method for}} measuring respiratory system resistance involved rapidly interrupting flow {{at the mouth}} while measuring the pressure just distal {{to the point of}} interruption. The pressure signal observed invariably exhibits two distinct phases. The first phase is a very rapid jump, designated ΔPinit, which occurs immediately on interruption of flow. The second phase is designated ΔPdif and is a further pressure change {{in the same direction as}} ΔPinit but evolving over several seconds. The physiological interpretations of ΔPinit and ΔPdif have been somewhat unclear. ΔPinit has been taken to equal the pressure drop across the pulmonary airways, possibly with a contribution from the tissues of the respiratory system. ΔPdif can arise, in principle, from two sources: gas redistribution throughout the lung after interruption of flow and stress recovery within the tissues. To resolve these issues we performed interruption experiments on anesthetized paralyzed, tracheotomized, open-chest normal dogs during passive expiration while measuring <b>alveolar</b> <b>pressures</b> at three sites with alveolar capsules. We found that, in the absence of the chest wall, ΔPinit reflects only the resistance of the airways and that ΔPdif can be ascribed almost entirely to the stress recovery properties of lung tissues...|$|R

Immediately after the achievement of the desired pressure level (5, 15, 25 cm H 2 O during inflation, and 15 and 5 cm H 2 O during deflation), the tracheal cannula was occluded and lungs were quick-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen, and fixed using Carnoy’s solution. Sections representing the central and peripheral areas of the lungs were sampled and processed for paraffin embedding and stained with hematoxylin–eosin. By means of stereological techniques, surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) and the fraction of large-volume gas-exchanging airspaces (LVGEAS) were determined.

40|$|Bronchodilatation was {{produced}} in normal subjects by the inhalation of atropine, a parasympatholytic agent, and isoproterenol, a beta adrenergic stimulator. Density dependence of maximal expiratory flow (Vmax), expressed as a ratio of Vmax with an 80 % helium- 20 % oxygen gas mixture to Vmax with air at isolung volumes, indicated that the predominant flow regimes across upstream airways changed differently after each agent was given separately. After atropine Vmax increased, elastic recoil pressure did not change, and density dependence decreased. Utilizing the equal pressure points analysis which defines upstream and downstream segments of the intrathoracic airways at flow limitation, these results suggest a greater relative dilatation of the larger upstream airways such that more of the driving pressure is dissipated across the smaller airways in which flow is less dependent upon gas density. After isoproterenol Vmax increased, elastic recoil pressure did not change, and density dependence increased. This suggests a preferential dilatation of the smaller and more peripheral airways with less density-dependent flow regimes such that more of the driving pressure would be dissipated in the larger airways in which flow is more dependent upon gas density. Systematic decreases after isoproterenol lead independently to the same conclusion.
