40|$|Passive wind {{dispersal}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} mechanisms through which organisms disperse and colonize new areas. The detailed comprehension of which factors affect this process may help to preserve its efficiency for years to come. This is especially important in the current context of climate change, which may seriously alter weather regimes that drive dispersal, and is crucial in urban contexts, where biodiversity is dramatically threatened by pollution and fragmentation of natural patches. Despite its interest, the analysis of factors affecting <b>aeroplankton</b> dispersal in urban environments is rare in literature. We sampled <b>aeroplankton</b> community uninterruptedly every 4 hours from 17 th May to 19 th September 2011 in the urban garden of Parco d'Orléans, within the campus of the University of Palermo (Sicily). Sampling was performed using a Johnson-Taylor suction trap with automatized sample storing. Weather variables were recorded at a local meteorological station. Overall, 11, 739 insects were caught during the present study, about 60 % of these belonged to the order Hymenoptera, with particular presence of families Agaonidae and Formicidae. The suction trap also captured specimens of very small size, and in some cases, species caught were new records for Italy. Composition and abundance of <b>aeroplankton</b> community was influenced by alternation day/night, as well as by daily fluctuations of climatic variables, for example fluctuating temperature. The diversity of samples was also studied and resulted higher when wind blew from the nearby green area. Our findings confirm that passive transport of arthropods strictly depends on weather conditions, and that the presence of natural areas within the urban environment significantly contribute to raise <b>aeroplankton</b> diversity, eventually fuelling overall biodiversity at a local scale. We discuss how climate change may affect future dispersal of these organisms...|$|E
40|$|The work {{contains}} {{the analysis of}} Ambrosia pollen producing seasons in the atmosphere of Upper Silesia in the years 1998 - 2004. The research was carried out applying a volumetric method (Burkard pollen sampler) in Sosnowiec and the gravimetric method, for comparative purposes, in Sosnowiec, Będzin, Czeladź and Katowice. The highest pollen concentration in the research years was found in Sosnowiec and in 1999 in Czeladź. The ambrosia pollen in <b>aeroplankton</b> was noticed in the first ten days of August {{until the middle of}} October. The maximum pollen concentrations were from 16 August to 21 September. The highest pollen concentration was found in 1999 and 2002 (222 and 127 grains per 1 m 3 per 24 h) on September 4 th, the lowest concentration in 2001. Two genera - Ambrosia artemisiifolia and A. psilostachya - can be found over an area of Upper Silesia. They constitute the main source of pollen in <b>aeroplankton,</b> but its transportation from distant areas cannot be excluded. The pollen of these plants can be transported by the wind from neighbouring countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Hungary) ...|$|E
40|$|Cladosporium is {{reported}} to be the most common airborne fungus in temperate zones. These spores were chosen for study {{on the basis of their}} dominance in fungal <b>aeroplankton</b> populations and documented involvement in triggering respiratory allergy symptoms. Generally, they were present at higher concentrations in late spring and summer, than in autumn and winter. Based of our results, clinicians should consider the spore type described herein as a possible cause of severe asthma attacks during periods of warm, dry summer weather. During the 2 months of this study the Cladosporium spores count exceeded the threshold value in Timisoara for a one day. The maximum value for Cladosporium was observed on June 20, 2008 (3134, 8 spores/m 3). The intradiurnal variations recorded during the monitored period have been studied. The present study will contribute to our knowledge of airborne spores in Timisoara...|$|E

40|$|Studies of the {{concentration}} of fungal spores were {{carried out in the}} cities of Lublin and Rzeszów simultaneously in 2002. At both sites the volumetric method of measurement was applied, using the Lanzoni VPPS 2000 trap. Only the allergenic taxa were analysed: Alternaria, Botrytis, Cladosporium, Drechslera type, Epicoccum, Torula, Stemphylium, Pithomyces, Polythrincium, and Ganoderma. The research showed considerable differences in {{the concentration}} and frequency of spores in the air at the sites compared. Higher mean concentrations of spores were usually observed in Lublin. Only for two taxa were the concentrations higher in Rzeszów. No significant differences were observed for the genus of Polythrincium and Torula. Also the lengths of periods of occurrence of the spores were determined using the 95 % method. It was determined that the geobotanical conditions in Rzeszów {{have a positive effect on}} the lengthening of the presence of the spores in <b>aeroplankton.</b> The results of the observations were analysed statistically, which confirmed the occurrence of significant differences between the cities compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} role of aeromycota is discussed. The fungal <b>aeroplankton</b> {{of upper}} soil air layers could influence on other organisms (plants, animals, humans) and deposited {{on the soil}} surface. We investigated {{the content of the}} fungal propagules in the surface air and as the deposits on the soil surface at the forest and at the grass areas by fluorescent microscopy. In comparison with the investigation on the solid media the number of spores during direct examination was some orders of magnitude higher and amounts to hundreds of thousands spores per cubic meter. In seasonal dynamic the number of fungal spores in the air was usually higher at forest area and less on the grassy territories. The maximal deposition of fungal spores on the soil surface (4. 1 ± 0. 4 mg/m 2 per day) was marked in the autumn. According to our preliminary data, in rainwater occurred a significant concentration of fungal spores from the surface air.

40|$|Grass pollen allergens are a {{frequent}} cause of pollen allergy in Poland and other European countries. The research on <b>aeroplankton</b> conducted in Lublin since 2001 allows {{characterization of the}} course of grass pollen seasons and estimation {{of the effect of}} maximum and minimum temperatures, relative air humidity, precipitation and maximum wind velocity on the taxon's pollen concentration. The gravimetric method was used in the study. During the eight-year research period, the pollen season usually started in the first or second decade of May and, as a rule, it lasted till the end of August, and quite exceptionally, in 2002 and 2008 till mid-August. The mean length of the pollen season was 107 days. The highest grass pollen risk was observed in the 26 th and 27 th week. The highest annual counts reaching over 3600 pollen grains × cm - 2 were noted in 2008, while in the other study years they ranged from 741 to 1909. The date of the pollen season onset and its course were highly dependent on weather conditions, which was confirmed by the statistical analysis. The greatest significant influence on the pollen season was exerted by maximum temperature, relative air humidity and the maximum wind...|$|E
40|$|The {{content of}} Aesculus pollen in <b>aeroplankton</b> of Lu-blin, located in central-eastern Poland, was studied {{during the period}} 2001 – 2012. The {{volumetric}} method {{was used for the}} study. The following parameters were determined: start, end, and duration of the pollen season, days of maximum concen-tration, and total annual pollen counts. Correlation coefficients were calculated between the start of the pollen season and mete-orological parameters. The study showed that during the period 2007 – 2012 the onset of the Aesculus pollen season occurred on average 4 days earlier than in the years 2001 – 2006. The total annual pollen counts were in the range of 53 – 271, with an ave-rage number of 117. The average pollen counts did not differ significantly in the first and second year of a 6 -year period of the study. The analysis of the correlation coefficients showed that there were significant positive correlations only between the season start date and minimum temperature of the first de-cade of May. The highest Aesculus pollen concentration occur-red between 6 and 22 May. The flowers of A. hippocastanum demonstrate an ambophilous pollination strategy due to partial insect and wind pollination.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relevance}} of climatic events as causative factors for cholera epidemics is well known. However, examinations of {{the involvement of}} climatic factors in intracontinental disease distribution are still absent. OBJECTIVES: The spreading of cholera epidemics {{may be related to}} the dominant wind direction over land. METHODS: We examined the geographic diffusion of three cholera outbreaks through their linkage with the wind direction: a) the progress of Vibrio cholerae O 1 biotype El Tor in Africa during 1970 – 1971 and b) again in 2005 – 2006; and c) the rapid spread of Vibrio cholerae O 139 over India during 1992 – 1993. We also discuss the possible influence of the wind direction on windborn dissemination by flying insects, which may serve as vectors. RESULTS: Analysis of air pressure data at sea level and at several altitudes over Africa, India, and Bangladesh show a correspondence between the dominant wind direction and the intracontinental spread of cholera. CONCLUSIONS: We explored the hypothesis that winds have assisted the progress of cholera Vibrios throughout continents. The current analysis supports the hypothesis that <b>aeroplankton</b> (the tiny life forms that float in the air and that may be caught and carried upward by the wind, landing far from their origin) carry the cholera bacteria from one body of water to an adjacent one. This finding may improve our understanding of how climatic factors are involved in the rapid distribution of new strains throughout a vast continental area. Awareness of the aerial transfer of Vibrio cholerae may assist health authorities by improving the prediction of the disease’s geographic dissemination...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the <b>aeroplankton</b> with a special {{emphasis}} on the pollen spread {{in the air in}} Croatia was started in 1957. These studies have so far been carried out in three different climatic areas (plate 1). The results obtained so far have partly been published. In the study we applied the standard method of exposing the test slides to the free air in a special apparatus during 24 hours. In microscopic examination the counts of the pollen grains were done on the slide surface of 324 sq. mm. The results shown in this paper refer to the pollen content in the atmosphere in some of the studied areas and were obtained from daily pollen counts. Figures 1 — 3 show the total number of pollen in the air in single months on the territory of Zagreb, Hvar and Dubrovnik. In the studied period of twelve months in the air of Zagreb the highest number of caught pollen grains was in April, the same in Hvar, but in the air of Dubrovnik this number was the highest in March. Least pollen was caught in the air of Zagreb in November and December, in Hvar in October and in Dubrovnik in December and January. A sudden {{increase in the number of}} pollen grains appears in Hvar a month earlier than in Zagreb. As for the quantity of pollen in the area of Zagreb winter break of vegetation is distinctly visible, and from the figure of total pollen count in the air of Hvar per month summer delay in the plant flowering is visible. The highest percentage in the three recorded areas (fig. 4) belongs to the pollen of different trees (Dubrovnik 93, 8 %, Hvar 81 %, Zagreb 55 %), while grasses (Dubrovnik 1, 2 %, Hvar 7 %, Zagreb 22, 5 %) and the group of other herbs or weeds (Dubrovnik 5 %, Hvar 12 %, Zagreb 22, 2 %) appear in considerably smaller percentage. Botanical composition of pollen in the atmosphere of the studied areas is the direct reflexion of the vegetation of the near surroundings, but air currents which bring pollen even from more distant areas are also of some importance. From the botanical composition shown in pollen spectra (fig. 5 a-c) it can be seen that as regards pollen content in the air — Hvar is the reflexion of a real mediterranean vegetation of the middle eumediterranean region, while Dubrovnik is situated in the south eumediterranean region and pollen content in the air is somewhat different due to the phytogeographical position and in some degree affected by air currents from the neighbouring submediterranean and mountain regions. Pollen content in the air of Zagreb is the reflexion of continental vegetation cover of the eurosiberian-northamerican vegetation region which this area is a part of. These studies are of great importance in medicine in diagnosing and treating allergic diseases of the respiratory organs. In connection with this practical application of the <b>aeroplankton</b> research it is necessary to pay special attention to the spreading of some kinds of pollen in the atmosphere of studied areas, which are known for their allergenic properties, as for instance Parietaria, Plantago, Ambrosia or numerous species from the family Gramineae and others...|$|E
40|$|Research on <b>aeroplankton</b> in {{the area}} of Crikvenica was done in 1968 and the results from the teritory cover the period between April 25 and July 24. The stadard Durham method was used for exposing test slides to the air for 24 hours. Pollen was counted on 324 sq. mm. of slide surface and {{exposure}} was done daily. In the research period in the air of Crikvenica the pollen of various trees and bushes was abundantly represented while grasses and other herbs or weeds were represented in a considerably smaller quantity, and the amount of pollen collected from the air in that period was much bigger than the amount of spores (table 1). On 84 exposed slides the total of 4656 pollen and 478 spores was counted. Table 2 shows daily circulation of pollen and spores during the testing period. A very high pollen curve at the end of April {{was the result of the}} blossoming period of some species of anemophylous trees (Quercus, Broussonetia, Fraxinus). During May the pollen content in the air of Crikvenica was rather high, in June it was reduced and in the second half of July quite negligible. In comparison with pollen the daily curve of spores for the whole period is rather low except for a peak at the beginning of June and one at the beginning of July, which can be seen from the graph in Table 2. Table 3 shows the appearance of the pollen of some more prominent variaties, i. e. groups of plants in the air of Crikvenica in the research period. Quercus, Ostrya and Carpinus and Broussonetia were present in the air of Crikvenica at the end of April and mostly again in May. Pina- ceae, Cupressaceae, Oleaceae, then Urticaceae, Chenopodiaceae and Plan- tago were present in the air more or less in the whole research period and so were Gramineae. Botanical composition of pollen in the air of Crikvenica can also be seen from the pollen spectrum graph (Table 4). This composition is the representative of the vegetation of the nearby country. Together with rich and various self grown vegetation of a submediterranean character in the planted areas there are various exotic plants. The air currents also influence the pollen composition in the air of Crikvenica, which is confirmed by the presence of the pollen of some mountain plants, e. g. Fagus, Picea and other as well as the plants from the nearby island of Krk. During the testing period spores of Alternaría and Cladosporium more often were found on the exposed test slides, and in a small numbers were ocassionally observed Ustilago and Tiletia, some Uredinales, then Helminthosporium and others. The wooded area around Crikvenica stretching from the seashore up to about 400 m above the sea belongs to the submediterranean deciduous vegetation as. Carpinetum orientalis croaticum H-ić 1939. and above 400 m. there is also a xerophilous woods of submediterranean character, as. Seslerio-Ostryetum Ht. et H-ić 1950...|$|E
