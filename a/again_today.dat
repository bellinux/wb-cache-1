2500|$|When in operation, {{the mill}} {{processes}} oats into oatmeal. (Oatmeal being a staple foodstuff, {{that in the}} past commonly formed part of the basic diet in Scotland.) Originally, the oats arrived in sacks from the neighbouring farms and had already been threshed. (There is an example of traditional threshing machine on display at the mill.) The oats were then dried in the mill's peat-fired kiln and then sent down a chute to the meal floor to be collected in sacks <b>again.</b> <b>Today</b> the oats arrive already processed, {{but the rest of the}} milling continues in the traditional style.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, it {{is known}} that the Slavic word [...] "mzec" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as [...] "having his eyes closed" [...] or [...] "be blind". Yet <b>again,</b> <b>today</b> it is almost certain that this legend was used as a metaphor, in allusion to the old Slavic pagan ceremony known as the [...] "postrzyżyny": During that ceremony hair cutting was performed to every boy at the age of seven. In that symbolic rite a child became a man. That explains that Mieszko wasn't blind in fact. He was blind only metaphorically. Besides his son's name was also Mieszko and {{it is hard to believe}} that he was also blind. In addition, as we know today ancient Slavs used only abstract names among nobility.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, saudade became {{associated}} with the feeling of longing for one's homeland, as hundreds of thousands of Portuguese-speaking people left in search of better futures in South America, North America and Western Europe. Besides the implications derived from a wave of emigration trend from the motherland, historically speaking saudade is the term associated with the decline of Portugal's role in world politics and trade. During the so-called [...] "Golden Age", synonymous with the era of discoveries, Portugal undeniably rose to the status of a world power, and its monarchy became one of the richest in Europe. But with the rise of competition from other European nations, the country went both colonially and economically into a prolonged period of decay. This period of decline and resignation from the world's cultural stage marked the rise of saudade, aptly described by a sentence in Portugal's national anthem: Levantai hoje de novo o esplendor de Portugal (Lift up once <b>again</b> <b>today</b> the splendour of Portugal).|$|E

John Major told the House of Commons that [...] "Our determination to beat terrorism cannot be beaten by terrorism. The IRA's record is one of failure in every respect, and that failure was demonstrated yet <b>again</b> <b>today.</b> It's about time they learned that democracies cannot be intimidated by terrorism, and we treat them with contempt".

The head of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch, Commander George Churchill-Coleman, described the attack as [...] "daring, well planned, but badly executed".
