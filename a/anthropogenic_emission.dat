50|$|Arctic {{temperatures}} {{are expected to}} increase at roughly twice the global rate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will in their fifth report establish scenarios for the future, where {{the temperature in the}} Arctic will rise between 1.5 and 2.5 °C by 2040 and with 2 to 7.5 °C by 2100. Estimates vary on how many tons of greenhouse gases are emitted from thawed permafrost soils. One estimate suggests that 110-231 billion tons of CO2 equivalents (about half from carbon dioxide and the other half from methane) will be emitted by 2040, and 850-1400 billion tons by 2100. This corresponds to an average annual emission rate of 4-8 billion tons of CO2 equivalents in the period 2011-2040 and annually 10-16 billion tons of CO2 equivalents in the period 2011-2100 as a result of thawing permafrost. For comparison, the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> of all greenhouse gases in 2010 is approximately 48 billion tons of CO2 equivalents. Release of greenhouse gases from thawed permafrost to the atmosphere may increase global warming.|$|E

Using existing anthropogenic inventories, the model reproduces the observed Hg/CO ratio in Asian long-range transport events observed at a surface site in Okinawa, Japan and Mount Bachelor, Oregon, with an underestimate of 18 - 26 % in the ratio. This {{is in contrast}} with previous studies that inferred a factor of two underestimate in Asian <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions.</b> We find that mercury from land emissions and re-emissions, which are largely co-located with <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions,</b> account for a significant fraction of the observed Hg/CO ratio. Increasing Asian <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> by 50 % while holding land emissions constant, or further increasing <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> while decreasing land emissions, corrects the remaining model bias in the Hg/CO ratio. We thus find that a total Asian source of 1260 - 1450 Mg/yr Hg 0 is consistent with observations. Hg 0 emissions from Asia are transported northwestward across the Pacific...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve our {{understanding}} of air quality in Southeast Asia, the anthropogenic emissions inventory must be well represented. In this work, we apply different <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> inventories in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) version 3. 3 using Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART) gas-phase chemistry and Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) aerosols to examine the differences in predicted carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O 3) surface mixing ratios for Southeast Asia in March and December 2008. The <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> inventories include the Reanalysis of the TROpospheric chemical composition (RETRO), the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment-Phase B (INTEX-B), the MACCity emissions (adapted from the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate and megacity Zoom for the Environment projects), the Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC 4 RS) emissions, and a combination of MACCity and SEAC 4 RS emissions. Biomass-burning emissions are from the Fire Inventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (FINNv 1) model. WRF-Chem reasonably predicts the 2 m temperature, 10 m wind, and precipitation. In general, surface CO is underpredicted by WRF-Chem while surface O 3 is overpredicted. The NO 2 tropospheric column predicted by WRF-Chem has the same magnitude as observations, but tends to underpredict the NO 2 column over the equatorial ocean and near Indonesia. Simulations using different anthropogenic emissions produce only a slight variability of O 3 and CO mixing ratios, while biomass-burning emissions add more variability. The different anthropogenic emissions differ by up to 30 % in CO emissions, but O 3 and CO mixing ratios averaged over the land areas of the model domain differ by ~ 4. 5 % and ~ 8 %, respectively, among the simulations. Biomass-burning emissions create a substantial increase for both O 3 and CO by ~ 29 % and ~ 16 %, respectively, when comparing the March biomass-burning period to the December period with low biomass-burning emissions. The simulations show {{that none of the}} <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> inventories are better than the others for predicting O 3 surface mixing ratios. However, the simulations with different <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> inventories do differ in their predictions of CO surface mixing ratios producing variations of ~ 30 % for March and 10 – 20 % for December at Thai surface monitoring sites...|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of trace gases exhibit large spatial heterogeneity over the Indian region with an elevated pollution loading over densely populated Gangetic Plains (IGP). The contending role and importance of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> and meteorology in deciding the trace gases level and distribution over Indian region, however, is poorly investigated. In this paper, we use an online regional chemistry transport model (WRF/Chem) to simulate the {{spatial distribution}} of trace gases over Indian region during one representative month of only three meteorological seasons namely winter, spring/summer and monsoon. The base simulation, using <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> from SEAC(4) RS inventory, is used to simulate the general meteorological conditions and the realistic {{spatial distribution of}} trace gases. A sensitivity simulation is conducted after removing the spatial heterogeneity in the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions,</b> i. e., with spatially uniform emissions to decouple the role of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> and meteorology and their role in controlling the distribution of trace gases over India. The concentration levels of Ozone, CO, SO 2 and NO 2 {{were found to be}} lower over IGP when the emissions are uniform over India. A comparison of the base run with the sensitivity run highlights that meteorology plays a dominant role in controlling the spatial distribution of relatively longer-lived species like CO and secondary species like Ozone while short-lived species like NOX and SO 2 are predominantly controlled by the spatial variability in <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> over the Indian region...|$|R

With the column-averaged CO 2 dry-air mole fraction (Xco 2) data derived from satellite observations, the issue is how to extract and assess these changes, which are related to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> and biosphere absorptions. We propose a k-means cluster analysis to extract the temporally changing features of Xco 2 in the Central-Eastern Asia using the data from 2009 to 2013 obtained by Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), and assess the effects of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> and biosphere absorptions on CO 2 changes combining with the data of emission and vegetation net primary production (NPP). As a result, 14 clusters, which are 14 types of Xco 2 seasonal changing patterns, are obtained in the study area by using the optimal clustering parameters. These clusters are generally in agreement with the spatial pattern of underlying <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> and vegetation absorptions. According to correlation analysis with emission and NPP, these 14 clusters are divided into three groups: strong emission, strong absorption, and a tendency of balancing between emission and absorption. The proposed clustering approach in this study provides us with a potential way to better understand how the seasonal changes of CO 2 concentration depend on underlying <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emissions</b> and vegetation absorptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend and}} interannual {{variability}} of methane sources {{are derived from}} multi-annual simulations of tropospheric photochemistry using a 3 D global chemistry-transport model. Our semi-inverse analysis uses the fifteen years (1979 - 1993) re-analysis of ECMWF meteorological data and annually varying including photo-chemistry, in conjunction with observed CH 4 concentration distributions and trends derived from the NOAA-CMDL surface stations. Dividing the world in four zonal regions, (45 - 90 N, 0 - 45 N, 0 - 45 S; 45 - 90 S) we find good agreement in each region between (top-down) calculated emission trends from model simulations and (bottom-up) estimated <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> trends based on the EDGAR global <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> database, which amounts for the period 1979 - 1993 2. 7 Tg CH 4 yr - 1 . Also the top-down determined total global methane emission compares well with the total of the bottom-up estimates. We use {{the difference between the}} bottom-up and top-down determined emission trends to calculate residual emissions. These residual emissions represent the inter-annual variability of the methane emissions. Simulations have been performed in which the year-to-year meteorology, the emissions of ozone precursor gases, and the stratospheric ozone column distribution are either varied, or kept constant. The analyses reveals that the variability of the emissions is of the order of 8 Tg CH 4 yr - 1 , and most likely related to mid- and low-latitude wetland emissions and/or biomass burning. Indeed, a weak correlation is found between the residual emissions and regional scale temperatures...|$|E

Interannual climate variability has mainly been associated with the de-trended fluctuation in the US annual daytime ozone over 1990 – 2014, with a much smaller effect on the nighttime ozone.

40|$|Atmospheric mercury {{concentrations}} were measured during two oceanographic cruise campaigns covering the Adriatic Sea, the first during the autumn in 2004 {{and the second}} {{in the summer of}} 2005. The inclement weather during the autumn campaign meant that no clear in-situ production of oxidised gas phase mercury was seen, and that events where high values of HgII(g) and/or Hg associated with particulates (HgP) were observed, were the result of plumes from <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> sources. During the summer campaign however, the by now rather familiar diurnal variation of HgII(g) concentration, with maxima around midday, was observed. Again there were events when high HgII(g) and particulates (HgP) {{concentrations were}} seen which did not fit with the pattern of daily in-situ HgII(g) production, which were traceable, with the help of back trajectory calculations, to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> sources. All the emission plumes encountered could be traced back to ports, not all of which are associated with major industrial installations. It therefore seems likely in theses cases that the emissions are either due to shipping or to port activities. Box modelling studies of the summer 2005 campaign show that although the in-situ production of HgII(g) occurs in the MBL, the exact chemical mechanism responsible is difficult to determine. However given the high O 3 concentrations encountered during this campaign it seems clear that if Hg 0 does react with O 3 , it does not produce gas phase HgII, and the reaction between Hg 0 and OH if it occurs, does not contribute appreciably to HgII(g) production...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of boundary conditions and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> inventories on the simulated O 3 and PM 2. 5 concentrations over a middle-eastern country – Lebanon. The Polyphemus chemical transport model (CTM) is used over Lebanon to simulate O 3 and PM 2. 5 concentrations. Comparisons to measurements at a sub-urban site of Beirut between 2 and 13 July 2011 show that O 3 is largely over-estimated when concentrations from a large-scale model are used as boundary conditions, as used in Waked et al. (2013). A global <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>emission</b> inventory (EDGAR-HTAP) is used with Polyphemus, {{in order to provide}} anthropogenic emissions for the Middle-East domain. Over Lebanon, sensitivity to emissions and to boundary conditions have been investigated. The comparison of EDGAR-HTAP to Waked et al. (2012) over Lebanon highlights high discrepancies between the inventories both in terms of emission estimates and spatial distribution. However, when studying the sensitivity to boundary conditions, O 3 is well modeled when a Middle-East domain and the Lebanon domain are nested and thus achieves better statistics. The observed concentration is 48. 8  μg m− 3 and the respective concentrations for the simulation using MOZART 4 and the one using the Polyphemus/Middle-East are 154. 8 and 65. 1  μg m− 3. As for PM 2. 5 which is less sensitive to regional transport than O 3, {{the influence of}} the boundary conditions on the PM 2. 5 concentrations at the site of comparison is low.
