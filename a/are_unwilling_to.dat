5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism. The book {{asserts that the}} countercultural themes in the ministry of Jesus, {{such as those of}} self-denial, are ignored by American Christians because they have become accustomed to exercising Christian privilege and <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> give it up.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{is set on}} a post-apocalyptic version of Mount Desert Island, known in-game as The Island, which is north-east of the Commonwealth, Fallouts post-apocalyptic version of Boston, Massachusetts. The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by radioactive fog. Because the creatures that live inside the fog <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called fog condensers to turn the fog into liquid {{in order to protect}} its inhabitants.|$|E

50|$|HIV/AIDS stigma is {{widespread}} in South Africa: a 2002 national survey revealed that 26% of respondents <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> share a meal {{with a person}} living with AIDS, 18% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> sleep {{in the same room}} as with someone with AIDS, and 6% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> talk to a person with AIDS. AIDS-related stigma is most severe among township residents in South Africa because they lack access to reliable information about the disease. Many South Africans in townships wrongly believe that HIV is transmitted through proximity to HIV-positive individuals, which leads them to claim that people with AIDS should be socially ostracized.|$|R
5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{receives}} {{news that}} his Aunt Shirley has died, and he informs the office. The only co-worker he invites {{to the funeral}} is Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who flees when Dwight begins shooting the corpse with a shotgun to ensure it is really dead. At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose (Michael Schur) and Zeke (Matt Jones), his brother Jeb (Thomas Middleditch), his sister Fannie (Majandra Delfino), his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal), and his uncle Heinrich (Tom Bower). The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate {{on the condition that}} they all come back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> move back in {{due to the lack of}} sophistication farm life offers. Nevertheless, Dwight convinces them to help him run the farm.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E

25|$|In Europe and elsewhere, railway {{networks}} are {{considered part of}} the national transport infrastructure, just like roads, highways and waterways, so are often financed by the state. Operators of the rolling stock pay fees according to rail use. This makes possible the large investments required for the technically and, in the long-term, also economically advantageous electrification. Because railroad infrastructure is privately owned in the U.S., railroads <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> make the necessary investments for electrification.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{after the}} fall of the USSR many critiques of {{federalism}} as an institution to resolve ethnic conflict emerged. The devolution of power away from the central state can weaken ties to the central state. Moreover, the parallel institutions created to serve a particular nation or ethnic group might provide significant resources for Secession from the central state. As most states <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> give up an integral portion of their territory, secessionist movements may trigger violence.|$|E

25|$|Even {{among those}} reconstructionist groups who see {{themselves}} {{as part of the}} broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, or who simply see some members of the Pagan community as allies, there is still a refusal to accept or identify with {{what they see as the}} more problematic aspects of that community, such as the above-noted eclecticism, cultural appropriation or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures. Many Polytheistic Reconstructionists see Reconstructionism as the older current in the Pagan community, and <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> give up this part of their history simply because eclectic movements are currently more fashionable.|$|E

25|$|Icelanders {{are proud}} of their Viking {{heritage}} and Icelandic language and take great care to preserve their traditions. Modern Icelandic remains close to the Old Norse spoken in the Viking Age. For example, the word for computer (an introduced object) is tölva which combines the ancient terms for number and seer. Until the Christianisation of Iceland, many traditional Viking beliefs were strongly held, remnants of which remain today. According to a 2005 New York Times article, the majority of Icelanders either believe in elves or <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> rule out their existence. There are a number of accounts of roads that have been re-routed and building plans redesigned or abandoned to avoid disturbing rocks where elves are said to live.|$|E

25|$|Several mining tragedies {{globally}} have {{underscored the}} human toll {{of the coal}} supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight {{the environmental impacts of}} coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages. Events at the Fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term. Further, cost estimates for “next generation” nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees.|$|E
25|$|Within philosophy, however, {{problems}} arise when the symbols {{are treated as}} the objects they represent and when, through composition, the original {{is expected to be}} found within the simulacrum. An example of this is the substance theory of rationalists and the bundle theory of empiricists. Empiricists, searching for the substance within the gaps of the composition, fill them in within even more symbols. Unwilling to continue filling in the gaps ad infinitum, they renounce that there is a substance and maintain the properties, or symbols, which are {{not to be confused with}} parts, are all that there are. The rationalists, on the other hand, <b>are</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> relinquish substance. Thus they transform it into an unknowable container in which properties reside. Trying to obtain the unity of the object, they allow their substance to contain more and more properties, until eventually it can contain everything, including God and nature. Bergson likened this to a piece of gold for which one can never make up the change.|$|E
