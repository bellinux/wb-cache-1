Christian imagery such as the urn, the wheel, and the shadow, can be found throughout.|$|E

5|$|A typical French Christmas dish is {{turkey with}} chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and foie gras. The Yule log {{is a very}} French {{tradition}} during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal {{in reference to the}} twelve apostles <b>and</b> <b>Christ.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{hunting with}} beagles {{was seen as}} ideal for young people, many of the British public schools {{traditionally}} maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against Eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today, and a pack used by Imperial College in Wye, Kent was stolen by the Animal Liberation Front in 2001. School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, Wye, Radley, the Royal Agricultural University <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Ashley-Cooper {{was educated}} at Eton <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> Church, Oxford. As a child, his primary pursuits outside of getting an education, {{included}} mountain climbing and skiing. He also expressed {{a love of}} music, which continued into adulthood with his service {{as chairman of the}} London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1966 to 1980. On 8 March 1947, his father died unexpectedly of a heart disease and Ashley-Cooper became heir to the titles held by his grandfather and acquired the courtesy title of Lord Ashley.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the end of}} the war, {{architect}} Charles Holden drew up {{plans to}} redevelop the city centre, but locals were so opposed that the Citizens' Defence Association was formed and swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections. Rebuilding of the city centre eventually began 10years after the war. A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre, which was later pedestrianised. The biggest expansion of the city occurred in the 1960s, {{with the arrival of the}} University of Kent at Canterbury <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> Church College.|$|E
5|$|The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was {{destroyed}} by bombing on 29December 1940. By then {{the decline in the}} population of the City of London had reduced the congregation to less than 80, and the parishes of St Leonard, Foster Lane <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> Church Greyfriars were merged with nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.|$|E
5|$|Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had {{inherited}} his title from his grandfather in 1868, when aged 21, {{together with an}} income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000acres (160km²) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent. His father had {{died when he was}} eight and he had been brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The Earls of Rosebery, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was highly intelligent, and a brilliant future was forecast for him by his tutors at both Eton <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> Church, Oxford.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the wide}} variety of topics in the text, {{scholars}} debate as to what constitute the main themes. Prevalent topics discussed, however, are 1) Satan as a character; 2) The might <b>and</b> measure of <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> Satan (<b>Christ</b> vs. Satan: Struggle for Power) and 3) A search for <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> Satan’s self <b>and</b> identity (<b>Christ</b> vs. Satan: Struggle for Self).|$|R
5|$|Brasenose was {{a smaller}} {{community}} during the war, but it kept going. Once again, union with Lincoln College was discussed: {{but in other}} areas, temporary merger was more appropriate; thus, Brasenose <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> Church fielded single sports teams. The College hosted military personnel {{as it had in}} the First World War; a Nissen hut was even set up in Deer Park. Brasenose sent a flood of undergraduates into the forces; in particular, the college's sporting, masculine ethos meant many joined the Royal Air Force. This would contribute significantly to a high death total– 123 for the Allies and 1 for the Germans– more than in the First World War, although proportionately less. Many of Brasenose's sporting heroes died; among survivors were future Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie and cricketer Pieter van der Bijl.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{architecture}} of the town is undistinguished, but there are listed buildings of some importance. The listed churches are All Saints Parish Church and Holy Trinity Church in the centre of the older part of the town, St Mary's in Halton village, St John's in Weston, <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> Church in Weston Point. All Saints' Church, a Grade II* listed building, dates from 1849 and was built by Anthony Salvin in red sandstone. The oldest existing houses are the Seneschal's House in Halton village (1598), Weston Old Hall (1607), Brookfield Farmhouse (1691) and Halton Old Hall (1693). Other outstanding houses include Runcorn Town Hall (formerly Halton Grange), Camden House and Cottage in High Street and Bridgewater House near the ship canal.|$|E
5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> the King. Most {{of these}} festivals {{are tied to}} the {{moveable}} feast of Easter. Festivals take precedence over all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas is considered to be twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost). For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the normal part of the Easter festival for that day.|$|E

5|$|The niches in {{the lowest}} zone of the gable contain nine angels, of which Cockerell {{identifies}} Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, clearly identifiable by the attributes that they carry. The uppermost niches of the gable contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from iconoclasm. A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain cherubim. Christ and the Virgin Mary are also represented by now headless figures in a Coronation of the Virgin in a niche above the central portal. A damaged figure of the Virgin <b>and</b> <b>Christ</b> Child occupies a quatrefoil in the spandrel of the door.|$|E

The seeds of the roselle <b>and</b> <b>Christ’s</b> thorn fruits were procured from Elobeid local market, North Kordofan State, while marula fruits were obtained from Elnuhod, West Kordofan State. The proximate composition of the seeds, cake <b>and</b> <b>christ’s</b> thorn pulp was done. Some chemical and physical properties were performed for the extracted oil. The results revealed that proximate composition of the seeds and cake differ statistically among the studied materials. Significant differences were observed among the oil extracted from these species; moreover, these oils differ significantly in color and viscosity only...|$|R
