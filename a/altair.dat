5|$|<b>Altair</b> is a type-A main {{sequence}} star with approximately 1.8 times {{the mass of}} the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. <b>Altair</b> possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires a little more than 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces <b>Altair</b> to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.|$|E

5|$|The NASA Constellation Program {{announced}} <b>Altair</b> as {{the name}} of the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) on December 13, 2007. The Russian-made Beriev Be-200 <b>Altair</b> seaplane is also named after the star.|$|E
5|$|<b>Altair</b> Airlines was a {{regional}} airline that operated out of Philadelphia from 1966 to 1982.|$|E
5|$|<b>Altair</b> rotates rapidly, with a {{velocity}} at {{the equator}} of approximately 286km/s. This {{is a significant}} fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that <b>Altair</b> is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Pertec {{was eager}} to {{increase}} sales to small businesses through the 26 <b>Altair</b> Computer stores across the United States. The marketing toward hobby/home user was curtailed. The November 1977 issue of the MITS newsletter, Computer Notes, was the last produced by the Albuquerque staff. There was one more issue produced by the Pertec staff in Chatsworth, California. The back cover of the leading home computer magazine, Byte, always carried a full page <b>Altair</b> advertisement. This ended with the September 1977 issue. Roberts and Yates stayed on and worked on special projects.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Altair</b> {{products}} were merged into the Pertec {{line and the}} MITS facility was used to produce the PCC-2000 small-business computer. The Albuquerque plant was closed in December 1980 and the production was moved to Pertec plants in Irvine, California.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} would spawn Microsoft {{initiated}} when Paul Allen showed Bill Gates {{the first of}} January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the <b>Altair</b> 8800. Allen and Gates saw potential to develop an implementation of the programming language BASIC interpreter for the system. Bill Gates called the creators of the new microcomputer, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation {{in order to win}} a contract with the company. Allen and Gates had neither an interpreter nor an <b>Altair</b> system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed an interpreter. When Allen flew to Albuquerque to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute <b>Altair</b> BASIC. Allen and Gates left Boston, where Allen worked for Honeywell and Gates was enrolled in Harvard, moved to Albuquerque (where MITS was located), and co-founded Microsoft there. Revenues of the company totaled $16,005 by the end of 1976.|$|E

5|$|Godbout {{also sold}} {{components}} to Processor Technology for their 4K Static RAM board and serial / parallel interface board. Lee Felsenstein designed an <b>Altair</b> compatible video board that provided 16 lines of 64 {{upper and lower}} case characters on {{a black and white}} television. This $160 board became very popular and led to the Processor Technology Sol-20 Computer in 1976.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the <b>Altair</b> 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the <b>Altair</b> computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2009, July 3, 2009, and August 8, 2009, {{use of the}} NIFS {{integral}} field spectrograph with <b>ALTAIR</b> {{allowed the}} astronomers {{to collect data on}} the spectrum of the faint object and its star. Analysis of the spectra and the objects' astrometry (how the star and the faint object change position in the sky) led to the confirmation of the companion HIP 78530 b.|$|E

50|$|But life is {{possible}} on Tenebra. Although Clement doesn't say so explicitly, Tenebra's plants {{do not use}} photosynthesis. The optical depth of the atmosphere is too great for enough of <b>Altair's</b> light to reach the ground. Instead, Tenebra's plants use chemosynthesis based on the transformation of sulphur oxides. The process is much like that used by plants growing around the hydrothermal vents known as black smokers {{on the bottom of}} Earth's oceans. <b>Altair's</b> abundant ultraviolet radiation, striking the top of Tenebra's atmosphere, restores the balance among the various sulphur oxides.|$|R
5|$|The {{first full}} page {{advertisements}} for the <b>Altair</b> computer {{appeared in the}} February issues of Popular Electronics and Radio-Electronics magazines. Soon MITS was advertising in technical journals such as the IEEE Computer, and general interest magazines such as Scientific American. MITS was also the most prominent advertiser in the new hobbyist computer magazines such as Creative Computing and Byte.|$|E
5|$|This star lies at a vertex of {{a widely}} spaced {{asterism}} called the Summer Triangle, {{which consists of}} Vega plus the two first-magnitude stars <b>Altair,</b> in Aquila, and Deneb in Cygnus. This formation is the approximate shape of a right triangle, with Vega located at its right angle. The Summer Triangle is recognizable in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity.|$|E
5|$|When the January 1975 {{issue of}} Popular Electronics reached readers in mid December 1974, MITS {{was flooded with}} orders. They had to hire extra people just to answer the phones. In February, MITS {{received}} 1,000 orders for the <b>Altair</b> 8800. The quoted delivery time was 60 days but it was many more months before the machines were shipped. By August 1975, they had shipped over 5,000 computers.|$|E
