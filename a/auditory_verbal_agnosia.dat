40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{retrospectively}} analyze the electroclinical features, etiology, treatment, and prognosis of 29 patients with Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS) with a long-term follow-up. MethodsInclusion criteria were a diagnosis of LKS with: (1) acquired aphasia or <b>verbal</b> <b>auditory</b> aphasia; (2) with or without focal seizures, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absences, or atonic seizures. ResultsMean follow-up was 12 years. All cases except six had seizures. Before the onset of aphasia, developmental language and behavioral disturbances were present in 19 and 14 patients, respectively. All patients had <b>verbal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Aphasia was severe in 24 patients and moderate in five. Nonlinguistic cognitive dysfunctions were moderate in 14 patients. Behavioral disturbances were found in 16 patients. During the continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep phase, the spike-wave index was > 85 % in 15, 50 – 85 % in eight, and 30 – 50 % in four. In two patients, the EEG recording showed occasional bilateral spikes, without continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep. In this phase, the awake EEG recording showed more frequent interictal abnormalities, predominantly in the temporal regions. Eight patients recovered language completely, but the remaining patients continue to have language deficits of different degrees. ConclusionLandau–Kleffner syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by acquired <b>verbal</b> <b>auditory</b> aphasia and seizures in most of the patients associated with continuous or almost continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow wave sleep. The most commonly used treatments were clobazam, ethosuximide, sulthiame. High-dose steroids were also administered. Adequate and early management may avoid language and cognitive deterioration...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the possible effects of <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> cues on flavor perception and swallow physiology for younger and elder participants. Apple juice, aojiru (grass) juice, and water were ingested {{with or without}} <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> cues. Flavor perception and ease of swallowing were measured using a visual analog scale and swallow physiology by surface electromyography and cervical auscultation. The <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> cues had significant positive effects on flavor and ease of swallowing {{as well as on}} swallow physiology. The taste score and the ease of swallowing score significantly increased when the participant’s anticipation was primed by accurate <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> cues. There was no significant effect of <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> cues on distaste score. Regardless of age, the maximum suprahyoid muscle activity significantly decreased when a beverage was ingested without <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> cues. The interval between the onset of swallowing sounds and the peak timing point of the infrahyoid muscle activity significantly shortened when the anticipation induced by the cue was contradicted in the elderly participant group. These results suggest that <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> cues can improve the perceived flavor of beverages and swallow physiology...|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> can be {{referred}} to as a pure aphasia because it has a high degree of specificity. Despite an inability to comprehend speech, patients with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> typically retain the ability to hear, speak, read and write. This specificity suggests that there is a separation between speech perception, non-speech auditory processing, and central language processing. In support of this theory, there are cases in which speech and non-speech processing impairments have responded differentially to treatment. For example, some therapies have improved writing comprehension in patients over time, while speech remained critically impaired in those same patients.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> (AVA), {{also known}} as pure word deafness, is the {{inability}} to comprehend speech. Individuals with this disorder lose the ability to understand language, repeat words, and write from dictation. However, spontaneous speaking, reading, and writing are preserved. Individuals who exhibit pure word deafness are also still able to recognize non-verbal sounds. [...] Sometimes, this agnosia is preceded by cortical deafness; however, {{this is not always}} the case. Researchers have documented that in most patients exhibiting <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia,</b> the discrimination of consonants is more difficult than that of vowels, but as with most neurological disorders, there is variation among patients.|$|E

40|$|Decreased {{language}} lateralization is a well-replicated {{finding in}} psychotic patients. It is currently unclear, however, whether this abnormality {{is related to}} a particular symptom of psychosis or to psychosis in general. It {{has been argued that}} decreased language lateralization may be related to <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucinations. To elucidate this, these hallucinations should be studied in isolation. Thirty-five patients with a psychotic disorder, 35 non-psychotic subjects with relatively isolated <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucinations and 35 healthy control subjects participated in this study. All subjects were scanned on a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, while covertly performing a paced verbal fluency task. In order to measure performance on the task, one additional task block was presented during which subjects had to generate words overtly. In addition to calculating language lateralization indices, group-wise brain activation during verbal fluency was compared between the three groups. Task performance was nearly maximal for all groups and did not differ significantly between the groups. Compared with the healthy control subjects and non-psychotic subjects with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucinations, language lateralization was significantly reduced for the patient group. In addition, the patients displayed significantly greater activity in the right precentral gyrus and left insula when compared with the healthy control subjects and the non-psychotic subjects with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucinations. Furthermore, the patients showed greater activity in the right superior parietal lobule when compared with the healthy control subjects. Lateralization indices did not differ significantly between the non-psychotic subjects with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucinations and the healthy control subjects. Moreover, {{there were no significant differences}} in brain activation during verbal fluency between the two non-psychotic groups. As language lateralization was not significantly reduced in the non-psychotic individuals with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucinations, a direct relationship between <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucinations and decreased language lateralization can not be established at present...|$|R

50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> is the {{inability}} to distinguish phonemes. In some patients with unilateral <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia,</b> {{there is evidence that}} the ability to acoustically process speech signals is affected at the prephonemic level, preventing the conversion of these signals into phonemes. There are two predominate hypotheses that address what happens within the language center of the brain in people that have AVA. One of the hypotheses is that an early stage of auditory analysis is impaired. The fact that AVA patients have the ability to read shows that both the semantic system and the speech output lexicon are intact. The second hypotheses suggests that there is either a complete or partial disconnection of the auditory input lexicon from the semantic system. This would suggest that entries in the lexicon can still be activated but they cannot go on to cause subsequent semantic activation. In relation to these two different hypotheses, researchers in one study differentiated between two different types of AVA. According to this study, one form of AVA is a deficit at the prephonemic level and is related to {{the inability}} to comprehend rapid changes in sound. This form of AVA is associated with bilateral temporal lobe lesions. The second type of AVA that the study discusses is a deficit in linguistic discrimination that does not adhere to a prephonemic patter. This form is associated with left unilateral temporal lobe lesions and may even be considered a form of Wernicke's aphasia. Often individuals diagnosed with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> are also incapable of discriminating between non-verbal sounds as well as speech. The underlying problem seems to be temporal in that understanding speech requires the discrimination between specific sounds which are closely spaced in time. Note that this is not unique to speech; studies using non-speech sounds closely spaced in time (dog bark, phone ring, lightning, etc.) have shown that those with <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> are unable to discriminate between those sounds in the majority of cases, though a few putative examples of speech-specific impairment have been documented in the literature.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that {{cortical}} deafness could {{be a part of}} a spectrum of an overall cortical hearing disorder.

40|$|Currently it is {{discussed}} whether the same cortical areas are activated during {{the imagination of}} as during the actual presentation of specific stimuli.

Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} we explored whether <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> imagery of syllables has sufficient power to evoke haemodynamic responses in the auditory cortex. To overcome the detrimental effects of scanner noise, one group of subjects was trained to vividly imagine hearing a syllable while a flashlight was presented. A control group did not receive this training. We found that only the trained group revealed haemodynamic responses in the auditory cortex during auditory imagination while the control group showed no activation within the auditory cortex. Peak activations during <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> imagery are located bilaterally within the superior temporal gyrus region {{in the vicinity of the}} planum temporale.

50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{is caused}} by {{bilateral}} damage to the posterior superior temporal lobes or disruption of connections between these areas. It {{is often associated with}} lesions to the left posterior superior temporal lobe, but no such unilateral case has yet been documented without damage to the white matter tract connecting superior temporal lobes bilaterally or bilateral damage to the superior temporal lobe. In cases where unilateral damage to the left superior temporal lobe has been documented, patients exhibited problems processing both speech and non-speech sounds (in other words, not typical of <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>agnosia).</b> These facts, in combination with the existence of cases of damage to these white matter tracts without detectable cortical damage, in combination with cases of pure word deafness resulting enlargement of the III ventricle alone suggest that the disorder results from damage to the left-right superior temporal circuit rather than the superior temporal area on one hemisphere or the other.|$|E

40|$|Neuronal {{underpinnings}} of <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucination remain poorly understood. One suggested mechanism is brain activation {{that is similar}} to verbal imagery but occurs without the proper activation of the neuronal systems that are required to tag the origins of verbal imagery in one's mind. Such neuronal systems involve the supplementary motor area. The supplementary motor area has been associated with awareness of intention to make a hand movement, but whether this region is related to the sense of ownership of one's verbal thought remains poorly known. We hypothesized that the supplementary motor area is related to the distinction between one's own mental processing (<b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> imagery) and similar processing that is attributed to non-self author (<b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucination). To test this hypothesis, we asked patients to signal the onset and offset of their <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucinations during functional magnetic resonance imaging. During non-hallucination periods, we asked the same patients to imagine the hallucination they had previously experienced. In addition, healthy control subjects signaled the onset and offset of self-paced imagery of similar voices. Both hallucinations and the imagery of hallucinations were associated with similar activation strengths of the fronto-temporal language-related circuitries, but the supplementary motor area was activated more strongly during the imagery than during hallucination. These findings suggest that <b>auditory</b> <b>verbal</b> hallucination resembles verbal imagery in language processing, but without the involvement of the supplementary motor area, which may subserve the sense of ownership of one's own verbal imagery.
