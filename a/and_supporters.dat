5|$|Following the 2008 election, Romney {{laid the}} groundwork for a likely 2012 presidential {{campaign}} by using his Free and Strong America political action committee (PAC) to raise money for other Republican candidates and pay his existing political staff's salaries and consulting fees. A network of former staff <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> around the nation were eager for him to run again.|$|E

5|$|The {{course of}} events {{paved the way for}} Venizelos to return to Athens on 29 May 1917. Greece, now unified, officially joined the war {{on the side of the}} Allies. The entire Greek army was mobilized (though {{tensions}} remained inside the army between supporters of the Constantine <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> of Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the Central Powers on the Macedonian front.|$|E

5|$|These factors {{combined}} with what RF politicians <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> saw as British decadence, chicanery and betrayal {{to create the}} case they put forward that UDI, while dubious legally and likely to provoke international uproar, might nevertheless be in their eyes justifiable and necessary {{for the good of}} the country and region if an accommodation could not be found with Whitehall.|$|E

5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena {{as a candidate for}} governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> of the free coinage of silver. Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term.|$|E
5|$|After the 1836 election, Harrison did {{not really}} stop running for president, nor did his {{supporters}} stop boosting him—an Ohio political convention endorsed him as early as 1837. His finances were somewhat secured by his appointment as clerk of Hamilton County's circuit court, a post that paid no salary, but allowed considerable income from fees. The years between 1838 and 1840 were years of personal tragedy for the general, as three of his adult children died and his wife Anna fell seriously ill. Harrison {{did his best to}} manage a network of acquaintances <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> from his home in North Bend, corresponding extensively and seeking to have items favorable to him placed in the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|As Prince of Wales, George Augustus {{bore the}} royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent. The arms {{included}} the royal crest <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> {{but with the}} single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label. His arms followed {{the change in the}} royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether. The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King.|$|E

5|$|As {{the chief}} aide and closest friend of Emperor Andronikos III, Kantakouzenos became regent for the underage John V upon Andronikos's death in June 1341. While Kantakouzenos was absent from Constantinople in September the same year, a coup d'état led by Alexios Apokaukos and the Patriarch John XIV secured {{the support of}} Empress Anna and {{established}} a new regency. In response, Kantakouzenos' army <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> proclaimed him co-emperor in October, cementing the rift {{between himself and the}} new regency. The split immediately escalated into armed conflict.|$|E
5|$|Because the Lithuanians did {{not have}} a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt for the end of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to the Lithuanians. On September 21, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> and arrested them in the following days. The PMO branch in Lithuania ceased to function and was liquidated.|$|E

Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, who had crowned Bruce, was suspended in a cage outside of Berwick Castle for four years. Bruce's younger brother Neil was executed by being hanged, drawn, and quartered; he had been captured after he and his garrison held off Edward's forces who had been seeking Bruce's wife (Elizabeth), daughter Marjorie, sisters Mary and Christina, and Isabella.|$|E

5|$|In the {{critical}} November 1946 election {{to select the}} first ever deputies to represent Madagascar at the French National Assembly, MDRM accused the French administration of stuffing ballot boxes, tampering with electoral rolls, intimidating MDRM candidates <b>and</b> <b>supporters,</b> and blatantly falsifying election results to ensure PADESM victory. Despite these irregularities, MDRM won 71 percent of the vote, {{and none of the}} PADESM candidates was elected. While MDRM won decisive victories in the central and eastern province, results were close in the western province, where the MDRM candidate Joseph Raseta won 21,475 votes and the PADESM candidate Totelehibe won 19,014 votes.|$|E
5|$|John of Fordun {{wrote that}} Duncan's wife fled Scotland, taking her children, {{including}} the future kings Malcolm III (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada) and Donald III (Domnall Bán mac Donnchada, or Donalbane) with her. On {{the basis of}} the author's beliefs as to whom Duncan married, various places of exile, Northumbria and Orkney among them, have been proposed. However, E. William Robertson proposes the safest place for Duncan's widow and her children would be with her or Duncan's kin <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> in Atholl.|$|E
5|$|Mark Antony was {{amassing}} political support, but Octavian {{still had}} opportunity to rival {{him as the}} leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, however, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts {{to get rid of}} Antony.|$|E
