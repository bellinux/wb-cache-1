50|$|The Hamilton Volunteer Fire Department {{held its}} first {{organized}} meeting in July 1944, {{and a year later}} purchased its first fire truck. In January 1946, it moved into its firehouse which, with remodeling and additions, is still in use. HVFD has an <b>attack</b> <b>pumper,</b> a pumper/tanker, a brush truck and a light and air unit. It has a BLS non-transport license to provide EMS assistance and over a dozen of its average of 30 active members are qualified 1st Responders or EMTs. In 2000, HVFD and the Hamilton Volunteer Rescue Squad together purchased 10 acre of land to build the Hamilton Public Safety Center where both companies are housed. Many Company 5 personnel run with HVRS or help staff Rescue 617. ALS 601, a career unit, is also housed at station 5/17, in addition to career staffing during weekdays from 0600−1800 hrs. In October 2013, HVFC requested immediate 7−12 career support, meaning that county staff would run 7 nights week, instead of the prior 5, with 24/7 support requested as soon as possible. Additionally in October, ALS 601 that had been running out of Station 17 along with a career ambulance during the day, instituted a new policy where the ALS providers for ALS 601 will cross-staff a medic unit. This means that if an ALS call goes out in Hamilton's first due, Medic 617 will take the call, but if it is outside of Hamilton's first due, ALS 601 will take the call, placing M617 out of service. In May 2014, HVFC requested immediate emergency staffing due to an inadequate number of volunteers, which LCFR fulfilled. This means that HVFC is now staffed 24/7 by LCFR personnel with some assistance from HVFC.|$|E
