5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I knew that I was, but it’s <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
25|$|This video {{features}} Björk morphing into a {{polar bear}} - and proves that she's {{willing to do}} anything to push herself artistically. And the beauty of Hunter is its utter simplicity. It's about a woman who allows the animal within to take over when necessary. The provider - in a cold world. It's <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> after all these years people still don't understand it. Mission accomplished.|$|E
25|$|Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, {{commented that}} “it was <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> Tommy Greenhough played Test cricket at all. As a young player with Lancashire, {{he took a}} job in a cotton mill during the winter and fell from a gantry. Both ankles were badly broken and his feet ended up {{different}} sizes”. Bateman went on “he overcame his handicap {{to become one of the}} most inventive leg-break bowlers in the country, performing well when called up in 1959. He could, however, lose confidence, as happened on the 1960 tour of the West Indies, where he did not play a Test”.|$|E

25|$|I find it <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> {{he wrote}} this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, {{it seems to be}} in line with a more modern {{understanding}} of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.|$|E
500|$|About {{two thirds}} of Du Fu's 1500 extant works are in this form, and he is {{generally}} considered to be its leading exponent. His best lǜshi use the parallelisms required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions. Hawkes comments that, [...] "it is <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner".|$|E
500|$|Bågenholm {{returned}} to work in October 1999. On 7 October 1999–140 days after the accident—she {{returned to}} the hospital in Tromsø and met the doctors and nurses that helped save her life. Bågenholm commented: [...] "When you are a patient, you're not thinking you are going to die. You think, I'm going to make it. But as a medical person, I think it's <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> I'm alive." [...] As of October 2009, Bågenholm has made an almost full recovery, although minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury remain. In late 2009, she was working as a radiologist at the hospital where her life was saved.|$|E

500|$|Zelda Fitzgerald's {{collected}} writings (including Save Me the Waltz), {{edited by}} Matthew J. Bruccoli, {{were published in}} 1991. New York Times literary critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, [...] "That the novel was written in two months is <b>amazing.</b> <b>That</b> for all its flaws it still manages to charm, amuse and move the reader is even more remarkable. Zelda Fitzgerald succeeded, in this novel, in conveying her own heroic desperation to succeed at something of her own, and she also managed to distinguish herself as a writer with, as Edmund Wilson once said of her husband, a 'gift for turning language into something iridescent and surprising.'" ...|$|E
500|$|All eight capital {{ships of}} the 1909–1910 Naval Programme {{had the same}} {{arrangement}} of masts and funnels; only the two battlecruisers had their foremast and forward funnel positions exchanged at considerable expense. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It is <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> {{it took so long}} to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the DNO's insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships." ...|$|E
500|$|Film {{aggregate}} review site Metacritic {{gave the}} third season 77 out of 100 based on six critical reviews, indicating the critical reception was [...] "generally favorable". Critic Josh Wigler, writing for Comic Book Resources, lauded the season's first two episodes, explaining [...] "For the third {{season of the}} critically acclaimed Fox series, executive producers and co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman have responded to their audience's demands by creating {{a new kind of}} episode: the mythalone, designed to propel the story and characters forward while still keeping the show accessible to new viewers on a weekly basis... it's nothing short of <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> the new mythalone approach to Fringe works wonders, if only in the first two episodes of the new season." ...|$|E

500|$|They {{thought of}} using David Glen Eisley's song [...] "Sweet Victory" [...] {{for the final}} act. He said [...] "It was {{different}} than what we were looking for, {{but it was so}} <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> we knew we had to use it. So we boarded the sequence to the music, and it felt like such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a freeze-frame shot for the ending. Greenblatt's favorite part was director Springer's drawings of Patrick on the electric drums and SpongeBob saying, [...] "It's the thrill of one more kill" [...] (an excerpt from [...] "Sweet Victory"). [...] The live action Bubble Bowl crowd is footage from a United States Football League game featuring the Memphis Showboats and the Tampa Bay Bandits.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{few things}} {{retained}} from earlier ships was the position of the tripod foremast with its spotting top behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the boat-handling derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable at times, but the Board of Admiralty insisted on it for all the ships of the 1909–1910 Programme. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It is <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> it took so long to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO)'s insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally it wasn't {{going to}} have {{anything}} to do with that, but people were looking through my photo albums this year. My father and I had made some photo albums together of his relatives and different people in the family. A couple people saw [...] and they were like, 'This is <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> you have this.' I guess everybody was like, 'How would you feel about this type of concept ?' So I guess I thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{is one of}} the longest-serving in British soap, coming third behind Ken Barlow and [...] Emily Bishop in a 1998 survey assessing character episode appearances in Coronation Street's history. In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been a wonderful experience and I feel very glad I was able to stick around for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Reading is Fundamental", Castiel is awakened {{when the}} Word of God – a tablet with {{information}} inscribed by an angel as dictated by God – is found by Sam and Dean. Although his torment has driven him insane, {{he explains that}} taking on Sam's pain has helped relieve some of his past burdens. He then explains what the Word of God is, but is unable to read it. Two angels from his former garrison arrive in pursuit of Kevin, a prophet who was awakened by the Word of God and drawn to it. The angel Hester tries to kill Castiel out of anger for his past actions, but she is instead killed by Meg. The other angel offers Castiel the chance to return to Heaven with him, but Castiel declines, explaining that he feels he no longer belongs there. The other angel then leaves, taking Kevin away to safety. Castiel comments to the Winchesters that he finds it <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> {{he does not know}} what he is going to do next, and teleports away after giving them his blood.|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Raine Maida {{first brought}} {{up the idea of}} a concept album after {{excerpts}} from the book began influencing his songwriting. Passing time on the road, he had amassed a backlog of songs and had begun to record demos. He jokingly suggested an album title of Kurzweil. [...] "That was not the most graceful sounding name in the world, so we went with Spiritual Machines instead," [...] Turner said. While the other band-members were less enthusiastic about the idea due to its weighty subject matter, Maida and Turner decided to pursue it and Turner contacted Ray Kurzweil via email to ask for permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil's excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album and a correspondence developed. “I think it’s <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> Ray Kurzweil sent us a bunch of pieces, and for whatever reason, they really tie in with {{what we were trying to}} say on this record,” said Maida.|$|E

500|$|Rosenblat {{was given}} the storyline that ties up the second season. The scenes feature Miss Rosa being told that {{she is going to}} die from her cancer. Fellow inmate and prison van driver Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) feels sorry for her and exits the van urging Miss Rosa to escape. The final scene {{features}} Miss Rosa driving away when she notices Vee also making an escape from prison. Recalling an earlier altercation with Vee, Miss Rosa careens the vehicle at Vee killing her instantly. Rosenblat told Silman that she joyfully screamed in the bathroom for five minutes when she learned of her character's actions. She added [...] "After all this effort {{to get rid of this}} woman, just evil incarnate, you know, and then I stroll along in my van. [...] 'So rude, that one.' <b>Amazing.</b> <b>That</b> final scene was really great." [...] During the scene Miss Rosa morphs into her younger incarnation as she becomes free once again. Rosenblat recalled the logistics of filming having to swap backwards and forth with Andujar to create the same position behind the wheel.|$|E
500|$|Both Jim Uttley of Indian Life Newspaper and Pastor Jamie Bagley of The News of Cumberland County called Nefarious [...] "hard-hitting". Uttley further {{asserted}} that Nefarious [...] "is {{not an easy}} film to watch because it deals with a subject {{that most of us}} would rather ignore", and he went on to highly recommend the film. Jimmy Stewart of Charisma reported that the film gives a human face to trafficking statistics and instils a desire in the viewer {{to put an end to}} such criminal activity. Ted Baehr of Movieguide, a Christian magazine, called the film [...] "a powerful, compelling and transformational documentary about human trafficking and sex slavery" [...] and wrote that it was <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> the film covered an inherently sexual topic both honestly and without nudity. Baehr praised the cinematography, editing, and filmmaking, but criticized some portions of the film as being repetitive and uncompelling. The Movieguide review ends by comparing the film's opposition to modern slavery to the death of Saint Telemachus, which put an end to gladiatorial games in ancient Rome. Erica Yunghans of Star News Daily called the film [...] "controversial".|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{expressed}} her amazement at the single's {{success in}} India. She said, [...] "I am so overwhelmed! I can't {{even begin to}} explain what I'm feeling... it's so <b>amazing</b> <b>that</b> it's been {{just a few days}} since launch and my debut single is now number one on the charts. Thank you so much for the support and appreciation. This means the world to me." [...] At the fourth Nokia Music Connect video conference, Chopra said that the commercial numbers for [...] "In My City" [...] were all the more surprising, since the music sales in the Indian market is not that much. Universal Music MD, India, Saarc Devraj Sanyal said that the label was surprised with the instant sales of the song. [...] "We have been in the non-film music business for a while and I must admit to mounting engines across all platforms that have been fired like never before on Priyanka's global single debut. But to see these results so quickly is beyond gratifying," [...] Sanyal said, before saying that the single debut would be followed by many promotional campaigns targeting different multimedia facets.|$|E
