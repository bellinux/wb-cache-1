25|$|Baroness Susan Greenfield, {{a leading}} neuroscientist, wanted a wide-ranging inquiry in the House of Lords into the {{dramatic}} increase in the diagnosis of ADHD in the UK and its possible causes. This followed a BBC Panorama programme in 2007 which highlighted US research (The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD by the University of Buffalo showing treatment results of 600) suggesting drugs <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than therapy for ADHD in the long-term. In the UK medication use is increasing dramatically. Other notable individuals have made controversial statements about ADHD. Terence Kealey, a clinical biochemist and vice-chancellor of University of Buckingham, has stated his belief that ADHD medication is used to control unruly boys and girls behavior.|$|E

25|$|The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, {{holder of}} the Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lineages, in a 2008 talk {{delivered}} to LGBT Dharma practitioners at the Shambhala Meditation Center of New York, stressed that for vajrayana lay practitioners, homosexual relationships <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> {{or worse than}} heterosexual relationships and that only unhealthy relationships in general are to be avoided. Both the Nalandabodhi sangha, which was founded by The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, and the Shambhala sanghas founded by Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche have stated that they are welcoming of all sexual orientations. The Shambhala Meditation Center of New York hosts a weekly practice group, Queer Dharma, specifically catering {{to the needs of}} the LGBTQ Buddhist community. According to the Danish Karma Kagyu Lama Ole Nydahl, Buddha saw homosexuality as circumstances making life more difficult, but also explained the reason for homosexuality could be aversion against the opposite sex in a former life. Nydahl says however that sexual orientation is not really important in order to practice Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

500|$|From {{the early}} drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made {{the issue of}} racial {{prejudice}} central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront {{the question of the}} Americans' racism. As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, [...] "if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up". In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal. [...] Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.|$|E
500|$|While some critics, such as writer Christopher Hitchens, {{psychologist}} Steven Pinker and Nobel laureates Sir Harold Kroto, James D. Watson and Steven Weinberg have defended Dawkins's {{stance on}} religion and praised his work, others, including Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Peter Higgs, astrophysicist Martin Rees, philosopher of science Michael Ruse, literary critic Terry Eagleton, and theologian Alister McGrath, have criticised Dawkins on various grounds, including the assertion that his work simply serves as an atheist counterpart to religious fundamentalism rather than a productive critique of it, {{and that he has}} fundamentally misapprehended the foundations of the theological positions he claims to refute. Rees and Higgs, in particular, have both rejected Dawkins's confrontational stance towards religion as narrow and [...] "embarrassing", with Higgs going as far as to equate Dawkins with the religious fundamentalists he criticises. Atheist philosopher John Gray has denounced Dawkins as an [...] "anti-religious missionary" [...] whose assertions are [...] "in no sense novel or original," [...] suggesting that, [...] "transfixed in wonderment at the workings of his own mind, Dawkins misses much that is of importance in human beings." [...] Gray has also criticised Dawkins's perceived allegiance to Darwin, stating that if [...] "science, for Darwin, was a method of inquiry that enabled him to edge tentatively and humbly toward the truth, for Dawkins, science is an unquestioned view of the world." [...] In response to his critics, Dawkins maintains that theologians <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than scientists in addressing deep cosmological questions and that he himself is not a fundamentalist as he is willing to change his mind in the face of new evidence.|$|E

A more recent meta-analysis that included randomized controlled trials published after the Cochrane review found that low-carbohydrate, non-energy-restricted diets appear {{to be at least}} as effective as low-fat, energy-restricted diets in inducing weight loss for up to 1 year. These results can be understood because weight loss is mainly governed by daily caloric deficit and not by the particular foods eaten. However, when low-carbohydrate diets to induce weight loss are considered, potential favorable changes in triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values should be weighed against potential unfavorable changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values." ...|$|E

Ultimately, this was also intended as a commentary on the state of Weimar Germany; underneath that facade of prosperity and happiness, lay corruption and savagery. Under Brecht's (and to some extent Weill's) Marxist-influenced view of capitalism, it is created to provide people the goods and services they need, but it does so at the expense of reducing everything to a mere commodity. Furthermore, since obtaining wealth in capitalism is a cutthroat enterprise, the powerful <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> than a gang of bandits, and the law in turn is run by such thugs.|$|E

2500|$|According to Roy Strong, Fear of {{the wrong}} use and {{perception}} of the visual image dominates the Elizabethan age. The old pre-Reformation idea of images, religious ones, was that they partook of {{the essence of what}} they depicted. Any advance in technique which could reinforce that experience was embraced. That was now reversed, indeed it may account for the Elizabethans failing to take cognisance of the optical advances which created the art of the Italian Renaissance. They certainly knew about these things but, and this is central {{to the understanding of the}} Elizabethans, chose not to employ them. Instead the visual arts retreated in favour of presenting a series of signs or symbols through which the viewer was meant to pass to an understanding of the idea behind the work. In this manner the visual arts were verbalised, turned into a form of book, a 'text' which called for reading by the onlooker. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> examples of this than the quite extraordinary portraits of the queen herself, which increasingly, as the reign progressed, took on the form of collections of abstract pattern and symbols disposed in an unnaturalistic manner for the viewer to unravel, and by doing so enter into an inner vision of the idea of monarchy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{of those}} who have been labeled [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] object to the designation, arguing that the term implies that {{disagreement}} or criticism of Mormonism stems from some inherent [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] prejudice, rather than being part of a legitimate factual or religious debate. Eric Johnson, for example, makes a distinction between [...] "personal animosity and intellectual dialogue". Johnson insists that he is motivated by [...] "love and compassion for Mormons", and that while he [...] " [...] plead guilty to being against Mormonism", he finds the suggestion that he is anti-Mormon [...] "both offensive and inaccurate." [...] Stephen Cannon elaborates,It is also helpful to know that Mormons are a group of people united around a belief system. Therefore, to be [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] is to be against people. Christians who desire to communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Mormons are never to come against people of any stripe. Yes, evangelical Christians do have strong disagreements with Mormonism, but the argument is with a belief system and not a people. The LDS people <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> or no worse than any other group of people. Any dispute is to be a disagreement with the [...] "ism", not the [...] "Mormon".|$|E

In the UK, Susan Greenfield spoke out publicly in 2007 in the House of Lords about the need for a wide-ranging inquiry into the dramatic increase in the diagnosis of ADHD, and possible causes.
