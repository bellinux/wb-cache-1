A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{literature}} {{shows that there}} is very limited empirical research into the factors that impact <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> ISO 10303, <b>the</b> Standard for <b>the</b> Exchange <b>of</b> Product Data (STEP). In particular no study has looked specifically at <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> STEP in <b>the</b> defence environment. Therefore, this paper seeks to identify factors that have impacted <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> STEP within <b>the</b> UK Ministry <b>of</b> Defence (MoD). A multi-case study approach is used to contrast <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> STEP, with <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> a regional and UK national defence standard within the MoD. This approach was taken to identify the factors that are unique to <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> STEP and <b>the</b> factors that are common to <b>the</b> general <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> standards within <b>the</b> MoD.
