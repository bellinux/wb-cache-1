500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only." ...|$|E
2500|$|About 2a.m. on {{the morning}} of May 18, 1936, as Ishida was asleep, Abe wrapped her sash twice around his neck and strangled him to death. She later told police, [...] "After I had killed Ishida I felt totally at ease, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from my shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of clarity." [...] After lying with Ishida's body for a few hours, she next severed his {{genitalia}} with the kitchen knife, wrapped them in a magazine cover, and kept them until her arrest three days later. With the blood she wrote [...] on Ishida's left thigh, and on a bed sheet. She then carved 定 ("Sada", the character for her name) into his left arm. After putting on Ishida's underwear, she left the inn at about 8a.m., telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 July 2003, {{at the age}} of 18, Goodrem was {{diagnosed}} with Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was forced to put all working commitments on hold while undertaking treatment for the disease. In an exclusive interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, Goodrem revealed that, since 2002, she had suffered from a head-to-toe rash, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and a lump on her neck. [...] "I was doing sit-ups when I felt something pop in my neck. I reached down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> small lump at the base of my throat. It wasn't sore, it wasn't visible, but I could feel it." [...] As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy. The news of her diagnosis made newspaper and television headlines and an outpouring of support was shown by fans and the general public alike. Goodrem thanked them during The Visualise Tour for all the letters and well wishes she received.|$|E
60|$|It weaned me of all further {{desire to}} rail at Mary, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{uncommon}} drawing to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] Jeanne answered, [...] "only {{you asked}} me <b>a</b> question, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> irresistible desire to answer you truthfully. It would have come sooner or later." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{bombardment}} became furious, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> uncomfortable {{disposition to}} shrink as <b>I</b> heard <b>and</b> saw shot and shell falling {{everywhere in the}} streets, piercing the houses, and bursting in them. Many of these were speedily reduced to ruins.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the race}} ended, the pit lane {{atmosphere}} became turbulent when a visibly angered Buemi went to Félix da Costa and {{accused him of}} braking his car's steering in the second turn. When Félix da Costa replied he had not made contact, Buemi walked to his teammate Frijns and engaged in a heated argument. Frijns argued he the choices he had were either to hitting Buemi's rear-wing or driving around {{the outside of the}} driver. He threatened to drive into Buemi's rear-end the next time he was anywhere near him. Buemi confronted Abt shortly after and accused the latter of hitting him deliberately. When Buemi walked away, he turned to Abt and called him [...] "a dirty guy". More than half an hour after the rant, Buemi called Audi Sport Abt [...] "a dirty team" [...] through the press and claimed the company went beyond what was allowed in the rules. Frijns was perplexed by Buemi's confrontation as he was expecting to be thanked by Buemi and believed he avoided being caught up in a more serious incident in the opening lap, [...] "I had actually already taken him before I turned in <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> small touch on the left rear but nothing much. Then five or six laps later he was behind me and I chose to let him go so I don’t know what he is crying about." [...] Ten days after the ePrix, Buemi apologised to his team and both Andretti drivers on Twitter.|$|E
60|$|Her voice trembled a little, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> brute even to hesitate.|$|E
60|$|She broke off, {{as though}} expecting {{me to say}} something, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little awkward.|$|E
60|$|Ham {{glanced at}} me, <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> shock {{that struck me}} back.|$|R
60|$|I {{had never}} seen a fair of any consequence, and my curiosity was Powerfully awakened by this bustle of preparation. I gazed with respect and wonder at the vagrant personages who {{accompanied}} these caravans. I loitered about the village inn, listening with curiosity and delight to the slang talk and cant jokes of the showmen and their followers; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> eager desire to witness this fair, which my fancy decked out as something wonderfully fine.|$|R
60|$|My spirit quailed {{under those}} last words; <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> immense relief {{at the same}} time, as if some {{overwhelming}} burden had been lifted from me.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked around}} at the others. Harry beamed approval, Johnston nodded indifferently, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> thrill of {{satisfaction}} as I turned to the railroad autocrat.|$|E
60|$|A tear {{burst from}} out its source and fell upon the {{emaciated}} hand of my father. He {{looked at me}} wistfully, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> slight pressure that denoted affection.|$|E
60|$|My {{heart beat}} faster, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> choking {{sensation}} at the throat the moment I heard the priest unconsciously mention my Christian name in mentioning the dying man's last words.|$|E
5000|$|He wrote, [...] "When I saw {{the first}} tower cascade down into that {{enormous}} plume of dust and paper, {{there was a little}} voice inside me that said, 'Yeah!' When the second tower came down the same way, that little voice said, 'Beautiful!' When the visage of the Pentagon appeared on the TV with a gaping and smoking hole in its side, that little voice had nearly taken me over, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> urge to pump my fist in the air" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had always}} been fond of female society. My experience, however, had {{hitherto}} been among the rough daughters of the backwoodsmen; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> awe of young ladies in 'store clothes,' and delicately brought up. Two or three of the married ladies of Bardstown, who had heard me at the debating club, determined that I was a genius and undertook to bring me out. I believe I really improved under their hands; became quiet where I had been shy or sulky, <b>and</b> easy where <b>I</b> had been impudent.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no--I--er--I am sure I am not," [...] stammered Job Haskers, yet {{in secret}} he pinched himself to make certain. [...] "I was--er--in bed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> earthquake--the bed swayed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> heard a cry----" [...] The teacher stopped suddenly. [...] "Perhaps {{it was those}} rascally boys!" [...] he cried, abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} this visit," [...] he said, [...] "when I found that you recognized my voice; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> deep assurance in my breast, that Alice Dunscombe would never betray me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my dear, don't be angry; I {{was only}} teasing you in fun. Tom took {{it into his}} foolish head that {{something}} was going on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> natural interest, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|So, when my {{brother-in-law}} announced his intention of going away incog. to parts unknown, on the succeeding Saturday, Amelia <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> flush of relief from long-continued tension. Especially Amelia--who {{was not going}} with him.|$|E
6000|$|If the damsel had said, [...] "ten to-night," [...] <b>I</b> {{should have}} <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> grim satisfaction, in the {{fulfillment}} of my own dark prophecy; but she said, [...] "At two, mum;" [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>a</b> personal insult.|$|R
5000|$|When {{she left}} school Lucy {{went to a}} {{finishing}} school in Paris and the time came {{for her to be}} formally received into the Wesleyan community. To her mother’s horror, she refused. Her mother wept and implored, told her she was [...] "lost", but Lucy remained adamant. [...] "Yet as I stepped out of the fold into the unknown I repeated privately to myself, ‘He shall keep my soul until that day’. I knew I was in search, not in denial. The abandonment of one’s father’s faith is a deep fear <b>and</b> sorrow <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> outsider." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found my}} old {{sweetheart}} {{sitting in a}} low chair by the fire, a man standing on the hearthrug pulling his moustache. Emily <b>and</b> <b>I</b> both <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> thrill of old delight at meeting.|$|R
60|$|Seti {{leaned on}} my {{shoulder}} looking at the empty bed, and at the scared nurse who still sat behind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> tear drop upon my hand. Old Bakenkhonsu lifted his massive face, and looked at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had nothing}} to say. I was {{surprised}} myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> childish curiosity {{to see what would}} happen. But the sergeant was thinking of the difficulty of controlling Gaspar Ruiz when the time for making an example would come.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{rose from}} his office chair, and I got up, too. My head swam, {{there was no doubt}} about it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> certain {{heaviness}} of limbs as if they had grown bigger since I had sat down on that chair. I made my bow.|$|E
60|$|But {{directly}} my {{eyes had}} rested on my ship all my fear vanished. It went off swiftly, {{like a bad}} dream. Only that a dream leaves no shame behind it, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> momentary shame at my unworthy suspicions.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} his tired face, at the car thick with dust, at the Chinese {{ambassador}} already nodding in his corner, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> smiled to myself. It was very certain {{to me that they}} had run from London without stopping, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> intense curiosity as to their destination. However, I said no more to them. I made my adieux to Delora, and bowed profoundly to the Chinese ambassador, who opened his eyes in time solemnly to return my farewell. The chauffeur was already in his place, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> stopped to speak to him. I saw Delora spring forward and whistle down the speaking-tube, but my question was already asked.|$|R
60|$|Makely rather faltered in conclusion, {{as if he}} {{were not}} quite {{satisfied}} with his remark, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> distinctly <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> want of proportion in it; but I did not wish to say anything. His wife had no reluctance.|$|R
60|$|Cleopatra went, {{and for a}} while I lay silent, {{gathering}} up my strength to speak. But Charmion came and stood over me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> great tear fall from her dark eyes upon my face, as the first heavy drop of rain falls from a thunder cloud.|$|E
60|$|We reached our {{destination}} {{in a few}} moments and had no difficulty in obtaining seats. It was all new to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little bewildered as I endeavoured to follow the performance. I soon had enough of that. The piece was a screaming farce, vulgar and stupid.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, [...] "that I was {{a little}} lonely. You see I know none of these people. I am a stranger, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little out of my element. And then--then he came by with you, and--well, I wished I were in his place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it so wonderful?" [...] she answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, I was not sleepy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>a</b> little walk. You can go back now, Bryan," [...] she said, turning to her maid. [...] "Mr. Mannering will see me home." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{something}} {{seemed to}} break in my breast; blood gushed from my mouth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fell on the sand <b>and</b> gravel. Footsteps <b>I</b> heard of men running to us. I lifted my hand faintly and waved it, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> hand on my face.|$|R
5000|$|Edwards was court-martialled on 17 September 1792 for {{the loss}} of the Pandora. Immediately prior to the proceedings, he {{submitted}} to the Admiralty his account of the events leading up to the sinking. All of his officers supported Edwards' contention that the frigate had been lost due to circumstances beyond anyone's control. [...] The court-martial was attended by William Dillon, then a midshipman, who later became a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and described Edwards in his memoirs as a [...] "fine, venerable- looking officer. His appearance completely absorbed all my attention during the trial, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> inward satisfaction at the result, after all the hardships and dangers he had overcome".|$|R
