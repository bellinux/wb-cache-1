Celeborn is said (in <b>Appendix</b> <b>A)</b> to have added most of southern Mirkwood to the realm of Lórien at the end of the Third Age, but elsewhere Tolkien wrote that Celeborn dwelt for a while in Lindon before at last leaving Middle-earth for Valinor.|$|E

25|$|The {{value of}} the short Vita Tibulli, found {{at the end of}} the Ambrosian, Vatican and {{inferior}} manuscripts, has been much discussed. There is little in it that we could not infer from Tibullus himself and from what Horace says about Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius's book De Poetis. It is another moot question of some importance whether our poet should be identified with the Albius of Horace (Od. i. 33; Epist. i. 4), as is done by the Horatian commentator Pomponius Porphyrion (AD 200-250) in his Scholia.

[...] If The X-Files were a Lord of the Rings-length novel, then [...] "Jose Chung's" [...] would be its first <b>appendix,</b> <b>a</b> source that is at once in love with the main text and critical of it, a place where real human concerns creep {{around the edges of the}} show's chilly implausibilities." [...] VanDerWerff's colleague Zack Handlen wrote that the episode was [...] "brilliant", but he did not feel it was as satisfying as he anticipated because it did not contribute to the series as a whole. Review website IGN named it the fourth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series, writing, [...] "it was 'Jose Chung's From Outer Space in Season 3 that showed that X-Files could create a true comedy masterpiece that almost completely broke away from the show's usual format and tone."
