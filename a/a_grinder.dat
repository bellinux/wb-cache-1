25|$|Mining {{operations}} use crushers, commonly {{classified by}} {{the degree to which}} they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally rockbreakers are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in <b>a</b> <b>grinder.</b> A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a ball mill. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.|$|E
25|$|Russian food {{historian}} William Pokhlyobkin {{claimed that}} chicken Kiev {{was invented in}} 1912 as Novo-Mikhailovskaya kotleta in а St. Petersburg Merchants' Club located near the Mikhailovsky palace, and was renamed kotleta po-kiyevski in 1947 by a Soviet restaurant. However, these claims collide with primary sources. The cookbook by Alexandrova-Ignatieva (including editions before and after 1912) describes indeed Novo-Mikhailovsky cutlets and mentions that they were invented in the club near the Mikhailovsky palace. However, in the provided recipe these cutlets are made from minced meat similarly to the Pozharsky cutlet, with the only difference being the meat pounded by a tenderizer until it gets minced. This allows one to remove tendons from the meat and results in a more tender consistency of the ground meat than after the use of <b>a</b> <b>grinder.</b> The author also remarks that not only breasts but also other parts of chicken can be prepared this way and added to the mixture of meat and butter.|$|E

500|$|Bégin's {{father taught}} his son that his {{best chance of}} making a career in hockey was as a {{defensive}} specialist and impressed on him {{the need for a}} strong work ethic. [...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as <b>a</b> <b>grinder,</b> willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, I really believe that there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL. [...] I always admired the way that he played. I look at the spirit, the leadership. Pretty amazing what he’s done for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In ice hockey, <b>a</b> <b>grinder</b> is {{a player}} {{better known for}} his hard work and {{checking}} than his scoring. <b>A</b> <b>grinder</b> is often a player who has limited offensive skills, but is valuable to a hockey team due to physical forechecking skills especially along the boards; for [...] "grinding along the boards". The grinder {{is not in the}} spotlight as would be the offensively skilled scoring stars, but they are often fan favorites due to their work effort in games. Thus the grinder is often the player who, by their willingness to endure the physical abuse of going into the corners to dig out the puck, often sets up the goals (passing the puck) for the team's offensive stars. It is common belief in hockey that a good team needs a balance of scoring stars and grinders.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> blade <b>grinder</b> may be {{considered}} a type of hammermill. <b>A</b> blade <b>grinder</b> resembles <b>a</b> meat <b>grinder</b> in that both have propeller-shaped cutting blades. However, meat grinders (and food mills) use a scissor cutting action as the blades rotate against a perforated metal plate. Meat grinder blades rotate at a much slower speed than blade grinders, which may rotate at speeds as high as 20,000 to 30,000 rpm; {{an example is the}} Preethi Steele mixer-grinder, whose no-load speed is 23500 rpm and loaded speed is 11500rpm.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{less common}} method for {{creating}} sparks {{is heating up}} the sample to red heat and then applying compressed air to the sample. The compressed air supplies enough oxygen to ignite the sample and give off sparks. This method is more accurate than using <b>a</b> <b>grinder</b> because it will always give off sparks of the same length for the same sample. The compressed air applies in essence the same [...] "pressure" [...] each time. This makes observations of the spark length a much more reliable characteristic for comparison.|$|E
2500|$|While grinder often {{refers to}} a player of lesser {{offensive}} skills, {{this is not always}} the case. NHL Hall of Fame inductee Bobby Clarke of the 1970s and 80s Philadelphia Flyers was considered <b>a</b> <b>grinder,</b> but was also a highly productive offensive player. [...] While a [...] "grinder" [...] plays a physical style of hockey they are distinguished from an [...] "enforcer", whose role is more physical intimidation and engaging in fights which are not within the rules of hockey. A [...] "grinder" [...] refers specifically to a style of defensive hockey which is within the rules of the game. Sometimes grinder is used in combination with [...] "mucker" [...] to describe a player as a [...] "mucker and a grinder", although it is used as emphasis. In this context, mucker is largely synonymous with grinder.|$|E

In this veil of light the near edge of the shore alone stood out almost coal-black with an opaque and motionless solidity. Thirty miles away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon, its outlines and shades of blue, faint and tremulous like a background painted on airy gossamer on the quivering fabric of an impalpable curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil; and the openings of the estuary appeared, shining white, like bits of silver let into the square pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body of the land bordered with mangroves.|$|E
