30|$|At the {{termination}} of the string, the forward and reverse travelling waves must sum {{in a particular way}} to satisfy the imposed boundary condition. For example, if one termination is open, power flow is equal to zero, then the sum of the reverse travelling wave and the forward travelling wave must be zero at the boundary which means they are opposite number. This case is equivalent to <b>a</b> negative <b>reflection</b> in power flow and <b>a</b> positive <b>reflection</b> in frequency. If the string of generators is connected to a so-called infinite bus at which the frequency remains constant, then the forward travelling wave in frequency must be <b>a</b> negative <b>reflection</b> of the reverse travelling wave. This is equivalent to <b>a</b> positive <b>reflection</b> for power flow and <b>a</b> negative <b>reflection</b> in frequency.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>reflection</b> {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its {{reciprocal}} lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Aaliyah is an R and neo soul {{record with}} music drawing from funk, hip hop, {{alternative}} rock, and electronica, among other styles. The producers incorporated synthesizer melodies, fragmented beats, distorted guitar, and eccentrically manipulated vocals and song structures.

Most of the songs were written by lyricist Static Major, who shared a close friendship and strong rapport with Aaliyah. She viewed the album as <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> of herself as both a young adult and a matured vocalist.|$|E
5|$|Also of {{historical}} importance were the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms {{to the south}} of the Kongo Empire, in the Ambundu area. Additionally, the Lunda Empire, in the south-east of the present day DRC, occupied a portion of what today is north-eastern Angola. In the south of the territory, and the north of present-day Namibia, lay the Kwanyama kingdom, along with minor realms on the central highlands. All these political units were <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> of ethnic cleavages that slowly developed among the Bantu populations, and were instrumental in consolidating these cleavages and fostering the emergence of new and distinct social identities.|$|E

This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E

5|$|Edler {{plays in}} the style of an {{offensive}} defenseman. One of his strongest offensive assets is his slapshot. At the Canucks' 2008 SuperSkills event, he beat the team's reigning hardest shooter, Sami Salo, with a 99.3 mile-per-hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010, as well. He is also known for his poise and confidence with the puck, allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards. Many within the Canucks organization, such as Assistant Coach Rick Bowness, have asserted this as <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> of his calm off-ice demeanor.|$|E
