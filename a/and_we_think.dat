During negotiations Mercer stated to Lee that [...] "we feel we've got the start of a good side. We are just one player short, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> you are that player." [...] Lee made his debut in a 2–0 win at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, the start of an 11 match unbeaten run, including a 6–0 win against Leicester City.|$|E
500|$|Only {{entering}} two European charts, [...] "Flatline" [...] reached number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart, {{however it}} peaked at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart. The group denied allegations {{of it being}} a [...] "flop": [...] "I don't think our song got lost on the radio. I think there were certain things that happened behind the scenes that couldn't be helped. Our goal was to put a song out that people liked <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we've done that". They also expressed preference in going on tour and releasing an album than having a [...] "throw-away hit" [...] on the charts." [...] To NME, Buchanan reiterated those sentiments and denied rumours floating {{at the time that}} speculated that the group had been dropped by Polydor.|$|E

World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we can make it enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, because at the end of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that it would last. After the first one we thought maybe there would be a second one, and then it would be over." ...|$|E
500|$|Nixon later {{characterized}} {{the attitude of}} his backers and aides as, [...] "We want you to start campaigning right now for 1956, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> {{the way to do}} it is to have available the funds to make speeches, make trips to California, and so forth." [...] Contributors were drawn only from his early supporters, and contributions were limited to $1,000. Nixon was not to be informed of the names of contributors; however, the fundraising letter stated that Nixon [...] "will of course be very appreciative of your continuing interest". By October 30, 1951, some $16,000 had been raised, of which Nixon had spent approximately $12,000, principally from contributors in the Los Angeles area. The senator's Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54. Despite the initial fundraising success, only $2,200 could be raised from November 1951 to July 1952, and an engraving bill was unpaid pending a hoped-for contribution of $500.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1855, {{the letters}} of the word [...] "Dollars" [...] were enlarged, {{following}} complaints from the public. The same year, coinage began at the San Francisco Mint, where 6,600were struck as opposed to 50,555at Philadelphia. [...] Mintages at Philadelphia declined {{for the remainder of the}} decade, to 7,036by 1860; pieces were also struck at San Francisco in 1856, 1857, and 1860. [...] In 1859, early numismatic writer Montroville W. Dickeson wrote of the three-dollar piece, [...] "it is very unpopular, being frequently mistaken for a quarter eagle, and often counted as a five-dollar piece. [...] It is exceedingly annoying to that portion of the human family whose vision is dependent on artificial aid, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> its retirement would meet with public approbation." [...] Perhaps a dozen contemporary numismatists collected three-dollar pieces; those who were serious ordered proof coins from the Mint. [...] Coins in this condition became easier to obtain from Philadelphia as officials responded to the rise in interest in coin collecting which followed the introduction of the Flying Eagle cent in 1857.|$|E

500|$|Tsakalotos {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "Revolutionary Europeanist", as he supports European Union integration but not its capitalist principles. In one article, he wrote: [...] " [...] European Monetary Union has created a split between [...] core and periphery, and relations between the two are hierarchical and discriminatory." [...] Tsakalotos has also advocated for a [...] "change in [...] architecture" [...] of the Eurozone. He has also suggested that the EU should have a focus on the development of member countries, which is what requires this change in architecture. In a May 2012 interview on Lateline, Tsakalotos said: [...] "At the moment the Eurozone is at risk, not because of the Greek radical left – it's at risk because it has an architecture, a financial and economic architecture that is evidently unable to deal with the crisis in the Eurozone, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> part of the solution is a change in that architecture." [...] In 2011, he cited a move towards fiscal federalism as a potential solution to the EU's economic architecture.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Brosnan joined Meryl Streep in {{the film}} {{adaption}} of the ABBA musical Mamma Mia!. He played Sam Carmichael, one of three men rumoured {{to be the father}} of lead Amanda Seyfried, while Streep played her mother. Judy Craymer, producer to the film, said [...] "Pierce brings a certain smooch factor, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> he'll have great chemistry with Meryl in a romantic comedy." [...] Brosnan's preparation in singing for the role included walking up and down the coast and singing karaoke to his own voice for about six weeks, followed by rehearsals in New York in which he noted he [...] "sounded dreadful." [...] Brosnan's singing {{in the film}} was generally disparaged by critics, with his singing compared in separate reviews to the sound of a water buffalo, a donkey, and a wounded raccoon. In September 2008, Brosnan provided the narration for the Thomas & Friends special The Great Discovery. He was originally set to narrate for both US and UK from Season 12 and onward, but withdrew from it for unknown reasons.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the game}} had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark {{received}} many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton {{explained that they}} [...] "wanted {{to bring her back}} in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic." [...] However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, {{which was one of the}} first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, [...] "It was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don't get normally.

He received offers from various other schools across the country, including Bradley, Colorado State, New Mexico State, Santa Clara, Stanford, Stephen F. Austin, and UTEP. Frazier was also visited by San Diego, TCU, and Penn State, spanning from September to October 2008. After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, [...] "We are very excited to have Tim join our program. He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does.

500|$|The {{success of}} the reality series {{resulted}} {{in the development of}} several spin-off shows and other related programming. In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled Kourtney and Khloé in Miami, which was later renamed Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new Dash boutique. Ted Harbert, president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. [...] "It's a very simple formula that we took from scripted TV and applied to a reality show. [...] There are a lot of family sitcom elements to 'Kardashians,' <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that humor and warmth will carry over to Miami," [...] Harbert added. The show premiered on August 16, 2009 to very high ratings; the first episode brought in 2.7 million total viewers and then became the most-watched show on the network since The Anna Nicole Show in 2002. The spin-off was subsequently renewed for a second season which premiered on June 13, 2010, and later returned as Kourtney and Kim Take Miami for a third season on January 20, 2013. Additionally, a series of webisodes entitled Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord were released following the show, which showcased Disick as he informed viewers how to live like a [...] "king".|$|E

But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

And we’re elated that #stopKony is a trending topic on Twitter—if anyone deserves global notoriety it’s Kony." [...] She added: [...] "Arresting Kony and other senior LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice. It will also help end the scourge {{of one of the most}} brutal rebel groups in Africa." [...] HRW's LRA researcher Ida Sawyer reaffirmed, [...] "we definitely support the message of the film <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it's great that they're bringing so much attention to the film with Kony's crimes and the phenomena of the LRA." [...] Amnesty International, which had documented what it described as the LRA's [...] "horrific impact on the lives of thousands of civilians in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Uganda" [...] and for years had been calling for the LRA leaders to be arrested, welcomed the massive public response to the Kony 2012 campaign. Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: [...] "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," [...] but added: [...] "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights", especially because [...] "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.|$|E
