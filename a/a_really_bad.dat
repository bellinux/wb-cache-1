25|$|In late 1976 McCarthy was {{approached}} by manager Fr. Harry Bohan to become the new coach of the Clare senior hurlers. McCarthy accepted the offer, a decision which {{came as a surprise}} to many people in Cork. His first season in charge was a successful one from the very beginning. Clare had had a good National League campaign and qualified for the final in 1977. Kilkenny, the reigning champions and victors over Clare in the final of 1976, provided the opposition on this occasion and an interesting game ensued. Clare's ability to get goals at crucial times proved vital and they claimed the 2–8 to 0–9 victory. With this victory under their belt Clare were widely tipped for success in the provincial championship. The team did reach the Munster final that year where McCarthy's native county of Cork provided the opposition. Clare got off to <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> start when they conceded a penalty after seventy-five seconds which was duly converted by Tim Crowley. Instead of crumbling Clare battled back and really put Cork to the pin of their collar. At half-time they trailed by only one point, however, they were reduced to fourteen men after Jim Power was sent off. The second-half was another interesting tussle, however, Cork won by 4–15 to 4–10.|$|E

Bozza submitted Love a manuscript in 2014 {{that he was}} quite pleased with, later calling it [...] "possibly the greatest thing I’ll ever do with anybody." [...] Love, however, disliked it, and {{said in an interview}} that the text made her sound like she was [...] "jacked on coffee and sugar in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> mood." [...] Love refused to pay Bozza for the work he had done, and he sued her in 2015 for lack of payment.|$|E
500|$|In early January 2007, {{production}} {{on the film}} I Know Who Killed Me was put on hold when Lohan underwent appendix surgery. Lohan admitted herself to the Wonderland Center rehabilitation facility for a 30-day stay, though she continued shooting the film, returning to the facility at night. Shortly thereafter, Lohan withdrew from a film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance, her publicist stating that Lohan needed to [...] "focus on getting better." [...] Lohan was replaced in The Edge of Love in April 2007, shortly before filming was to begin, with the director citing [...] "insurance reasons" [...] and Lohan later explaining that she [...] "was going through <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> time then." ...|$|E

500|$|Ganguly, Chappell and the Indian {{team manager}} for the Zimbabwe tour, Amitabh Choudhary, were asked {{to appear before the}} BCCI committee, where it was {{reported}} that assurance of working together was given by them. Consequently, due to his poor form and differences with the coach, Ganguly was dropped as the captain of the team, with Dravid taking his place. Chandresh Narayan, chief correspondent for The Times of India, commented that [...] "The row with Greg Chappell just added to the mystery, but he was going through <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> patch then, his only score [...] was a hundred against Zimbabwe and that didn't count for much." [...] Ten months later, during India's tour to South Africa, Ganguly was recalled after his middle order replacements Suresh Raina and Mohammad Kaif suffered poor form.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Everything" [...] {{is aimed}} at Zac Hanson, who Marion Raven dated briefly while M2M were on tour with Hanson. According to Raven, once the tour ended he never {{contacted}} her, effectively ending the relationship. The song [...] "Miss Popular" [...] is about [...] "that one popular girl in school who goes around bad-mouthing everyone" [...] then eventually [...] "it all comes back to her", while [...] "Jennifer" [...] is about wanting to dislike [...] "the girl your boyfriend is constantly comparing you to" [...] but {{not being able to}} as she is a nice person. Raven wrote the song [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] about a guy who dumped her then wanted her back, and wrote the song [...] "Sometimes" [...] when she was having <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> day and wanted to just [...] "get it out".|$|E

The spot-light falls on her again when she goes away to a graduate program and her parents receive a letter from the dean saying Sandra has been hospitalized after an extreme diet, revealing that she is anorexic. She dreams of being an artist. She broke her arm.|$|E

Newman of PNselling wrote hin his review: [...] "A bad, {{bad movie}} with <b>a</b> cool concept. <b>Really</b> <b>bad.</b> In fact I'm debating recutting {{the movie and}} {{changing}} the dialog and renaming it as [...] "Prey, Pray, Pway" [...] and releasing it as a comedy because this movie is really, really close to being hilarious." ...|$|R
500|$|After Jade {{challenged}} Mark {{to a game}} of pool, [...] "sparks of {{a different}} kind" [...] began to fly between them. McGregor explained the situation: [...] "Mark has had <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> day at work, so he's out for a fun night. To his surprise, he enjoys Jade's company. Lucas goes home early - and Mark and Jade end up sharing a kiss." [...] The next morning it was made clear that Mark and Jade {{had spent the night}} together and Mark was full of regret. Mark was [...] "terrified" [...] that Kate would find out and even though Jade agreed to keep quiet, he does not feel any less guilty. Mark's problems at work continued and he became a victim of harassment when his car tyres were let down. Despite talking to his superior officer, nothing happens and Mark felt like he had no support from the people at his work place.|$|E
500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> place at the moment".|$|E
500|$|Haug said he {{was amazed}} with the highly {{positive}} critical response the album had received, surprised that [...] "even Molly [...] gave it nine out of ten." [...] The positivity of the album's reception created a feeling of surrealism, and Haug told Juice Magazine [...] "I wish someone would write <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> [...]" [...] Nonetheless, he appreciated the credibility the album helped Powderfinger develop. Coghill agreed with Haug on the album's popularity, stating [...] "you couldn't ask for much better", and saying he really took notice of the album's positive critical commentary. Juices Benedict Watts said it received [...] "a level of universal praise not yet dished out on an Australian release since You Am I's Hi Fi Way". [...] Despite Polydor telling the band the album would be heavily marketed, Fanning still found its success surprising. HITs Teresa Bolster suggested Fanning feared the worst during songwriting; [...] "Celebrity Head", a song on the album, {{was seen as a}} [...] "pre-emptive, scathing attack on music writers", which he argued was intended as a joke.|$|E

5000|$|In his 1997 {{biography}} Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, McCartney {{said of the}} song: [...] "Sometimes we didn't {{fight it}} if the lyric came out rather bland {{on some of those}} filler songs like 'It's Only Love'. If <b>a</b> lyric was <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> we'd edit it, but we weren't that fussy about it, because it's only a rock 'n' roll song. I mean, this is not literature." ...|$|R

"Why, it's like this," [...] said Father Brown, in his frankly {{doubtful}} way: [...] "We {{are taught}} that if <b>a</b> man has <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> first principles, {{that must be}} partly his fault.

500|$|Disney was {{concerned}} with Lasseter's position {{on the use of}} music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a buddy film featuring [...] "real toys." [...] Joss Whedon agreed, saying, [...] "It would have been <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion." [...] However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming [...] "Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for." [...] Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in Toy Story would not break into song, but the film would use non-diegetic songs over the action, as in The Graduate, to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling. Disney and Lasseter tapped Randy Newman to compose the film. The edited Toy Story was due to Newman and Gary Rydstrom in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Continuing the band's {{policy of}} using names that would repulse {{potential}} listeners, the band named the album by using {{part of the}} phrase [...] "queer as a three dollar bill" [...] and adding the word [...] "Y'all" [...] for Florida flavor, naming the album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall. The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music. After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating [...] "The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile." [...] That same year, they also notably served as an opening act for Faith No More, a band often credited as {{paving the way for}} Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre. The group's keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalled [...] "That guy Fred Durst had <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> attitude. He was kind of a jerk. I remembered he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} idea {{was written by}} Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X-Files {{in order to get}} a TV agent. [...] "I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> feeling about it.’ She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed," [...] said Reddick. [...] "I thought, that’s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?" [...] Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to The X-Files after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film. [...] One of the biggest misconceptions about the project is that it was based on the real-life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred in 1996. Like in the movie, the TWA disaster involved a Boeing 747 that exploded after take-off from JFK International Airport in New York en route to Paris. [...] Moreover, five chaperones and sixteen high school students from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, were aboard the doomed flight, heading to Paris with their high school French club. The TV spec script for The X-Files [...] however, was actually written in 1994.|$|E

50|$|The {{experts have}} harsh words for Krystal and Tyler, {{due to their}} confrontational {{attitude}} and drunk-driving habits respectively. Tyler admits {{from the start that}} he might be Canada's Worst Driver, but Krystal angrily denies that she's the worst, and the experts are perturbed by her repeated claims that she's not <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> driver because she's never severely injured anyone. As usual, no one graduates this episode.|$|R
500|$|When {{writing the}} album, Moa {{wanted to put}} the word [...] "love" [...] into the title of every song. Ultimately, four of the ten track titles contain [...] "love" [...] or [...] "loves", and every song has the word in its lyrics. In interviews, Moa has {{revealed}} the inspiration and circumstances around many of its songs. She said that [...] "I Am the Woman Who Loves You" [...] is about when she and Universe first met and that [...] "Love Me Again" [...] is about [...] "taking the piss out of [...] love for Azaria", calling the latter [...] "a real Anika Moa song." [...] According to Moa, [...] "Two Hearts" [...] and [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] were inspired by people who [...] "fucked [...] off". [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] was written while Moa says she was [...] "in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> mood", however she asserts that it is her favourite track on the album. Moa said that [...] "Blame It On the Rain" [...] is about a person who Moa [...] "will never ever name because they will be really, really sad if they knew". [...] "In the Air" [...] is about Moa's fear of flying, and [...] "Running Through the Fire (Storm)", originally simply called [...] "Storm", was prompted {{by the death of}} Moa's father.|$|E

He said, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> movie... Fuck it. It is what it is. Fucking trees, man. The plants. Fuck it.

40|$|When {{studying}} type-definable sets {{in closed}} Hasse fields, we observe a certain analogy {{with the case}} of algebraically closed fields. We show here in particular that connected type-definable groups {{can be described as}} “D-algebraic groups”, which is the natural equivalent for algebraic groups. However, many problems arise when we try to give a description of these geometric objects in the language of schemes. We will mainly focus on the relationship between a D-ring A and the D-ring Â of global sections for the D-scheme defined by A. We will give some minimal conditions for these two D-rings to define the same D-scheme, and exhibit <b>an</b> example where <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> things occur. ...|$|R

5000|$|Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot {{wrote about}} the Nintendo 64 version, [...] "The game's {{graphics}} run quite smoothly on a platform that's hardly renowned for smooth graphics. Unfortunately, this smoothness {{comes at a price}} - Exotica's cars and tracks lack detail. The game looks decent, but it won't blow your mind." [...] Shoemaker also wrote that the game [...] "requires very little skill or finesse, but for the casual gamer who doesn't want to commit lots of time to racing a track, that's not <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing." ...|$|R
2500|$|On September 6, 2013, ESPN retired {{the butt}} fumble from [...] "Worst of the Worst" [...] after going undefeated for 40 weeks. A SportsCenter {{producer}} {{explained that it}} was time to [...] "start fresh" [...] as the 2013 NFL season began. Negandhi concluded, [...] "Time to get some new material and years from now, when we see <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> play, we'll say, 'But can it compare to the Butt Fumble?' That is setting a legacy." [...] Before retiring the play, ESPN subjected it to analysis on its [...] "Sports Science" [...] segment. In this segment, they show how Sanchez's speed combined with the angle of impact created a force of over 1,300 pounds, well over the 125 pounds required to cause a fumble.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 May 2011, Stephen Fry and Ryan Gage were {{confirmed}} {{to join the}} project as Master of Lake-town and Alfrid respectively.

I mustn't give too much away but I've got a bald cap and then on top of that <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> combover wig and this wispy mustache and wispy beard and horrible blotchy skin and disgusting fingernails... And generally speaking a really unappetising piece of work. And a coward to boot and very, very greedy."

2500|$|Initial {{critical}} reaction to Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! was somewhat mixed. Tom Carson, writing in Rolling Stone, claimed that [...] "There's not {{an ounce of}} feeling anywhere, and the only commitment is to the distancing aesthetic of the put-on", and opined that [...] "Devo lacks most of Eno's warmth and much of Bowie's flair for mechanized melodrama. For all its idiosyncrasies, the music here is utterly impersonal." [...] Critic Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a positive rating of a B+, but noted, [...] "In small doses it's as good as novelty music ever gets, and there isn't <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>bad</b> cut on this album. But it leads nowhere." [...] Nonetheless, it was voted {{one of the best}} albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices [...] Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1978.

She felt that D'Sora never achieved the intimacy that Ishara Yar did with Data, and that the subplot was simply something created so that Picard had something to do. She summed up the ending of the episode by saying that [...] "I don't believe that Data can't be hurt emotionally, but he's more invested in his cat than he ever seems to be in Jenna D'Sora." [...] Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in May 2012, describing it as a [...] "clunker" [...] and a re-hash of the earlier episode [...] "" [...] but [...] "without the gravitas". He thought that having Picard pilot the shuttle was ridiculous, especially as the character admitted in the episode [...] "11001001" [...] that {{it had been years since}} he had worked the helm of a ship.
