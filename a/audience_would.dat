5|$|The concerto delle donne {{transformed}} the musica secreta. In the past, {{members of the}} <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> perform, and performers would become audience members. During the ascendancy of the concerto delle donne the roles within the musica secreta became fixed, as did the roster of those who performed for the Duke's pleasure every night.|$|E
5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> not want to see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team also had significant {{problems with the}} scenes in the parking garage, and how to avoid the anatopism of contemporary cars being found on Caprica. In order to avoid this, the {{production team}} used cars mostly found in Eastern Europe, for the purpose that the <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> not immediately recognise the types of cars, but still to keep a sense of realism.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} in the pre-climax sequences was toned down to match the sensibilities of the Telugu audience after Venkatesh expressed scepticism {{as to whether the}} <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> accept him getting beaten up badly in the police station. During set construction for the police station and the house in the film, the producer and the director {{wanted to get rid of}} some coconut trees. However, art director Vivek managed to erect those sets without cutting down any trees.|$|E
5|$|While {{previous}} Street Fighter titles relied almost {{solely on}} Capcom's Research and Development branch, the development team instead allowed other {{branches of the}} company to give input {{on the design of}} new characters, due to the influx of fan requests from outside Japan. Rufus was designed based upon marketing research on what sorts of characters an American <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> enjoy playing, and was one of several characters considered for inclusion during the game's development.|$|E

5|$|After a few warm up gigs {{towards the}} end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scotts, London on 1 May. Realising the opera's {{narrative}} was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played Tommy all the way through at full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of Tommy had a significant positive response.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rise}} of grunge began to phase punk and {{hardcore}} out of the Northwest underground by the late 1980s, Perry set out to start a band that stood in defiant contrast to the shoegazing attitude of alternative rock, showcasing high energy dance music and Zappa-esque theatricality {{in an attempt to}} create something that an <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> react to viscerally instead of passively. Recruiting a horn section led by alto saxophonist Brooks Brown, Perry and Schmid formed their latest band Mr. Wiggles – named after a Parliament song – in November 1988, playing their first show in Springfield as part of a benefit concert for workers of the Nicolai door manufacturing plant, who were then engaged in a union strike.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, {{and went back to}} the amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, he thought the silence and natural ambient sounds present would make a good {{backdrop}} for the music. He also felt that filming the band without an <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E
50|$|The knife {{used by the}} Night Slasher {{was made}} for the film by knife {{designer}} Herman Schneider. Sylvester Stallone asked Schneider to create a knife that <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> never forget.|$|R
50|$|Although Errol Flynn {{was worried}} how <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> accept him in Westerns, {{the film was}} a big hit {{and he went on}} to make a number of movies in that genre.|$|R

5|$|While {{drawing the}} series, Fujima changed his art style from one used previously, {{though he was}} asked to use his {{original}} styling. He also noted that the series was different from his other works, and was unsure of how the <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> respond to it. Free Collars Kingdom is licensed for English language release in the United States by Del Rey, which released the series in 2007, and in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi, which released it in 2008. It was licensed for regional release by Tong Li Publishing in Taiwan, Jonesky in Hong Kong, and Star Comics in Italy. Free Collars Kingdom garnered mixed reviews from critics. The series was praised for its artwork and humor, but criticized for its plot and characters.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{primarily}} in Cornwall and the Upper Boat Studios in Wales. The {{exterior of the}} pirate ship was filmed at a dock in Cornwall, while the lower decks were built from a set at the studio. The principal challenge to film at the dock was to ensure the <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> not see it. The crew set up smoke machines to simulate fog. To create the storm the crew used wind and rain machines, the latter of which went through 15,000 litres of water. The loud noise from the wind machines caused communication difficulties during takes. Anticipating they would get soaked, the cast present on the deck wore dry suits underneath their clothes. Before filming began on the storm sequences, Darvill heard that he would perform the stunt where he is thrown into the sea, and was willing to perform it. The stunt would later be performed by a double.|$|E
50|$|Lesser {{refused to}} call the lead female {{character}} Jane—according to him, Eleanor Holm was so famous for her swimming exploits that <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> not accept her portraying anyone other than someone named Eleanor.|$|R

50|$|Lex Barker was {{reportedly}} {{going to play}} the male lead but O'Hara objected, claiming <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> only see him as Tarzan. Jeff Chandler was signed instead. Victor McLaglen joined the cast as Chandler's helper.|$|R
5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based {{the story on the}} central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was {{the death of his father}} in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E
5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is {{too embarrassed to}} examine the teeth {{of a young woman}} and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E
50|$|Ed Fishman (who {{fought with}} Joe Glaser to be Holidays manager) {{thought of a}} {{comeback}} concert at Carnegie Hall. Holiday hesitated, unsure <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> accept her after the arrest. She gave in and agreed to appear.|$|R
5000|$|Amarillo Film critic Curt McCarl {{said that}} <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> [...] "be {{better off with}} Jesse Quackenbushe's documentary" [...] and that it's [...] "shameful that an oppourtunity to tell an honest story was wasted on this schlock." ...|$|R
5000|$|During 16th century public {{performances}} of comedias in Madrid, Spain would begin at 2pm in courtyards and later corrales. <b>Audiences</b> <b>would</b> arrive early and vendors would sell foods. Soon these <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> become impatient and start loudly hissing, whistling and shouting. One {{hour before the}} performance, musicians came onto the stage to sing a ballad (seguidilla) and immediately after an actor or member of the company came on stage to [...] "echar la loa" [...] or [...] "throw out praise" [...] by reciting a loa. Most comedia playwrights (autors) also wrote loas asking the audience for silence in order to enjoy the afternoon of theatre.|$|R
5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama The West Wing in 1997 {{when he went}} unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> not be able to take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing, NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not think that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E
5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos <b>audience</b> <b>would</b> sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree {{to listen to the}} ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E
50|$|An elderly magician who {{inspired}} Burt {{to become a}} magician. Holloway was originally scripted to die, but the studio felt that <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> have {{too much of a}} connection to the character and so he remained alive.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew the}} <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> {{come forward and}} shake hands with you--that one infallible sign of sincere approval. In all my life, {{wherever}} it failed me I left the hall sick and ashamed, knowing what it meant.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} {{debate about the}} play's portrayal of Jews and how Elizabethan <b>audiences</b> <b>would</b> have viewed it. The Jew of Malta is considered {{to have been a}} major influence on William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice.|$|R
