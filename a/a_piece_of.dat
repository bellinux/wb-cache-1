5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings).

Mastering <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E

5|$|The lower molar of Indraloris {{is known}} from four specimens. GSI D237, an m1 in <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> jaw, is the holotype of I.himalayensis.

YGSP 44443, the holotype of I.kamlialensis, is either m1 or m2, but more likely the former. Part of the trigonid is broken off. YGSP 32152, a very worn m1 in <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> jaw, represents the unnamed large Indraloris. Vasishat suggested in 1985 that these teeth were instead p4s corresponding to molars referable to Sivaladapis, but this hypothesis has been disproven by the discovery of p4s referable to Indraloris.|$|E
