500|$|Motown {{released}} [...] "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)" [...] as a 7" [...] vinyl {{single in}} February 1966. The standard edition commercial single features the B-side track [...] "Just As Long <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> Me". A promotional {{early version of}} the 7" [...] single also exists, with both the stereo and mono versions of the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening of}} the episode, in which Bart rushes to do {{everything}} he planned on doing during summer vacation, was originally written and animated for the season fourteen episode [...] "I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can" [...] (2003) but was cut. This episode came in short, and to fill in time, the sequence was added. Burns has said commented the episode [...] "ended up being incredibly short because when you do an episode where there's really just one good side of an argument , you don't fill out as much time <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to." [...] The opening sequence features {{a large number of}} allusions to popular culture, including references to The Natural (1984 film), Happy Days (television sitcom), and Men in Black (1997 film).|$|E
2500|$|... "A {{cassette}} {{is great}} for a local scene like Olympia because a band can release a cassette {{and not have to}} spend their would-be savings. If they were to press 500 records, there goes their savings. But if you do a cassette you make up as many <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need,</b> they're cheap, and if you don't sell them you just use them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, you will," [...] she returned. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>need</b> {{the rest}} from {{this kind of}} work, now, just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> rest from your college work before. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> a change of {{standpoint}},--and the American standpoint will be the very thing for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clementina did not relent so easily. [...] "Mrs. Landa, whateva you do I don't ca'e to know it; and if {{you talk}} to me again about this I shall go home. I would stay with <b>you</b> <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> me, but I can't if you keep {{bringing}} this up." ...|$|R

2500|$|Flight attendants at {{the carrier}} voted to {{organize}} their workgroup under the Transport Workers Union of America in December 2010, citing scheduling concerns among other {{issues in their}} work rules and the airline's pilots elected to vote on whether to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in July 2012. In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters. Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has {{been critical of the}} unionization of airline employees and has stated that [...] "Unionization {{is one of those things}} that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to be on top of your game... In this industry and others that are heavily unionized, you ultimately end up with bankruptcy as the primary driver" ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} a gradual {{increase}} in brain volume as the ancestors of modern humans progressed along the human timeline of evolution (see Homininae), starting from about 600cm3 in Homo habilis up to 1736cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Thus, in general there is a correlation between brain volume and intelligence. However, modern Homo sapiens have a smaller brain volume (brain size 1250cm3) than neanderthals; women have a brain volume slightly smaller than men, and the Flores hominids (Homo floresiensis), nicknamed [...] "hobbits", had a cranial capacity of about [...] 380cm3, {{about a third of}} the Homo erectus average and considered small for a chimpanzee. It is proposed that they evolved from H. erectus as a case of insular dwarfism. In spite of their threefold smaller brain there is evidence that H. floresiensis used fire and made stone tools as sophisticated as those of their proposed ancestor, H. erectus. Iain Davidson summarizes the opposite evolutionary constraints on human brain size as [...] "As large <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> and as small as you can".|$|E
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that First Data and Apple Inc. had [...] "quickly struck a deal" [...] in a March 2014 meeting, and in early September Apple debuted iPhones with digital credit cards. Called Apple Pay, the technology utilized First Data's encryption technology, with First Data's software also allowing processing for [...] "iPhone-enabled payments for its retail clients" [...] such as {{credit card companies}} and stores like Target, Panera Bread, and Whole Foods. In response to the new technology, Jim Robinson was quoted saying that Bisignano had been [...] "a real change agent in shifting the company from cost cutting to growing revenues," [...] and calling him both [...] "paranoid and confident – <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to be.” In November 2014, the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation awarded Bisignano the Colonel Michael Endres Leadership Award for Individual Excellence in Veteran Employment, for [...] " [...] a difference in employment opportunities for veterans, transitioning service members, and spouses." [...] First Data posted a quarterly profit in February 2015, its first in over seven years. In response to the results, journalists such as Robin Sidel of the Wall Street Journal wrote that [...] "one of the biggest buyout duds of the past decade" [...] was becoming a [...] "top turnaround story." ...|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{said that}} [...] "Richard Hawley creates an album {{brooding}} with creativity and charm. With dreamy and ethereal instrumental works throughout, Hawley paints the town psychedelic with spirit and fervent passion. From beginning to end, this Bar None release is chock-full of reflective lyrical statements and stunning, pristine guitar and percussive statements... a fine journey by a singer/songwriter with budding potential". [...] MusicOMH said [...] "It's a terrific showcase for {{the voice that}} is rightly being lauded wherever he goes... <b>You</b> <b>need</b> this album almost <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> the first one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] said Willy, [...] "won't {{you come}} down and have your breakfast? I don't believe you have eaten a thing, and <b>you</b> look <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet {{you told}} him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never {{complain}} now, or seem <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> any help," [...] said Jo, wondering.|$|R
6000|$|... "A siege-train will {{be loaded}} on vessels {{and sent to}} Fort Monroe, in {{readiness}} {{to be sent to}} you if required. All other supplies can be drawn from Beaufort <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my brother'll {{get them}} changed {{for you at}} Montreal as we pass, won't you, Jack? {{or at least as}} much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> till you get to"--she checked herself--"the end of your journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive her, my son. Forgive her <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> forgiveness. She {{does not}} {{understand}} the thing she does. Come, we will pray for her, that God in His infinite mercy may teach her humility and true knowledge of Him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, I haven't {{considered}} whether {{you would be}} of any use or not. The trip will brace you up, and <b>you</b> look <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed!' {{spoke the}} Sun. 'Do <b>you,</b> rich <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are, <b>need</b> help? But though {{you live in}} a palace without windows, the Sun enters everywhere, and he knows you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, I haven't {{considered}} whether {{you would be}} of any use or not; but you had better come. The trip will brace you up, and <b>you</b> look <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such {{protection}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> and I {{can give}} you shall have, my daughter; {{but it is a}} strange request to make of such a man, in such a place, and at such a time. Moreover, your voice is not quite strange to me," [...] added the old man with a perplexed look. [...] "Surely I have heard it before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, dear, {{with your}} leave, we will {{say no more}} about Stella Fregelius and her spiritual views. When I engaged myself to you, as I told you at the time, I did so with my eyes open, {{for better or for}} worse, and unless you tell me right out that you don't want me, I have no {{intention}} of changing my mind, especially <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> looking after, and are not likely to come across another Stella.|$|E
60|$|King Midas hastened {{back to the}} palace; and, I suppose, the {{servants}} knew not {{what to make of}} it when they saw their royal master so carefully bringing home an earthen pitcher of water. But that water, which was to undo all the mischief that his folly had wrought, was more precious to Midas than an ocean of molten gold could have been. The first thing he did, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> hardly be told, was to sprinkle it by handfuls over the golden figure of little Marygold.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{expected}} to find you a pale, worn-out thing," [...] she remarked, as their motor-car climbed the white, stone-bordered road which crossed the heather-covered mountain. [...] "You don't look <b>as</b> though <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> a change at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|Amyas bowed low; and {{the lord}} deputy went on, [...] "You will needs {{wish to see}} your prisoner. You will find him such a one <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> not be ashamed to have taken, and as need not be ashamed to have been taken by you: but here he is, and will, I doubt not, answer as much for himself. Know each other better, gentlemen both: last night was an ill one for making acquaintances. Don Guzman Maria Magdalena Sotomayor de Soto, know the hidalgo, Amyas Leigh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Any other man," [...] Sylvanus Power went on, [...] "would {{have sat}} in the chair for that. Not I! You don't know as much of me <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to, Merton Ware. I'm no whippersnapper of a pen-slinger, earning a few paltry dollars by writing doggerel for women and mountebanks to act. I've hewn my way with my right arm and my brain, from the streets to the palace. They say that money talks. By God! if it does I ought to shout, for I've more million dollars than there are men in this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> me," [...] said Hope, {{with her}} {{pleasant}} smile,--"and {{that will be}} {{as long as you}} live in the world,--I promise never to desert you. There may come times and seasons, now and then, when you will think that I have utterly vanished. But again, and again, and again, when perhaps you least dream of it, you shall see the glimmer of my wings on the ceiling of your cottage. Yes, my dear children, and I know something very good and beautiful that is to be given you hereafter!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Appleby {{nodded as}} {{he took out his}} watch. “I shouldn’t wonder if I bring you good news to‐morrow. Remember, you are to say nothing to anybody. Give me what money you have and then go to sleep. <b>You</b> look <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> it.” ...|$|R
60|$|Falconet's {{answer was}} hard and positive. Contemporary glory suffices. What is fame, if I am not there to enjoy? The fear of {{contempt}} and disgrace is as strong a motive <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need,</b> to incite men to great work. Glory after death is chimerical and uncertain. Think of all the great names that are clean forgotten, of all the great workers whose achievements are lost or effaced, of all the others whose works are attributed {{to those who did}} not execute them! Your posterity is no better than a lottery.|$|E
6000|$|... "This must end," [...] {{said the}} trapper, rising with {{the dignity of}} one bent only on the {{importance}} of his object. [...] "I know not what need ye may have, children, to fear those you should both love and honour, but something must be done to save your lives. A few hours more or less can never be missed from the time of one who has already numbered so many days; therefore I will advance. Here is a clear space around you.

6000|$|... "Thoughtless {{people are}} not unusual," [...] {{observed}} the Scarecrow, [...] "but I consider them more fortunate than those who have useless or wicked thoughts and {{do not try to}} curb them. Your oil can, friend Woodman, is filled with oil, but you only apply the oil to your joints, drop by drop, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> it, and do not keep spilling it where it will do no good. Thoughts should be restrained {{in the same way as}} your oil, and only applied when necessary, and for a good purpose. If used carefully, thoughts are good things to have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor thing! <b>You</b> look <b>as</b> if <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> it," [...] {{answered}} Frank. But {{he let her}} get out alone, to {{the horror}} of Messrs.

6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Maxwell cheerfully, {{when they}} lingered over a frugal meal, [...] "if any misguided bushmen try to rush this camp to-night they will regret it.

5000|$|A tagline 'Simply More' {{was used}} to define 'The Fiat 500 <b>as</b> {{everything}} <b>you</b> <b>need</b> and nothing <b>you</b> don't.
