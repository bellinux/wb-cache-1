5|$|Between 270 and 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers began {{developing}} {{more elaborate}} mechanized water clocks. The added complexity {{was aimed at}} regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang bells and gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, <b>and</b> <b>dials.</b> Some even displayed astrological models of the universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL <b>and</b> <b>dials</b> the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E

25|$|The company {{struggled}} after World War I: {{the loss}} of military contracts sharply reduced demand for luminescent paint <b>and</b> <b>dials,</b> and in 1922, high-grade ore was discovered in Katanga, driving all U.S. suppliers out of business except U.S. Radium and the Standard Chemical Company. U.S. Radium consolidated its operations in Manhattan in 1927, leasing out the Orange plant and selling off other property. But demand for luminescent products surged again during World War II; by 1942, it employed as many as 1000 workers, and in 1944 {{was reported to have}} radium mining, processing, and application facilities in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Whippany, New Jersey; and North Hollywood, California as well as New York City.|$|E

25|$|Cars are {{equipped}} with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated {{by a combination of}} the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons <b>and</b> <b>dials</b> for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.|$|E

[...] Steamships had [...] no direct speed control from {{the bridge of the}} vessel. [...] The captain signaled the engine room using a system of bells <b>and</b> <b>dials</b> called the engine room telegraph. [...] Accidents could and did happen when engine telegraph signals were misinterpreted by the engine room. [...] On this particular occasion, Sioux, coming in from Seattle, was approaching the Everett dock. [...] From the bridge, Capt. William Thorton signaled the engine room for [...] "half astern" [...] to slow the vessel down. [...] Instead the engine room gave him [...] "half ahead" [...] which caused the steamer to ram into the dock. [...] Captain Thorton then signaled for [...] "full astern".|$|E

A mind so constituted must be as happy in its hope as a hen incubating a nest-ful of porcelain door-knobs. It lives in rapturous contemplation of a world of its own creation--a world where public morality and political good order are to be had by purchase at the machine-shop. In that delectable world religion is superfluous; the true high priest is the mechanical engineer; the minor clergy are the village blacksmiths. It is rather a pity that so fine and fair a sphere should prosper only in the attenuated ether of an idiot's understanding.|$|E

40|$|High {{temporal}} and spatial resolution measurements by both space-borne and ground-based instruments are therefore necessary to monitor atmospheric water vapor for climate purposes. Lidar techniques can accomplish ground-based measurements of atmospheric water vapor with high space and time resolution. A lidar system capable to perform simultaneous measurements of atmospheric water vapor and aerosols has been developed in Potenza, Southern Italy, {{in the context of}} a cooperation between the Universita della Basilicata and Istituto di Metodologie Avanzate di Analisi Ambientale. An intensive measurement campaign was performed during 1997 in Potenza aimed to the simultaneous application of the Raman <b>and</b> <b>DIAL</b> techniques for water vapor ground- based lidar measurements. Raman <b>and</b> <b>DIAL</b> humidity measurements performed during 1997 in Potenza aimed to the simultaneous application of the Raman <b>and</b> <b>DIAL</b> techniques for water vapor ground-based lidar measurements. Raman <b>and</b> <b>DIAL</b> humidity measurements performed at night in the Planetary Boundary Layer have been compared with simultaneous radiosonde data obtained from both free and captive balloons. The agreement among Raman, <b>DIAL</b> <b>and</b> radiosonde data is found to be within 30 percent up to approximately 1. 5 km. Results from this measurement campaign will be reported and discussed in this paper...|$|R
