5|$|Details on the Mauretanian {{events of}} 39–44 are unclear. Cassius Dio wrote an entire chapter on the {{annexation}} of Mauretania by Caligula, {{but it is}} now lost. Caligula's move seemingly had a strictly personal political motive – fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy – and thus the expansion {{may not have been}} prompted by pressing military or economic needs. However, the rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to provide protection to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula's expansion was <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> response to potential future threats.|$|E
25|$|According to The Minorities at Risk Project {{the number}} of Bihari killed is about 1,000. International {{estimates}} vary between 20,000 to 200,000. In June 1971, Bihari representatives stated that 500,000 Biharis were killed by Bengalis. R.J. Rummel gives <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> estimate of 150,000 killed.|$|E
25|$|Since it is {{accepted}} that ion suppression {{has the potential}} to affect the other analytical parameters of any assay, <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> approach to any LC-MS method development should include an evaluation of ion-suppression.

6000|$|Whereto Mrs. Herbert Le Breton, {{raising her}} eyes for a moment from the pages of her last new novel, {{answered}} languidly: 'Don't you think, Herbert, it'd be better to wait a little while and see how things turn out with them in the long run, you know, before we commit ourselves by going to call upon them? One swallow, you see, doesn't make a summer, does it, dear, ever?' Whence the acute and intelligent reader will doubtless conclude that Mrs. Herbert Le Breton was <b>a</b> very <b>prudent</b> sensible young woman, and that perhaps even Herbert himself had met at last with his fitting Nemesis. For what worse purgatory could his bitterest foe wish for <b>a</b> selfishly <b>prudent</b> and cold-hearted man, than that he should pass his whole lifetime in congenial intercourse with <b>a</b> selfishly <b>prudent</b> and cold-hearted wife, exactly after his own pattern? ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{link between}} Latin communis sensus and Aristotle's Greek was in rhetoric, {{a subject that}} Aristotle {{was the first to}} systematize. In rhetoric, <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> speaker must take account of {{opinions}} (Greek doxai) that are widely held. Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as koinai doxai, which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as endoxa.|$|E
25|$|John Barry and Roger Charles of Newsweek {{wrote in}} their 13 July 1992 article that Rogers acted {{recklessly}} and without due care.

He also acted according to the prescribed rules of engagement for USN warship captains in that situation.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, US President Richard Nixon, under {{pressure}} from Senator Jackson, dismissed {{the head of the}} Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and replaced him with Fred Ikle. Ikle brought in a new team that included Wolfowitz. While at ACDA, Wolfowitz wrote research papers and drafted testimony, as he had previously done at the Committee to Maintain <b>a</b> <b>Prudent</b> Defense Policy. He traveled with Ikle to strategic arms limitations talks in Paris and other European cities. He also helped dissuade South Korea from reprocessing plutonium that could be diverted into a clandestine weapons program.|$|E

25|$|The {{turnaround}} {{in the fiscal}} performance is particularly noteworthy. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century, Morocco's overall deficit stood at 5.3 percent of GDP, and gross total government debt amounted to three-fourths of GDP. In 2007, reflecting a strong improvement in revenue performance and moderate growth in expenditure, the budget was close to balance. Under the combined effect of <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> fiscal policy and sizeable privatization receipts, the total debt stock had shrunk by 20 percentage points, and now stands at a little over half of GDP. As a result, perceptions of Morocco's creditworthiness have improved.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} was {{the turning}} point in Holmes's career. He had shown himself equal to dealing with Africans, company factors, the Dutch and his own men and officers alike, recommending himself as <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> leader. He consequently was appointed captain of the flagship, Royal Charles, which he lost quickly after having failed to force the Swedish ambassador to salute the flag. But this was only a temporary setback, and he swiftly was granted £ 800 from the Crown and the command of the newly launched Reserve. The appointment of an inept master led to a quarrel with Pepys, which subsided after a while, but the antagonism between the administrator and the aggressive fighter was never resolved. Aboard Reserve, Holmes tested a pair of pendulum watches conceived by Christiaan Huygens.|$|E
25|$|Many {{mass graves}} have been {{discovered}} in Bangladesh. The first night of war on Bengalis, which is documented in telegrams from the American Consulate in Dacca to the United States State Department, saw indiscriminate killings of students of Dacca University and other civilians. Numerous women were tortured, raped and killed during the war; the exact numbers are not known and are a subject of debate. The widespread rape of Bangladeshi women led to birth of thousands of war babies. The Pakistan Army also kept numerous Bengali women as sex-slaves inside the Dacca Cantonment. Most of the girls were captured from Dacca University and private homes. There was significant sectarian violence not only perpetrated and encouraged by the Pakistani army, but also by Bengali nationalists against non-Bengali minorities, especially Biharis. In June 1971, Bihari representatives stated that 500,000 Biharis were killed by Bengalis. R.J. Rummel gives <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> estimate of 150,000 killed.|$|E

25|$|While Petre {{designed}} many churches, schools, public buildings, {{and private}} houses, his largest and grandest project, the Roman Catholic cathedral at Dunedin, was never fully completed. The entrance facade and the nave are built {{to the original}} design, and reveal the cathedral as {{a prime example of}} the French Gothic Revival. St Joseph's Cathedral, standing next to St Dominic's Priory, is reminiscent of many of the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, with its twin towers and central rose window—Chartres and Notre Dame come to mind, although the original design if completed with its tower would have produced a building more like Rouen Cathedral. The architect's intention was for a mighty structure, with the twin towers dwarfed by a lofty spire some 60 metres (200ft) in height, which would have been a magnificent edifice. In the event, the project stalled when <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> Roman Catholic diocese reluctant to incur unnecessary debt with the onset of the 1880s depression postponed further work.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{with limited}} budgets {{were allowed to}} pay in four instalments, but when a reader of the weekly newspaper, writing {{in the name of}} low-paid workers with large families, {{suggested}} the creation of savings clubs, Griffith encouraged the idea enthusiastically. The public response was more enthusiastic this time and by 7 May 1909, the Board had already received 3,386 applications. Ó Ceallaigh's minutes for this period reflect an atmosphere of general optimism: the SFPP was in contact with several suppliers of printing equipment, was recruiting personnel, and was actively looking for a new publishing office and a location for its printshop. Griffith was <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> businessman, however, and the SFPP negotiated simultaneously with the Linotype Machine Co. for the purchase of a Cox Duplex printing press, and the manager of the Ireland's Own Publishing Co., Mr. Walsh, for the printing of the newspaper. If the printshop failed once again to materialise, the SFPP would still have the option of subcontracting to Walsh.|$|E
500|$|The {{standards}} of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search.

Probable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made. Evidence obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the arrest.|$|E

500|$|The first {{generation}} were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly {{placed in the}} Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate {{that he had a}} good knowledge of both Latin and Greek. A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe. Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a valet de chambre at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good. Van der Weyden was <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> investor in stocks and property; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine [...] "Mettengelde" [...] ("with the money"). Vrancke van der Stockt invested in land.|$|E
500|$|At this point, Alcibiades's scheme {{encountered}} a great obstacle. Tissaphernes {{would not make}} an agreement on any terms, wanting to follow his policy of neutrality. As Kagan points out, Tissaphernes was <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> leader and had recognized the advantages of wearing each side out without direct Persian involvement. Alcibiades realized this and, by presenting the Athenians with stiffer and stiffer demands on Tissaphernes's behalf, attempted {{to convince them that}} he had persuaded Tissaphernes to support them, but that they had not conceded enough to him. Although the envoys were angered at the audacity of the Persian demands, they nevertheless departed with the impression that Alcibiades could have brought about an agreement among the powers if he had chosen to do so. This [...] at the court of Tissaphernes, however, {{put an end to the}} negotiations between the conspirators and Alcibiades. The group was convinced that Alcibiades could not deliver his side of the bargain without demanding exorbitantly high concessions of them and they accordingly abandoned their plans to restore him to Athens.|$|E
500|$|Voyager creator Jeri Taylor {{designed}} Janeway Lambda one as Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew's) favorite holonovel and a [...] "story {{within a}} story" [...] that would slowly unravel {{with each of}} its appearances. It was the first holonovel to be featured in the series. Taylor originally imagined the program as a simulation of Western fiction, in which Janeway {{assumed the role of}} a pioneer emigrating to the American West on a covered wagon. Janeway's character was described as a wife and mother struggling with daily tasks, and was portrayed as the polar opposite of Janeway's position as a Starfleet Captain. Taylor described the Western concept as a [...] "metaphor for the captain's predicament in the Delta Quadrant" [...] and a [...] "method of developing and enhancing Janeway's character". The plan was subsequently abandoned after Mulgrew expressed a dislike for working with horses and estimates for developing and filming each scene ranged up to an additional $100,000 per day. Taylor said it was [...] "not <b>a</b> <b>prudent</b> decision" [...] to keep the Western concept considering the show's budget and the difficulty in shooting outdoor locations. As a result, the concept of Janeway Lambda one was changed to be a work of Gothic fiction set in 1840s England.|$|E
