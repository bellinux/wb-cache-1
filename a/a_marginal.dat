5|$|As Ironside was <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> operation, {{and they}} were worried about exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee for the most part {{utilised}} less important agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E
5|$|At federal level, Hamersley {{is within}} the Division of Stirling, <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> seat which {{historically}} has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996.|$|E

40|$|We study {{extinction}} in a commons {{problem in}} which agents {{have access to}} capital markets. When the commons grows more quickly than the interest rate, multiple equilibria are found for intermediate commons endowments. In one of these, welfare decreases as the resource becomes more abundant, a `re- source curse'. <b>As</b> <b>marginal</b> extraction costs become constant, market access instantly depletes the commons. Without markets - the classic environment - equilibria are unique; extinction dates and welfare increase with the endow- ment. When the endowment is either very abundant or very scarce, market access improves welfare. <b>As</b> <b>marginal</b> costs of extraction from the commons become constant, market access can reduce welfare if the subjective discount rate exceeds the interest rate. commons, capital markets, perfect foresight, extinction, resource curse, storage...|$|R

5|$|In 1610 the Constable {{gave the}} cup to a convent in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. <b>A</b> <b>marginal</b> note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained {{the permission of the}} Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for {{the cup to}} be used as a ciborium, or container for consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Maryland faced Johns Hopkins for {{the first}} time since the Aggies' inaugural season. Hopkins beat Maryland handily, 30–6, and the Aggies went on to lose their next three games to finish the year with a 2–4 mark. The 1898 season saw the Aggies finish 2–5–1 and in 1899, the team {{canceled}} the remainder of its season after accumulating a 1–4 record. Maryland saw <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> improvement to 3–4–1 in 1900, but then fell to a 1–7 season in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many large}} rorquals, the fin whale is a {{cosmopolitan}} species. It {{is found in}} all the world's major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at both {{the north and south}} extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea although they can reach into the Baltic Sea, <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> sea of such conditions. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the warmest, equatorial regions.|$|E
5|$|Monocytes {{develop in}} the bone marrow and reach {{maturity}} in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant cytoplasm that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present antigens to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to tissues and organs {{and in doing so}} transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive. There are about 500 million monocytes in one litre of human blood.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several days, Bilis moved {{generally}} northwestward toward Taiwan, slowly strengthening over open waters. Bilis was designated a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 11, but the storm did not strengthen much further {{over the next few}} days due to <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> upper-air environment and dry air entrainment. PAGASA upgraded the system to typhoon status on July 12, but the JMA never officially recognized the system as such in its advisories. Bilis reached its official peak intensity of 60knots (110km/h, 70mph) later that day.|$|E

When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.|$|E
5|$|Sunshine (1999)—a three-hour {{historical}} epic, and an English-language, international co-production—was {{viewed by}} many critics as Szabó’s most ambitious film, and, along with Mephisto, his most important. Hungary’s Jews had figured in either <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> or coded fashion in several of Szabó’s earlier films, produced during the socialist period when discourse around {{the history of the}} country’s Jews was more circumscribed. In Sunshine, for the first time, Szabó focused explicitly on this aspect of Hungarian history, which he himself had experienced as a child during the Arrow Cross dictatorship. Ralph Fiennes plays three generations in the Sonnenschein family as they experience the trials of twentieth-century Hungarian Jewish history, from the late Austro-Hungarian Empire through the Holocaust to the 1956 Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The National Front was <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> {{party from}} 1973, the first {{election}} it participated in, until its {{breakthrough in the}} 1984 European elections, where it won 11% of the vote and ten MEPs. Following this election, the party's support mostly ranged from around 10 to 15%, although it saw a drop to around 5% in some late 2000s elections. Since 2010, the party's support seems to have increased towards its former heights. The party managed {{to advance to the}} final round of the presidential elections in 2002, although it failed to attract much more support after the initial first round vote.|$|E

5|$|The text is {{surrounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> commentary; {{it is the only}} codex that has both text and commentary in uncial script. The commentary is a catena of quotations of nine church fathers: Origen, Eusebius, Titus of Bostra, Basil, Isidore of Pelusium, Cyril of Alexandria, Sever from Antioch, Victor from Antioch, and Chrysostom. The commentary surrounds the single-column text of Luke on three sides. Patristic text is written in small uncial letters. Most of the quotations are those of Ciril of Alexandria (93 scholia); next comes Titus of Bostra (45 scholia). The commentary was written in a different kind of uncial script than the biblical text.|$|E
5|$|Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, {{plantations}} {{were established}} {{for the production of}} crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported and planted in 1803, and coconuts—which had been relatively sparse on the island—were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil. Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19thcentury, when more intensive cultivation for export began. Vanilla, later to become one of Madagascar's premiere export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of hand pollination, critical to higher vanilla yields, was introduced 30years later. Nonetheless, vanilla remained <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> crop {{until the end of the}} monarchy.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, NSB {{started the}} process of finding a {{replacement}} for the El 9. New locomotives would cost NOK20 million, and the company saw it as unrealistic to invest so much in <b>a</b> <b>marginal</b> branch line. NSB had also concluded its away-with-the-steam program, and therefore had a lack of locomotives in general. If {{a new class of}} locomotives was to be built, it would have to satisfy more than the requirements for the Flåm Line, so NSB instead started investigating whether any of the older models could be used. Tests were performed in 1971 and 1973 with El 11, built between 1951 and 1964, and El 13, built between 1957 and 1966. Neither was considered optimal: El 11 allowed the train weight to increase to , but the train had the steps for the voltage regulator and the commutation set for too high speeds. El 13 had rheostatic brakes, which were not suitable for the gradient; the locomotives were also better suited for mainline service and would therefore not be prioritized for branch lines.|$|E
