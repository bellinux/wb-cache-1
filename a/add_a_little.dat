25|$|Buttons and Buttonholes: the three-roll-two {{construction}} {{features a}} lapel that hides the third button, {{in order to}} provide extra freedom of movement thanks to a longer opening in the front. The buttonhole on the lapel is called “occhiello” in Italian, and it means “little eye” for its elongated almond shape. There isn’t really a tradition for a specific type of buttonhole in Naples, but there is a tendency of Neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt, while “regular” buttonholes of English tradition are more elongated and slender. Some tailors <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> teardrop shape {{at the end of the}} buttonhole, but that’s an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition. For what concerns the buttons on the sleeves, they are always working buttons, and they are always overlapping, as if they were kissing each other.|$|E
25|$|Many of the European comics {{based on}} the Disney Universe have created {{their own version of}} Scrooge McDuck, usually {{involving}} him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s-1980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero dragging his long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or blunderbuss, or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings {{up at the end of}} the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb – something which Scrooge shows little concern for – he tends to end up with nothing.|$|E

The title has been contested since 1898 in varying forms of competition. Juventus are the current champions, and {{have won a}} record of 33 titles. The first time the Scudetto was used was in 1924 when Genoa won its 9th championship title and decided to <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shield to their shirt as to reward and celebrate themselves as champions.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I really think they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E
500|$|However, other reviews were positive. After Briggs' {{review was}} published, {{a large number}} of letters {{supportive}} of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to [...] "take a second look" [...] at the show, with Matt Shumway and Lamont Wayne writing a much more positive review, calling it [...] "a fresh show with very different approaches". The Sarasota Herald-Tribune was highly positive of the show and felt that the show's lively animation and slapstick humor recalled [...] "the delight of earlier cartoon era", writing: [...] "In times of old, cartoon characters had eyes that bugged out when they drank something unpleasant, legs that became whirling circles when they ran and bodies that flattened into pancakes when they crashed into slammed doors. Well, they're ba-a-a-ck." [...] The Herald Sun considered Ed, Edd n Eddy an animated mixture of well-known classic TV shows, noting [...] "just imagine Dexter in his laboratory working on some new project for the Cartoon Network when he tunes into The Little Rascals and The Three Stooges. Alfalfa, Spanky, Moe and Curly really excite the wunderkind who decides to extract some DNA from the old TV legends. Into the test tubes with the DNA ... <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> animation and Dexter has Ed, Edd N Eddy".|$|E
500|$|Australian activist Julian Assange—the {{founder of}} WikiLeaks—appeared as himself. Many of his lines {{were written by}} Australian author Kathy Lette, {{who is one of}} Assange's friends. According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess they just wanted me to <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made {{as to whether or not}} he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it." [...] Groening has said in an interview that [...] "We [...] dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gilmore Girls non-diegetic {{score was}} {{composed}} by singer-songwriter Sam Phillips throughout its entire run. Sherman-Palladino, {{who served as}} the music supervisor of the series, was a big fan of the musician and secured her involvement. For the score's instrumental arrangement, Phillips primarily used her voice and an acoustic guitar, and on occasion included piano, violin, and drums. Many of the musical cues are accompanied by melodic [...] "la-la"s and [...] "ahh"s, which [...] developed because Sherman-Palladino wanted the score to sound connected to the girls themselves, almost like [...] "an extension of their thoughts ... if they had music going in their head during a certain emotional thing in their life." [...] Sherman-Palladino felt that the score elevated the series [...] "because it wasn't a wasted element in the show. Everything was trying to say a little something, <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> something to it." [...] Several of Phillips' album tracks are also played in the show, and she made an appearance in the season six finale, performing part of [...] "Taking Pictures".|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Udi" [...] was pictured {{during this}} session which was choreographed by Longinus Fernandes, whom Bhansali had judged in Jhalak Dikhla Jaa, a popular dance based reality show. Fernandes was already {{known for his}} works in Slumdog Millionaire and Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na. According to him Bhansali [...] "..wanted to make the song {{different}} and unique. I asked him if we can <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of Spanish to it {{and give it a}} raw, earthy feel. He liked the idea, so we gave the whole dance a very rustic look {{in order to make it}} look as natural as possible". The choreographer added that the dance sequence was very distinct in that the audience had never seen Rai doing such steps. He went gaga over the lead actress saying that she danced like a dream. Longinus said in an interview that it [...] ".. did not take her long to learn the dance but it did take her some time to perfect it and to get into the mood of the character". In an interview Sanjay Leela Bhansali said that in the song Udi, [...] "..with such few words Sofia manages to say so much. It was my tribute to Waheeda Rahman's character in Guide."In a sequence from the film, Ethan explains Omar, that the first magic he had performed was for his mother. Bhansali said that it is inspired from his childhood days. He said, [...] "I remember my grandmother selling off the last of her silver and storing chillar in large Johnson baby powder tin. Every afternoon she would count that money and put it back. That kurr-kurr of the coins being bought out, counted and put back had to be heard again. The value of those coins doesn't exist anymore but it was an important part of my growing up." [...] Since Roshan's character, Ethan, plays a magician in the initial portion of the film, a Ukrainian magician was hired for teaching him magic tricks, after a long search for a professional magician. The magic stunts performed by Roshan and Monikangana Dutta formed the major portion of the film shot in the last schedule.|$|E
