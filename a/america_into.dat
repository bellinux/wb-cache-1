5|$|After {{graduating from}} Harvard and {{serving in the}} Army during World War I, Tunis began his writing career freelancing for American sports {{magazines}} while playing tennis in the Rivera. For {{the next two decades}} he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire. Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning <b>America</b> <b>into</b> a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E

5|$|Argon-argon radiometric dating {{indicates}} that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, {{the site of the}} Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North <b>America</b> <b>into</b> two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Daniel {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on July2. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection, and on July12, it crossed Central <b>America</b> <b>into</b> the eastern Pacific Ocean. Convection increased on July13, and two days later the system began to exhibit signs of tropical development to the south of Mexico. It tracked westward at about 15mph (25km/h), and on July16, the disturbance became better organized. With convective rainbands near an associated low-level circulation, it is estimated the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression late on July16. At the time, it was located about 525miles (845km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Flossy {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean and moved across Central <b>America</b> <b>into</b> the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression on September 21, 1956, which became a tropical storm on September 22 and a hurricane on September 23. The hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h) before it struck the central Gulf coast of the United States as a Category 1 hurricane on September 24, and evolved into an extratropical cyclone on September 25. It was the first hurricane to affect oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. The tropical cyclone led to flooding in New Orleans, and broke a drought across the eastern United States. The death toll was 15, and total damages reached $24.8million (1956USD).|$|E

Most of these sinkings {{took place in the}} mid-Atlantic gap, well within range of long-range Sunderlands and Liberators, only the Command lacked these aircraft in quantity. Following the entry of the United States of <b>America</b> <b>into</b> the war, German U-boats had plenty of targets. Coastal Command found it difficult to maintain strength. Its units now operated from the United States, West Africa, the Mediterranean, Iceland, Russia, Gibraltar, North Africa and the Middle East. Squadrons were also sent to the Pacific Theatre of Operations.|$|E
5|$|In the Cretaceous, {{a shallow}} seaway spread into the {{interior}} of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North <b>America</b> <b>into</b> two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay {{on top of each other}} as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Emilia {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that crossed northern Central <b>America</b> <b>into</b> the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 16. The system moved westward, developing a well-defined low pressure area about 525miles (850km) southwest of Acapulco by July 19. The next day, its forward motion had shifted to a slow north-northwest track, and with its convection continuing to organize around the low, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Early on July 21, its thunderstorm activity organized enough for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Six-E, located to the southwest of Acapulco.|$|E

United States, 320 U.S. 115 (1943) was a United States Supreme Court case {{regarding}} {{the constitutionality of}} curfews used during World War II when they were applied to citizens of the United States. The case arose out of the implementation of Executive Order 9066 by the U.S. military to create zones of exclusion along the West Coast of the United States where Japanese-Americans were subjected to curfews and eventual removal to relocation centers. This Presidential order followed the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that brought <b>America</b> <b>into</b> World War II and inflamed the existing anti-Japanese sentiment in the country.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 14, 1998. It traveled westward, and on August 19 spawned the tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Bonnie. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and crossed Central <b>America</b> <b>into</b> the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low-level circulation over southern Mexico. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low-level circulation, and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low-level circulation on August 29 about 575miles (925km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. On August 31, the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center. By early on September 1, despite a lack of convective organization, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E, or the tenth tropical depression of the season, about 350miles (565km) south of Cabo San Lucas. In real time, the National Hurricane Center first upgraded the system 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 3. It tracked westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean, and on June 15 it crossed Central <b>America</b> <b>into</b> the eastern Pacific Ocean. The system continued westward, and late on June 16 a low pressure area developed about 300miles (480km) southwest of San José, Costa Rica. At around 1200UTC on June 17, Dvorak classifications began on the disturbance, though initially its convection was broadly distributed and disorganized. The next day, however, an area of concentrated convection developed just south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Ships in the vicinity confirmed the development of a surface circulation within the system, while satellite imagery showed the development of a central dense overcast. Based on its organization, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-E late on June 18 while located about 270miles (470km) southeast of Puerto Angel, Oaxaca in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on May16 and crossed Central <b>America</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific Ocean on May24. That day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather about 150mi (240km) southwest of the Costa Rican coastline. At that time, this system was associated with a monsoon trough embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Despite being disorganized, gradual development of this system was anticipated by the NHC. On May25, a broad low pressure area formed southwest of Nicaragua, after the tropical wave interacted with an eastward-moving Kelvin wave. Convection soon became organized around the newly formed low, and the NHC noted that the formation of a tropical cyclone within the subsequent 48hours was likely. The NHC estimated that Tropical Depression Two-E developed at 1200UTC on May28 about 125mi (205km) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Cora was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season to reach hurricane strength. Forming from a disturbance that exited the African coast on August 7, the storm moved at an unusually high forward speed for a cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean in August. The storm later reached hurricane strength and formed a well-defined eye that lasted only 12hours before the eye rapidly lost organization for unknown reasons, though the post-season report on the storm mentions the possibility that its high speed caused the eye to dissipate. The storm moved west-southwestward, weakening before making landfall {{on the island of}} Grenada. The storm lost its circulation and became a tropical wave on August 12. The remnant crossed over Central <b>America</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific Ocean, where it reintensified, becoming Hurricane Kristy.|$|E
