5|$|The Mitsukue {{neighborhood}} prospered as a port town {{during the}} feudal period, {{as it was}} used as a port of rest for daimyōs on their way to and from the capital as part of the sankin-kōtai system. This traffic was likely the source of the demand for Nobutaka's abortive <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> shortcut through the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Weezer {{recorded}} The Kitchen Tapes as an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> buzz around L.A. The band eventually attracted {{attention from}} major-label A reps looking for alternative rock bands while performing {{on the same}} bill as the band That Dog. They were then signed to DGC Records on June 26, 1993, by Todd Sullivan, an A rep from Geffen Records.|$|E
5|$|In an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> {{sense of}} realism for the storyline, {{principal}} CNN news outlet commentators were scripted into Contact.

5|$|The German {{aircraft}} carrier Graf Zeppelin {{was the lead}} ship {{in a class of}} two carriers of the same name ordered by the Kriegsmarine. She was the only {{aircraft carrier}} launched by Germany and represented part of the Kriegsmarines <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> well-balanced oceangoing fleet, capable of projecting German naval power far beyond the narrow confines of the Baltic and North Seas. The carrier would have had a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us, an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{video game}} developed by Naughty Dog, {{deals with the}} relationship between an older man, Joel, and a teenaged girl, Ellie. Joel is tasked with escorting Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> potential cure against an infection to which Ellie is immune.

5|$|Club {{competitions}} between {{teams from}} different European countries can trace their origins {{as far back}} as 1897, when the Challenge Cup was created for clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who did not meet under normal circumstances. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, named after entrepreneur and sportsman Thomas Lipton, was established in 1909 and was contested between clubs from Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland; the competition lasted for two years. The earliest <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> cup for national champion clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club FC Servette. Founded in 1930, the Coupe des Nations featured clubs of ten major European football leagues and was deemed a success. Due to financial reasons, the competition was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1870, Rockefeller {{abolished}} the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, forming Standard Oil of Ohio. Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.|$|E
5|$|The Wildcat Tribune was Dougherty's {{official}} {{student newspaper}} before being dissolved by the school's administration in 2009. Published online and in print, the Tribune featured sections on news, editorials, opinions, features, entertainment, and sports. The first <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> newspaper club {{occurred in the}} inaugural school year, although it fell through because the teacher supporting the club was unable to receive approval from the school's administration. The newspaper club was founded by five students during the 08-09 school year.

5|$|The game is set {{twenty years}} after an {{outbreak}} of the mutated strain of Cordyceps fungus that destroyed much of civilization. The single-player story follows Joel, tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> potential cure against the infection to which Ellie is immune. Players make their way through various locations, fighting against the Infected and hostile human survivors. The multiplayer lets up to eight players engage in cooperative or competitive game matches. To accommodate Remastereds technical enhancements, Naughty Dog spent months developing the game, beginning upon the release of The Last of Us.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} American horse breeds with leopard {{coloring}} and Appaloosa ancestry. These include the Pony of the Americas and the Colorado Ranger. Appaloosas are crossbred with gaited horse breeds in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> leopard-spotted ambling horse. Because such crossbred offspring {{are not eligible}} for ApHC registration, their owners have formed breed registries for horses with leopard complex patterns and gaited ability. In 1995 the Nez Perce tribe began a program to develop a new and distinct horse breed, the Nez Perce Horse, based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa with the Akhal-Teke breed from Central Asia. Appaloosa stallions have been exported to Denmark, to add new blood to the Knabstrup breed.|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} {{continuing}} fan activities eventually persuaded Universal Studios {{to produce a}} feature film, Serenity. (The title of Serenity was chosen, according to Whedon, because Fox still owned {{the rights to the}} name 'Firefly'). Numerous early screenings of rough film cuts were held for existing fans starting in May 2005 as an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> buzz to increase ticket sales when the final film cut was released widely on September 30, 2005. The film was not as commercially successful as fans had hoped, opening at number two and making only $40 million worldwide during its initial theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his life, Władysław {{successfully}} defended Poland {{against foreign}} invasions. He {{was recognized as}} a good tactician and strategist, who did much to modernize the Polish Army. Władysław ensured that the officer corps was significantly large so that the army could be expanded; introduced foreign (Western) infantry to the Polish Army, with its pikes and early firearms, and supported {{the expansion of the}} artillery. His <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy resulted {{in the creation of a}} new port village, Władysławowo. Despite promising beginnings, Władysław failed to secure enough funds for the fleet creation; the ships were gone – sunk, or stolen – by the 1640s.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Ellie is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the 2013 video game The Last of Us, and the main protagonist of the upcoming video game The Last of Us Part II. In the first game, the character Joel is tasked with escorting Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> potential cure for an infection to which Ellie is immune. She is voiced by Ashley Johnson, who also provided motion capture for the character. While players briefly assume control of Ellie {{for a portion of}} the game, the computer's artificial intelligence primarily controls her actions, often assisting in combat by attacking or identifying enemies. Ellie reappeared as the sole playable {{character in the}} downloadable content prequel campaign, , in which she spends time with her friend Riley. Ellie is also the main character in the comic book prequel, , wherein she befriends Riley and has her first encounter with the rebel group the Fireflies.|$|E

In one scenario, Nue, a young female Tayutai, begins to steal undergarments from the Flawless dormitories due to her curiosity in them. She is defeated by Mashiro and Mifuyu Kisaragi, and finds herself befriended by Mifuyu, who later begins {{to take care of her}} as a guardian. Yumina Takanashi, Yuri's stepsister, also begins to take care of Hou, an exhausted bird Tayutai who begins to nest on Yumina's head. Yumina is later attacked by Ou, another Tayutai who makes up the Houou couple with Hou, before the couple reconciles with the help of Yuri and Mashiro. Lastly, Ameri allies herself with Ouryu, the last of the Three Mightiest, out of jealousy from the amount of attention Mashiro receives from Yuri. After Ameri reconciles with Yuri, Ouryu agrees to stop attacking humans, and acknowledges Mashiro's goal.|$|E
5|$|Since the 20th century {{there has}} been {{significant}} population movement to England, mostly {{from other parts of}} the British Isles, but also from the Commonwealth, particularly the Indian subcontinent. Since the 1970s {{there has been}} a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the service industry. As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a common market initiative called the European Economic Community which became the European Union. Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. There is no devolved English government, but an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> film {{without the support of}} the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
