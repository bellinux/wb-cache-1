30|$|Overall, Chinese trade cost shows a {{downward}} trend with 108.4 % in 2000 declining to 0.9089 in 2013, which falls by 16.2 %. This is mainly due to China’s joining WTO in 2001, and China’s economic rapidly {{integrated into the}} global with the reduction of non tariff and tariff, {{as well as the}} declining access barriers. During this period, the trade cost reached 0.973, which ranks fourth. This is due to the declining economic since the global financial crisis, which contributes to the deterioration of external situation. For example, the year of 2009 has the highest number of Chinese trade friction cases and highest amount. During 2009 and 2013, Chinese foreign trade gradually gets rid of the impact of financial crisis, and shows a declining trend of <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> cost. In 2004, the average <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> cost is only 0.66 in these 37 industrialized countries and the countries that are in transition (Milner and McGowan 2013).

40|$|The {{topic of}} insider/director trading raises {{interesting}} questions and has generated much attention from researchers, market participants and regulators. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to investigate the long-run director trading performance in the UK market. It examines relationship between <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and indicators of the UK macroeconomy focus on the macro-aspects in Chapter 4 and 5. The extant empirical literature on <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> can be categorized into two parts: {{the first is the}} relationship between director trading and the stock market; and the second is the link between stock returns and future aggregate economic activities. Having examined the macro-picture, it goes to examine a more micro-picture. Chapter 6 examines long-run relationship between director trading and market reactions. This thesis is organized around three research studies which are presented in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 and which examine long-run director trading activities in the UK. Chapters 4 and 5 together investigate the evidence for director trading activities and the macroeconomy. There is little literature on <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and the macro-economy: therefore Chapter 4 examines the relationship between <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and future market excess returns. Empirical evidence is presented which demonstrates that the returns on stock market are significantly correlated to future economic growth. Chapter 5 then examines whether the forecasting ability can be improved by adding <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> as a measurement of business confidence into the forecasting model. Chapter 6 examines the long-run performance of market reaction to director roles. In order {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and the macro-economy, the link between <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and future market excess returns is investigated. This thesis considers the importance of the seasonality issue in UK director trading and employs a number of alternative seasonality adjustments to adjust the raw data on <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading.</b> The positive correlation between <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and future market excess returns is confirmed and evidence is provided that indicates directors are contrarian: in aggregate they purchase (sell) their own-company stock prior to general stock market increases (decreases). In the long-run, the empirical work demonstrates that <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> has forecasting power in terms of predicting future stock market excess returns. Additional findings are that <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> in large firms has a positive significant predictive ability for identifying future excess returns of large firms and <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> of some industries has positive significant forecasting ability for future excess returns of these industries. Having confirmed the relationship between <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and future market movement, this thesis turns to examine the link between <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and future UK economic growth. It measures economic growth of future real economic activity by the change in gross domestic product (GDP) and it documents a strong correlation between past <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> and future real economic activity. The predictability of future economic growth increases with both the length of forecasting horizon and past net number of director trading. In a multivariate regression analysis this thesis finds that <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> retains predicting power with respect to future GDP growth even after including popular business cycle variables (dividend yield of FTSE All share, growth rate of industrial production and term spread) as explanatory variables. This finding suggests that <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading</b> captures things related to changes in real activity but not captured by market factors (Fama-French 3 factors: SMB, HML and RMRF) and business cycle variables. After examining the relationship between <b>aggregate</b> director <b>trading,</b> market returns and changes in GDP, the last empirical Chapter of the thesis concentrates director trading on the micro-aspects of director trading and stock movement. It examines the stock market reaction to director trading with firm characteristics and the effects of director trading pattern. Using long-run calendar-time abnormal returns (CTAR) methodology with Fama-French 3 -factor model, evidence is presented that directors do have more valuable information allowing them to make significant abnormal returns than other market participants, the performance of CFOs supports the information hierarchy hypothesis in 1 - and 6 -month post-purchase trading time, and the director trading with firm characteristics has a significant effect on stock abnormal returns...|$|R

3000|$|Table  4 shows, {{whether it}} is from the {{perspective}} of “global comparative advantage” or of “local comparative advantage” (Deardorff 2004), the <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> cost has the effect on export structure of manufacturing, 9 which indicates the trade cost is similar with the material capital and human capital, and is also a factor that influences the trade pattern or structure. The increase in Chinese <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> cost significantly reduces the export share of manufacturing. This effect in the industry with higher trade cost sensitivity is more obvious, and thereby affects the structure of trade commodities. Specifically, the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacturing of office, accounting and computing machinery (C 30)” is highest with the value of 0.523639; the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacture of radio, television and communication equipment and apparatus (C 32)” ranks second with the value of 0.464463; the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacture of medical equipment, precision instruments and optical instruments, watches and clocks manufacturing (C 33)” ranks third with the value of 0.464463. The decline of <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> cost contributes to the effect of these industries export ranking the top three. The trade cost sensitivity of “food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing (C 15 T 16)” is lowest with the value of 0.118279. The trade cost sensitivity of “other non metallic mineral products manufacturing (C 26)” is in the reciprocal second with the value of 0.166794. The trade cost sensitivity of “wood products (C 20)” is in the reciprocal third with the value of 0.178894. The decline of <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> cost contributes to the effect of these industries export in the reciprocal three.

I propose the first explanation for the gravity equation {{in international trade}}, based on the emergence of a stable network of input-output linkages between firms. Over time, a firm acquires more suppliers and customers, which tend to be further away.
