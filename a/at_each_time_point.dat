When the log rank statistic is large, it is evidence for a difference in the survival times between the groups. The log rank statistic approximately has a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, and the p-value is calculated using the chi-squared distribution.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} assess changes in osteophytic, chondral, and {{subchondral}} structures in a surgically-induced osteoarthritis (OA) rabbit model {{in order to}} correlate MRI findings with the macroscopic progress of OA and to define the timepoint for disease status in this OA model. METHODS: The OA model was constructed by surgery in thirty rabbits with ten normal rabbits serving as controls (baseline). High-resolution three-dimensional MRI using a 1. 5 -T coil was performed at baseline, two, four, and eight weeks post-surgery. MRIs of cartilage lesions, subchondral bone lesions, and osteophyte formations were independently assessed by two blinded radiologists. Ten rabbits were sacrificed at baseline, two, four, and eight weeks post-surgery, and macroscopic evaluation was independently performed by two blinded orthopedic surgeons. RESULTS: The signal intensities and morphologies of chondral and subchondral structures by MRI accurately reflected the degree of OA. Cartilage defects progressed from a grade of 0. 05 - 0. 15 to 1. 15 - 1. 30 to 1. 90 - 1. 97 to 3. 00 - 3. 35 <b>at</b> <b>each</b> successive <b>time</b> <b>point,</b> respectively (p< 0. 05). Subchondral bone lesions progressed from a grade of 0. 00 to 0. 78 - 0. 90 to 1. 27 - 1. 58 to 1. 95 - 2. 23 <b>at</b> <b>each</b> successive <b>time</b> <b>point,</b> respectively (p =  0. 000). Osteophytes progressed from a size (mm) of 0. 00 to 0. 87 - 1. 06 to 1. 24 - 1. 87 to 2. 21 - 3. 21 <b>at</b> <b>each</b> successive <b>time</b> <b>point,</b> respectively (p =  0. 000). CONCLUSIONS: Serial observations revealed that MRI can accurately detect the progression of cartilage lesions and subchondral bone edema over an eight-week period but may not be accurate in detecting osteophyte sizes. Week four post-surgery was considered the timepoint between OA-negative and OA-positive status in this OA model. The combination of this OA model with MRI evaluation should provide a promising tool for the pre-clinical evaluation of new disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs...|$|R
