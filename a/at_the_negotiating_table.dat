Her missions around this time were generally strategic bombing missions, however {{the effectiveness of these}} final missions were mixed, with some failing to achieve strategic results. She also provided close air support for UN troops for the final weeks of the war before an armistice was reached at Panmunjom in July 1953, ending major combat operations in Korea. During this time, the two sides often conducted costly attacks in order to strengthen their bargaining positions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>table.</b> Boxer remained in Korean waters until November 1953. She received eight battle stars for her service in Korea.|$|E
25|$|The next Russo-Ottoman war in 1877 led {{to another}} European intervention, {{although}} this time <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>table.</b> The Congress of Berlin blocked Russia from imposing the harsh Treaty of San Stefano on the Ottoman Empire. Despite its alliance with the French in the Crimean War, Britain viewed the Second Empire of Napoleon III with some distrust, especially as the emperor built up his navy, expanded his empire and took up a more active foreign policy.|$|E

Tikka Khan had proposed an offensive into India, and the PAF's overriding priority was to give maximum support to this offensive. The initial plans for the offensive called {{for at least a}} temporary cover of air dominance by the PAF under which Khan's troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into Western India before digging in and consolidating their positions. In order to achieve air dominance, Pakistan decided to launch an offensive counter air strike codenamed Operation Chengiz Khan on Indian airbases.|$|E

500|$|Indonesia, meanwhile, and {{especially}} her longtime president Sukarno, was vehemently {{opposed to the}} creation of the Federation. Sukarno opposed both the preservation of the 'imperialist' British presence in Southeast Asia, a region in which he aspired to be the supreme power, and the incorporating of the Borneo colonies into the new Federation, as his goal was to control the entire island. Indeed, through possession of the Kalimantan region, Indonesia already controlled the vast majority of the massive island. To improve Indonesia's position <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>table</b> before the Federation was created, Sukarno initiated a period of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) with Malaysia. Consisting initially of frequent raids by Indonesian 'volunteers' into Malaysian territory, the conflict was not considered a war by either side, least of all by the Indonesians. In fact, when questioned on what exactly the Confrontation was, Foreign Minister Subandrio of Indonesia replied, [...] "Confrontation does not include war, because it can be carried on without war." ...|$|E
500|$|Pertaining to the above, {{it should}} be noted that Walter Brown was not rich; also that as Auerbach was as tough <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>table</b> as he was on the {{practice}} court and in the locker room, it was always for the purpose of getting the most out of his players. In the summer of 1984, with much trepidation, Auerbach reluctantly signed former finals MVP Cedric Maxwell to a lucrative guaranteed contract to stay with the Celtics. Then, Auerbach's worst fears came true when Maxwell arrived that fall out of shape, and, suffering from various injuries, provided little contribution as the team lost a playoff for the first time ever to the Lakers in the 1985 Finals. [...] Two subsequent facts are perhaps most relevant in evaluating Auerbach's legacy: First, he was able to trade Maxwell to San Diego in exchange for former MVP Bill Walton, who was a major contributor to the team winning its 16th title in 1986, the last of Auerbach's career. Second, Maxwell continues to be embraced as a beloved member of the Celtics family, including having his number retired alongside the team's legendary greats.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the [...] Viet Minh had proclaimed {{independence}} {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in September 1945. This occurred after the withdrawal of Imperial Japan, which had seized control of the French colony during World War II. The military struggle started in November 1946 when France attempted to reassert control over Indochina with {{an attack on the}} northern port city of Haiphong. The DRV was recognised by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On the other hand, the western powers recognised the French-backed State of Vietnam, nominally led by Emperor Bảo Đại, but with a French-trained Vietnamese National Army (VNA) which was loyal to the French Union forces. In May 1954, after eight years of fighting, the French were surrounded and defeated in a mountainous northern fortress at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. France's withdrawal from Indochina was finalised in the Geneva Accords of July 1954, after two months of negotiations between Ho's DRV, France, the PRC and the Soviet Union. Under the terms of the agreement, Vietnam was temporarily divided at the 17th parallel north pending elections in 1956 to choose a national government that would administer a reunified country. The communist Viet Minh were left in control of North Vietnam, while the State of Vietnam controlled the south. French Union forces would gradually withdraw from Vietnam as the situation stabilised. Both Vietnamese sides were unsatisfied with the outcome at Geneva; Ngo Dinh Diem, Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam, denounced France's agreement and ordered his delegation not to sign. He stated [...] "We cannot recognise the seizure by Soviet China [...] [...] [...] of over half of our national territory" [...] and that [...] "We can neither concur in the brutal enslavement of millions of compatriots". North Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng expressed bitterness after his Soviet and Chinese backers threatened to cut support if he did not agree to the peace terms; Dong had wanted to press home the Viet Minh's military advantage so they could lay claim to more territory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
50|$|After a {{month and}} a half of {{planning}} and reorganization, a new offensive was launched 15 January 1951, and was successfully completed by 10 February with the recapture of Inchon and Kimpo Air Base. This was the first of several successful assaults on the Chinese/North Korean force, which helped turn the tide in the United Nations' favor. The division next participated in Operation Ripper, during which it drove the enemy across the Han River. Success continued with Operation Dauntless, Detonate and Piledriver in the Spring of 1951. These offensives secured part of the famous Iron Triangle which enhanced the United Nations' bargaining platform. With leaders of four nations now <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>tables</b> in <b>the</b> summer of 1951, Division activity slowed to patrol and defensive actions to maintain the line of resistance. This type of action continued into the winter of 1952. When negotiations stalled, the division assumed the responsibility of guarding the approaches of Seoul on 5 May 1953. 23 days later, a heavy Chinese assault was hurled <b>at</b> it. <b>The</b> division held its ground and the assault was repulsed; the brunt of the attack was absorbed by the 14th Infantry Regiment ("Golden Dragons"). By successfully defending Seoul from continued attack from May to July 1953, the division earned its second Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. Again negotiators moved toward peace. In July, the division again moved to reserve status at Camp Casey where it remained through the signing of the armistice 27 July 1953. Fourteen division soldiers were awarded Medals of Honor during the Korean War, making the division one of the most decorated US Army divisions of that war.|$|R
40|$|Would {{developing}} countries and their poor populations benefit from further trade liberalization under the World Trade Organization (WTO) ? How have the different strands of globalization affected poverty and food security in {{developing countries}}? What policies should governments promote to improve the access of small farmers and traders to domestic, regional, and global markets?Agriculture plays a predominant role in the economies of developing countries. Any strategy for ending poverty and hunger {{in the developing world}} must center on rapid growth in the agricultural sector. However, increased agricultural productivity can also have an adverse effect on the poor by depressing commodity prices and farm incomes. Poorly functioning markets, weak domestic consumer demand, and lack of export opportunities constrain agricultural growth. Trade negotiations have long been accompanied by heated debates about {{the costs and benefits of}} global trade liberalization. Such debates have focused on whether freer trade promotes development and reduces poverty or penalizes the poor through stagnation and the worsening of global and national income distribution disparities. The Globalization and Markets Program’s research helps policymakers and stakeholders in developing countries address the implications of trade liberalization and globalization. We strengthen the analytical capacities of {{developing countries and}} use research and outreach to improve those countries' positions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> global <b>negotiating</b> <b>table.</b> In industrialized nations, we inform governments and the public about the impacts the developed world can have on developing countries and the world’s poor.
