5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{scores were}} tied fifteen times, and <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> were the Australians {{more than five}} points in front. With six minutes {{to go in the}} final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she {{extended}} her team's lead to 47–43. A technical foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from the paint to put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once more, but time ran out, and the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.|$|E
5|$|Alaska possessed no {{mental health}} {{treatment}} facilities prior {{to the passage of}} the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E

5|$|In Journey, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} a robed figure in a desert. After an {{introductory}} sequence, the player is shown the robed figure sitting in the sand, with a large mountain in the distance. The path towards this mountain, the ultimate destination of the game, is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly. The player can walk in the levels, as well as control the camera, which typically follows behind the figure, either with the analog stick or by tilting the motion-sensitive controller. The player can jump with one button, or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another; the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button is pressed, and the note stays in tune with the background music. These controls are presented pictorially {{in the beginning of the}} game; <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> outside of the credits and title screen are any words shown or spoken.|$|E
5|$|On Falalop Island, the seawall erected during World War II {{was entirely}} {{destroyed}} and allowed storm surge to inundate the island; however, <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> was the entire island under water. Initially, Falalop was left under 1.2m (4ft) of water, though {{by the time}} the eye moved over this had decreased to 0.6m (2ft). Along the south shore, waves reached 1.8m (6ft) and caused moderate beach erosion. Sand from the coastline was found up to 215m (700ft) inland, filling many taro pits in the island's interior. Along the south shore, two children were killed when their home collapsed, pinning them underneath debris, and water later inundated the area and drowned them. Elsewhere on the island, three people sustained minor injuries. Asor Island experienced most of its flooding as the backside of Ophelia moved through. The island was shortened by 45m (150ft) to the north and southern beaches experienced varying degrees of erosion. Mogmog Island, located at the northern end of the atoll's lagoon, saw the deposition of large boulders and cobblestone along its north shore which covered an area 30 to 45m (100 to 150ft) wide. Flying debris resulted in one injury on both Asor and Mogmog. To the west, Potangeras Island saw an increase in land area by 60m (200ft) as sand was pushed from other areas.|$|E
5|$|The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide {{written by}} Rebecca Silverman, {{also of the}} Anime News Network, {{expressed}} differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention {{that she had not}} previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s. In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Point</b> <b>No</b> <b>Point</b> Treaty {{was signed}} on January 26, 1855 <b>at</b> <b>Point</b> <b>No</b> <b>Point,</b> on the {{northern}} tip of the Kitsap Peninsula. Governor of Washington Territory, Isaac Stevens, convened the treaty council on January 25, with the S'Klallam, the Chimakum, and the Skokomish tribes. Under the terms of the treaty, the original inhabitants of northern Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Peninsula were to cede ownership of their land in exchange for small reservations along Hood Canal and a payment of $60,000 from the federal government. The treaty required the natives to trade only with the United States, to free all their slaves, and it abjured them not to acquire any new slaves.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{strategy of}} Heraclius, {{to destroy the}} Muslim troops in Syria, needed a rapid and quick deployment, but the commanders on the ground never displayed these qualities. Ironically, on the field at Yarmouk, Khalid carried out on a small tactical scale what Heraclius had planned on a grand strategic scale: by rapidly deploying and manoeuvering his forces, Khalid was able to temporarily concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail. Vahan {{was never able to}} make his numerical superiority count, perhaps because of the unfavorable terrain that prevented large-scale deployment. However, <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> did Vahan attempt to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough. Although he was on the offensive 5 days out of the six, his battle line remained remarkably static. This all stands {{in stark contrast to the}} very successful offensive plan that Khalid carried out on the final day, when he reorganised virtually all his cavalry and committed them to a grand manoeuvre that won the battle.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E
5|$|Stratus' second {{reign as}} {{champion}} {{came to an}} end on June 23, when she was defeated at King of the Ring by Molly Holly. The two Divas continued their storyline feud for the next three months. After a failed attempt to win the title in July, Stratus won the championship back at Unforgiven. While feuding with Holly, Stratus was also involved in an angle with new Diva Victoria, who held a storyline grudge against Stratus, claiming she was betrayed by Stratus when they both worked as fitness models. The two competed in several title matches, with Stratus retaining until Survivor Series, where Victoria won the title in a Hardcore match. On March 17, 2003, Victoria and Steven Richards defeated Jazz and Stratus in a tag team match when Jazz walked out on Stratus. After the match, Jeff Hardy saved Stratus from an attack by Victoria and Richards and then kissed her, resulting in Stratus becoming Hardy's on-screen girlfriend once more. The two would talk and kiss backstage, compete as an intergender tag team, and come to each other's aid when in danger during singles competition. <b>At</b> <b>no</b> <b>point</b> was their previous relationship acknowledged. The storyline was suddenly dropped when WWE released Hardy in April. This marked the second time in two years that a romance between Stratus and Hardy was abruptly scrapped due to a setback in one of their personal lives. In neither instance did the angle fully play out or reach a conclusion.|$|E
