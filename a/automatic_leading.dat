500|$|The ITP was a low-wing, mixed {{construction}} monoplane {{with a wooden}} monocoque fuselage made from 'shpon', molded birch plywood. The two-spar metal wing was built in three sections with <b>automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slats. The engine radiators were built into the wing center section with intakes in the wing roots while the oil cooler was located under the engine. The curved, one-piece windshield lacked a flat front panel which gave the pilot a rather distorted view. The conventional undercarriage, including the tailwheel, was fully retractable. It carried [...] of fuel in tanks between the spars of the wing center section. The rear fuselage, cockpit and tail resembled that of the Polikarpov I-185.|$|E
500|$|The Petlyakov design bureau {{addressed}} {{these concerns}} in September {{and they were}} tested in the Pe-3bis prototype between September and October. The armament was upgraded with 250rounds provided {{for each of the}} UBK machine guns, a 20mm ShVAK cannon with 250rounds was mounted in the nose and a 12.7mm Berezin UBT machine gun with 180rounds in boxes replaced the 7.62mm ShKAS in the dorsal position. Frontal armor was installed and the navigator's seat armor was thickened with a total weight of [...] <b>Automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slats were fitted and the nitrogen fuel tank pressurization system was replaced by one that used inert gases from the engine exhaust. The crash pylon was moved forward [...] and the cockpit canopy shortened.|$|E

50|$|Departing {{passengers}} are routed first to airline ticket counters or kiosks for checking in. Since all gates at Palm Springs {{are in the}} two outlying concourses, passengers must pass through the security screening area for admittance into the secure air side of the airport. After leaving the main building via the <b>automatic</b> doors <b>leading</b> out to the open-air courtyard, passengers can access seventeen full-service gates at the two concourses.|$|R
500|$|The prototype, {{internally}} {{designated as}} aircraft or TIS [...] "A", was a low-wing, all-metal, cantilever monoplane with two Mikulin AM-37 engines and a twin tail. The monocoque fuselage had four [...] ShKAS machine {{guns in the}} nose, each with 1,000 rounds. The pilot and the gunner/radio-operator were seated back-to-back, separated by an armor plate, under sliding canopies. The gunner had a dorsal ShKAS on a TSS-1 mount with 750 rounds {{that could be used}} once his canopy was slid forward. He also had a ventral ShKAS mounted below the armored floor that he could access by raising a hatch in the floor and kneeling down to fire the machine guns. The ventral gun was provided with 500 rounds of ammunition. A [...] UBK machine gun with 400 rounds and a [...] ShVAK cannon with 350 rounds were mounted in each wing root. Underneath the wings were two racks each capable of carrying a single [...] FAB-500 bomb. The wing had <b>automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slats and four split flaps separated by the engine nacelles. The single wheel landing gear retracted into the rear part of the nacelles, as did the tailwheel into the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Bf 109 was {{regarded}} with disfavour by E-Stelle test pilots {{because of its}} steep ground angle, which resulted in poor forward visibility when taxiing; the sideways-hinged cockpit canopy, {{which could not be}} opened in flight; and the <b>automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slats on the wings which, it was thought, would inadvertently open during aerobatics, possibly leading to crashes. This was later borne out in combat situations and aerobatic testing by various countries' test establishments. The leading edge slats and ailerons would flutter rapidly in fast tight turns, making targeting and control difficult, and eventually putting the aircraft into a stall condition. [...] They were also concerned about the high wing loading.|$|E
2500|$|The P-40 tolerated harsh {{conditions}} {{and a variety}} of climates. Its semi-modular design was easy to maintain in the field. It lacked innovations such as boosted ailerons or <b>automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slats, but its strong structure included a five-spar wing, which enabled P-40s to pull high-G turns and survive some midair collisions. Intentional ramming attacks against enemy aircraft were occasionally recorded as victories by the Desert Air Force and Soviet Air Forces. Caldwell said P-40s [...] "would take a tremendous amount of punishment, violent aerobatics as well as enemy action." [...] Operational range was good by early war standards and was almost double that of the Supermarine Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, although inferior to the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, Nakajima Ki-43 and Lockheed P-38 Lightning.|$|E
50|$|The Tiger Moth's biplane design {{makes it}} strong, {{and it is}} fully aerobatic. However, it has ailerons only on its bottom wing, which makes its rate of roll {{relatively}} slow for a biplane, and as stated previously, the ailerons on a Tiger Moth normally operate with a heavy degree of designed-in differential operation (mostly deflecting up, hardly at all downwards) to avoid adverse yaw problems in normal flight. Most manoeuvres are started at about 90 to 110 knots, {{and it has a}} Velocity Never Exceeded (VNE) of 140 knots. It is important to lock the <b>automatic</b> slats (<b>leading</b> edge flaps) during aerobatic manoeuvres.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{following}} the 2010 federal election, the Gillard Government formed a minority government {{with the support}} of a number of votes from minor parties and independents, and the Opposition refused to grant <b>automatic</b> pairing, <b>leading</b> to some embarrassment and reversals for the opposition when, for example, a pair was initially not given for a member to care for her sick baby or to attend at the birth of his baby. The practice also extends to minor party legislators. In the case of Greens Senator Scott Ludlam, he was given a government pair when absent from the Senate in late 2016.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a great effort {{underway}} to improve the World Wide Web. A better content organisation, allowing <b>automatic</b> processing, <b>leading</b> to the Semantic Web {{is one of the main}} goals. In the light of bringing this technology closer to the Software Engineering community we propose an architecture allowing an easier development for ontology-based applications. Thus, we first present a methodology for ontology creation and automatic code generation using the widely adopted CASE UML tools. And based on a study of the art of the different RDF storage and querying systems, we couple this methodology with the Sesame system for providing a framework able to deal with large knowledge bases...|$|R
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the NB program are obscure, but design work began {{during the winter of}} 1941–42 with the OKB {{designation}} of aircraft T. The NB was a high-winged, twin-engined, twin tail monoplane of mixed construction. The fuselage was built of 'shpon', molded birch plywood, [...] thick and was reinforced with a welded steel tube framework and a network of bracing wires in the midsection around the aperture for the wing and the capacious bomb bay. The single-spar wing was built from a mix of steel and duralumin. The center section had a duralumin skin, but the outer panels were skinned in 'shpon'. The duralumin slotted flaps were electrically powered and ran the length of the wing center section, divided by the engine nacelles. <b>Automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slats were mounted on the outer panels. All control surfaces were built from wood and covered in fabric. The tailplane had 7° dihedral with twin fins. It had a duralumin structure and was covered in 'shpon'. The main gears of the conventional undercarriage retracted aft into the rear of the engine nacelles and the tail wheel retracted into the rear fuselage. Six protected fuel tanks were in the wing center section, plus four more in the outer wings. They had a total capacity of [...] (including oil). Two [...] air-cooled Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engines were slung underneath the wings. Alternative engines considered were the Mikulin AM-39 V-12 and the Shvetsov M-71 radial, but development problems with both engines dropped them from consideration.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{alternative}} perspective on inflation {{to that of}} the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). It indicates that there are no <b>automatic</b> forces <b>leading</b> to a level of aggregate demand consistent with constant inflation. Inflationary pressures arise from conflict over income shares, and from cost elements, with the price of raw materials, especially oil, being the most important. There are supply-side factors impinging on the inflationary process, which arise from the level of productive capacity (relative to aggregate demand). The supply-side constraints are viewed as arising from capacity constraints, rather than from the operation of the labour market. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
5000|$|Laser {{trimming}} is {{the manufacturing}} process of using a laser to adjust the operating parameters of an electronic circuit.One {{of the most common}} applications uses a laser to burn away small portions of resistors, raising their resistance value.

50|$|At {{the same}} time as these {{modifications}} were being carried out work commenced on a larger and improved aircraft, the Widgeon II. Taxiing tests of the Widgeon II were commenced on 16 February 1928 at Mascot aerodrome and it flew {{for the first time on}} 21 February following a one-day delay due to engine problems. Following an extended flight from Melbourne to Darwin and back in 1928 to accompany flying boats of the RAF Far East Flight, a final series of improvements were made to the Wackett II. These included the addition of <b>automatic</b> wing <b>leading</b> edge slats, a water rudder, an exhaust manifold ring, and a metal rear-cabin structure. The forward hull beam was increased by adding blisters to extend the chines.|$|R

5000|$|As Peter Garrison further explains: [...] "To prevent tip stall, {{designers}} {{have resorted to}} providing the outboard portions of tapered wings with more cambered airfoil sections, drooped or enlarged leading edges, fixed or <b>automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slots or slats, and, most commonly, wing twist or [...] "washout". The trouble with these fixes is that they all increase the drag, canceling whatever benefit the tapered wing was supposed to deliver in the first place." ...|$|E
50|$|The Superstol is a {{development}} of the Just Highlander and differs {{by the addition of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slats, a long stroke air shock robust landing gear with 29 in tundra tires, Fowler flaps and a newly designed tailplane. The resulting design features a strut-braced high-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit accessed by doors, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. It is designed for operation on rough airfields.|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} view {{relating to}} unemployment and inflation is that inflation will be constant {{at a level}} of unemployment (the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, NAIRU) determined on the supply side of the economy (and in the labor market in particular). Further, the economy will tend to converge to (or oscillate around) that level of unemployment. Moreover, demand variables or economic policy changes are thought to have no influence whatsoever on NAIRU. An alternative perspective on inflation would indicate {{that there would be no}} <b>automatic</b> forces <b>leading</b> to a level of aggregate demand consistent with constant inflation. Inflationary pressures would arise from, inter alia, a role of conflict over income shares, and from cost elements, with the price of raw materials, especially oil, being the most important. Insofar as there are supply-side factors impinging on the inflationary process, these would arise from the level of productive capacity (relative to aggregate demand) and from conflict over income shares. This paper focuses on the arguments and the evidence that supply-side constraints should be viewed as arising from capacity constraints, rather than from the operation of the labor market. ...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis explored the roles of attention and number awareness in visual enumeration and estimation {{through a variety of}} methods. First, a distinction was made between different attentional modes underlying estimation and enumeration in an in-depth single case study of a patient with simultagnosia. Subsequently I demonstrated that, in visual enumeration, subitizing and counting are dissociable processes and they rely on different brain structures. This was done through a neuropsychological single case study as well as through the first large sample neuropsychological group study using a voxel-based correlation method. Following this, behavioural methods were used to examine the relations between subitizing and estimation. I found that, under conditions encouraging estimation, subitizing is an automatic process and may lead to the exact representation of small numbers, which contrasts with approximate representations for larger numerosities. Finally, a functional MRI study was conducted to highlight the brain regions that are activated for subitizable numerosities, but not for larger numerosities under distributed attention conditions. The imaging study provided converging evidence for <b>automatic</b> subitizing <b>leading</b> to an exact number representation. The last chapter discusses the implications of the contrast between subitization and counting for understanding numerical processing. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Semantic Web vision and the shift toward machine understandable Web resources has unearthed the importance of automatic semantic reconciliation. Consequently, new tools for automating the process were proposed. In this work we present a formal model of semantic reconciliation and analyze in a systematic manner {{the properties of the}} process outcome, primarily the inherent uncertainty of the matching process and how it reflects on the resulting mappings. An important feature of this research is the identification and analysis of factors that impact the effectiveness of algorithms for <b>automatic</b> semantic reconciliation, <b>leading,</b> it is hoped, to the design of better algorithms by reducing the uncertainty of existing algorithms. Against this background we empirically study the aptitude of two algorithms to correctly match concepts. This research is both timely and practical in light of recent attempts to develop and utilize methods for automatic semantic reconciliation...|$|R
50|$|Like the G-15 {{it had a}} {{completely}} plywood covered wing centre section which {{was an integral part}} of the fuselage. The outer wing panels were ply covered from the leading edge back to the rear spar, with the rest fabric covered. In plan the wings were strongly tapered, mostly on the trailing edges, and ended in long, elliptical tips. Its <b>automatic</b> <b>leading</b> edge slats were interconnected through the fuselage with a steel tube and its ailerons were slotted.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} newest {{results obtained}} during development of {{discovered by the}} authors new methodology of automatic understanding of medical images – used additionally or applied instead of its groove medical image processing, typical features analysis, and sometimes classical pattern recognition, object clustering and illnesses classification. This methodology is in fact knowledge based method of <b>automatic</b> reasoning, <b>leading</b> to very effective computer aided diagnosis process, necessary in many cases of medical practice. Using mathematical linguistic as a tool and applying cognitive resonance method we can solve many very difficult medical problems by means of semantic oriented medical images interpretation. Automatic understanding of images is also very useful tool for content oriented searching in multimedial databases (primary medical, but not only). Many times we need from big hospital databases (and also from library databases or Internet) some specific information, which can be described only in form of the example image (“show me data of all patient with similar type of cancer”). If content oriented searching must be used for text databases we can use many kind of known methods, e. g. ontologies. When compared data have multimedial form (for example medical images) the problem under consideration is much more difficult, because very often images containing the same semantic information (for example showing the same illnesses) are very different in form where images very similar {{in terms of the}} shapes of selected objects and its textures having quite different semantic (medical) meaning an...|$|R
40|$|The {{security}} {{plays an}} important role in any type of organization in today’s life. Iris recognition is one of the <b>leading</b> <b>automatic</b> biometric systems in the area of security which is used to identify the individual person. Biometric systems include fingerprints, facial features, voice recognition, hand geometry, handwriting, the eye retina and the most secured one presented in this paper, the iris recognition.

In this paper, we are concentrating on Iris as a biometric component which is somewhat better than other biometrics in terms of stability, uniqueness, accuracy, fast and non-invasive. Usually an iris technique works by capturing & storing the biometric information & then comparing the scanned iris biometric with what is stored in the database [7].

40|$|Motivation: Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) is used {{to study}} the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in {{time as well as}} gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for <b>automatic</b> image analysis, <b>leading</b> to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHave {{you ever}} shouted your child's {{name from the}} kitchen while they were {{watching}} television {{in the living room}} to no avail, so you shout their name again, only louder? Yet, still no response. The current study provides evidence that young children process loudness changes differently than pitch changes when they are engaged in another task such as watching a video. Intensity level changes were physiologically detected only when they were behaviorally relevant, but frequency level changes were physiologically detected without task relevance in younger children. This suggests that changes in pitch rather than changes in volume may be more effective in evoking a response when sounds are unexpected. Further, even though behavioral ability may appear to be similar in younger and older children, attention-based physiologic responses differ from automatic physiologic processes in children. Results indicate that (1) the <b>automatic</b> auditory processes <b>leading</b> to more efficient higher-level skills continue to become refined through childhood; and (2) there are different time courses for the maturation of physiological processes encoding the distinct acoustic attributes of sound pitch and sound intensity. The relevance of these findings to sound perception in real-world environments is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of the {{advantages}} of temporal-logic model-checking tools is their ability to accompany a negative answer to the correctness query by a counterexample to the satisfaction of the specification in the system. On the other hand, when the answer to the correctness query is positive, most model-checking tools provide no additional information. In the last few years there has been growing awareness to the importance of suspecting the system or the specification of containing an error also in the case model checking succeeds. The main justification of such suspects are possible errors in the modeling of the system or of the specification. The goal of sanity checks is to detect such errors by further <b>automatic</b> reasoning. Two <b>leading</b> sanity checks are vacuity and coverage. In vacuity, the goal is to detect cases where the system satisfies the specification in some unintended trivial way. In coverage, the goal is to increase the exhaustiveness of the specification by detecting components of the system that do not play a role in verification process. For both checks, the challenge is to define vacuity and coverage formally, develop algorithms for detecting vacuous satisfaction and low coverage, and suggest methods for returning to the user helpful information. We survey existing work on vacuity and coverage and argue that, in many aspects, the two checks are essentially the same: both are based on repeating the verification process on some mutant input. In vacuity, mutations are in the specifications, whereas in coverage, mutations are in the system. This observation enables us to adopt work done in the context of vacuity to coverage, and vise versa. ...|$|R
