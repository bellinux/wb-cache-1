40|$|Finding cluster head (CH) is an {{important}} issue in WSN. A new optimization algorithm Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) has been introduced recently, inspired by socio-political process of imperialistic competition. We use ICA for CH selection according to the communication energy (CE) cost. We demonstrate that ICA is an effective method for selection of CH in WSN. ICA either finds one or at most a few CHs within 500 decades. The tie is broken by use of a heuristic. CE stabilizes <b>after</b> 225 <b>decades</b> in the case of 300 -size, <b>after</b> 150 <b>decades</b> for 200 -size, and <b>after</b> 140 <b>decades</b> for 100 -size WSNs. For 100 -size, 1 CH is selected <b>after</b> 260 <b>decades,</b> for 200 -size and 300 -size 7 and 21 CHs, respectively are selected <b>after</b> 500 <b>decades.</b> For reducing the number of final CHs, the algorithm should be run for more than 500 decades for larger-size WSNs. For smaller size (100) networks, time increases very slowly with decades. For higher size networks, it increases nonlinearly and takes almost exponential shape with a network of 300 sensors. This is a preliminary study and we plan further investigation in this direction...|$|R

Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E

Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, <b>after</b> <b>decades</b> of discussion.
