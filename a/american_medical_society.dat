40|$|Background: Appropriateness Criteria {{for nuclear}} imaging exams {{were created by}} American College of Cardiology (ACC) e American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) to allow the {{rational}} use of tests. Little is known whether these criteria have been followed in clinical practice. Objective: To evaluate whether the medical applications of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in a private nuclear medicine service of a tertiary cardiology hospital were suitable to the criteria of indications proposed by the <b>American</b> <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> in 2005 and 2009 and compare the level of indication of both. Methods: We included records of 383 patients that underwent MPS, November 2008 up to February 2009. Demographic characteristics, patient’s origin, coronary risk factors, time of medical graduation and appropriateness criteria of medical applications were studied. The criteria were evaluated by two independent physicians and, in doubtful cases, defined by a medical expert in MPS. Results: Mean age was 65 ± 12 years. Of the 367 records reviewed, 236 (64. 3 %) studies were performed in men and 75 (20. 4 %) were internee. To ACC 2005, 255 (69. 5 %) were considered appropriate indication and 13 (3. 5 %) inappropriate. With ACC 2009, 249 (67. 8 %) were considered appropriate indications and 13 (5. 2 %) inappropriate.

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of guidelines review in 2006 and preliminary guidelines in 2007 from the Korean Society of Interventional Neuroradiology (KSIN) [1, 2], new study results are needed to be mentioned for carotid artery stenting (CAS). The most outstanding change was publication of Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) [3, 4]. CREST showed {{no significant difference between}} the stenting and endarterectomy group overall in the rates of a composite outcome that included major periproce-dural complications (such as stroke, myocardial infarc-tion, or death) and ipsilateral stroke over a 4 -year follow-up period. According to the results of CREST, American College of Cardiology (ACC) /American Heart association (AHA) recommended CAS as an alternative to CEA for symptomatic carotid stenosis [5]. However, debates still remain about the compara-tive efficacy of CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) [6]. While there are many comparative trials in European and North <b>American</b> <b>medical</b> <b>societies</b> [3, 7 - 10], there have not been any large comparative trials between CAS and CEA in Asia or Korea. Ethnicity may play a role in the characteristics of carotid stenosis. For example, the pattern of carotid bulb stenosis in Koreans is different from westerners; apical type of carotid bulb stenosis is more common in Koreans than body type which is more common in western countries and related with hyperlipidemia [11].
