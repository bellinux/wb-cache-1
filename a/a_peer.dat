5|$|Despite this, {{or perhaps}} because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan <b>a</b> <b>peer</b> of France, and he received a command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, he was an old man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E
5|$|The factors used in {{determining}} how an individual aerodrome is categorised by the GASAR study are based broadly on size and facilities.

5|$|The {{position}} and rights of Scottish peers {{in relation to}} the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, <b>a</b> <b>peer</b> of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that <b>a</b> <b>peer</b> of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.|$|E
5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, were excluded from the House of Commons. Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as <b>a</b> <b>peer.</b> Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Born in Metz, Custine was {{a son of}} Philippe-Joseph, comte de Custine, and Anne-Marguerite Maguin, {{daughter}} of Francois, comte d' Roussy and Marguerite de Walter. His father, the tenth count, had died at the Battle of Rossbach in 1757, one of six French generals killed in the engagement. Custine's other titles included Signeur de Guermagne and de Sareck, and he was, after 1770, also the lord of Niderviller, a property he purchased. He married Adelaide-Celeste Louise Gagnat de Longny. In 1790 Custine's daughter, Adelaide-Anne-Philippe, married Henri Evrard, marquis de Dreux-Brézé, master of ceremonies for Louis XVI. She and her husband {{spent much of the}} early 1790s as refugees in Britain, although he returned to France several times to visit his estates; he was eventually confirmed as <b>a</b> <b>peer</b> of France, resumed his pre-Revolution position as master of ceremonies, this time for Louis XVIII, and was awarded military rank.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 16th century the Dunlugas Ogilvies {{undertook}} re-furbishment and extension work, including {{the addition of}} courtyard buildings and a distinctive circular tower that incorporated the hall into its first storey. An act recording the lands in favour of George Ogilvy was ratified by King Charles I in late June 1633. George {{was the son of}} Walter Ogilvy, and an ardent Royalist and supporter of the king against the Covenanters. Inchdrewer Castle was left in ruins after being attacked by Covenanter forces led by General Robert Monro in 1640; another of the family properties, a town house, was also devastated. George Ogilvy was appointed <b>a</b> <b>peer</b> in 1642, becoming the first Lord Banff.|$|E
5|$|His lands, though {{primarily}} {{centred on}} Warwickshire and Worcestershire, were spread over nineteen counties {{as well as}} Scotland and the Welsh Marches. His heir was his eldest son, whom he had named Thomas after the earl of Lancaster. Thomas, born probably on 14 February 1314, did not succeed to his father's title until 1326, as Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick. In the meanwhile Warwick's possessions went {{into the hands of}} the king, who donated Warwick's hunting dogs to the earl of Pembroke. A younger son, named John, also became <b>a</b> <b>peer,</b> as John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp.

50|$|Peerage robes are {{currently}} worn in the United Kingdom by peers on certain ceremonial occasions and are of two varieties: Parliament robes, worn on ceremonial occasions in the House of Lords (such as at <b>a</b> <b>peer's</b> Introduction {{and at the}} state opening of parliament), and Coronation robes, worn by peers at the coronations of monarchs.

5|$|In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn {{automatically}} became <b>a</b> <b>peer,</b> preventing {{him from}} {{sitting in the}} House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, {{who was at the}} time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} <b>a</b> new <b>peering</b> link using CBA, x evaluates each potential peer y by hypothetically establishing <b>a</b> <b>peering</b> link with it. Each new link in the network causes some traffic to be re-routed along different paths based on the interdomain routing policy. x computes {{the impact of the}} hypothetical peering link by updating its traffic flow, costs and revenue. x agrees to peer with y if and only if its fitness increases {{as a result of the}} hypothetical link. In the real world, such link evaluations are carried out through <b>peering</b> trials. Under <b>a</b> <b>peering</b> trial, two ASes establish <b>a</b> <b>peering</b> relationship for <b>a</b> short time period and evaluate the impact of the temporary link on their economic fitness. The link is retained if both peers find the relationship beneficial for their fitness, otherwise it is terminated. Similar evaluations are carried out for existing peers when using CBA. Each existing peer is hypothetically depeered and the impact of depeering on fitness is computed. The link is terminated if depeering improves fitness, otherwise it is retained.|$|R
5|$|In the Roman empire's {{hierarchical}} system, a vassal king {{usage of}} the King of Kings title did not indicate that he is <b>a</b> <b>peer</b> of the emperor or that the vassalage ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was the legitimate King of Kings in the East. A lead token depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped {{like that of the}} Parthian monarchs, so it must have been Odaenathus' crown; this combination of title and imagery indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the Sassanians and the protector of the region against them.|$|E

The restored King Louis XVIII made Sérurier <b>a</b> <b>Peer</b> of France, but he joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, when the former emperor briefly returned to power. This caused him to lose his post at Les Invalides and his marshal's salary after Napoleon's second downfall.

5|$|Since November 2002, by-elections {{have been}} held to fill vacancies. Two by-elections were held in 2003, one in 2004, four in 2005, one in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, two in 2010, four in 2011, two in 2013, four in 2014, six in 2015, two in 2016 and two in 2017. Voting is by {{preferential}} voting, with peers ranking the candidates in order of preference. As many or as few preferences as desired may be indicated. To win the election, <b>a</b> <b>peer</b> must receive a majority of first preference votes. If no candidate receives such a majority, the candidate with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated, with each of his votes being redistributed according to the second preference marked on the ballot (see Instant-runoff voting). The process is continued until one candidate receives a majority.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{and study}} <b>a</b> framework, called <b>peer</b> data exchange, for sharing and exchanging data between peers.
