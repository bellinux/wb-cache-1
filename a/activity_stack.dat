We propose a novel variable-length pattern extraction algorithm, called LookN, based on loss-less compression techniques. This algorithm is applied on system call traces for anomaly detection purposes. It is computationally simple and efficient. ^ The call stack of program execution {{can be a very}} good information source for intrusion detection. There was no prior work on dynamically extracting information from call stack and effectively using it to detect exploits. We propose another new method that we call Vt-Path to do anomaly detection using call stack information. The basic idea is to extract return addresses from the call stack, and generate abstract execution path between two program execution points. Experiments show that our method can detect some attacks that cannot be detected by other approaches, while its convergence and false positive performance is comparable to or better than the other approaches. ^ Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks.

40|$|Simple {{stacks of}} perylenediimides (PDIs) grown {{directly}} on solid surfaces are an intriguing {{starting point for}} the construction of multicomponent architectures because their intrinsic activity is already very high. The ability of PDI stacks to efficiently generate photocurrent originates from the strong absorption of visible light and the efficient transport of both electrons and holes after generation with light. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore whether or not the excellent performance of these remarkably simple single-channel photosystems could be further improved in more sophisticated multicomponent architectures. We report that the directional construction of strings of anions or cations along the PDI stacks does not significantly improve their activity; that is, the intrinsic <b>activity</b> of PDI <b>stacks</b> is too high to yield ion-gated photosystems. The directional construction of electron- and hole-transporting stacks of naphthalenediimides (NDIs) and oligothiophenes along the central PDI stack did not improve photocurrent generation under standard conditions either. However, the activity of double-channel photosystems increased with increasing thickness, whereas increasing charge recombination with single-channel PDI stacks resulted in decreasing activity with increasing length. Most efficient long-distance charge transport was found with double-channel photosystems composed of PDIs and NDIs. This finding suggests that over long distances, PDI stacks transport holes better than electrons, at least under the present conditions. Triple-channel photosystems built around PDI stacks with oligothiophenes and triphenylamines were less active, presumably because hole mobility in the added channels was inferior to that in the original PDI stacks, thus promoting charge recombination...|$|R

In this thesis the energy efficiency of a microcontroller based on the open source ZPU microprocessor is evaluated and improved. The ZPU microprocessor is a zero-operand stack machine originally designed for small size FPGA implementation, but in this thesis the core is synthesized for implementation with a 180 nm technology library. Power estimation of the design is done both before and after synthesis in the design flow, and it is shown that power estimates based on RTL simulations (before synthesis) are 35 x faster to obtain than power estimates based on gate-level simulations (after synthesis). The RTL estimates deviate from the gate-level estimates by only 15 % and can provide faster design cycle iterations without sacrificing too much accuracy.

This redistribution was disrupted by nocodazole, implicating an underlying plus end–directed microtubule motor <b>activity.</b> The Golgi <b>stack,</b> monitored using sialyltransferase, galactosyltransferase, and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, was dramatically disrupted into scattered structures that colocalized with components of the intermediate compartment (ERGIC- 53 and ERD- 2). The disrupted Golgi elements were revealed by EM to represent short stacks similar to those formed by microtubule-depolymerizing agents. Golgi-to-ER traffic of stack markers induced by brefeldin A was not inhibited by dynamitin overexpression. Time-lapse observations of dynamitin-overexpressing cells recovering from brefeldin A treatment revealed that the scattered Golgi elements do not undergo microtubule-based transport as seen in control cells, but rather, remain stationary at or near their ER exit sites. These results indicate that dynactin is specifically required for ongoing centripetal movement of endocytic organelles and components of the intermediate compartment. Results similar to those of dynamitin overexpression were obtained by microinjection with antidynein intermediate chain antibody, consistent with a role for dynactin in mediating interactions of cytoplasmic dynein with specific membrane organelles. These results suggest that dynamitin plays a pivotal role in regulating organelle movement at the level of motor–cargo binding...|$|R
40|$|Microscopic inhomogeneities in the {{electrical}} properties of semiconductors are {{of great importance}} to device performances, particularly in advanced device technology. Then {{in the last few}} years great attention was paid to the processes which can change the material microstructure, and, above all, to the gettering techniques, on account of their wide impact on the overall yield of electronic tailored materials. With this aim, therefore, extended investigations were carried out, mainly by electron and optical beam testing. In this respect, we report here some results of a spectroscopic analysis performed on Si intrinsically gettered samples by a scanning photocurrent microscopy technique[1] similar, in principle, to the light beam induced current (LBIC) method. However, some differences in the experimental set-up have turned out to be fundamental from the point of view of the instrument-sample interaction and, then, of the information obtainable by the induced photocurrent signals. To probe the material, an above-band-gap energy light from an halogen lamp is focused onto the sample, where a Schottky barrier was provided. The light path is intercepted by interferential filters in the visible-infrared range, so as to select the beam wavelength. To probe point-by-point the object, the sample is moved in a raster fashion across a stationary spot. As in EBIC and LBIC methods, the electron-hole pairs generated by the beam give rise to an induced current I(x,y). This current is measured as analog signal corresponding to the irradiated point, amplified by the lock-in technique, converted from analog-to-digital form and, lastly, noise-cleaned by filtering algorithms. This procedure makes it possible to detect current changes as low as 10 - 14 - 10 - 15 A. Since a defect causes a local variation in the photoinduced carrier concentration, it is detected by the induced current changes. It should be pointed out that the investigation method described above and from now on called IRBIC (Infra-Red Beam Induced Current) method, even if very similar to the LBIC one, differs from it for an essential element : the extremely low injection level. The use of an halogen lamp as light source, instead of the laser employed in the LBIC method, gives very low values of irradiance. This gives rise to problems in the signal processing, but, on the other side, generates a very low bulk current level (as low as 10 - 13 A), allowing the detection of current changes equal to some parts per cent of this value. In LBIC mode[2] the rate of above-band-gap photon emission from a 1 -mW He-Ne (6328 Å) laser produces 3. 2 * 1015 photons*sec- 1. Usually it is supposed that the beam is attenuated by an amount α≈ 0. 01, so that, on impinging the semiconductor surface, 3. 2 * 1013 electron-hole pairs are generated per second. In our investigation we examined the samples with a beam power equal to 3. 6 * 10 - 8 mW. The electron-hole pair generation rate G was calculated by the expression[3] : G = PbQ(1 -τ) /(qEg) where Pb is the beam power, Q the quantum efficiency, τ the backscattering coefficient, q the electronic charge and Eg the band gap. In Our experimental conditions G is 1. 2 * 108 sec- 1. The intensity of the light impinging on the sample resulted a decisive factor in the imaging {{the electrical}} <b>activity</b> of the <b>stacking</b> faults. Moreover, due to the ease of changing the wavelength of the light beam probing the sample, depth profiling of the <b>stacking</b> fault electrical <b>activity</b> was obtained. By this way we detected the occurrence of minority carrier recombination and generation processes at some stacking faults, corresponding, respectively, to dark and bright levels in a grey-shade imaging. A possible explanation based on the presence of fixed charges[4] at the defect-silicon matrix interface is proposed...|$|R
