40|$|The chalazal {{megaspore}} {{develops in}} a Polygonum-type embryo sac. The amyloplast-rich endothelium is partially degraded during {{the expansion of}} the micropylar portion of the megagametophyte. Organization of the mature embryo sac is determined by the patterns of vacuolation, nuclear migration, spindle orientation and cellularization. The egg cell is slightly chalazal in relation to the synergids, and its micropylar end does not touch the micropylar channel. At the chalazal pole of the egg apparatus, the common walls between the synergids, the egg and central cells, despite their tenuity, are present in the mature megagametophyte.

30|$|Finally, one of {{the four}} nuclei located at the micropylar end became the micropylar polar nucleus and started to migrate through the central vacuole toward the chalazal end of the sac to meet the single nucleus which is {{observed}} outside the haustorial tube, said nucleus became the chalazal polar nucleus. When a 3 D reconstruction was performed thin filaments were observed connecting the two polar nuclei (Fig.  2 e, f). According to Tilton and Lersten (1981) these filaments are formed of cytoplasm and provide the vehicle by which the polar nuclei can join. Ikeda (1902) supported the hypothesis that these cytoplasmic connections found between different cell types in the embryo sac provide the means by which the <b>antipodals,</b> the central cell and the egg apparatus remain in communication.|$|R

30|$|The normal {{development}} of the P. tuberosa var. Simple embryo sac follows a monosporic pattern of the Polygonum type and starts its development from the chalazal megaspore. At maturity, the embryo sac is of a pyriform shape with a chalazal haustorial tube where the <b>antipodals</b> are located, just below the hypostase, which connects the embryo sac with the nucellar tissue of the ovule. The central cell nucleus shows a high polarity, being located at the chalazal extreme of the embryo sac. Due to this particular characteristic, the second sperm nucleus has to travel a long distance in order to fertilize such nucleus. The position of cells inside the P. tuberosa embryo sac may be useful for in depth studies about the double fertilization. Furthermore, {{it was possible to}} make a chronological description of the events that happen from fertilization and early embryo development to the initial {{development of}} the endosperm which was classified as of the Helobial type.|$|R

It is known that in the species C. arabica the embryo sac formation is complete at the time the flowers open. Embryo sac formation in C. canephora is slightly delayed and it is not complete until the day following opening of the flowers. It was also determined that in C. canephora shedding of pollen begins shortly after the flowers open and the pollen was functional at least for two days. Thus the results of the present study indicate that the self-sterility of C. canephora flowers is not due to the delay in formation or abnormal development of the embryo sac...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Wheat {{endosperm}} morphogenesis was {{studied by}} light microscopy {{during the entire}} growth period of anthesis to maturity. Four developmental stages have been described in this thesis: (1) double fertilization, (2) formation of the lower endosperm cells, (3) termination of nuclear divisions, and (4) initiation of protein bodies. The first manuscript reviews double fertilization and provides photographs of the embryo sac, pollen tube growth, syngamy and triple fusion. The descriptions made by previous researchers are compared with the observations of the writer. Early endosperm growth was characterized by nuclear divisions without formation of cell walls. During the first 4 days of growth, dense endosperm cells were formed above the embryo by a unique and previously undescribed mechanism. Cytoplasmic vesicles were formed in the upper endosperm, bordering the <b>antipodals.</b> Those vesicles fell to the gravitational bottom of the embryo sac, coalesced and were divided into cells by walls growing in from the nucellus. Later, those cells were entirely consumed by the developing embryo. Morphogenetically, cytoplasmic vesicles were the mechanism by which nutrients were transferred from the <b>antipodals</b> to the lower endosperm and ultimately to the embryo. The upper embryo sac vacuole was cellularized by cytoplasmic projections from the endosperm nuclei. The nuclei then divided {{in all areas of}} the embryo sac, as long as space was available. During the ninth to twelfth days after anthesis, the cuticularized inner integument and nucellar epidermis stopped growing. That limited the space available for nuclear divisions in the endosperm. Between the thirteenth and fifteenth days after anthesis, endosperm nuclei stopped dividing. It is concluded that endosperm nuclear division was limited to the space within the inner integument and nucellar epidermis. Because that space stopped increasing by 14 days after anthesis, endosperm cell number was spacially limited. After cell formation had ceased, the endosperm nuclei released their nucleoli into the cell vacuole. Those nucleoli enlarged and acquired safranin stain like protein bodies. The nuclei broke down and released other chromosome-sized particles which also united and formed protein bodies. It is concluded that wheat endosperm protein bodies originate from nucleoli...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microsporogenesis, embryogeny and {{endosperm}} {{development of}} Lomandra longifolia Labill. {{are described in}} detail. The formation of the anther wall is the basic type composed of four cell layers, namely an epidermis, an endothecium, one middle layer and a tapetum. The tapetum layer has glandular, uninucleate cells. Successive cytokinesis followsmeiosis, subsequently forming a tetrahedral tetrad of microspores. The ovule in each carpel is hemitropous, crassinucellate and bitegmic, with the micropyle formed by the inner integument. The archesporial cell divides periclinally to form the primary parietal and primary sporogenous cells. The sporogenous cell functions as the megaspore mother cell, whereas the parietal cell divides to give rise to two parietal layers. Thematuremegagametophyte, which has enlarged synergids and <b>antipodals,</b> is of the Polygonum type, with the normal complement of seven cells and eight nuclei. Nucellar tissue in the mature ovule consists of enlarged dermal cells and irregular subdermal cells surrounding a central strand of markedly smaller cells. Endosperm development is of the nuclear type. Embryo development is of the Graminad type, characterised by oblique zygotic and early pro-embryonic divisions...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{embryology}} of Plagiopteron suaveolens Griffith is presented in order to evaluate the affinities of the genus. Anther wall formation is of the dicotyledonous type. The anther tapetum is glandular and its cells become two to four nucleate. Cytokinesis in the microspore mother cell is simultaneous and the resultant tetrad is tetrahedral. The mature pollen grains are two-celled. The anther has 4 -locules at anthesis. The ovule is anatropous, bitegmic and weakly crassinucellate with only one cell-layered parietal tissue. The micropyle is zig-zag in section and formed by both inner and outer integuments which are three and three to four cell layers thick respectively. The megaspore archesporium is one-celled and the embryo sac development is of the Polygonum type. An endothelium is formed with early disintegration of nucellar tissue. The <b>antipodals</b> multiply co 15 to 20 cells. Embryological evidence supports the placement of Plagiopteron in its own family, Plagiopteraceae, with closest relationship with Celastraceae and close relationship with Elaeocarpaceae, Rhizophoraceae and some families of the Geraniales...|$|R
50|$|In eudicot plants, {{the entire}} process happens inside the ovule of a plant. The details of the process vary by species, but the process {{described}} here is common. This process starts with a single diploid megasporocyte in the nucleus. This megasporocyte undergoes meiotic cell division to form four cells that are haploid. Three cells die {{and one that is}} most distant from the micropyle develops into the megaspore. This megaspore becomes larger and the nucleus of it undergoes mitosis three times until there are eight nuclei. These eight nuclei are then arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus {{to the center of the}} cell which then becomes the polar nuclei. The three cells left at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. A cell wall forms around the other set of nuclei and forms the <b>antipodals.</b> The cells in the center develop into the central cell. This entire structure with its eight nuclei is called the embryo sac.|$|R
