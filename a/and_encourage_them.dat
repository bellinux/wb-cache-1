5|$|The 'Peaks of Excellence' {{curriculum}} is continuous with the 'Broad-Base Curriculum', with more elaborate programmes {{that cater to}} students’ talent development. For instance, the Young Writers Programme, which is open to students {{who are interested in}} writing, has lessons conducted by various renowned Chinese language essayists in the region to expose and familiarise students to different forms of writing, <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to appreciate different forms of written work. Students also have opportunities to attend cultural symposiums, national and international bi-cultural forums, research on contemporary issues, and embark on refined overseas immersions to strengthen their world and cultural views under the Global Classroom Programme.|$|E
5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E

5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The duo enlisted a music {{marketing}} startup company—TopspinMedia—to {{design their}} site, delivery {{options for the}} digitalmusic, and promotional webwidgets. Like {{the entirety of the}} recording process, the marketing was self-financed and controlled by the artists, with Topspin taking a portion of the money made from digital sales. This allowed the artists to control creative aspects of producing music as well as the overhead costs associated with marketing an album. The company used viralmarketing techniques to collect potential customers' e-mailaddresses <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to post the album streaming on their blogs. By early November, the collected e-mail addresses amounted to 37percent of the album sales. Topspin has also created a Flickr pool encouraging users to upload screenshots of the widget posted to web sites. No advertisements were taken out for the album.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, {{the sexual}} {{education}} {{perspective of the}} discourse of desire is very rare in U.S. high schools. This perspective encourages adolescents {{to learn more about}} their desires, gaining pleasure and feeling confident in their sexualities. Researchers state that this view would empower girls because it would place less emphasis on them as the victims <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to have more control over their sexuality.|$|E

25|$|London {{witnessed}} animal cruelty in {{the training}} of circus animals, and his subsequent novels Jerry of the Islands and Michael, Brother of Jerry included a foreword entreating the public to become more informed about this practice. In 1918, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the American Humane Education Society teamed up to create the Jack London Club, which sought {{to inform the public}} about cruelty to circus animals <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to protest this establishment. Support from Club members led to a temporary cessation of trained animal acts at Ringling-Barnum and Bailey in 1925.|$|E
25|$|After his 1814 {{proposal}} {{to build a}} personified statue of Religion for St. Peter's Basilica was rejected, Canova sought to build his own temple to house it. This project came to be the Tempio Canoviano. Canova designed, financed, and partly built the structure himself. The structure {{was to be a}} testament to Canova's piety. The building's design was inspired by combining the Parthenon and the Pantheon together. On 11 July 1819, Canova laid the foundation stone dressed in red Papal uniform and decorated with all his medals. It first opened in 1830, and was finally completed in 1836. After the foundation-stone of this edifice had been laid, Canova returned to Rome; but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit Possagno to direct the workmen <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> with rewards.|$|E

25|$|In some {{instances}} growers’ demand for beehives far exceeds the available supply. The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from close to 6 million after WWII, {{to less than}} 2.5 million today. In contrast, the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% {{in the same time}} period. Additionally, {{in the past five years}} there has been a decline in winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate of colony losses at near 30%. At present, there is an enormous demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honey bees and increasing their foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings. ISCA Technologies, from Riverside California, created a semiochemical formulation called SPLAT Bloom, that modifies the behavior of honey bees, inciting them to visit flowers in every portion of the field.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's move {{to legalize}} slavery was not taken lightly by President Thomas Jefferson. Although Jefferson was himself a slaveholder, he {{was opposed to}} the spread of slavery. Jefferson had been working with James Lemen since at least 1784 and used him as an agent in the Northwest to {{organize}} an anti-slavery movement. Lemen succeeded in helping to establish an anti-slavery Baptist church that drew many members. [...] Jefferson sent Lemen to the Indiana territory again in 1807 with the mission to seek out and organize the anti-slavery men of the state <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to take action. Several prominent men had already been stirred by Harrison's moves to legalize slavery. Dennis Pennington, a former slave holder who had freed his slaves when he moved to Indiana, [...] was chief among the anti-slavery men. Jonathan Jennings, who also attended the meeting, would quickly grow into the party's leader. Other prominent anti-slavery men included Richard Rue, John Paul, and General William Johnson, all veterans of the Revolution.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 El Salvador took a 20-man squad (two players {{short of}} the normal 22, as a {{controversial}} cost–saving measure), coached by the aforementioned Mauricio [...] "Pipo" [...] Rodríguez, to Spain. The team's experience was an unhappy one. In their first match on June 15 in Elche, they were defeated 10–1 by Hungary, a scoreline that stands as a World Cup record to this day. A silver lining was that Luis Baltazar Ramírez Zapata scored the country's first World Cup goal during the game, albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5–0. It was cold comfort however. When Zapata scored against Hungary, some Salvadorans cried out to Zapata not to celebrate the goal effusively because it might make the Hungarians angry <b>and</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>them</b> to score more. El Salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games. Displaying much-improved levels of organisation and commitment, they lost 1–0 to Belgium on June 19 in Elche and 2–0 to the then-reigning world champions, Argentina, in Alicante on June 23.|$|E
