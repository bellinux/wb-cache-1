5|$|At 14:00, Ceylon spotted Hamelin's {{ships in}} pursuit and her crew {{increased}} {{their efforts to}} escape, mistaking Victor, which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As night fell, Gordon slowed Ceylon by shortening sail {{in the hope of}} meeting Vénus (which had outdistanced Victor) alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, Vénus caught up with Ceylon, which began firing on the larger French frigate <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passed.</b> Hamelin, recognising that his vessel had the advantage in size and weight of shot, did not wait for Victor but attacked immediately, passing Ceylon and tuning across her bows to open a raking fire.|$|E

He therefore did not consider it his duty to observe the truce that had been declared, so he ordered Louisiana to be destroyed. Set afire, she soon became undocked and floated down the river.

It was here that she first got the chance to teach natural childbirth methods, after being invited by an obstetrician she met at a house party. She coached all of the obstetrician's patients in natural childbirth, learning while she taught. After a year of this, she {{decided to go back to}} England.

25|$|The next day, Balao {{investigated}} smoke on the horizon, {{found two}} cargo ships, tracked {{them through a}} rain squall, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> into clear weather, found the convoy in perfect position for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but heard no explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, Balao submerged {{to wait out the}} inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, Balao moored alongside Coucal and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.|$|E
25|$|Ogle {{was given}} {{command of the}} fourth-rate HMS Swallow in March 1719 and saw action against the pirate fleet of Bartholomew Roberts in the Battle of Cape Lopez in February 1722. Ogle spotted three of Roberts' ships at anchor and {{initially}} pretended to flee: the pirate ship Ranger under Captain James Skyrme gave pursuit and was captured by HMS Swallow. Ogle then went after Roberts' flagship Royal Fortune which was anchored at Cape Lopez: Roberts tried to escape but Royal Fortune received a broadside from HMS Swallow <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> and Roberts {{was killed in the}} action. Ogle was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath in April 1723, the only British naval officer to be honoured specifically for his actions against pirates. The action was to prove {{a turning point in the}} war against the pirates and many consider the death of Roberts to mark the end of the Golden Age of Piracy.|$|E
25|$|While {{cruising}} in {{the company}} of the 36-gun , on 16 April 1797, Pearl helped capture the 24-gun privateer, Incroyable. In March 1798, she sailed for the Leeward Islands via West Africa where on 24 April, she escaped from two French frigates. While passing through the Îles de Los, an archipelago off the coast of Guinea, Pearl discovered an enemy squadron comprising 4 large ships at anchor and a brig under sail. As she approached one of the French frigates hoisted her colours and opened fire. Forced to run between two frigates, Pearl engaged both <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> then hove to, continuing to fire for a further hour before making off with one, or possibly both frigates in pursuit. The chase continued through the night and all through the following day before Pearl managed to escape, and arrived at Sierra Leone on 27 April, where she was inspected for damage. She had been holed in several places, although all were above the waterline; her foretopgallant yard and fore yard had been shot away and a number of lower shrouds and other rigging had been cut through. In addition two of her carronades had been dismounted, causing the death of one man.|$|E

25|$|Riou {{positioned}} himself near the iceberg, and despatched boats {{to collect the}} ice. By the time the last boats had been recovered night had fallen, when a sudden fogbank descended, hiding the iceberg from view. Riou {{found himself in a}} dangerous situation. Somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice, concealed in the darkness and fog. He posted lookouts in the bows and rigging, and began to edge slowly forward. After sometime the danger seemed to be past, and the iceberg left behind, when at 9 o'clock a strange pale glow was reported by the lookout in the bows. Riou ordered the helm to turn hard a starboard, turning into the wind as a wall of ice higher than the ship's masts slid by along the side. It briefly appeared that the danger had been avoided, but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> by the Guardian struck an underwater projection with a sudden crash. Caught in a sudden gust of wind the ship reared up and swung about, driving the stern into the ice, smashing away the rudder, shattering her stern frame and tearing a large gash in the hull. Despite the seriousness of the situation Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.|$|E
25|$|Phoenix {{continued}} off Elba, and on 31 August {{was observed}} alone anchored off Piombino, causing French General François Watrin {{to order the}} two French frigates anchored at Leghorn the Succès and Bravoure, to put to sea to attempt to capture her. The French ships did so, but {{early in the morning}} of 2 September they came across the 38-gun HMS Minerve under Captain George Cockburn, and chased her. Cockburn fled, signalling to Phoenix, which quickly got underway, accompanied by Pomone. Realising the situation the two French frigates attempted to flee, now pursued by their former quarry, Minerve. The Succès was unable to keep up with Bravoure, and ran aground off Vada. Minerve fired a shot at her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>passed</b> by in pursuit of Bravoure, at which Succès promptly surrendered. Pomone ranged alongside to take possession of her, while Phoenix and Minerve chased Bravoure. The changing wind prevented the French vessel from regaining the safety of Leghorn, and she ran aground four miles south of the port. She was soon dismasted and wrecked. The British were able to get Succès off without much damage however. She had previously been , and had been captured on 13 February 1801 by a French squadron under Honoré Ganteaume. She was duly readded to the navy under her old name. Halsted remained in the Mediterranean until paying off Phoenix in June 1802.|$|E
