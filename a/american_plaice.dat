During the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including Greenland halibut, yellowtail flounder, Atlantic halibut, haddock, spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, witch flounder, and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.In 1497 John Cabot became the first to explore mainland North America {{and one of his}} major discoveries was the abundant resources of Atlantic cod off Newfoundland. Referred to as [...] "Newfoundland Currency" [...] this discovery supplied mankind with some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock, mackerel, and lobster. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as redfish, Greenland halibut, witch flounder, and grenadiers. Overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on international waters, it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made. In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery.

40|$|The {{swimming}} {{capability of}} fish {{plays an important}} role in determining the selectivity and eYciency of capture by mobile bottom-trawl fishing gears. The authors test the hypotheses that the swimming endurance of <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> (Hippoglossoides platessoides) is independent of fish size and water temperature. Using a swimming flume, swimming endurance was examined across a range of fish sizes (14 â 44 cm) and water temperatures (" 0. 2 to 9. 7) C). All trials were conducted at a swimming speed of 0. 30 ms" 1. This is comparable to the swimming speeds required by flatfish during herding by bottom-trawl sweeps. The data were analysed using failure time (survival) analysis, a more robust statistical technique for endurance-type data. The advantage of this technique over traditional regression analyses is that censored observations can be included in the analysis. An important distinction, however, is that the dependent variable being modelled was not endurance per se, but the instantaneous rate of exhaustion, or hazard rate at a given time t. The results showed that both fish length and water temperature had a negative eVect on the endurance hazard rate. This is equivalent to an increase in the probability of <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> achieving a given endurance with increasing fish length and water temperature. This was suYcient evidence to reject the null hypotheses that the swimming endurance of <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> is independent of these variables.

The study focused on the infection levels of the three most abundant nematode species, Hysterothylacium aduncum, Anisakis simplex and Contracaecum osculatum, in the three flatfish species <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and common dab (Limanda limanda). When all nematode and fish species were pooled the percentage of infected fish (i. e prevalence), {{the average number of}} nematodes per fish (i. e. abundance) and the average number of nematodes per infected fish (i. e. the intensity) were significantly higher at LangÃ¸ya than at TorbjÃ¸rnskjÃ¦r. While H. aduncum and C. osculatum had higher abundances at the western site, A. simplex was more abundant at the eastern site. Among the three flatfish species, <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> had a relatively high prevalence both at LangÃ¸ya and at TorbjÃ¸rnskjÃ¦r (55 and 53 % respectively). Witch flounder was only infected at LangÃ¸ya (59 %) and mainly with H. aduncum (53 %). Common dab had a high prevalence at LangÃ¸ya (80 %) and rather low at TorbjÃ¸rnskjÃ¦r (15 %). However, since the sample size was small for witch flounder at TorbjÃ¸rnskjÃ¦r (n = 4) and for common dab at LangÃ¸ya (n = 5), these results are likely to be biased. This study also supports the general view that there is a large fluctuation in the nematode populations in the outer Oslofjord. The previously observed decrease of A. simplex seems to continue. C. osculatum and H. aduncum are getting more widespread in the Oslofjord. In addition, my data contain the first recording of the flatfish nematode Cucullanus heterochrous at LangÃ¸ya, suggesting that also this species is expanding in the Oslofjord. The lengths of the nematodes were used to investigate whether the three flatfishes are suitable hosts for the three nematode species. <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> and witch flounder are good transport and final hosts for H. aduncum. <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> seemed to be suitable transport host for C. osculatum as well. Despite the fact that A. simplex is known to have a pelagic life-cycle with Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as the main transport host, my observations show that it can also use the benthic common dab as transport host in the outer Oslofjord. The number of nematodes per witch flounder and common dab had a random distribution (Poisson distribution). However, the number of Pseudoterranova decipiens per <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> was highly over-dispersed. It is likely that a combination of different factors, especially the feeding ecology and habitat preferences of the fish, is the cause for the observed infestation patterns. In addition, <b>American</b> <b>plaice</b> and witch flounder harboured a more diverse parasite fauna than common dab.
