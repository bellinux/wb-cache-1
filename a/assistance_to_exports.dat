We show that, although ambiguous in principle, the case for investment subsidies is reasonably robust in practice. Except when functional forms exhibit arbitrary nonlinearities, it holds under both Cournot and Bertrand competition, with either costreducing or market-expanding investment, and with or without spillovers. Only if firms have strong asymmetries in their investment behaviour and engage in Bertrand competition is an investment tax clearly justified.

It {{is very difficult to}} approximate these policies with a simple indicator. Nevertheless, we have attempted to do so using a dummy variable based on the Nominal Rate of <b>Assistance</b> (NRA) <b>to</b> <b>export</b> products. Anderson and Valenzuela (2008) estimate distortions and agricultural incentives from 1955 to 2007. We use as a proxy of distorsions the index of the Nominal Rate of <b>Assistance</b> <b>to</b> exportable agricultural goods. This dummy variable takes the value of 1 if the exporter country has a negative value higher than 0.10 and 0 otherwise. Given that for some countries and years, Anderson and Valenzuela (2008) do not provide this datum, we have assumed in these cases that its value was the same as that first existing. For this reason, we have considered it safer to establish the limit for the dummy variable at − 0.10. The variable in the case of North countries is always 0, because in these countries during the whole time horizon of the study farmers were strongly subsidized (this variable always takes positive values).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, Australia’s {{proposed}} emissions trading regime. Following {{analysis of the}} international policy context {{which has led to}} climate mitigation scenarios both within Australia and abroad, the nature of Australia’s iron and steel industry is examined, as is its dynamic trade relationship with Chinese steel makers. Since Chinese participation is a critical component of post-Kyoto climate change mitigation, I analyse the role of China thus far in international negotiations. Within the context of iron and steel trade flows, the operation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and its likely effects on this industry’s international competitiveness are discussed. Common critiques of the proposed emissions trading scheme (including but not limited to carbon leakage, emissions capture, and emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industry assistance thresholds) are identified and subsequently contextualised against the backdrop of iron ore mining and steel manufacture. I propose, in addition to emissions leakage addressed in the literature, that domestic, intra-industry permit leakage would appear to exist as a result of poorly designed assistance thresholds. There is potential for industries that receive no government <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>export</b> emissions onto industries that receive most permits free. On the one hand, carbon leakage can act as a disincentive for net emissions reduction if trading partners are not forced to play by the same rules. On the other hand, inappropriate cost burdens could disadvantage Australian industries. If the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is to be effective in the long run, it must address the tensions between comprehensive emissions control and administrative viability. If emissions capture is incomplete, mitigation efforts are notably ineffective. If certain industries beg concessions due to reduced competitiveness, then the cost burden on all other participating industries could reduce the scheme’s economic efficiency. In either case, the justification behind these claims is analysed in depth. Based on the findings of this thesis, I have concluded that the focus of critics on the tradeoffs between environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency sacrifices the ability of the proposed scheme to achieve maximum buy-in from industry interests and ignores the foreign policy implications of early climate policy action by Australia...|$|R

As {{part of a general}} import substitution programme initiated during the Rhodesian Bush War, commercial vehicles were converted for military uses and several types of light ammunition manufactured. Small arms such as the Kommando LDP and the Rhogun submachine guns were also produced, although primarily for civilians; most Rhodesian weaponry was designed with those unaccustomed to handling firearms in mind. The local industry remained dependent on South African technical <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> promote the <b>export</b> of its products and facilitate general distribution.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (International Commerce)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Internationalisation has {{required}} companies to look outside their domestic markets and also utilize opportunities internationally. Companies {{are engaging in}} <b>export</b> activities <b>to</b> pursue greater market share and growth in profits. Countries also benefit from increased exports by earning more foreign exchange and creating more employment opportunities. Therefore governments and other private entities are providing export promotion programmes which are designed to encourage companies <b>to</b> promote the <b>exports</b> {{of goods and services}} in foreign markets. When <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> promote <b>exports</b> is provided, it is important to evaluate how effectively the limited government resources are spent and applied. Such evaluation of export promotion programmes will enable public policy-makers to expand those programmes that are more effective. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the Return on Investment (ROI) of some of the export promotion programmes provided by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The relationship between the total cost of export assistance and actual export sales for national pavilions and trade missions were evaluated. These two programmes are the largest in the DTl's Export Marketing and Investment Assistance (EMIA) scheme. Evaluation measures or criteria which have been successfully implemented by four other countries were examined in order to make practical recommendations to the DTI on how to implement appropriate criteria for the evaluation of these export promotion programmes. The results of this study yielded that the ROI per sector for national pavilions and trade missions produced positive results. For sustainable export growth, however, the DTI will have to develop new criteria for the evaluation of export promotion programmes. It should also focus more on the manufacturing and services industries <b>to</b> increase the <b>export</b> volumes and obtain higher ROI of government spending in export promotion programmes.

40|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1990 s <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) {{countries}} from many Central and Eastern European countries grew rapidly. The authors explore the extent that export growth reflects economic restructuring and changes in trade composition as opposed to redirection of traditional Council of Mutual Economic <b>Assistance</b> (CMEA) <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> the West. They also investigate vertical intra-industry exchanges role in trade expansion with Western Europe. They find a strong relationship between export performance and growth in vertical intra-industry trade with the European Union (EU). The Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia all rely heavily on the EU for inputs. As their per capita <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> the EU have grown the fastest, this appears to be a successful transition characteristic. The Czech and Slovak Republics registered the highest export growth and the greatest trade pattern reorientation. They have the highest intra-industry trade growth level and rate with the EU, but have undergone the least change in export composition. But substantial changes have occurred in the export composition within traditional export categories. This suggests that Czech and Slovak firms pursueda strategy of upgrading and differentiating traditional exports, relying on EU firms for new machinery, components, and know-how. Simple redirection of goods that were traditionally <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> CMEA markets does not appear to have played an important role in the growth of <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Western Europe. <b>Export</b> growth is in products that were not <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> the CMEA or in traditional export items that have been substantially upgraded or differentiated. Foreign direct investment inflows correlate highly with intra-industry trade levels. But, excluding the automobile sector, foreign direct investment seems unlikely to have been a major force driving intra-industry trade growth. These exchanges and the underlying integration in the world economy mostly reflect arm's length transactions between Central and Eastern European firms and their European counterparts.
