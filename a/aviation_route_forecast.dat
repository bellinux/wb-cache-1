40|$|It is {{well known}} that the space {{radiation}} dose over the polar route should be carefully considered especially when the space weather shows sudden disturbances such as CME and flares. The National Meteorological Satellite Center (NMSC) and Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) recently established a basis for a space radiation service for the public by developing a space radiation prediction model and heliocentric potential (HCP) prediction model. The HCP value is used as a critical input value of the CARI- 6 and CARI- 6 M programs, which estimate the <b>aviation</b> <b>route</b> dose. The CARI- 6 / 6 M is the most widely used and confidential program that is officially provided by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The HCP value is given one month late in the FAA official webpage, making it difficult to obtain real-time information on the <b>aviation</b> <b>route</b> dose. In order to overcome this limitation regarding time delay, we developed a HCP prediction model based on the sunspot number variation.

40|$|The space {{radiation}} dose over air routes including polar routes should be carefully considered, especially when space weather shows sudden disturbances such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), flares, and accompanying {{solar energetic particle}} events. We recently established a heliocentric potential (HCP) prediction model for real-time operation of the CARI- 6 and CARI- 6 M programs. Specifically, the HCP value {{is used as a}} critical input value in the CARI- 6 / 6 M programs, which estimate the <b>aviation</b> <b>route</b> dose based on the effective dose rate. The CARI- 6 / 6 M approach is the most widely used technique, and the programs can be obtained from the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). However, HCP values are given at a one month delay on the FAA official webpage, which makes it difficult to obtain real-time information on the <b>aviation</b> <b>route</b> dose. In order to overcome this critical limitation regarding the time delay for space weather customers, we developed a HCP prediction model based on sunspot number variations (Hwang et al. 2015). In this paper, we focus on improvements to our HCP prediction model and update it with neutron monitoring data. We found that the most accurate method to derive the HCP value involves (1) real-time daily sunspot assessments, (2) predictions of the daily HCP by our prediction algorithm, and (3) calculations of the resultant daily effective dose rate. Additionally, we also derived the HCP prediction algorithm in this paper by using ground neutron counts.

We have previously reported on Stages 1 and 2. Stage 3 refinements are reported alongside those made in Stage 4 in this Deliverable. In Stage 1, we developed the <b>route</b> and passenger <b>forecasts</b> for 2015, for the UK regional airports. We produced passenger forecasts {{for the whole of}} the year 2015 (primarily based on 1995 and 2005 CAA-sourced data), and <b>route</b> and frequency <b>forecasts</b> which related to a peak week in July 2015 (primarily based on 1995 and 2005 OAG-sourced data), split into international, plus ‘domestic and Eire’ forecasts. In Stage 2, we specified the actual <b>routes</b> <b>forecast</b> for all UK regional airports, for the peak week in July 2015. An example peak week schedule for Aberdeen was furnished. The schedules and forecasts have been built from a supporting database of over 10 500 flights. Several independent models were built, and integrated, to produce the initial output tables. Extensive data cleaning was necessary for this task. In Stages 3 and 4, a number of enhancements have been incorporated into the algorithms for the model, including the integration of some basic, alternative macro-level assumptions (such as higher/lower growth rates). New methods for the balancing of domestic routes and incorporation of different runway constraints are discussed. The challenges of producing parallel charter and cargo estimates are also explored. Seven pre-defined forecast scenarios that simulate varying degrees of economic growth and fuel price have been developed and form the basis of the output generated by the model. The baseline (scenario 1) forecast is discussed in detail in this Deliverable, and forms the basis of the outputs herein. In addition, output tables (traffic forecasts and timetables) for all seven scenarios accompany this document. Total CO 2, aggregated across all the scheduled passenger flight movements from the 36 regional forecasts have been calculated for each of the seven scenarios.

50|$|Mount Spurr, {{the highest}} volcano of the Aleutian arc, {{is a large}} lava dome {{constructed}} {{at the center of}} a roughly 5 km-wide horseshoe-shaped caldera that is open to the south. The volcano lies 130 km west of Anchorage and NE of Chakachamna Lake. The caldera was formed by a late-Pleistocene or early Holocene debris avalanche and associated pyroclastic flows that destroyed an ancestral Spurr volcano. The debris avalanche traveled more than 25 km to the SE, and the resulting deposit contains blocks as large as 100m in diameter. Several ice-carved post-caldera domes lie in the caldera. Present Mt. Spurr is the highest of the post-caldera. This regrown summit peak of Spurr experienced a heating event in 2004 which created a small crater lake. By 2008, the summit crater had cooled enough to have begun to have accumulated significant amounts of snow again. The youngest post-caldera dome, Crater Peak (2309m, 7575 ft), formed at the breached southern end of the caldera about 3.2 km south of Spurr, has been the source of about 40 identified Holocene tephra layers. Spurr's two historical eruptions, from Crater Peak in 1953 and 1992, deposited ash on the city of Anchorage. Crater Peak has a summit crater that is itself slightly breached along the south rim; the north wall of the crater exposes the truncated remains of an older dome or lava lake. Before the 1992 eruption, a small crater lake occupied the bottom of Crater Peak's crater. As with other Alaskan volcanoes, the proximity of Spurr to major trans-Pacific <b>aviation</b> <b>routes</b> means that an eruption of this volcano can significantly disrupt air travel. Volcanic ash can cause jet engines to fail.|$|R
