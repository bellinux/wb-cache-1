5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an agent {{to make a}} contract on his behalf with a third party. In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on the {{airplane}} to Berlin, flashbacks are interlaced throughout the episode, illustrating the tensions caused by Eli's frequent absence during Ziva's adolescence and the disintegration of Rivka (Weronika Rosati) and Eli David's marriage. Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding.

5|$|Gimmick! {{initially}} garnered lackluster {{interest and}} mixed reviews from publications like Famitsu, Electronic Gaming Monthly, and Nintendomagasinet. This lack of popularity was blamed on casual players {{being unable to}} handle the difficulty, and the industry's transition to newer 16-bit consoles like the Super NES and Mega Drive. When Gimmick! was exhibited at places like the Tokyo Toy Show, Sakai recalled that he was hoping <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> would see Gimmick! as a next-generation title developed for the original Nintendo and distribute it, only for them to lose interest once they learned it was an NES game. In retrospect, he joked that the game took 10 years for people to appreciate.|$|E
5|$|Cartman's {{involvement}} with the fried chicken black market closely mirrors {{the plot of the}} 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman in the role of Tony Montana, and Colonel Sanders in the role of Alejandro Sosa. In the episode, Cartman travels to a foreign land to meet <b>a</b> <b>dealer,</b> usurps the illegal operation from his local boss, and is ultimately brought down because he becomes addicted to his own product, plot points that mirror the plot of Scarface. Specific scenes patterned after ones in Scarface, include one in which Cartman watches Tommy being executed by being hanged from a helicopter, and the final scene in which Cartman's compound is attacked by gunmen. The episode also includes references to the 1991 crime film New Jack City.|$|E

In April 1929, Swedish swimmer Arne Borg, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Los Angeles on a world swimming tour, and in May, Sir James Gunnson, a former Mayor of Auckland, arrived for a one-month visit to promote increased trade between California and New Zealand. The next January, Herbert Hagerman, former Governor of New Mexico Territory; author Basil Woon, who had been doing research for a Hawaiian story; and aviation promoter and chewing gum magnate William Easterwood all sailed stateside on the ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Wong's {{father died}} in Los Angeles {{at the age of}} 91. After a six-year absence, Wong {{returned}} to film the same year with a small role in a B movie called Impact. From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the DuMont Television Network series The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, in which she played the title role which used her birth name. Wong's character was <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> in Chinese art whose career involved her in detective work and international intrigue. The ten half-hour episodes aired during prime time, from 9:00 to 9:30p.m. Although there were plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the show or its scripts are known to exist. After the completion of the series, Wong's health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an internal hemorrhage, which her brother attributed to the onset of menopause, her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries.|$|E
5|$|It {{belonged to}} Señora O. Yturbe of Madrid, who sold it in 1930 to Franz M. Zatzenstein, {{founder of the}} Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin. That April, the Duveen Brothers, less {{affected}} by the 1929 stock market crash than other dealers, paid Zatzenstein £30,000, in cash, for the painting and sold it immediately to Mellon. <b>A</b> <b>dealer</b> usually {{had to go through}} the lengthy process of sending photographs of a painting via trans-Atlantic ship to an American buyer and then wait for a reply; the transaction for the Nativity is exceptional because it is the first painting of which the photograph was wired via Marconi cable from England to America. To avoid the export fees due if the painting been sent directly to New York, the Duveens took a circuitous route– from Madrid to Germany, then to Paris and America. In 1936 it was acquired by the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, and gifted to the National Gallery a year later.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. According to an {{advertisement}} in the February 1899 issue of The Numismatist, gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as {{a birthday present}} and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried news of a customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins rates the least expensive gold dollar in very fine condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given {{for each of the}} Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.|$|E
5|$|Verbinski did {{not want}} an entirely romanticized feel to the film: he wanted a sense of {{historical}} fantasy. Most of the actors wore prosthetics and contact lenses. Depp had contacts that acted as sunglasses, while Rush and Lee Arenberg wore dulled contacts that gave a sinister feel to the characters. Mackenzie Crook wore two contacts to represent his character's wooden eye: a soft version, and a harder version for when it protrudes. In addition, their rotten teeth and scurvy skin were dyed on, although Depp did have gold teeth added, which he forgot to remove after filming. Depp also used a genuine pistol which was made in 1760 in London, which the crew bought from <b>a</b> <b>dealer</b> in Connecticut. A number of swords were built for the production by blacksmith Tony Swatton. The crew spent five months creating the cavern in which Barbossa and the Black Pearl crew attempt to reverse their curse, filling it with five feet of water, 882 Aztec coins, and some gold paint on the styrofoam rocks for more impressions of treasure. The crew also built the fortress at Port Royal in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and Governor Swann's palace was built at Manhattan Beach. A fire broke out in September 2002, causing $525,000 worth of damage, though no one was injured.|$|E
