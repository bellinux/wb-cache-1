This camouflage {{is designed to}} obfuscate the vehicle's visual lines, and is used along with padding, covers, and decals. The patterns' purpose is to prevent visual observation (and to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> photography), that would subsequently enable reproduction of the vehicle's form factors.|$|E

5|$|Manta {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E
5|$|More {{sophisticated}} classification {{arrangements were}} proposed by Pseudo-Geber (in the Geber corpus, c. 1310), Paracelsus (De Natura Rerum libri nonem, 1525–6; and later works), Basil Valentine (Conclusiones, 1624), and Boerhaave (Elementa Chemiæ, 1733). They attempted {{to separate the}} more characteristic metals from substances having those characteristics to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> Such substances included zinc, antimony, bismuth, stibnite, pyrite and galena. These were all then called semimetals or bastard metals.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{have a large}} {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, but also on bicycles. Tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation. Increase the crown radius of the front tire {{has been shown to}} decrease the size or eliminate self stability. Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in temperature, and, to <b>a</b> much <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> humidity will cause an {{increase in}} density altitude. Thus, in hot and humid conditions, the density altitude at a particular location may be {{significantly higher than the}} true altitude.|$|R

5|$|Warfarin {{decreases}} {{blood clotting}} by blocking an enzyme called vitamin K epoxide reductase that reactivates vitamin K1. Without sufficient active vitamin K1, clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X have decreased clotting ability. The anticlotting protein C and protein S are also inhibited but to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> A few days {{are required for}} full effect to occur and these effects can last {{for up to five}} days.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} there were about forty Jesuit colleges (secondary schools) {{scattered}} throughout the Commonwealth. They were educating mostly szlachta, burgher sons to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of the Crown, who built the town of Zamość, established an academy there in 1594; it had functioned as a gymnasium only after Zamoyski's death. The first two Vasa kings were well known for patronizing both the arts and sciences. After that the Commonwealth's science experienced general decline, which paralleled the wartime decline of the burgher class.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E

5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> France.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, {{and until the}} present day most of Bani Zeid's cultivable land is covered by olive orchards. The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions, dry legumes and fodder to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009. Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> than new facts or memories.|$|E

5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics.

An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> Rose.|$|E
5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria.

High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes.|$|E
