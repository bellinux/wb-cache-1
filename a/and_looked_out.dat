5|$|Work on Kingswear {{began in}} 1491, with the {{intention}} of providing protection to {{the east side of the}} estuary, and by the time it was completed in 1502 it formed one of the first purpose-built artillery forts in Britain. It took the form of a three-storeyed, square tower built of slate rubble with red sandstone detailing. Its large, rectangular gun-ports with wooden shutters on the ground level matched those at Dartmouth Castle, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> close to the water at the entrance to the harbour, covering both the sea and the anchorage itself. The first floor would have also held guns and provided accommodation for the garrison.|$|E

25|$|The {{dangers of}} viewing explosions behind window glass were known of before the Atomic Age began, being a common source of injury and death from large {{chemical}} explosions. The Halifax Explosion of 1917, an ammunition ship exploding {{with the energy}} of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT, injured the eyes and faces of hundreds of people who stayed behind <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of their windows after seeing a bright flash, with 200 blinded by broken glass when the slower moving blast arrived. Every window {{in the city of}} Halifax, Nova Scotia, was shattered in this catastrophe of human error.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Slug (Marshall Lancaster), who {{had been}} seen {{on-screen}} dating Becky in her early appearances, returned. The two characters share a backstory, which was partially created by Lancaster and Kelly themselves. During an interview with Digital Spy Kelly spoke the impact Slug has had on Becky stating: [...] "Marshall and I have invented a whole back story between us. It's nice to remember where Becky came from and what a journey she's had. Slug was {{an important part of}} Becky's life– they’ve got a lot of history. They grew up together <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> for each other." [...] The storyline progresses into Slug confessing his love for Becky. Kelly points out that Becky has been on a journey, subsequently changing, stating that [...] "Becky and Slug didn't know what love was" [...] and that she proves she has changed by rejecting his advances.|$|E

2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
