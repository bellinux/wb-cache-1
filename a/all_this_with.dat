25|$|In 1990 Crossrail {{plans were}} {{announced}} by Secretary of State of Transport Cecil Parkinson, {{which would have}} seen trains using part of the line to reach the Chiltern line to Aylesbury. A new viaduct would have run alongside the Grand Union Canal from Old Oak Common to Harlesden, and the first stop out of Paddington station would have been Wembley Park, for connections to the Metropolitan line and Jubilee line. Later plans replaced <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> a new tunnel connection, and finally the Aylesbury branch was dropped completely from the scheme.|$|E
500|$|MSNBC's Patrick Enwright {{listed the}} episode as his ninth {{favorite}} in the show in 2007, saying it [...] "brilliantly skewers new-agey self-help gurus" [...] and adding that [...] "it's also noteworthy for clever pop-cultural references." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as [...] "A very bizarre episode in which everyone just has a good time." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "A certified classic, 'Child' mocks the self-help field and makes a good point along the way. Of course, it does <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> scads of clever moments and becomes a great show. As one who works in psychology, it's hard to resist this program's spoofery." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and described Homer's escapades with the trampoline as [...] "the episode's brightest spot." [...] Turner described the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner homage as [...] "one of the show's most overt and inspired tributes to the Warner cartoons." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4.5 out of 5.|$|E
2500|$|The {{established}} {{congregation of}} Berlin viewed <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> apprehension. Rabbi Akiva Eger of Posen, perhaps the generation's greatest halakhic authority, published a short rebuke. He condemned {{the use of}} German in prayer, though not any other innovation, and castigated the Berlin group for wishing to emulate the [...] "Ordinances of the Gentiles" [...] ("neither shall ye walk in their ordinances"). The chief rabbi of Berlin, Meyer Simon Weyl, launched a formal protest to the government, utilizing a legal clause that allowed prayer only in the single recognized synagogue. On orders of King Frederick William III, both private temples were closed on 9 December 1815. Beer concluded that the only possible course of action was to vie for influence in the main prayerhouse. Seeking approbation for the reformed service, he sent enquiries to several rabbis in Italy, where he had business contacts. He did not explicitly describe the situation in Berlin, but vaguely asked about the permissibility of various practices. Italian communities, well acculturated and integrated, served {{as a matter of}} particular interest to German Jews, apart to their penchant for all things Sephardic. They had a long tradition of instrumental music in their synagogues, since the days of Salamone Rossi, making them an excellent precedent.|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} saw <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> eyes as keen as Ridgeley's. A cheerless {{and strange}} smile came upon his face.|$|E

60|$|<b>All</b> <b>this</b> tallied <b>with</b> {{what had}} been {{gathered}} from the child, and this last had probably been a bold attempt to procure the passage-money for his sweetheart.|$|R
