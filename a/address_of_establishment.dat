We also show that in plants, cells in culture and male germ-line cells undergo massive epigenomic changes correlated with the appearance of a novel class of 21 -nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) from transcriptionally reactivated transposable elements (TEs) following loss of heterochromatic DNA and histone methylation. We propose a model for the role of deliberate TE reactivation in germ-line companion cells as part of a developmental mechanism for first revealing and then silencing TEs via small RNA, which may contribute to reprogramming during early development in plants and animals...|$|R

To overcome some of those difficulties, a statistical approach is frequently used in a multi-object data association and state estimation framework. Additionally, the correspondence between each measurement and predicted feature can be performed by minimizing the overall Mahalanobis distance. Under these circumstances, the estimation of the system can be accomplished using different stochastic filters. Hereby, a comparison is made between the results obtained, with the described framework, either by the Kalman Filter or the Unscented Kalman Filter, in the tracking of linear and nonlinear motions of feature points along image sequences. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a census {{recently}} carried out by CSIL of the leading kitchen furniture producers worldwide, which has enabled it to outline the weight of the first 500 kitchen furniture manufacturers in the world. The kitchen furniture turnover of 500 selected companies accounts for about 56 % of the world kitchen furniture production. The selection of 500 players is based partly on the overall size of the company (turnover, employees, etc.) and partly on the need of international representativeness (for example, the 51 st North American firm is probably larger than the largest firm in India, but the latter was chosen in order to represent the Pacific area too). Company information is based on previous CSIL market reports and on desk research or estimates concerning the countries not covered. The kitchen turnover is updated with data of the last three years and it is estimated for some companies. The companies are mentioned by home country and gathered in geographical areas (Europe, Africa and Middle East; Asia and Pacific; North and South America) to give both local and global reading of the kitchen furniture industry in the world. For each company are provided (where available) : Full company <b>address,</b> Year <b>of</b> <b>establishment,</b> Group membership, Total turnover, Kitchen turnover % of kitchen on total production, Number of employees, Turnover per employee. For leading companies the report offers also short profiles with history, product breakdown, main brands and distribution channels. The first chapter of the report provides an overview of the kitchen furniture market worldwide in 60 countries selected according to their economy size, importance of the major furniture sector and contribution to international trade of kitchen furniture. Scope of the research is to facilitate the sales relationship between suppliers, manufacturers and distributors in the kitchen furniture sector, which is developing globally in a rapid pace. ...|$|R

The analysis {{is based on}} the concept of the primary ash particle size distribution (PAPSD), defined as the PSD of primary ash particles liberated by fuel particles upon complete burn-off. An experimental procedure for the quantitative assessment of the rate of primary ash generation and of the size distribution of primary ash particles (PAPSID) is presented. The application of the procedure is demonstrated with reference to a set of solid fuels, including coals and biogenous fuels. The reliability and accuracy of the technique was satisfactorily tested, with the exception of two biomass fuels which gave rise to bed agglomeration making the application of the test procedure unsuccessful. A simplified theoretical analysis is presented, based on material balances on lumped classes of primary ash particles around the CFBC. The analysis aims at clarifying the role of the PAPSD and of the cyclone efficiency to the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> bed inventory, particle size distribution and solids circulation rate. Lower and upper bounds to the solids circulation rate that can be established in the steady operation of a CFBC are related to the PAPSD and to the cyclone performance...|$|R

40|$|This thesis <b>addresses</b> the {{question}} <b>of</b> {{the implementation of}} the freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> (Article 49 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) in two EU member states with particular emphasis on impediments to the freedom. It is argued that despite a very long-standing and clear legal prohibition on restrictions to the freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment,</b> there remain many practical obstacles which inhibit the right. This thesis’ hypothesis is that double taxation and double non-deductibility of losses constitute hurdles to a complete freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment.</b> As far as the methodology is concerned the approach chosen to test the hypothesis is as follows: first to set out a theoretical framework based on the non-Discrimination principle, the basic principles of the freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> right and the exemptions to that right. Then, right <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> is tested as against the practice in three ways, each considered in a chapter: the requirement of the nationality prerequisite; the double taxation of companies operating in more than one EU member state; and the practice of double non-deductibility of losses. The research is inspired by the case study of an author’s businesses, SMEs who trade cross-border in the United Kingdom (UK) and subsequently in Poland. From a study of the implementation practices of both the UK and Poland this thesis suggests that the following form serious restrictions: double taxation and non-deductibility of losses. Moreover, case law and existing literature identify taxation as a core impediment to the exercise of the freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> as taxation matters deter companies from relocating their whole business. This thesis examines how to balance the freedom <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> and the tax powers of the EU member states. Taxation also plays a fundamental {{role in the development of}} the EU’s internal market. The thesis seeks a pragmatic solution which might be implemented effectively without resorting to substantial international harmonization...|$|R
