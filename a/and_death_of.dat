5|$|Morris had {{continued}} to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris's epic poem, The Life <b>and</b> <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> Jason, at his own expense. The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek myth of the hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life <b>and</b> <b>Death</b> <b>of</b> Jason was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E

5|$|Eliot {{included}} other literary sources {{within the}} poem: Stéphane Mallarmé, W. B. Yeats, Jonathan Swift, Arnaut Daniel, Nijinsky's dancing in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Shakespeare's Hamlet. Religious images {{were used to}} connect the poem to the writings of Julian of Norwich, to the life <b>and</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Wentworth, to William Laud, to Charles I, and to John Milton. Eliot relied on theological statements {{similar to those of}} Alfred, Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam and Thomas Hardy's The Impercipient. The Bible also played a large role within the poem, especially in discussions on the Holy Spirit and Pentecost. Many commentators have pointed out the influence of George Herbert within the poem, but Eliot, in a letter to Anne Ridler dated 10 March 1941, stated {{that he was trying to}} avoid such connections within Little Gidding.|$|E

5|$|Graysmith {{first met}} Fischer and Vanderbilt at {{the premiere of}} Paul Schrader's film, Auto Focus, {{which was based on}} Graysmith's 1991 book about the life <b>and</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> actor Bob Crane. A deal was made and they optioned the rights to Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked when they became {{available}} after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. David Fincher was their first choice to direct based on his work on Seven. Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia (later filmed by Brian De Palma), and envisioned a five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars. When that fell through, Fincher left that project and moved on to Zodiac.|$|E

The siege lasted through winter and the Arab army faced great hardship, but after the Arabs defeated a Byzantine relief force in spring 708, the city surrendered. A few months later, in the summer, Maslama led another expedition into Asia Minor and defeated a Byzantine army near Amorium, while in 709 he raided into the region of Isauria.|$|E

5|$|In June 1560, Michel de l'Hôpital was {{appointed}} Chancellor of France. He sought {{the support of}} France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend {{the law in the}} face of the growing anarchy. Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at Fontainebleau. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Condé raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness <b>and</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the king, as a result of an infection or an abscess in his ear.|$|E
5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency.
