5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> period.|$|E
25|$|Bump Day summary: The day {{opened with}} nine spots {{available}} in the starting field. A total of ten drivers were preparing to make qualifying attempts. During morning practice, Katherine Legge took practice laps {{for the first time}} during the month. At 12 noon, qualifying opened, and in the first hour, the field was filled to 33 cars. At 1 p.m., Katherine Legge was on the bubble, and the only car to not make an attempt was Michel Jourdain, Jr. The Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing team was having considerable difficulty getting Jourdain's car up to speed, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> progressed, the team was not making progress. After several drastic changes to the car's set-ups, the team decided to park the car at 5:45p.m., and did not make a qualifying attempt.|$|E
500|$|The {{meteorological}} {{instability in}} the region resulted {{in the formation of}} at least five supercell thunderstorms in the space of around three hours. The storms, which spawned progressively further up the coast from Brisbane to Gladstone <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> progressed, left a trail of damage resulting from hail, rain and wind. The event has been described as [...] "one of the most widespread outbreaks of severe thunderstorms recorded" [...] by veteran meteorologist Richard Whitaker.|$|E

500|$|On 24 April, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> progressed, about 1,000 of General Muhlenberg's Virginia militia {{marched into}} Petersburg. Other militia units were also gathering. Lafayette's force was still several days away, and another Continental Army force under General Anthony Wayne was even further off. [...] Von Steuben and Muhlenberg, {{who had been}} {{avoiding}} conflict with the British due to their weak numbers and inexperienced troops, {{decided that it was}} time to make some sort of stand. [...] The militia had not had any sort of victory since the British arrived in Virginia, and morale was quite low. [...] After a council of war, they decided to establish a line in Blandford, then a separate town east of Petersburg and now a neighborhood within the city. When the time came, the colonists could retreat across the Appomattox River over the Pocahontas Bridge. [...] That evening General von Steuben ordered Muhlenberg's corps to the north side of the Appomattox onto the peninsula known as Pocahontas Island and onto the elevated ground overlooking the river. Then, during the moonless night, von Steuben and Muhlenberg moved their forces south of the river into Blandford.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{computer}} models {{indicated that the}} day's storms would primarily feature strong winds and hail with a minimal risk for tornadoes, with severe weather occurring mainly north of the stalled front in Oklahoma. However, conditions improved further than expected, leading the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Fort Worth, Texas to intensify its verbiage in its public forecasting products as the day progressed, in addition to highlighting areas around the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex as potential risk areas for tornadoes. Thunderstorms began to develop in earnest along the dry line <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> progressed, beginning with initial storm development northeast of Abilene. The strong southwesterly winds aloft from the curved subtropical jet over the region helped to ventilate the storms, allowing for their persistence and intensity. The SPC issued its first of two tornado watches for the event at 2:53p.m. CST (20:53 UTC) for portions of southern Oklahoma and North-Central Texas. The most favorable environment for tornadoes was initially over the Red River but shifted southward to include the Dallas-Fort Worth area in the evening hours. As storms continued to develop along a line paralleling Interstate 35, some storms congealed into a mesoscale convective system {{in the vicinity of}} the Metroplex; this cluster of storms produced both F3tornadoes in Fort Worth and Arlington. The complex of storms eventually evolved into a transient bow echo that continued to track eastward into Louisiana. [...] Elsewhere, supercells continued to propagate eastward across North and South-Central Texas along the dry line, slowly weakening after sunset.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{verdicts}} were announced, {{a crowd of}} protesters formed at the Los Angeles police headquarters at Parker Center in Downtown Los Angeles.

In the midst of this, before 6:30 pm, police chief Daryl Gates left Parker Center, {{on his way to}} the neighborhood of Brentwood. There, as the situation in Los Angeles deteriorated, Gates attended a political fundraiser against Los Angeles City Charter Amendment F, which was stated to [...] "give City Hall more power over the police chief and provide more civilian review of officer misconduct", and would limit the power and term length of his own position.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{hours after}} the Dolphins' game against the Cincinnati Bengals, the Dolphins {{suspended}} Incognito indefinitely for conduct detrimental to the team. The Dolphins also asked the NFL to join their own internal investigation of the matter. According to Schefter, the final straw for the Dolphins was a highly graphic voicemail Incognito left in April 2013, in which Incognito called Martin a [...] "half-nig*er piece of s*it," [...] threatened to slap Martin's mother across the face and even uttered a death threat against Martin. Until then, the Dolphins had publicly maintained the charges against Incognito were pure speculation. Schefter said that as late <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of November 3, the Dolphins didn't even know the voicemail existed. Within hours of hearing the tape, Schefter said, the Dolphins had suspended Incognito. The next day, a Dolphins source told The Miami Herald that Incognito would never play another down for the Dolphins again, and that the team intended to cut ties {{with him at the}} earliest opportunity.|$|E

Curtin's brigade assaulted the fort from the rear as well as across the ditch and over the parapet, capturing three guns and several prisoners {{but they could not}} advance due to flanking artillery fire. The attack then bogged down after Parke's corps had taken four batteries, including Fort Mahone, and only about [...] of the Confederate forward line. Confederate counterattacks led to bitter fighting, traverse to traverse, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> continued. Brigadier General Simon G.

Major General Bryan Grimes's Confederates counterattacked at 1:00p.m. and 3:00p.m., which recaptured a portion of Fort Mahone and sections of Union-occupied trenches east of Jerusalem Plank Road. Union Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles H. T. Collis's Independent Brigade then attacked to stabilize the situation for the Union troops and to reoccupy the line east of Fort Mahone.|$|E
