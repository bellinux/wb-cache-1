40|$|Septic tanks <b>and</b> soil <b>adsorption</b> {{fields are}} a {{commonly}} used {{wastewater treatment system}} in unsewered areas. The biological processes on which they rely were considered in detail and their operating requirements established along with the assumptions underlying {{the design of the}} treatment system. The principal regions in which septic tanks <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> fields are used in Tasmania were also established and the environmental conditions in these areas were compared with the operating and design conditions of septic tank <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> field systems. From this the suitability of septic tank wastewater treatment in the particular areas of use was predicted. In highland areas septic tank <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> field systems were considered to be unsuitable for wastewater treatment whilst in lowland areas their suitability is dependent upon site characteristics. No region of septic tank <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> field use in Tasmania was considered to be completely suitable for this form of wastewater treatment. The environmental conditions of two dissimilar sites, Mt. Mawson and Carlton, were characterised and the performance of septic tank <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> field systems under them assessed. The behaviour of the treatment systems was consistent with the predictions made earlier. Within this study several deficiencies in septic tank <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> field design <b>and</b> operation, both in Tasmania generally and specifically at the two study sites, were highlighted. Remedial action was suggested where appropriate...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} fundamental interfacial tension properties <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> behaviors of four surfactant {{candidates for the}} chemical flooding.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, it was {{investigated}} the changes of structure of sepiolites under different conditions of acid treatments and heat treatments using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR). At the same time, through the tannin adsorption experiments, it was studied the changes adsorption properties of sepiolites by acid treatments and heat treatments. The H 2 SO 4 treatment {{was found to}} be more effective for the removal of tannin than HCl and HNO 3 treatments. With increasing the acid concentration and acid treatment time of H 2 SO 4, the removal rates <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacity of tannin by sepiolites were first increased and then decreased. The removal rates <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacity were 61. 0 % and 23. 7 mg/g when the acid concentration was 4. 0 mol/l. And the removal rates <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacity were 62. 5 % and 24. 3 mg/g when the acid treatment time was 16 hours. The calcinations treatment exhibited significant effects on the adsorption of tannin. The removal rates <b>and</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacity were 77. 9 % and 30. 8 mg/g when the calcined temperature was 400 ◦C.
