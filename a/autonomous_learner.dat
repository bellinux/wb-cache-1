Participants were 50 second grade learners in the English Language Teaching Departments of Hacettepe University (N= 10), Mehmet Akif Ersoy University (N= 10), and Uludag University (N= 30) who had already taken courses about learner autonomy.   The data were collected by means of a questionnaire which had two Likert-scale sections and an open-ended questions section. The first Likert-scale section contained 15 characteristics of <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners</b> each of which was rated by the participants in a scale from strongly disagree to agree, from 1 to 5. In the second Likert-scale section, {{the participants were asked to}} rate the Turkish education system’s five basic elements such as school curriculums, course materials, approaches used by the teachers in classrooms, learning activities, and classroom settings. Additionally, learners’ opinions about their awareness and understanding of learner autonomy were gathered by five open ended questions. The results proposed that the participants were aware of learner autonomy, and had the characteristics of <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners.</b> On the other hand, results showed that the Turkish education system was not suitable for <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners</b> and did not foster learner autonomy.

40|$|Abstract—A {{cognitive}} collaborative {{reinforcement learning}} algorithm (CCRL) that incorporates an advisor into {{the learning process}} is developed to improve supervised learning. An <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner</b> is enabled with a self awareness cognitive skill to decide when to solicit instructions from the advisor. The learner can also assess the value of advice, and accept or reject it. The method is evaluated for robotic motion planning using simulation. Tests are conducted for advisors with skill levels from expert to novice. The CCRL algorithm and a combined method integrating its logic with Clouse’s Introspection Approach, outperformed a base-line fully <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner,</b> and demonstrated robust performance when dealing with various advisor skill levels, learning to accept advice received from an expert, while rejecting that of less skilled collaborators. Although the CCRL algorithm is based on RL, it fits other machine learning methods, since advisor’s actions are only added to the outer layer.

40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} about {{autonomy}} in language {{learning and the}} basic components which define {{the role of a}} teacher and the role of a learner in the process. A teacher's role is very important in helping students develop autonomy in learning, besides other crucial functions, such as management and instruction. Learner autonomy in the last few decades has been considered as one of the ultimate goals in education in general and in particular in language learning. An <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner</b> can be considered that student who has developed some learning strategies and is able to control their way of learning. In the case of learning a language, the students {{need to know how to}} learn in the classroom and out of it in order to understand what strategies are more functional for them. Having a repertoire of learning styles and strategies can help students become better and more creative and autonomous learners. The process of becoming an <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner</b> is a dynamic one and leads the learner into the acquisition of numerous styles and strategies. The main goal of strategies and instruction is to make the students more aware of the effectiveness of their learning, and also to help students consciously control how they learn so that they can be efficient, motivated, and independent language learners...|$|E

The present research explores how the degree of self-determination of learners, that is the motivational orientation of a learner, influences the communication and interaction patterns in an online Problem Based Learning environment. Given the complexity of CMC, we expected that <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners</b> would {{be more willing to}} contribute to cognitive discourse. In time, we expected that control-oriented learners would develop a preferential attachment to contribute to discourse from <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners.</b> Data were gathered from 37 autonomous and 39 control-oriented learners who posted 1669 messages. Using a dynamic multi-method approach of content analysis of cognitive and social discourse, social network analysis, and measures of academic motivation, we find some preliminary evidence that motivational orientation influences communication and social interaction patterns amongst learners. From the beginning, most control-oriented learners develop a preference to connect to and communicate with <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners,</b> although a separate team-analysis indicates that group dynamics also influence how learners develop connections with other learners in time.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{on-going}} study dealing {{with one of}} the automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems, Eva Text Analysis of L 2 writing by Japanese EFL college students (see note 1). Through the medium of Eva Text Analysis, this present study aims to identify the advantages, disadvantages, as well as changes, in the students’ attitudes and reactions to their evaluation of L 2 writing. At the same time, this study evaluates possible backwash effects after introducing Eva Text Analysis to L 2 writing classes, and the possibility for establishing <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners.</b> In order to obtain relevant data, a longitudinal study spanning almost four months was conducted. The quantitative and qualitative aspects of students’ attitudes and reactions were assessed. As a result, we found that the use of Eva Text Analysis was successful not only for the assessment of L 2 writings but also for improving L 2 writings by the students. At the same time, Eva Text Analysis was also helpful for enhancing <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners</b> and for motivation of the students’ L 2 studying. In other words, Eva Text Analysis was helpful significantly for students’ autonomy in L 2 writings and also for students’ motivation in studying L 2 writing. They were important findings in this study. By introducing AWE, instructors can save a lot of time when revising students’ writing at a surface level. Students can evaluate their written work anywhere as many times as they want, thus promoting the establishment of <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners.</b> Encouraging students to become <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners</b> is crucial. However, there were some limitations to be considered in this study. First, the number of students in this study was limited (only 28 in total). If this study collected much more than 28, the result of this study would have been different from the present data results. For example, the readability grades would have been different, and the number of words/sentences and T. T. R.

Drawing upon samples of students work, it will look at whether certain types of activity, both technology-based and more traditional, are more likely to enhance autonomous learning. In particular, the use of blogs and student-produced assessment tools, as means of developing autonomy, will be focused on in more depth. Alongside this, using data from interviews with and observations of teachers, the role of the teacher as facilitator, adviser and resource in the setting up and managing of activities which may nurture the process of autonomous learning is considered since, as Smith (2008) highlights, the teachers’ role, far from being diminished, is vital in developing <b>autonomous</b> <b>learners.</b> Finally, taking into account the above, activities through which classroom teaching can focus more overtly on promoting and developing autonomy will be suggested.

40|$|Classroom-based, teacher-directed {{language}} learning has been dominant in language {{teaching and learning}} for decades; however, the notion of autonomy is not novel to language teachers. Since the publication of Holec’s book, Autonomy and Foreign Language Learning (1981), autonomy in {{language learning}} {{has been a significant}} issue for discussion in relation to language learning practices and language teaching principles. Many ESL researchers have turned their attention to learner autonomy in classroom settings; however, learner autonomy in the Iranian context within self-access settings, classroom settings, and school curriculum has not been adequately addressed in the literature. To fill the research gap mentioned above, the present study aims to determine: 1. if Betts’s <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Learner</b> Model (Betts & Kercher, 1999) has any significant effect in terms of students’ self-directed learning readiness, and 2. if Betts’s <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Learner</b> Model has any significant effect on students’ English language proficiency. Adopting a quasi-experimental design, the study involved a comparison between the experimental and the control group. Two instruments were used: Gugliemino’s (1977) Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS); and standardized TOEFL test. 30 students (group A) were taught English based on a pedagogical model, which blended Betts’s ALM with classroom instruction and 30 students (group B) were taught through a traditional teacher-directed method. Finally, after six months of treatment, TOEFL test and SDLRS test were administered as the post-test and the results were analyzed by means of SPSS software.

40|$|In recent years, the {{learning}} plan {{has become an}} inherent part of academic discussions around identifying ways to foster learner autonomy. In this context, various definitions and terms have surfaced. As a consequence, at their extreme some do not have much {{more in common with}} the umbrella term 'learning plan' than a phonetic resemblance. A main reason for the widely differing semantic use of the term 'learning plan' lies within its theoretical conception. In fact, there is no consensus on the components which define the content and the use of 'learning plans'. Deciding upon a learning plan that suits individual educational institutions thus requires educators to sort through a veritable 'jungle' of different terms and theoretical conceptions of learning plans. An additional aspect that particularly schools view critically when considering to include learning plans in the curriculum is the lack of evidence that documents benefits that learning plans may have for the learner. While research has engaged extensively in defining learner autonomy and in establishing an environment which supports the development of the <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner,</b> there are few examples which measure the effectiveness of learning plans. This highlights the necessity of developing instruments which measure the effectiveness of a learning plan as a 'scaffold' supporting learner autonomy. Effectiveness in this sense can refer to a number of outcomes closely related to learner autonomy of which two key factors are higher motivation and engagement in learning. Claiming that the learner's motivation towards and engagement in learning plans support the development into an <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner,</b> the approach of this paper is twofold. Firstly, this paper aims to shed light on the 'jungle' of learning plan concepts by presenting examples of best teaching practices. Secondly, this paper suggests an instrument to measure the learner's commitment towards her/his learning plan as an indicator of effectiveness. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the characteristics of autonomous learners, autonomous learning strategies which were applied by them, and the factors influencing the autonomous learners in learning English. This {{study was conducted in}} second grade of one senior high school in Bandung. This study employed a qualitative case study. Case study was deemed to be relevant for this study since it deals with specific phenomenon of <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner</b> as a single case which was analyzed and described. The data were obtained from the students which were collected through observation, questionnaire, and interview. After collecting the data, it was analyzed inductively based on qualitative data analysis and interpreted to answer the research questions. The study revealed three findings related to the research questions. First, it was found that all of the autonomous learners were able to identify their learning needs, find the materials that they intended to learn, and select learning projects, there were ten learners who worked collaboratively to learn English and used the teacher as a guide in learning English, nine learners learned outside the class, eight learners set their goals to learn English, six learners assist themselves in problems to tackle and chose when and where they will learn, three of them who plan activities to learn English and only a learner who decided when learning was complete. Second, the autonomous learners employedfour strategies which were (1) memory strategy, (2) social strategy, (3) cognitive strategy and (4) metacognitive strategy. Memory and social strategy were the most preferred learning style among autonomous learners. Third, autonomous learners were influenced by five factors which are (1) motivation, (2) social environment, (3) task, (4) teacher and (5) material. These finding suggest that the teacher must encourage and promote students to become <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner</b> because students will get more benefit from becoming autonomous learners...|$|E

40|$|Supporting the <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner</b> in the {{classroom}} is an innovative attempt to foster learner engagement and learning outcomes. Some proponents {{go so far as to}} stress the importance of the concept of learner autonomy for lifelong learning. The literature suggests several instruments (i. e. portfolios, diaries, learning contracts or individualised learning plans) in order to engender learner autonomy. Over the past 30 years, the literature has engaged extensively in elaborating the theoretical framework of learner autonomy and its practical application in {{the classroom}}. Aiming to equip students for lifelong learning, strong focus has been put on identifying the components of the autonomous classroom, and its academic and behavioural effects on students. According to various case studies, a number of schools have been identified to have tested or permanently adopted an approach fostering the <b>autonomous</b> <b>learner.</b> However, the majority of the findings focus on descriptive analyses of case studies. Contributing to these findings, this paper discusses findings of an empirical study nestled within the Australian schooling system. Its objectives were threefold. Firstly, it aimed to identify whether the concept of learner autonomy has been widely adopted by schools or whether it remains a theoretical concept rather than a feasible one. Secondly, it attempted to identify how schools define the concept of learner autonomy and thirdly, how this concept is generally implemented by schools. Drawing upon the existing literature, this paper argues that learner autonomy is more than a theoretical construct as it is implemented by the majority of Australian schools. However, its definition and application varies significantly amongst schools and school types. This indicates that learner autonomy must be considered as a flexible concept that takes various shapes that extend beyond commonly cited concepts in the literature. 22 page(s...|$|E
