40|$|Antagonistic symmetries of superconducting polygons {{and their}} induced multi-vortex {{states in a}} {{homogeneous}} magnetic field may lead to appearance of antivortices {{in the vicinity of}} the superconducting/normal state boundary (where mesoscopic confinement is particularly strong). Resulting vortex-antivortex (V-Av) molecules match the sample symmetry, but are extremely sensitive to defects and fluctuations and remain undetected experimentally. Here we show that V-Av states can re-appear deep in the superconducting state due to an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>perforations</b> in a polygonal setting, surrounding a central hole. Such states are no longer caused by the symmetry of the sample but rather by pinning itself, which prevents the vortex-antivortex annihilation. As a result, even micron-size, clearly spaced V-Av molecules can be stabilized in large mesoscopic samples. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Development of the {{electronic}} retinal prosthesis for restoration of sight in patients suffering from the degenerative retinal diseases faces many technological challenges. To achieve significant improvement in the low vision patients the visual acuity of 20 / 80 would be desirable, which corresponds to the pixel size of 20 µm in the retinal implant. Stimulating current strongly (quadratically) depends on distance between electrode and cell. To achieve uniformity in stimulation thresholds, to avoid erosion of the electrodes and overheating of tissue, and to reduce the cross-talk between the neighboring pixels the neural cells should {{not be separated from}} electrodes by more than a few micrometers. Achieving such a close proximity along the whole surface of an implant {{is one of the major}} obstacles for the high resolution retinal implant. To ensure proximity of cells and electrodes we have developed a technique that prompts migration of retinal cells towards stimulating sites. The device consists of a multilayered membrane with an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>perforations</b> of several (5 - 15) micrometers in diameter in which addressable electrodes can be embedded. In experiments in-vitro using explants of the whole retina of P 7 rats, and in-vivo using adult rabbits and RCS rats the retinal tissue grew into the pores when membranes were positioned on the sub-retinal side. Histology has demonstrated that migrating cells preserve synaptic connections with cells outside the pores, thus allowing for signal transduction into the retina above the implant...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the acoustic properties of a rigid plate with a periodic pattern of holes, in a compressible, ideal, inviscid fluid in the absence of mean flow. Leppington and Levine (J. Fluid Mech., 1973) obtained an approximation of the reflection and transmission coefficients of a plane wave incident on an infinitely thin plate with a rectangular <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>perforations,</b> assuming that a characteristic size of the perforations is negligible relative to that of the unit cell of the grating, itself assumed to be negligible relative to the wavelength. One part of the present study is of methodological interest. It establishes {{that it is possible to}} extend their approach to thick plates with a skew grating of perforations, thus confirming recent results in Bendali et al. (SIAM J. Appl. Math., 2013), but in a much simpler way without using complex matched asymptotic expansions of the full wave or to a grating of multipoles. As is well-known, effective compliances for the plate can then be derived from the corresponding approximations of the reflection and transmission coefficients. These compliances are expressed in terms of the Rayleigh conductivity of an isolated perforation. Consequently, in one other part of the present study, the methodology recently introduced in Laurens et al. (ESAIM:M 2 AN, 2013) to obtain sharp bounds for the Rayleigh conductivity has been extended to include the case for which the openings of the perforations on the upper and lower sides of the plate are elliptical in shape. This not only enables the determination of these bounds and of the associated reflection and transmission coefficients for actual plates with tilted perforations but also yields single expressions covering all usual cases of perforations: straight or tilted with a circular or an elliptical cross-section...|$|E

40|$|Superconductivity is an {{electronic}} {{state of matter}} arising from {{the existence of a}} common wave function with a coherent phase extending on a truly macroscopic scale. One major manifestation of this striking quantum phenomenon is the dissipationless transport of electrical current, an asset deserving particular attention in the present times where the efficient energy distribution has become of utmost importance. Unfortunately, the motion of quantum units of magnetic flux (so-called vortices or fluxons), which is an unavoidable side-effect found in superconductors in the presence of transport currents and magnetic fields, severely limits the conditions to preserve dissipationless transport. This poses a challenge for achieving the functionalization of superconducting materials and threatens their spectrum of applications. It is widely known that any inhomogeneities (either material imperfections, or ones made artificially), which locally suppress superconductivity on the scale comparable to the core of the vortex, can pin the vortex and delay the onset of the vortex motion to higher applied currents. In recent years a substantial effort has been made to minimize the effects of current-induced vortex motion by tailoring <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> artificial pinning centers. Besides improving the critical parameters of the superconducting state, a pinning matrix can be used for the manipulation of vortex matter, thus directly affecting the vortex dynamics, such as rectification of vortex motion under an ac drive (vortex diode) by introducing asymmetric pinning landscapes. In the literature one can find that the realization of the anchoring of the vortices can be based on nanostructured <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> <b>perforations,</b> chemically grown defects, permanent nanomagnets, or even pinning sites produced by heavy ion bombardment. All of those realizations are based on a permanent imprint on the superconductor, without any possibility for subsequent modifications in the distribution and strength of the pinning. The principal objective of this thesis is to investigate the dynamical behavior of vortex matter under an entirely new kind of pinning landscape consisting of spatial and temporal modulation of the superconducting condensate. A particular case of spatial modulation is considered in a constricted structure where current lensing can cause extremely high vortex velocities. Subsequently, a time-dependent thermal potential introduced to the superconducting condensate will cause stroboscopic resonances during the vortex motion - a phenomenon that cannot be observed in the systems with static pinning imprints. Finally, a study of electronic gating is presented, where the local properties of superconductor, such as mean free path, or electronic band structure in general, can be influenced electronically. This is a completely unexplored interdisciplinary research topic, which will eventually allow one to manipulate individual vortices in superconducting materials by means of spatially confined and temporally controlled thermal and electromagnetic excitations. Furthermore, such techniques can provide one fundamental insight in different states of the vortex matter with respect to variation of the transport current, highly relevant for understanding the resistive state of superconducting materials and their applications...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a new {{solution}} representation for the Helmholtz transmission problem in a bounded domain in R^ 2 with a thin and periodic layer of finite length. The layer may consists of a periodic pertubation of the material coefficients or it is a wall modelled by boundary conditions with an periodic <b>array</b> <b>of</b> small <b>perforations.</b> We consider the periodicity in the layer as the small variable delta and {{the thickness of the}} layer to be at the same order. Moreover we assume the thin layer to terminate at re-entrant corners leading to a singular behaviour in the asymptotic expansion of the solution representation. This singular behaviour becomes visible in the asymptotic expansion in powers of delta where the powers depend on the opening angle. We construct the asymptotic expansion order by order. It consists of a macroscopic representation away from the layer, a boundary layer corrector {{in the vicinity of the}} layer, and a near field corrector in the vicinity of the end-points. The boundary layer correctors and the near field correctors are obtained by the solution of canonical problems based, respectively, on the method of periodic surface homogenization and on the method of matched asymptotic expansions. This will lead to transmission conditions for the macroscopic part of the solution on an infinitely thin interface and corner conditions to fix the unbounded singular behaviour at its end-points. Finally, theoretical justifications of the second order expansion are given and illustrated by numerical experiments. The solution representation introduced in this article can be used to compute a highly accurate approximation of the solution with a computational effort independent of the small periodicity delta...|$|R
