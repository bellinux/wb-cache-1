5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was {{brought before the}} U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued that {{under the terms of}} the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out suspensions <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.|$|E

5|$|Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear, {{released}} in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, utilized stealth elements within an action-adventure framework, {{and was the}} first mainstream stealth game to be released on consoles. Since the MSX2 was not available in North America, only the NES version was released there. Metal Gear placed a greater emphasis on stealth than other games of its time, with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons (requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found) and having limited ammunition for each weapon. Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance (using a line-of-sight mechanic) <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> gunshots from non-silenced weapons; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations, and a security alarm sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him. Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box, and use his fists to fight enemies.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
