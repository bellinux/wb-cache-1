5|$|Humpbacks {{can easily}} be {{identified}} by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E

5|$|Lead(II) {{compounds}} <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the {{inorganic chemistry}} of lead. Even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF2 and PbCl2. Lead(II) ions are usually colorless in solution, and partially hydrolyze to form Pb(OH)+ and finally Pb4(OH)4 (in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands), {{but are not}} reducing agents as tin(II) ions are. Techniques for identifying {{the presence of the}} Pb2+ ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead(II) chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is somewhat soluble in water, the precipitation of lead(II) sulfide, by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution, is then attempted.|$|E
5|$|Microgale macpheei is an extinct shrew tenrec from southeastern Madagascar. It {{is known}} only from two partial skulls found in Andrahomana cave, which {{radiocarbon}} dating of associated rodent remains suggests are about 2000 years old. It {{is the only}} known recently extinct tenrec. First described in 2007, it is most similar to the smaller Microgale brevicaudata of northern and western Madagascar. M.macpheei has a broad rostrum (front part of the skull) and, like M.brevicaudata, lacks a diastema (gap) between the premolars. A number of details of tooth morphology <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> M.macpheei.|$|E
5|$|Muqarnas are elaborately carved {{ceilings}} to semi-domes, {{often used}} in mosques. They are typically made of stucco (and thus {{do not have a}} structural function), but can also be of wood, brick, and stone. They <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> Islamic architecture of the Middle Ages from Spain and Morocco in the west to Persia in the east. Architecturally they form multiple tiers of squinches, diminishing in size as they rise. They are often elaborately decorated.|$|E

5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} of chromospheric activity, strong {{magnetic}} field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> a young star. Most estimates {{of the age of}} Epsilon Eridani place it in the range from 200 million to 800 million years. The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the interstellar medium (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars. This anomaly might be caused by a diffusion process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's convection zone.|$|E
5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the area: ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland. With their temperate climate these support {{a range of}} flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E

5|$|The {{mountains}} <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> the Great Basin's {{topography of}} mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, {{which came from}} an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The {{southern end of the}} range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> Hogarth.|$|E

5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae. A find of associated caudal vertebrae {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only slowly from front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) vertebrae, the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean-shaped and much wider from side to side than from top to bottom. In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E
5|$|Jali are pierced stone screens with {{regularly}} repeating patterns. They <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> Indo-Islamic architecture, {{for example}} in the Mughal dynasty buildings at Fatehpur Sikri and the Taj Mahal. The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room dividers, providing privacy but allowing in air and light. Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India. The use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards {{and the need for}} security. Modern, simplified jali walls, for example made with pre-moulded clay or cement blocks, have been popularised by the architect Laurie Baker. Pierced windows in girih style are sometimes found elsewhere in the Islamic world, such as in windows of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E

5|$|Kerala cuisine has a {{multitude}} of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day. A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, {{in one form or}} the other (idli, puttu, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada. These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.|$|E
5|$|Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) {{date from}} the Renaissance. Most of them have oriel windows that <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey {{and it has a}} large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a {{beautiful}} oriel that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.|$|E
5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba <b>are</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not}} yet {{developed}} these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E
