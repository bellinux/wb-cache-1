5|$|Both leagues play a 143-game regular season, {{after which}} the top three teams in each league compete <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in a {{two-stage}} playoff. In the First Stage, the teams that finish the regular season with the second- and third-best records play {{one another in a}} best-of-three series. The winners of these three-game series advance to the Final Stage to face each league's regular-season champion in a six-game series, which the regular-season champion starts with a one-game advantage.

The signatories {{undertook}} {{to preserve their}} common frontiers, to consult together in all matters of common interest and to commit no aggression <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> territory. The treaty united the Afghan king's call for greater Oriental-Middle Eastern cooperation, Reza Shah's goal in securing relations with Turkey that would help Iran free itself from Soviet and British influence, and Mustafa Kemal's foreign policy of securing stability in the region. The immediate outcome was to deter Mussolini from adventures in the region.|$|R
5|$|Another {{civil war}} {{had begun in}} Uruguay which pitted its {{political}} parties <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties.

5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fingleton {{enlisted in}} the {{military}} during World War II and was eventually sent to work on media matters for Prime Minister John Curtin {{and one of his}} predecessors, Billy Hughes. After the war, Fingleton worked as a political correspondent in Canberra and commentated on cricket during the summer months in Australia and England. He was a prolific author, {{regarded as one of the}} finest and most stylish cricket writers of his time, producing many books. Fingleton was known for his forthright opinions and willingness to criticise, and his cricket reports were published by newspapers in several countries. He was known for his ongoing feud with Bradman—the pair repeatedly spoke out <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> judgement and play on the field long after they retired.|$|R

5000|$|Susan Dupont Petigru King-Bowen (24 October 1824 - December 1875) was a 19th-century socialite, realist, {{fiction writer}} and novelist. Her work, which {{included}} Busy Moments of an Idle Woman (1853), Lily: A Novel (1855), Sylvia’s World: Crimes Which the Law Does Not Reach (1859), and Gerald Gray’s Wife (1864), focused on subversive portrayals of South Carolina aristocracy, {{in which men}} toyed with women’s affections, women plotted <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another’s</b> best interests, and mothers forced daughters to choose wealth over romance. Due to her lack of in-text references to the American Civil War, slavery or the abolitionist movement, Sue’s work has been widely ignored among critics. It is only recently, {{as part of a}} renewed interest in 19th-century women writers, that her writing has begun to receive critical attention.|$|R

5|$|The Castle Doctrine is a 2014 {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Jason Rohrer for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux via Valve Corporation's Steam platform. The game was released on January 29, 2014 for all platforms and is available as public domain software on sourceforge.

5|$|The {{male and}} female {{dichotomy}} of polar opposites with the former oppressing the latter at all times is refuted in the Indian context because it was men who initiated social reform movements against various social evils.

Here women are pitted <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Not all women are powerless at all times.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire loomed, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to {{the isolation of the}} farms and villages. Denonville was quoted as saying “If we have a war, nothing can save the country but a miracle of God,”.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 film GoldenEye, Bean portrayed James Bond's nemesis Alec Trevelyan (MI6's 006). He {{played the}} weak-stomached Spence in Ronin (1998), a wife-beating ex-con in Essex Boys (2000), and a malevolent kidnapper/jewel thief in Don't Say a Word (2001). He was also widely {{recognised}} as villainous treasure hunter Ian Howe in National Treasure, {{and played a}} villainous scientist in The Island (2005).

5|$|In the {{interest}} of strengthening the defenses of the kingdom, Andriamasinavalona divided his realm into four quadrants to be ruled by his four favorite sons. This decision had the opposite effect, however; each was interested in expanding his own realm, prompting one son to kidnap the king and hold him hostage for seven years. After the king's eventual release, he famously committed a mock human sacrifice to re-sanctify his authority. Upon his death, Andriamasinavalona's sons launched military campaigns <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> to seize each other's territories, triggering 77 years of civil war in Imerina. In Madagascar today, Andriamasinavalona's reign is remembered as a golden age of justice, harmony and prosperity.|$|E
40|$|We study cascades of {{failures}} {{in a network}} of interdependent finan-cial organizations: how discontinuous changes in asset values (e. g., defaults and shutdowns) trigger further failures, and how this depends on network structure. Integration (greater dependence on counterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per orga-nization) have different, nonmonotonic effects {{on the extent of}} cas-cades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting cascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are better insured <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another’s</b> failures. Integration also faces trade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less sensitivity to own investments. Finally, we illustrate the model with data on European debt cross-holdings. (JEL D 85, F 15, F 34, F 36, F 65, G 15, G 32, G 33, G 38) Globalization brings with it increased financial interdependencies among many kinds of organizations—governments, central banks, investment banks, firms, etc. — that hold each other’s shares, debts, and other obligations.

5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> so that they could be heard for a like distance.

30|$|In {{financial}} {{network topology}} research, Eboli (2004) used a graph-theoretic {{representation of a}} financial network to model the flow of losses and its impacts on default contagion among firms.

They found that diversification connects the network initially, permitting cascades to travel; but as it increases, organizations become better insured <b>against</b> <b>one</b> <b>another’s</b> failures. Network topology {{can also be used}} for study the resilience against systemic risk of financial networks. Amini et al. (2010) proposed a simulation-free framework for stress testing the resilience of a financial network against external shocks that affect balance sheets. Roukny et al.

They analyzed the interplay of several crucial drivers, i.e., network topology, banks’ capital ratios, market illiquidity, and random vs targeted shocks. Topology was found to have effects only when the market is illiquid. Moreover, Markose et al. (2012)) studied the credit default swaps (CDS) problem by modeling it as a financial network.|$|R
