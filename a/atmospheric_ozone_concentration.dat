The model included anthropogenic molecular chlorine emissions, anthropogenic hypochlorous acid emissions from cooling towers and swimming pools, and chlorine released from sea-salt aerosols. The release of chlorine emissions from sea-salt aerosols was modeled using heterogeneous reactions involving chloride ions in aerosols and three gas-phase species. The gas-phase chlorine chemistry was combined with the Carbon Bond Mechanism and incorporated into the Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system. Air quality model simulations were performed for July 2001 and the results obtained with and without chlorine emissions were analyzed.

40|$|Net photosynthesis, dark respiration, {{chlorophyll}} concentrations {{and growth}} were determined for Rumex patientia L. exposed to UV-B radiation corresponding to reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The hypothesis of whether reciprocity is maintained in {{the response of}} R. patientia to polychromatic UV-B radiation was tested. On {{the basis of the}} relationships derived from these studies, a simulation model was developed for the prediction of photosynthesis and growth of R. patientia exposed to UV-B radiation corresponding to any <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> reduction. Photosynthetic rates were found to be depressed after two hours exposure to UV-B irradiance simulating a 0. 18 atm•cm ozone column when the sun is at 30 ° from the zenith. During this initial exposure period, partial stomatal closure was implicated in the suppression of photosynthesis. However, after one day exposure, substantial increases in photosynthetic resistances apart from stomatal diffusion resistance occurred in the UV-irradiated plants and no differences in stomatal diffusion resistance were apparent between UV-irradiated and control plants. Dark respiration rates were slightly higher in those plants exposed to UV radiation. Leaf expansion of R. patientia was substantially repressed but only during the initial few days of exposure. Thereafter, leaf expansion was similar in the UV-irradiated and control plants. A reduction in total plant dry weight and leaf area of approximately 50 percent occurred after 22 days treatment while chlorophyll concentrations remained unaltered. Time of leaf initiation was shawm to be delayed in those plants exposed to UV-B radiation. Leaf longevity was decreased with increased UV radiation but accelerated whole-plant senescence and death was not observed. Photosynthetic rates determined through the ontogeny of the third leaf of R. patientia exposed to four levels of UV irradiance were found to be depressed {{as a function of the}} accumulated biologically effective UV irradiation. Thus, reciprocity was demonstrated between 6350 and 3175 J biologically effective UV irradiation. Results of the simultion model showed that under reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations,</b> suppression of photosynthesis and leaf growth would be more severe during mid-sunnner (i. e. June) than would occur during the March to early May period, This results from smaller solar angles from the zenith and lower prevailing <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> prevalent during June. A validation test of the model was made with photosynthetic data obtained during a field study with R. patientia exposed to UV-B radiation corresponding to a 38 percent <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> reduction (0. 18 atm•cm when the sun was at 30 ° from the zenith). This validation test showed a reasonable correspondence between the measured and predicted photosynthetic rates. R. patientia was selected as the test species for this study because (1) it is reasonably sensitive to UV radiation as determined in preliminary studies evaluating approximately 20 native and agricultural plant species, (2) it is normally exposed to full sunlight in · its natural habitat, and (3) individual leaves are relatively long - lived (about 60 days) and are not normally shaded by other leaves of the same plant. Although this species probably represents one of the more sensitive plants to UV radiation, it would be this group of sensitive plants that would be initially affected under conditions of reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> If more resistant plants with long-lived plant parts also accumulate UV radiation damage as was shown to occur in R. patientia, over sufficient periods of time even these species might be significantly impacted under conditions of reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of ozone {{in the atmosphere}} has become increasingly important {{over the past two}} decades. Significant increases of <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the lower atmosphere, or troposphere, and decreases in the upper atmosphere, or stratosphere, have been attributed to man-made causes. High <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the troposphere pose a health hazard to plants and animals and can add to global warming. On the other hand, ozone in the stratosphere serves as a protective barrier against strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Man-made CFC's (chlorofluorocarbons) act as a catalyst with a free oxygen atom and an ozone molecule to produce two oxygen molecules therefore depleting the protective layer of ozone in the stratosphere. The beneficial and harmful effects of ozone require the study of ozone creation and destruction processes in the atmosphere. Therefore, to provide an accurate model of these processes, an ozone lidar system must be able to be used frequently with as large a measurement range as possible. Various methods can be used to measure <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> These include different airborne and balloon measurements, solar occulation satellite techniques, and the use of lasers in lidar (high detection and ranging,) systems to probe the atmosphere. Typical devices such as weather balloons can only measure within the direct vicinity of the instrument and are therefore used infrequently.

40|$|Metabolism in an {{environment}} containing of 21 % oxygen has {{a high risk of}} oxidative damage due to the formation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, plants have evolved an antioxidant system consisting of metabolites and enzymes that either directly scavenge ROS or recycle the antioxidant metabolites. Ozone is a temporally dynamic molecule that is both naturally occurring as well as {{an environment}}al pollutant that is predicted to increase in concentration in the future as anthropogenic precursor emissions rise. It has been hypothesized that any elevation in <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> will cause increased oxidative stress in plants and therefore enhanced subsequent antioxidant metabolism, but evidence for this response is variable. Along with increasing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations,</b> <b>atmospheric</b> carbon dioxide concentration is also rising and is predicted to continue rising in the future. The effect of elevated carbon dioxide concentrations on antioxidant metabolism varies among different studies in the literature. Therefore, the question of how antioxidant metabolism will be affected in the most realistic future atmosphere, with increased carbon dioxide <b>concentration</b> and increased <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration,</b> has yet to be answered, and is the subject of my thesis research. First, in order to capture as much of the variability in the antioxidant system as possible, I developed a suite of high-throughput quantitative assays for a variety of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes. I optimized these assays for Glycine max (soybean), {{one of the most important}} food crops in the world. These assays provide accurate, rapid and high-throughput measures of both the general and specific antioxidant action of plant tissue extracts. Second, I investigated how growth at either elevated carbon dioxide concentration or chronic elevated <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> altered antioxidant metabolism, and the ability of soybean to respond to an acute oxidative stress in a controlled environment study. I found that growth at chronic elevated <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> increased the antioxidant capacity of leaves, but was unchanged or only slightly increased following an acute oxidative stress, suggesting that growth at chronic elevated <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> primed the antioxidant system. Growth at high carbon dioxide concentration decreased the antioxidant capacity of leaves, increased the response of the existing antioxidant enzymes to an acute oxidative stress, but dampened and delayed the transcriptional response, suggesting an entirely different regulation of the antioxidant system. Third, I tested the findings from the controlled environment study in a field setting by investigating the response of the soybean antioxidant system to growth at elevated carbon dioxide <b>concentration,</b> chronic elevated <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> and the combination of elevated carbon dioxide <b>concentration</b> and elevated <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration.</b> In this study, I confirmed that growth at elevated carbon dioxide concentration decreased specific components of antioxidant metabolism in the field. I also verified that increasing <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> is highly correlated with increases in the metabolic and genomic components of antioxidant metabolism, regardless of carbon dioxide concentration environment, but that the response to increasing <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> was dampened at elevated carbon dioxide concentration. In addition, I found evidence suggesting an up regulation of respiratory metabolism at higher <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration,</b> which would supply energy and carbon for detoxification and repair of cellular damage. These results consistently support the conclusion that growth at elevated carbon dioxide concentration decreases antioxidant metabolism while growth at elevated <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> increases antioxidant metabolism...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} solar {{radiation}} management (SRM) techniques has been proposed to counter anthropogenic climate change. Here, we examine the potential effects of stratospheric sulfate aerosols and solar insolation reduction on tropospheric ozone and ozone at Earth's surface. Ozone is a key air pollutant, which can produce respiratory diseases and crop damage. Using {{a version of the}} Community Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research that includes comprehensive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, we model both stratospheric sulfur injection and solar irradiance reduction schemes, with the aim of achieving equal levels of surface cooling relative to the Representative Concentration Pathway 6. 0 scenario. This allows us to compare the impacts of sulfate aerosols and solar dimming on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Despite nearly identical global mean surface temperatures for the two SRM approaches, solar insolation reduction increases global average surface <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations,</b> while sulfate injection decreases it. A fundamental difference between the two geoengineering schemes is the importance of heterogeneous reactions in the photochemical ozone balance with larger stratospheric sulfate abundance, resulting in increased ozone depletion in mid- and high latitudes. This reduces the net transport of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere and thus is a key driver of the overall decrease in surface ozone. At the same time, the change in stratospheric ozone alters the tropospheric photochemical environment due to enhanced ultraviolet radiation. A shared factor among both SRM scenarios is decreased chemical ozone loss due to reduced tropospheric humidity. Under insolation reduction, this is the dominant factor giving rise to the global surface ozone increase. Regionally, both surface ozone increases and decreases are found for both scenarios; that is, SRM would affect regions of the world differently in terms of air pollution. In conclusion, surface ozone and tropospheric chemistry would likely be affected by SRM, but the overall effect is strongly dependent on the SRM scheme. Due to the health and economic impacts of surface ozone, all these impacts should be taken into account in evaluations of possible consequences of SRM...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles {{retrieved from}} measurements made with two ground-based millimetre-wave radiometers in Kiruna, Sweden. The instruments are the Kiruna Microwave Radiometer (KIMRA) and the Millimeter wave Radiometer 2  (MIRA  2). The ozone concentration profiles are retrieved using an optimal estimation inversion technique, and they cover an altitude range of [*]∼[*] 16 – 54  km, with an altitude resolution of, at best, 8  km. The KIMRA and MIRA  2 measurements are compared to each other, to measurements from balloon-borne ozonesonde measurements at Sodankylä, Finland, and to measurements {{made by the}} Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) aboard the Aura satellite. KIMRA has a correlation of 0. 82, but shows a low bias, {{with respect to the}} ozonesonde data, and MIRA  2 shows a smaller magnitude low bias and a 0. 98 correlation coefficient. Both radiometers are in general agreement {{with each other and with}} MLS data, showing high correlation coefficients, but there are differences between measurements that are not explained by random errors. An oscillatory bias with a peak of approximately ± 1  ppmv is identified in the KIMRA ozone profiles over an altitude range of [*]∼[*] 18 – 35  km, and is believed to be due to baseline wave features that are present in the spectra. A time series analysis of KIMRA ozone for winters 2008 – 2013 shows the existence of a local wintertime minimum in the ozone profile above Kiruna. The measurements have been ongoing at Kiruna since 2002 and late 2012 for KIMRA and MIRA  2, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. It is also {{available}} online at: [URL] risks caused by exposure to ground level ozone have significantly increased during recent years. One main producer of ozone is the photochemical reaction between volatile organic components and the anthropogenic nitrogen oxides created by vehicular traffic. Therefore the measurement and monitoring of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> levels is important. In this {{paper we propose a}} study of the use of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in modelling the concentration of ground level ozone. The prediction is based on concentrations of seven gases (NO 2, SO 2, and BTX (Benzene, Toluene, o-,m-,p-Xylene) and six meteorological parameters (ambient temperature, air pressure, wind speed, wind direction, global radiation, and relative humidity). The analysis of the results indicates that accurate models for the concentration of ground level ozone can be derived with the best performance accuracies indicated by the Ensemble Learning Algorithms. The investigation carried out compares the use of different machine learning classifiers and show that the Ensembleclassifier Bagging performs superior to standard single classifiers, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, popularly used in literature. In addition, we study the performance of the meta-classifier Bagging when different base classifiers are used in optimised configurations and compare the results thus obtained. The research conducted bridges an existing research gap in big-data analytics related to environment pollution prediction, where present research is largely limited to using standard learning algorithms such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines often available within popular commercial software packages...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue {{to lack of}} {{observational}} {{studies on}} greenhouse gases in Malaysia, most studies in this field were carried out based on ground station data. These studies did not utilize satellite data from the equatorial area. Satellite remote sensing {{is one of the}} most effective approaches for greenhouse gas distribution monitoring on a global scale. As such, satellite remote sensing exhibits a very high spatial and temporal resolution. Variations of ozone concentrations in Peninsular Malaysia were observed and investigated by means of data retrieved from the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY). The aim of this study was to determine the monthly and seasonal ozone concentrations in Peninsular Malaysia from January 2003 to December 2009. We utilized total column ozone at level 2 of the WFMD version 1. 0. A spatial resolution value of 1 °× 1. 25 ° was used. Analysis indicated that the five selected sites exhibited strong seasonal <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> variations. These variations resulted from the significant differences between the northeast monsoon (NEM) and the southwest monsoon (SWM). As the NEM prevails, cold air breaks out from Siberia and spreads to the equatorial region in the form of northeasterly cold surge winds. These winds manifest in low–level anticyclones over Southeast Asia. Inversely, the air masses from the southwest contribute to long–range air pollution. During SWM, the transport of atmospheric ozone by wind is associated with biomass burning in Sumatra, Indonesia. HYSPLIT was also utilized to identify the air pollutant transport between NEM and SWM toward Peninsular Malaysia. Comparisons were made between the ozone data from five sites in 2009. Data were retrieved from SCIAMACHY and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The relative difference average of the ozone data measured by SCIAMACHY and AIRS was approximately 6 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} chemical-dynamical-radiative {{model of}} the middle atmosphere is used to investigate the potential changes of temperature, ozone, and other chemical constituents in response tovariations in the solar ultraviolet flux, associated with the solar rotation (27 days) and the solar cycle (11 years). The model reproduces satisfactorily the response (amplitude and phase) to the 27 -day forcing of ozone and temperature in the stratosphere but does not properly explain the ozone and temperature r sponses of opposite sign observed near 70 km altitude. The change in the ozone column abundance associated with the 27 -day solar forcing {{is estimated to be}} less than 0. 5 %. Variations in middle and upper <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> and temperatures induced by solar variations on the ll-year time scale are not negligible compared to changes produced as a result of human activities over the same period of time. The calculated change in the ozone column abundance from solar minimum to solar maximum conditions is of the order of 1. 1 - 1. 3 % in the tropics and increases with latitude, especially in winter, to reach up to 1. 5 - 1. 7 % in the polar regions. There are large unexplained ifferences between the calculated and observed stratospheric responses. For example, in the photochemically controlled region of the upper stratosphere, the model seems to underestimate the ozone response by more than a factor 2. In addition, the negative temperature and ozone responses observed in the lower stratosphere cannot be reproduced by the model. Potential dynamical feedbacks exist, but reliable data sets covering a period longer than one solar cycle have to become available before this problem can adequately be addressed. 1...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Analizar la relación entre las concentraciones ambientales de partículas de diámetro OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} of <= 10 µm particles (PM 10) and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations,</b> with the daily number of emergency visits due to asthma and acute respiratory diseases, among children aged under 15, living in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 1999, an ecologic study was conducted. Atmospheric data {{were obtained from the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), from eight monitoring stations located in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, and El Paso, Texas. From July 1997 to December 1998, data from emergency room visits for respiratory illness were abstracted from existing medical records of two Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) hospitals in Ciudad Juarez. Diagnoses were classified into two groups: a) asthma, and b) upper respiratory infections (URI), according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 9 and/or IDC- 10). Statistical analysis was carried out using the Poisson regression time series method. RESULTS: During the study period, the mean 24 -hour PM 10 level was 34. 46 µg/m³ (SD= 17. 99) and the mean ozone level was 51. 60 ppb (SD= 20. 70). The model shows that an increase of 20 µg/m³ in the mean 24 -hour exposure to PM 10 was related to an increase of 4. 97 % (95 % CI 0. 97 - 9. 13) in emergency visits for asthma, with a 5 -day lag, as well as to an increase of 9 % (95 % CI 1. 8 - 16. 8) when a cumulative 5 -day exposure was considered. URI increased 2. 95 % as a cause of emergency room visits, for each 20 µg/m³ increase in the mean 24 -hour exposure to PM 10. The impact of PM 10 on emergency visits for asthma was greater on days with ozone ambient levels exceeded 49 ppb (median value). CONCLUSIONS: A positive association was found between environmental PM 10 and <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> and the daily number of emergency room visits due to asthma and acute respiratory diseases, even with levels lower than the Mexican standard levels. Also, a synergic effect between PM 10 and O 3 was found...|$|R
