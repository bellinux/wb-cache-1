"Well, then," [...] said Sir Percy Blakeney in that optimistic, light-hearted yet supremely {{authoritative}} tone {{of which}} he held the secret, [...] "you and Rosette remain here {{and wait for the}} gendarmes. When they come, say nothing; behave with absolute meekness, and let them search your place from end to end.

60|$|R.C. Well, I did not <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> {{father to}} extort this confession; I pray God give you repentance for it, and forgive you that {{and all your}} other sins; but I asked you, because I see that, though you have not much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are in things that are good; that you have known more of {{religion}} a great deal than you have practised.|$|E

No: I first {{discovered}} his talent in that direction at Palermo, where I surprised him in an animated discourse with the dark-eyed daughter of an innkeeper there. That was the first conversation in Italian I succeeded in following. A week later I could understand the language almost as well as he. However, dont let us waste the whole afternoon talking stuff. I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> mother. I should greatly like to call upon her; but she has never made me any sign since my marriage; and Mrs. Leith Fairfax tells me that she never allows my name to be mentioned to her.

6000|$|... 'Why, my dear,' said he, 'I'll confess {{the whole}} scheme {{to you as}} I had laid it; I purposed here to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> estate, as <b>you</b> see I did, and when you, as I expected you would, had entered into some account with me of the particulars, I would have made an excuse to you to have put off our voyage to Ireland for some time, and to have gone first towards London.|$|R

Television critic Nancy Banks-Smith {{wrote in}} The Guardian: [...] "After {{a year of}} rebuffs, Deer ran Dr Wakefield to ground at an Indianapolis conference on autism. The camera took {{a bit of a}} buffet and Dr Wakefield left with Deer following, shouting: 'We have very important questions to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> research and your commercial ambitions, sir! Will you stand your ground and answer?' If this was hounding, and it was, Dr Wakefield had only himself to blame for running away".|$|E

If the character doesn't set boundaries and Emily visits, {{it turns out that}} Emily and the character ended up hooking up, and Emily feels like she was taken advantage of when she was vulnerable. If the character does set boundaries and they don't hook up, Emily asks if the character had feelings for her when she visited and why they didn't make a move. Alternatively, if you choose to not let Emily visit, she will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> new friends. The conversation is awkward and distant, with Emily eventually leaving due to her discomfort, feeling too weird to continue.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, {{someone has}} to {{nominate}} you - based on their experience of working you {{on at least two}} bands within the last year. The station you are working may <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> possible interest in joining the club, or your nomination may come out of the blue when a letter arrives from George Eddowes, G3NOH, the Membership Secretary. Upon accepting the nomination you are then added to the ‘Additional Nominations’ List, which means that all FOC members know you are seeking further sponsorship. You then have to find a further four sponsors within six months of nomination. Sponsors must come from at least two continents, with no more than three from any one continent, and at least one must be from the UK. All sponsors must have a QSO with you on at least two bands {{in order to be able}} to support your nomination. In recent years, just over half of those nominated have gone on to attain membership.|$|E

[...] Gay told Yahoo!7's writer that Paul [...] "treats Frances like a lady and I think that's quite a new sensation for her".

Jantzen (2005) distinguishes the English Canadian, meaning [...] "someone whose family has been in Canada for multiple generations", and the French Canadien, used to refer to descendants of the original settlers of New France in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E

Until November last Bordeaux, and indeed {{the whole of the}} Gironde, was moderate. All our deputies--who have now, as perhaps you know, either fallen on the scaffold or been hunted down like wild beasts--belonged to that party. They were earnest reformers, and were prominent among the leaders of the Revolution. They went with the stream, up to a certain point. They voted for most of the sanguinary decrees, although in time they strove to mitigate the horrors inflicted by the extreme party; but after a long conflict the latter, supported by the mob of Paris, obtained the ascendency, and the Girondists underwent the same fate that had befallen so many others. For myself, I cannot pity them. They were all men of standing and of intelligence but, without perceiving the terrible results that must follow, they unchained the mob and became its victims.|$|R
