30|$|Hostetter (2011) {{also found}} that {{communicative}} effects of gesture were smaller when there was more overlap in the information expressed in gesture <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> <b>and</b> larger when the information expressed in gesture <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> was non-redundant. Teachers sometimes express non-redundant information in gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> (e.g., Goldin-Meadow, Kim & Singer, 1999), and in an experimental study, Singer and Goldin-Meadow (2005) found beneficial effects of teacher gestures on children’s learning about mathematical equivalence, but only for lessons in which the teacher’s gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> were non-redundant, <b>and</b> not for lessons in which the teacher’s gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> were redundant. These findings align with Hostetter’s (2011) conclusion that when speakers express redundant information in gesture <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> gesture matters less for listeners’ comprehension.|$|R
5000|$|Vygotsky's {{theory on}} {{cognitive}} development, known as Vygotsky's theory of interchanging roles, {{supports the idea}} that social and individual development stems from the processes of dialectical interaction and function unification. Lev Vygotsky believed that before two years of age, both <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> thought develop in differing ways along with differing functions. The idea that relationship between thought <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> is ever-changing, supports Vygotsky's claims. Vygotsky's theory claims that thought <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> have different genetic roots. And {{at the age of}} two, an child's thought <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> collide, <b>and</b> the relationship between thought <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> shifts. Thought then becomes verbal <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> then becomes rational.|$|R
40|$|Gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> {{are mostly}} well-aligned. However, during {{difficult}} tasks, gesture-speech mismatches occur. This study investigates the dynamic interplay between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> as 12 children perform a hands-on air pressure task. We applied Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis {{on the time}} series of understanding levels displayed in gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech.</b> We focused on: 1) the temporal relation between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> 2) the relative strength {{and direction of the}} coupling between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> (overall <b>and</b> for different levels of understanding), and 3) the relations between recurrence measures and some child characteristics. Strength, direction, and timing of the coupling between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> were different for younger and older children, as well as for children who performed well on math and past tasks, or on a language task. We suggest that the observed asymmetric dynamic attunement reflects the simultaneous and at times competing coordination of synergies for gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> instead of a disembodied cognitive capacity...|$|R

5|$|Battersea Council {{grew tired}} of the controversy. A new Conservative council was elected in November 1909 amid talk of {{removing}} the statue. There were protests in support of it, and the 500-strong Brown Dog memorial defence committee was established. Twenty thousand people signed a petition, and 1,500 attended a rally in February 1910 addressed by Lind af Hageby, Charlotte Despard and Liberal MP George Greenwood. There were more demonstrations in central London <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> in Hyde Park, with supporters wearing masks of dogs.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{three-dimensional}} model of affect, {{we compared the}} affective consequences of manipulating intensity, rate, and pitch height in music <b>and</b> <b>speech.</b> Participants rated 64 music <b>and</b> 64 <b>speech</b> excerpts on valence (pleasant-unpleasant), energy arousal (awake-tired), and tension arousal (tense-relaxed). For music <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> loud excerpts were judged as more pleasant, energetic, and tense than soft excerpts. Manipulations of rate had overlapping effects on music <b>and</b> <b>speech.</b> Fast music <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> were judged as having greater energy than slow music <b>and</b> <b>speech.</b> However, whereas fast speech was judged as less pleasant than slow speech, fast music was judged as having greater tension than slow music. Pitch height had opposite consequences for music <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> with high-pitched speech but lowpitched music associated with higher ratings of valence (more pleasant). Interactive effects on judgments were also observed. We discuss {{similarities and differences between}} vocal and musical communication of affect, and the need to distinguish between two types of arousal: energy and tension. 11 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, <b>and</b> <b>speeches.</b> Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{continued}} {{to have a strong}} association with the University of Toronto's Massey College as a continuing senior fellow and senior resident. Her many activities include encouraging young women to pursue careers in science, promoting peace and social justice, and speaking and writing about the social effects of science and technology. Many of her articles <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> on pacifism, feminism, technology and teaching are collected in The Ursula Franklin Reader published in 2006.

5|$|Leaving Russia before Reed, {{who wanted}} {{to report on the}} Bolshevik debate about Russian {{participation}} in the war with Germany, Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918. She found Greenwich Village much changed by the war; old friends had moved, rents had gone up, and tourists were replacing bohemians. Under government pressure, The Masses had shut down. Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel, Bryant wrote articles about the October Revolution <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.|$|E
40|$|Foundations of Voice <b>and</b> <b>Speech</b> Quality Perception {{starts out}} with the {{fundamental}} question of: "How do listeners perceive voice <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> quality <b>and</b> how can these processes be modeled?" Any quantitative answers require measurements. This is natural for physical quantities but harder to imagine for perceptual measurands. This book approaches the problem by actually identifying major perceptual dimensions of voice <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> quality perception, defining units wherever possible and offering paradigms to position these dimensions into a structural skeleton of perceptual <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> voice quality. The {{emphasis is placed on}} voice <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> quality assessment of systems in artificial scenarios. Many scientific fields are involved. This book bridges the gap between two quite diverse fields, engineering and humanities, and establishes the new research area of Voice <b>and</b> <b>Speech</b> Quality Perception...|$|R

5|$|Radio {{became popular}} in Germany during the 1930s, with over 70 percent of {{households}} owning a receiver by 1939, {{more than any other}} country. Radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable by July 1933. Propaganda <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.|$|E

40|$|Music <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> {{are complex}} sound streams with {{hierarchical}} rules of temporal organization that become elaborated over time. Here, we use functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} to measure brain activity patterns in 20 right-handed nonmusicians as they listened to natural and temporally reordered musical <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> stimuli matched for familiarity, emotion, and valence. Heart rate variability and mean respiration rates were simultaneously measured and were found not to differ between musical <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> stimuli. Although the same manipulation of temporal structure elicited brain activation level differences of similar magnitude for both music <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> stimuli, multivariate classification analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns of brain responses in the 2 domains. Distributed neuronal populations that included the inferior frontal cortex, the posterior and anterior superior and middle temporal gyri, and the auditory brainstem classified temporal structure manipulations in music <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> with significant levels of accuracy. While agreeing with previous findings that music <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> processing share neural substrates, this work shows that temporal structure in the 2 domains is encoded differently, highlighting a fundamental dissimilarity in how the same neural resources are deployed...|$|R

5|$|Through {{his actions}} <b>and</b> <b>speeches,</b> {{and because he}} was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser {{inspired}} several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world. He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders. The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their own citizens.|$|E
5|$|After he left office, Harrison {{visited the}} World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in June 1893. After the Expo, Harrison {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Indianapolis. Harrison had been elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in 1882, and was elected as commander (president) of the Ohio Commandery on May 3, 1893. For a few months in 1894, Harrison lived in San Francisco, California, where he gave law lectures at Stanford University. In 1896, some of Harrison's friends in the Republican party tried to convince him to seek the presidency again, but he declined. He traveled around the nation making appearances <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> in support of William McKinley's candidacy for president.|$|E

5|$|In one of {{her last}} public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The {{committee}} issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims. Following the report's release, she also testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, {{she was unable to}} accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on The Today Show <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal (from the National Audubon Society), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical Society), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|E
5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} {{this violence}} or {{participated in it}} first-hand, and publicly distanced himself from it. His published articles <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> rarely called for executions, but he regularly did so in his coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.|$|E
40|$|Most people acquire {{literacy}} skills with remarkable ease, {{even though the}} human brain is not evolutionarily adapted to this relatively new cultural phenomenon. Associations between letters <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> sounds {{form the basis of}} reading in alphabetic scripts. We investigated the functional neuroanatomy of the integration of letters <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> sounds using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Letters <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> sounds were presented unimodally and bimodally in congruent or incongruent combinations. Analysis of single-subject data and group data aligned on the basis of individual cortical anatomy revealed that letters <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> sounds are integrated in heteromodal superior temporal cortex. Interestingly, responses to speech sounds in a modality-specific region of the early auditory cortex were modified by simultaneously presented letters. These results suggest that efficient processing of culturally defined associations between letters <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> sounds relies on neural mechanisms similar to those naturally evolved for integrating audiovisual speech...|$|R
40|$|As {{children}} learn {{they use their}} speech to express words and their hands to gesture. This study investigates the interplay between real-time gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> as children construct cognitive understanding during a hands-on science task. 12 children (M = 6, F = 6) from Kindergarten (n = 5) and first grade (n = 7) participated in this study. Each verbal utterance and gesture during the task were coded, on a complexity scale derived from dynamic skill theory. To explore the interplay between <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> gestures, we applied a cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) to the two coupled time series of the skill levels of verbalizations and gestures. The analysis focused on (1) the temporal relation between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> (2) the relative strength {{and direction of the}} interaction between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> (3) the relative strength and direction between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> for different levels of understanding, and (4) relations between CRQA measures and other child characteristics. The results show that older and younger children differ in the (temporal) asymmetry in the gestures–speech interaction. For younger children, the balance leans more toward gestures leading speech in time, while the balance leans more toward speech leading gestures for older children. Secondly, at the group level, speech attracts gestures in a more dynamically stable fashion than vice versa, and this asymmetry in gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> extends to lower and higher understanding levels. Yet, for older children, the mutual coupling between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> is more dynamically stable regarding the higher understanding levels. Gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> are more synchronized in time as children are older. A higher score on schools’ language tests is related to speech attracting gestures more rigidly and more asymmetry between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> only for the less difficult understanding levels. A higher score on math or past science tasks is related to less asymmetry between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech.</b> The picture that emerges from our analyses suggests that the relation between gestures, <b>speech</b> <b>and</b> cognition is more complex than previously thought. We suggest that temporal differences and asymmetry in influence between gestures <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> arise from simultaneous coordination of synergies...|$|R
40|$|This study compares affective piano {{performance}} with speech production {{from the perspective}} of dynamics: unlike previous research, this study uses finger force and articulatory effort as indexes reflecting the dynamics of affective piano performance <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> production respectively. Moreover, for the first time physical constraints such as piano fingerings <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> articulatory distance are included due to their potential contribution to different patterns of dynamics. A piano performance experiment <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> production experiment were conducted in four emotions: anger, fear, happiness and sadness. The results show that in both piano performance <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> production, anger <b>and</b> happiness generally have high dynamics while sadness has the lowest dynamics, with fear in the middle. Fingerings interact with fear in the piano experiment and articulatory distance interacts with anger in the speech experiment, i. e., large physical constraints produce significantly higher dynamics than small physical constraints in piano performance under the condition of fear <b>and</b> in <b>speech</b> production under the condition of anger. Using production experiments, this study firstly supports previous perception studies on relations between affective music <b>and</b> <b>speech.</b> Moreover, this is the first study to show quantitative evidence for the importance of considering motor aspects such as dynamics in comparing music performance <b>and</b> <b>speech</b> production in which motor mechanisms play a crucial role...|$|R
