40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} model-based Plug and Play Process Control, a novel {{concept for}} process control, which allows a model-based control {{system to be}} reconfigured when a sensor or an actuator is plugged into a controlled process. The work reported in this paper focuses on composing a monolithic model from models of a process to be controlled and the actuators and sensors connected to the process, and propagation of tuning criteria from these sub-models, thereby accommodating automatic controller synthesis using existing methods. The developed method is successfully tested on an industrial case study from Danfoss A/S, where the process to be controlled is the indoor temperature of a house and the actuators acting on the process are a floor heating system and <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>radiator.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNowadays, European {{policies}} are promoting low energy buildings {{because of the}} high amount of energy consumption of the building sector. Phase change materials (PCM) have been studied in building implementation as a passive system to reduce the energy demand. Based in the experience obtained in the experimental set-up of Puigverd de Lleida (Spain), this paper pretends to analyze experimentally the PCM performance in a scenario with internal thermal gains. The experiments were done in three different cubicles with the same internal dimensions. The selection of the constructive systems used in these three cubicles allows the authors to evaluate the impact of using PCM in a typical Mediterranean building. A domestic heat pump for summer and <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>radiator</b> for winter were installed to control the internal temperature of the cubicles. The results of summer period experiments show that the PCM cubicle stored the heat produced by the internal loads limiting the heat dissipation to the outer environment. Therefore, the energy consumed by the HVAC system of the PCM cubicle during the cooling period is higher than that of the other cubicles that dissipated the thermal loads according to the thermal resistance of their envelopes. Therefore, the PCM selection should take into account not only the comfort temperature but also the activity and functionality of the building...|$|E

40|$|If {{you have}} access to wood, a wood burning boiler is a cheap way to heat your home, but it is {{certainly}} not the most convenient option. Wood requires many operations and management, which takes time. One way to reduce this workload is to have a modern boiler with automatic ignition. Enertech/CTC has a desire to create an accessory with automatic ignition to a modern wood burning boiler. Today there is no boiler on the market that can ignite firewood automatically without the introduction of paper and sticks. A comfortable ignition with a timer, temperature and GSM control means that the boiler can compete with other modern heating alternatives on the market. During the project we used our knowledge in construction, energy technology and the CAD program Catia V 5. In the process different prototypes were manufactured and tested. The tests gave us ideas for the final design. We finally came to a result in which the wood is ignited by flowing air which is heated by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>radiator.</b> The module can be bought as an accessory and installed in an existing boiler. The report describes the methods we used, from problem definition to final solution and results. The thesis work has been done partly in secrecy so the report will describe some areas limited...|$|E

In this study 13 different particle sources were {{for the first time}} examined in a 32 m 3 full-scale chamber with an air change rate of 1. 7 ± 0. 1 /h. Two different instruments, a condensation particle counter (CPC) and an optical particle counter (OPC) were used to quantitatively determine ultrafine and fine particle emissions, respectively. The CPC measures particles from 0. 02 μm to larger than 1. 0 μm. The OPC was adjusted to measure particle concentrations in eight fractions between 0. 3 and 1. 0 μm. The sources were cigarette side-stream smoke, pure wax candles, scented candles, a vacuum cleaner, an air-freshener spray, a flat iron (with and without steam) on <b>a</b> cotton sheet, <b>electric</b> <b>radiators,</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> stove, <b>a</b> gas stove, and frying meat. The cigarette burning, frying meat, air freshener spray and gas stove showed a particle size distribution that changed over time towards larger particles. In most of the experiments the maximum concentration was reached within a few minutes. Typically, the increase of the particle concentration immediately after activation of the source was more rapid than the decay of the concentration observed after deactivation of the source. The highest observed concentration of ultrafine particles was approximately 241, 000 particles/cm 3 and originated from the combustion of pure wax candles. The weakest generation of ultrafine particles (1. 17 × 107 particles per second) was observed when ironing without steam on a cotton sheet, which resulted in a concentration of 550 particles/cm 3 in the chamber air. The highest generation rate (1. 47 × 1010 particles per second) was observed in the radiator test...|$|R

40|$|Advanced thermal {{management}} systems for internal combustion engines can improve coolant temperature regulation and servomotor power consumption by better regulating the combustion process with multiple electro-mechanical components. The traditional thermostat valve, coolant pump and clutch-driven radiator fan are upgraded with servomotor actuators.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{cooling system}} has unrealized potential to improve {{internal combustion engine}} performance through enhanced coolant temperature control and reduced parasitic losses. Advanced automotive thermal management systems use controllable actuators (e. g., smart thermostat valve, variable speed water pump, and <b>electric</b> <b>radiator</b> fan) that must work in harmony to control engine temperature. One important area of cooling system operation is warm-up, during which fluid flow is regulated between the bypass and radiator loops.

In this paper, four different thermostat configurations have been analyzed, with accompanying linear and nonlinear control algorithms, to investigate warm-up behaviors and thermostat valve operations. The configurations considered include factory, two-way valve, three-way valve, and no valve. Representative experimental testing was conducted on a steam-based thermal bench to examine the effectiveness of each valve configuration in the engine cooling system. The results clearly demonstrate that the three-way valve has the best performance as noted by the excellent warm-up time, temperature tracking, and cooling system power consumption. 1...|$|R
