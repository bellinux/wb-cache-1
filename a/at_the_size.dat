25|$|Magnates of the Commonwealth {{are often}} called the {{aristocracy}} of the Commonwealth but the definition of what constitutes aristocracy differs {{from the rest of}} Europe in that the Magnate families were much more powerful, often comparable to Princes. A good example is the extinct family of Pac that ruled the Duchy of Lithuania in the 17th century. The Pac family had not descended from a Prince, and therefore did not use any title at all. During the partition of the Commonwealth the Pac family received the title of Count. However, when looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the Pac properties and their position in the Commonwealth, a simple Count title seems not adequate to their power and property size that was far beyond imagination of most of the European Lords.|$|E
25|$|Mansa Mahmud IV {{tried to}} take {{advantage}} of the situation with the support of Fulbe and Bambara chiefs. In 1599, the mansa led this army in a march on Battle of Jenné. The rulers of Jenné called on the Moroccan garrison of Arma in Timbuktu for reinforcements. The other obstacle to the mansa's success was his betrayal by a major ally prior to the battle. The reasoning behind this betrayal, according to Mandinka oral traditions was that Mahmud IV did not have the support of Mali's traditional generals, the Farim-Soura and Sankar-Zouma. This major ally of the mansa abandoned him at the last moment and went over to the Moroccans and advised them on what to expect from the mansa's army. Despite their amazement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the mansa's force, the Arma won the battle after a violent bombardment.|$|E

500|$|The Tessarakonteres ( [...] , [...] "forty-rowed"), {{or simply}} [...] "forty" [...] {{was a very}} large {{catamaran}} galley reportedly built in the Hellenistic period by Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt.

According to these descriptions, supported by modern research by Lionel Casson, the enormous size of the vessel made it impractical and it was built only as a prestige vessel, rather than an effective warship. The name [...] "forty" [...] refers not to the number of oars, but to the number of rowers on each column of oars that propelled it, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> described {{it would have been the}} largest ship constructed in antiquity, and probably the largest human-powered vessel ever built.|$|E

500|$|The blotchy swellshark is oviparous, and {{reproduction}} proceeds {{throughout the year}} with no obvious seasonal cycling. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional oviducts. The species {{is thought to be}} relatively prolific, as the ovary contains numerous ova at various stages of development. Pairs of eggs are laid at a time, one per oviduct. Females have been documented producing eggs even after years without male contact, suggesting that {{they may be able to}} store sperm. The purse-shaped egg capsules are relatively large and thick, measuring around [...] long and [...] across. The capsule surface is smooth with lengthwise striations, and opaque cream in color with yellow margins. Long, coiled tendrils extend from the four corners of the capsule. When the embryo is [...] long, the external gills have been lost, the dermal denticles have begun to develop, and light brown saddles are present. The eggs take roughly one year to hatch; newly emerged sharks measure [...] long. From a series of captive rearing experiments, Sho Tanaka reported that hatchling sharks grew in length by up to [...] per day.
