5|$|Sainsbury {{was born}} on 5 July 1851 in Bath, Somerset, the {{youngest}} son of John Popham Sainsbury. He attended Sherborne School, an independent school in north-west Dorset.

He was considered <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> batsman, and often opened the innings for the school.|$|E
5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} Del Piero would have {{as good a}} season, or <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> one, than the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, Del Piero {{announced that he would}} try to keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40. Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free kick to seal a home win against Zenit. On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2–1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.|$|E

The first Persona was {{referred}} to {{at the time as}} a sleeper hit, and the success of it and Eternal Punishment helped establish both Atlus and Megami Tensei in North America. In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of Persona 3 and 4, both of which were highly successful in the region. According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of Persona 3, which was a commercial success and brought the series {{to the attention of the}} mainstream gaming community. Persona 4 received <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> reception. The Persona series' success has allowed Atlus to build a strong player base in the West, contributing to the success of other titles such as Catherine.|$|E
5|$|After {{their first}} round bye, Tennessee faced Mississippi State again. Instead of Tennessee {{starting}} quickly, however, the Bulldogs did, taking a 9–2 lead. At this point though, the Vols went {{on one of}} their runs, this time a 15–2 one. State did not recover from this, and Tennessee advanced to the semi-finals, 88–60. Catchings had a double-double by halftime. In the semi-finals, UT met Vanderbilt for the third time, with <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> performance than the previous two. Catchings again had a double-double by halftime and the team shot 6 of 7 from beyond the three point line, as they advanced to the championship 106–45. The SEC Championship was against Alabama, who had played within seven points of the Lady Vols in their previous match-up. Alabama used the same, slow style they had previously employed, and at the break were only down by three. Tennessee was able to slowly up the lead to ten during the first ten minutes of the second period, eventually reaching a fourteen-point lead, before Alabama started a comeback, cutting the lead to five with just over forty seconds remaining. Alabama was able to score the five points, but Tennessee made their foul shots, and won the title, 67–63. After the game, Holdsclaw was named the tournament's most outstanding player. UT was now 33–0, with the NCAA tournament coming up next.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in 1919, Richmond {{made their}} first Grand Final appearance, losing to Collingwood.

This was followed by <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> performance the next year. The only club that continued to beat Richmond {{on a regular basis}} was Carlton.

One notable example came in 1984, when a teenage Canadian golfer who had {{previously}} met Nicklaus at an exhibition wrote him for career advice. The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus' letter framed in his home.|$|E

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used compounds as a matrix are variations of glycerol, such as glycerol, deuteroglycerol, thioglycerol, and aminoglycerol. If the sample cannot dissolve in the chosen matrix, such as glycerol, a cosolvent or additive can be mixed with the matrix to facilitate the dissolving of the solid analyte. For example, chlorophyll A is completely insoluble in glycerol, but by mixing in {{a small amount of}} Triton X-100, a derivative of polyethylene glycol, the chlorophyll becomes highly soluble within the matrix. It {{is important to note that}} though a good signal may be achieved through glycerol or glycerol with an additive, there could be other matrix compounds that can offer <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> signal. Optimization of matrix compounds and concentration of solid analyte are vital for FAB measurements.|$|E
25|$|It was March 1968 at a minor club meeting when 17-year-old racer Barry Sheene {{lined up}} on the {{starting}} grid, on a works 125cc Bultaco, for his first race. It was an impressive debut by anyone's standards. Sheene had worked his way up to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars.

25|$|Although Pedro's brother Ramón, then a star pitcher for the Dodgers, {{declared}} {{that his brother}} was <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> pitcher than he, the younger Martínez was thought by manager Tommy Lasorda {{too small to be}} an effective starting pitcher at the MLB level; Lasorda used Pedro Martínez almost exclusively as a relief pitcher. Lasorda was not the first to question Martínez's stature and durability; in the minor leagues, the then-135-pound pitcher was threatened with a $500 fine if he was caught running. Martínez turned in a strong 1993 season as the Dodgers' setup man, going 10–5 with a 2.61 ERA and 119 strikeouts, in 65 games; his 107 innings led all NL relievers. With the Dodgers in need of a second baseman after a contract dispute with Jody Reed, Martínez was traded to the Montreal Expos for Delino DeShields before the 1994 season.|$|E

25|$|In 1942 a {{rationing}} {{system was}} begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires {{were the first}} item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> way to allocate scarce rubber. In June 1942 the Combined Food Board {{was set up to}} coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase coffee, sugar, meat, cheese, butter, lard, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, gasoline, bicycles, fuel oil, clothing, silk or nylon stockings, shoes, and many other items. Some items, like automobiles and home appliances, were no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to used goods like clothes or cars, but they became more expensive since they were not subject to price controls.|$|E
25|$|Galois' {{theory was}} {{notoriously}} difficult for his contemporaries to understand, {{especially to the}} level where they could expand on it. For example, in his 1846 commentary, Liouville completely missed the group-theoretic core of Galois' method. Joseph Alfred Serret who attended some of Liouville's talks, included Galois' theory in his 1866 (third edition) of his textbook Cours d'algèbre supérieure. Serret's pupil, Camille Jordan, had <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> understanding reflected in his 1870 book Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques. Outside France, Galois' theory remained more obscure for a longer period. In Britain, Cayley failed to grasp its depth and popular British algebra textbooks didn't even mention Galois' theory until well {{after the turn of}} the century. In Germany, Kronecker's writings focused more on Abel's result. Dedekind wrote little about Galois' theory, but lectured on it at Göttingen in 1858, showing a very good understanding. Eugen Netto's books of the 1880s, based on Jordan's Traité, made Galois theory accessible to a wider German and American audience as did Heinrich Martin Weber's highly influential 1895 algebra textbook.|$|E
