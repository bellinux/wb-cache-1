5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for leaving out {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} forced into a more participatory role in the story development. For example, in No One Writes to the Colonel, the main characters <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain about Caffo; his dates of birth and death <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> in the sources. He {{is said to have}} been one of the sons of St Caw, a king in {{northern}} Britain who lost his lands and sought safety with his family in Anglesey; the ruler Maelgwn Gwynedd gave him land in the north-east of the island, in the district known as Twrcelyn. Other relatives of Caffo included his uncles St Iestyn and St Cyngar (brothers of Caw), his sister St Cwyllog and various brothers including St Gildas (although the number of his siblings varies from 10 to 21 in different manuscripts).|$|E
5|$|Not {{listed below}} are Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip of France, eldest son of Louis VI; both were co-kings {{with their fathers}} (in {{accordance}} with the early Capetian practice whereby kings would crown their heirs in their own lifetimes and share power with the co-king), but predeceased them. Because neither Hugh nor Philip were sole or senior king in their own lifetimes, they are not traditionally listed as Kings of France, and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> ordinals.|$|E
6000|$|NOTE.--The {{characters}} on the Duke of Shrewsbury, the Duke of Devonshire, the Earl of Ranelagh, and Rear-Admiral Byng, have been entirely omitted.

5|$|The {{following}} list contains airports, heliports, {{or water}} aerodromes that {{are located in}} the Okanagan region of British Columbia, Canada. It includes the airport name, location, type, usage, codes of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO airport code) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA airport code), as well as the Transport Canada location identifier (TC LID) code, and coordinates of the airport's location. ICAO and IATA codes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> for airports which were closed or converted to general aviation before being issued such codes. As shown in the following list, each airport contains certain codes that are given, but not all of the three.|$|E
5|$|The list shows {{airports}} {{that have}} been served by Braathens {{as part of its}} scheduled services between 1949 and 2004. It excludes airports where Braathens only operated charter services. The list includes the city, country, the codes of the International Air Transport Association (IATA airport code) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO airport code), and the airport's name, with the airline's hubs marked. The list also contains the beginning and end year of services, with destinations marked if the services was not continual. IATA and ICAO codes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> for airports which were closed or converted to general aviation before being issued such codes.|$|E
5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes {{the soul of a}} dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person of the next generation dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given.</b> Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E

5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist. Rosidi {{writes that}} {{a sense of}} realism was {{promoted}} in Joehana's writings {{through the use of}} references to existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to know these products, they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of goods or services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E
5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not have {{to spend a lot of}} time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E
5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E

5000|$|The {{table of}} means on the left, below, shows a {{quantitative}} interaction [...] - [...] treatment A is beneficial both when B is given, and when B <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>given,</b> but the benefit is greater when B <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> (i.e. when A is given alone). The table of means {{on the right}} shows a qualitative interaction. A is harmful when B is given, but it is beneficial when B <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>given.</b> Note that the same interpretation would hold if we consider the benefit of B based on whether A is given.|$|R
