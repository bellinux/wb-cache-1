Originally the middle hall served the <b>Assistant</b> <b>Magistrate</b> of Kowloon's administrative office, and the rear block was his residence. After the government officials left the area in 1899, it was used for several other purposes, including an old people's home, a refuge for widows and orphans, a school, and a clinic. It was restored in 1996 and is now found near the centre of the park. It contains a photo gallery of the Walled City, and two cannon dating back to 1802 sit at the sides of its entrance.|$|E

He soon took to studying them and retained {{an interest in the}} anthropology of such tribes for the remainder of his life. He also became involved in William Wilson Hunter's Statistical Survey of India, which began in 1869, and was to be printed in the first edition of The Imperial Gazetteer of India, published in 1881. Hunter personally conducted the survey of Bengal, and the anthropological, linguistic and sociological accomplishments of Risley were recognised in February 1875 when he was appointed as one of five Assistant Directors of Statistics for Hunter's Survey.|$|E

25|$|On 14 October 2010, Syvret {{was convicted}} by the Magistrate's Court of the {{motoring}} offences, when the <b>Assistant</b> <b>Magistrate</b> criticized the police as overreacting {{in the way}} they arrested Syvret. On 17 November 2010, the court found Syvret guilty of the data protection offences and guilty of contempt of court on account of his non-attendance and words of disrespect. The prosecuting Attorney General made two charges against Syvret for the aforementioned blogging of the Faudemer Report. The charges came under the Data Protection (Jersey) Law, Articles 55, 17, and 21. The opinion on these two charges by <b>Assistant</b> <b>Magistrate</b> Mrs B. Shaw of the Magistrate's Court was published online. Syvret refused the option of community service and was jailed for ten weeks, fined £4,200 and ordered to pay £10,000 in legal costs. He was granted bail by the Royal Court the following day, pending an appeal. On 17 June 2011, Syvret made a further claim for judicial review to the Royal Court relating to the prosecution. The application was refused by Commissioner Pitchers and an appeal to the Jersey Court of Appeal (consisting of Michael Beloff QC, Clare Montgomery QC and Christopher Nugee QC) was dismissed.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the proceedings, Syvret made an {{application}} to the Royal Court in August 2009, arguing that the <b>Assistant</b> <b>Magistrate</b> was biased against him, as was the Commissioner of the Royal Court hearing that application: Sir Richard Tucker rejected these submissions and ordered him to pay costs. When the case resumed in the Magistrate's Court, Syvret sought to call the Attorney General, several senior civil servants, the suspended police chief Graham Power and other police officers, and Deputy Carolyn Labey (his former partner) as witnesses.|$|E
2500|$|Gorton's {{views on}} the role of {{government}} had transformed markedly during his time in England. He became actively involved in roles that he had previously criticized, now that his settlement of Warwick was secured by royal decree. [...] The separate settlements of Providence Plantation, Portsmouth, Newport, and now Warwick all came together under a fragile government, choosing John Coggeshall as its first President in 1647 and calling itself Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. [...] With his success in England, Gorton was seen as a leader in the colony and he was chosen as the Warwick <b>assistant</b> (<b>magistrate)</b> in 1649 under colonial President John Smith, also from Warwick. [...] Both Gorton and Smith declined their positions but were fined for doing so; they both ultimately served and their fines were remitted.|$|E

2500|$|Yet the magistrate's {{power was}} circumscribed, as {{reflected}} in the saying [...] "Heaven is high and the emperor far away." [...] The county government bureaucracy was thin in relation to the population, and the official staff of a larger county might consist only of a magistrate, a vice-magistrate, perhaps an <b>assistant</b> <b>magistrate</b> or recorder, and the captain of the militia. As early as the 12th century this small group was expected to supervise a population that could easily be 150,000 in the more densely populated sections of the country. In later dynasties, magistrates took on larger staffs. In the counties of the prosperous Lower Yangzi valley, the total staff of clerks, secretaries, yamen runners, medical examiners, jailers, and other such lesser employees might be some 500 people for a population of 100,000 to 200,000. The eminent historian Kung-chuan Hsiao, however, argued that local government became more despotic and the county magistrate had unlimited powers to control the people.|$|E

[...] Their oldest child John was very active in colonial affairs over a period of three decades, serving as treasurer, commissioner, assistant, and deputy governor. [...] Their son Joshua also served in public office as deputy to the General Court of Rhode Island for all but two years between 1664 and 1672, and as <b>assistant</b> (<b>magistrate)</b> for all but one year from 1669 to 1676. [...] Their oldest {{daughter}} Ann married Peter Easton, a son of Nicholas Easton who served many terms as either president or governor of the Rhode Island colony. Their daughter Wayte married Daniel Gould; descendant Elizabeth Buffum Chace was an abolitionist with the Underground Railroad.|$|E
60|$|Thirty-six {{miles from}} Purnea {{brought me to}} Kishengunj, when I found that no {{arrangements}} whatever had been made for my dawk, and I was fairly stranded. Luckily a thoughtful friend had provided me with letters to the scattered residents along the road, and I proceeded with one to Mr. Perry, the <b>assistant</b> <b>magistrate</b> of the district,--a gentleman well known for his urbanity, and the many aids he affords to travellers on this neglected line of road. Owing to this being some festival or holiday, {{it was impossible to}} get palkee-bearers; the natives were busy catching fish in all the muddy pools around. Some of Mr. Perry's own family also were about to proceed to Dorjiling, so that I had only to take patience, and be thankful for having to exercise it in such pleasant quarters. The Mahanuddee, a large stream from the hills, flows near this place, strewing the surrounding neighbourhood with sand, and from the frequent alterations in its course, causing endless disputes amongst the landholders. A kind of lark called an Ortolan was abundant: this is not, however, the European delicacy of that name, though a migratory bird; the flocks are large, and the birds so fat, that they make excellent table game. At this time they were rapidly disappearing; to return from the north in September.|$|E

Following the war the Territories were consolidated under one magistrate, to which post Stanford was appointed in 1902. Remarkably the two <b>assistant</b> <b>magistrates</b> were his brothers: Robert at Kokstad and Arthur at Umtata. Walter was always sympathetic to the Transkeians. Known by them as ‘Ndabeni’ (‘in the news’), he was deeply respected. His popularity was such that when Cape Town’s first African township was set up in 1901, on Crown land near Maitland, following recommendations by a commission chaired by Stanford, it was named Ndabeni in his honour at the residents’ request.|$|R
