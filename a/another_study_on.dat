25|$|One {{large scale}} study {{on a group}} of young adults in New Zealand showed 95.6% had at least 1 wisdom tooth with an {{eruption}} rate of 15% in the maxilla and 20% in the mandible. <b>Another</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> 5000 army recruits found 10,767 impacted wisdom teeth. The frequency of impacted lower third molars {{has been found to be}} 72% and the frequency of retained impacted wisdom teeth that are free of disease and symptoms is estimated at 11.6% to 29% which drops with age.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> men and women's {{patterns}} of sexual arousal confirmed {{that men and}} women have different {{patterns of}} arousal, independent of their sexual orientations. The study found that women's genitals become aroused to both human and nonhuman stimuli from movies showing humans of both genders having sex (heterosexual and homosexual) and from videos showing non-human primates (bonobos) having sex. Men did not show any sexual arousal to non-human visual stimuli, their arousal patterns being in line with their specific sexual interest (women for heterosexual men and men for homosexual men).|$|E
25|$|In a study {{concerning}} a Tilia americana-Tuber borchii ectomycorrhiza, 29 {{volatile organic compounds}} were produced only during the interaction phase between the two partners, suggesting some of these compounds could {{play a role in}} the early stages of the formation of the ectomycorrhiza. <b>Another</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> the same ectomycorrhizal association by Menotta et al. showed 58 genes were differentially expressed during the pre-contact phase, most of which were involved in secretory, apical growth, and infection processes. Thus, there appears to be a complex set of molecular changes that occurs even before the fungus and host plant make contact.|$|E

25|$|Another {{study of}} the Amerindian ancestry of Argentines was headed by Argentine {{geneticist}} Daniel Corach of the University of Buenos Aires. The {{results of this study}} in which DNA from 320 individuals in 9 Argentine provinces was examined showed that 56% of these individuals had at least one Amerindian ancestor. <b>Another</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> African ancestry was also conducted by the University of Buenos Aires in the city of La Plata. In this study 4.3% of the 500 study participants were shown to have some degree of African ancestry. Nevertheless, it must be said here that this type of genetic studies -meant only to search for specific lineages in the mtDNA or in the Y-Chromosome, which do not recombine- may be misleading. For example, a person with seven European great-grandparents and only one Amerindian/Mestizo great-grandparent will be included in that 56%, although his/her phenotype will most probably be Caucasian.|$|E
25|$|A {{similar study}} among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest {{mortality}} {{on the actual}} birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80; <b>another</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> Swiss data found a 13.8% excess {{and was able to}} link this to specific causes: heart attack and stroke (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths. Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young â€“ among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%. An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women. Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players and people with entries in the Encyclopedia of American History.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Crawley, Anderson, Kiersten Clark, {{and their}} colleagues {{conducted}} <b>another</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> the effects of Blue's Clues, this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers. They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension, but they found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers. Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of Blue's Clues interacted more with other children's TV shows and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from Blue's Clues could be transferred to other shows. They found that although experienced viewers of Blue's Clues interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show. The researchers stated, [...] "It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of why they do so." [...] The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially {{in the way they}} interact with them. They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, children tend {{to pay more attention to}} novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered. The researchers predicted that since shows like Blue's Clues help children feel empowered to learn, it could have long-term effects in motivating children to learn and provide them with a lifelong love of learning.|$|E
