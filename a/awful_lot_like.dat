500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy said, {{the song}} was [...] "a {{perfectly}} decent slice of midtempo Timba-pop, but it's not really {{in the same league}} as the brilliant 'The Way I Are'." [...] MTV Buzzworthy said [...] "slightly less out-there are the beats -- which sound an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Hilson and Timbaland's first collaboration, [...] "The Way I Are"—and the cameo from Timba himself." [...] Sophie Bruce of BBC Music thought that the song lacked the a catchy hook such as in [...] "The Way I Are." [...] Less than impressed with Timbaland's rapping and [...] "less than sexy" [...] vocal appeal, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said the [...] "unfortunate pairing" [...] was reprised, and the song [...] "encapsulates the record’s shortcomings." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, but wrote: [...] "Flashes of brilliance aside, the result sounds an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> something Yorke dashed off {{to pass the}} time before delving into the new Radiohead album." [...] Mark Beaumont of the Guardian called it [...] "deviously understated", but found that its unconventional release was [...] "more impactful than the product." [...] Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "There's precious little to grab on to in terms of melody and feeling, and you won't find yourself humming along to anything here. That said, certain elements of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, if given the right amount of attention, can be enjoyable to luxuriate in." [...] Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times found the album too similar to Yorke's 2006 solo album The Eraser and his work with Atoms for Peace, writing that [...] "it’s just a bit disappointing that Yorke's path seems short on new directions." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm {{just not sure}} if it works. It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's hard to say whether this is genius or madness." [...] Isler observed that he would have [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviews for The 3rd Degree {{have been}} mixed. Iain Weaver from UKGameshows gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} series, saying: [...] "We're not tremendously upset {{by the way the}} teachers went through the series unbeaten, they are university lecturers, and university lecturers are meant to know an <b>awful</b> <b>lot.</b> We also <b>liked</b> the way Steve Punt kept the programme flowing at a decent pace, adding jokes and asides, and keeping proceedings moving along most enjoyably. He's probably helped by the audience at the student bar, who have doubtlessly taken this opportunity to have their one pint of something for the week. If there's one slight criticism we'd make, it's that the Highbrow Lowbrow round {{is a bit of a}} block in the middle of the programme. We might prefer to split the round into two parts, perhaps shifting the first immediately before the lists round. That would add a little bit more variety, and make the programme a little less imposing. That's just a minor criticism: most of what The 3rd Degree does, it does well. Given that it replaced the venerable Quote... Unquote, it didn't have a high bar, but we can see this programme running for a fair few years." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Wings" [...] {{received}} acclaim from critics. Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{said the}} group were poised to succeed [...] "where other X Factor winners have failed by releasing a great single at the right time". Cragg highlighted the song's production, writing that it had [...] "everything you'd want to hear in a pop song in 2012", and likened Little Mix's [...] "ridiculous vocal runs" [...] to those of Christina Aguilera. Tim Lee from musicOMH called it [...] "an absolutely stomping pop song" [...] and [...] "possibly the best mass market pop song since Girls Aloud's heyday", complimenting its brass production and call and response. According to Lee, the track is [...] "all shot through with such sassiness that you nearly forget it sounds an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> 'Ain't No Other Man' by Christina Aguilera." [...] Joe Rivers of No Ripcord gave the song a rating of nine out of ten, regarding it as [...] "vivacious, fun, brash and confident", and noting its [...] "absolute belter of a chorus". Rivers concluded: [...] "'Wings' is really pretty darn good. Not just good-for-X-Factor good, but good-in-the-context-of-all-pop-music good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lamont noted Lieberman's {{position}} {{was similar to}} George W. Bush and Dick Cheney's position.

That’s a false premise.” [...] Lieberman's communications director replied that Lamont was politicizing national security by [...] "portraying [...] as a soul mate of President Bush on Iraq".|$|E
2500|$|... {{the world}} Atwood imagines in Oryx and Crake is hardly that far-fetched, {{especially}} online. The exhibitionistic website At Home With Anna K, for instance, {{is almost certainly}} a reference to Ana Voog's AnaCam and the lifecasting movement pioneered by Jennifer Ringley and her now-defunct JenniCam website. Likewise, {{many of the other}} fictional websites Jimmy and Crake visit in the novel have real-life analogues: Felicia's Frog Squash is essentially a crush porn portal, the premise of dirtysockpuppets.com recalls ITV's Spitting Image programme, Queek Geek sounds an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Fear Factor, and the concept of watching assisted suicides on nitee-nite.com was actualized in our world when Craig Ewert allowed his death in Switzerland to be documented by Sky TV for their controversial Right to Die documentary. Even the seemingly far-fetched idea of broadcasting live executions (which Jimmy and Crake watch on shortcircuit.com, brainfrizz.com, and deathrowlive.com) has already been discussed, with a high percentage of the U.S. population receptive to the concept.|$|E

5000|$|Larry Flick of Billboard {{gave the}} song a mixed review writing [...] "Walker {{has made a}} hell of a living selling this kind of cornbread-philosophical lyric.

5000|$|In {{his review}} of Songs from the Big Chair, Barry McIlheney of Melody Maker stated that [...] "none of you should really be too {{surprised}} that Tears for Fears have made such an excellent album", calling it [...] "an album that fully justifies the rather sneering, told-you-so looks adopted by Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal on the sleeve", before concluding, [...] "An <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of people will, of course, {{go on and on}} about overcoats, The Lotus Eaters and an alleged lack of depth. And an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of people will have to eat an <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of words." [...] Ian Cranna of Smash Hits described it as [...] "looser, more exploratory than before" [...] in nature, and noted its [...] "unflinching lyrical honesty". Rolling Stone critic Don Shewey wrote that Tears for Fears [...] "sounds a <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> a <b>lot</b> of other British bands" [...] and observed traces of [...] "U2's social conscience, the Bunnymen's echoing guitars and XTC's contorted pop wit" [...] on the album, but commented that Chris Hughes' production [...] "nudges Songs from the Big Chair slightly ahead of the pack." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in his review for The Village Voice, observing some substantial lyrics, particularly on [...] "The Working Hour", and musical elements such as an [...] "uncommon command of guitar and piano, Baker Street sax, synthesizers more jagged than is deemed mete by the arbiters of dance-pop accessibility". However, he felt these are all beneath grandiloquent lamentations suggesting [...] "a depth and drama English lads have been falling short on since the dawn of progressive rock." ...|$|R
