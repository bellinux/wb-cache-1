5|$|The {{data also}} allowed for an {{investigation}} into whether visual prominence {{is an important factor}} in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.|$|E

5|$|These geyser observations, {{along with}} the finding of {{escaping}} internal heat and very few (if <b>any)</b> <b>impact</b> craters in the south polar region, show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus is trapped in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior, possibly driving the geological activity.|$|E
5|$|After no {{tropical}} cyclone activity in July and August, the third tropical storm formed offshore of southwestern Mexico on September3. Like {{the previous two}} {{tropical cyclone}}, this storm had a peak of 50mph (80km/h), and did not intensify further. Tropical Storm Three headed northwestward, and began paralleling the coast of Baja California. On September8, Tropical Storm Three turned abruptly south-southwestward, and dissipated by the next day. The outer rainbands of this system were expected to bring squally weather over the Baja California Peninsula; instead, this storm turned away without causing <b>any</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> on the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|His first 13 {{games for}} the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio {{throughout}} the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, although Ian Rush had scored more goals in the league. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> {{in any of the}} major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built up hope for the future.|$|E

5|$|The {{solar eclipse}} of March 20, 2015, {{was the first}} {{occurrence}} of an eclipse estimated to potentially {{have a significant impact}} on the power system, with the electricity sector taking measures to mitigate <b>any</b> <b>impact.</b> The continental Europe and Great Britain synchronous areas were estimated to have about 90 gigawatts of solar power and it was estimated that production would temporarily decrease by up to 34 GW compared to a clear sky day. The temperature may decrease by 3°C, and wind power potentially decreases as winds are reduced by 0.7m/s.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player {{to let them know}} that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{season began}} with the team trying to improve on an 2–14 season. This {{was one of the}} worst seasons in {{franchise}} history. There is some sentiment that the 1986 team was even worse than the winless team of 1976, and the 473 points conceded was not beaten by any NFL team until the 2001 Indianapolis Colts gave up 486. The Buccaneers selected Bo Jackson with the top pick in the draft, but were unable to convince him to join the team. Three weeks after the draft, Jackson signed a three-year baseball contract with the Kansas City Royals. Despite holding four of the first forty selections in the draft, and the presence of a great influx of fresh talent from defunct USFL teams, the Buccaneers were unable to find <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> players in either the draft or free agency. They entered the season with a roster nearly identical to the previous season's 2–14 team.|$|E
5|$|Victory in Normandy {{stemmed from}} several factors. German {{preparations}} along the Atlantic Wall were only partially finished; shortly before D-Day Rommel reported that construction was only 18 per cent complete {{in some areas}} as resources were diverted elsewhere. The deceptions undertaken in Operation Fortitude were successful, leaving the Germans obliged to defend a huge stretch of coastline. The Allies achieved and maintained air superiority, which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of the preparations underway in Britain and were unable to interfere via bomber attacks. Transport infrastructure in France was severely disrupted by Allied bombers and the French Resistance, {{making it difficult for}} the Germans to bring up reinforcements and supplies. Much of the opening artillery barrage was off-target or not concentrated enough to have <b>any</b> <b>impact,</b> but the specialised armour worked well except on Omaha, providing close artillery support for the troops as they disembarked onto the beaches. The indecisiveness and overly complicated command structure of the German high command was also a factor in the Allied success.|$|E
50|$|This crater has {{a roughly}} {{circular}} outer rim {{that is not}} overlaid by <b>any</b> <b>impacts</b> of significance. The inner walls appear as simple slopes down to the interior floor.

5|$|After Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion {{marched to}} the rear and began {{establishing}} a reserve line at Beaucourt. On 18 April, Gellibrand was evacuated sick and Leane was appointed to act as brigade commander in his place. The following day he was temporarily promoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. During Gellibrand's absence, on 27–28 April the 12th Brigade was deployed to the line at Villers-Bretonneux, which had just been recaptured from the Germans. In order to push the frontline further east of the town, it was necessary to capture strongly-held German positions in Monument Wood, so-named as it was adjacent to a memorial to the Franco-Prussian War. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, and Leane, knowing that the fighting would be difficult, applied his usual practice of giving the most challenging missions to his own, the 48th Battalion. After the intense fighting at Dernancourt, the 48th had been reinforced with a significant number of unseasoned new recruits. The attack was planned for 02:00 on 3 May, and in order to achieve surprise, there was to be only intermittent shelling of the wood during the day, and just a two minute barrage with all available guns {{at the time of the}} attack. In the event, Leane's first battle as brigade commander went badly, with the artillery barrage being very weak and failing to cut the wire in front of the wood, and the supporting tanks failing to have <b>any</b> <b>impact.</b> One party managed to get through the wire and capture 21 Germans in the farm buildings in the centre of the wood, but a German counterattack forced the Australians back to their start line, with a loss of 12 officers and 143 other ranks, against German casualties of 10 officers and 136 men.|$|E
5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have <b>any</b> <b>impact,</b> and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E
