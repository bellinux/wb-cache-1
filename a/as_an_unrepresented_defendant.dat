40|$|Previous {{articles}} {{have addressed the}} ethical and legal issues involved when private psychiatrists perform forensic evaluations on criminal defendants before the defendants have access to counsel; {{but there have been}} few studies ad-dressing evaluations requested through public facilities and by clinicians other than psychiatrists. The authors present the results of a detailed study of defen-dants admitted for evaluations of competency to proceed to a forensic inpatient unit in one state, as well <b>as</b> data from <b>a</b> national survey of state forensic facilities. The studies were designed to measure the incidence of <b>unrepresented</b> defen-dants in <b>a</b> population referred for competency evaluation, as well as to examine the reasons for such occurrences. The data reveal that court-ordered evaluations of <b>unrepresented</b> <b>defendants</b> are rare, but continue to exist.

[...] Indeed, the term is used by people all across the political spectrum to refer to the journalists and political operatives who see themselves as the arbiters of conventional wisdom.

50|$|At end of {{the state}} case, before the defence case, the court may {{discharge}} the accused.

40|$|In Indiana v. Edwards, the U. S. Supreme Court {{held that}} the Sixth Amendment permits a trial court to impose a higher {{competency}} standard for self-representation than to stand trial. The Court declined to specify {{the contents of a}} permissible representational competence standard, but cited with support the construct of adjudicative competence developed by Professor Richard Bonnie. While Bonnie 2 ̆ 7 s proposal may provide an appropriate framework for evaluating the competence of represented defendants 2 ̆ 7 decisions, it is at most a starting point for defining the capacities needed for self-representation at trial. This Article begins by exposing three reasons why Bonnie 2 ̆ 7 s approach is inadequate to address self-representation. First, Bonnie selected the functional abilities necessary for decisional competence only in reference to the norm of autonomy. Second, Bonnie did not consider the unique decisionmaking context presented by self-representation. Third, Bonnie derived the elements in his decisional competence construct from the subset of abilities considered necessary to consent to medical treatment. While many similarities exist between a represented defendant and a medical patient, this analogy does not hold for <b>unrepresented</b> <b>defendants</b> forced to make decisions at trial without an expert 2 ̆ 7 s assistance. Next, the Article [...] conceptualizing self-representation <b>as</b> <b>an</b> exercise in problem solving, where the major 2 ̆ 2 problem 2 ̆ 2 is the prosecution of a criminal charge [...] draws upon psychological theories of problem solving to identify abilities necessary for decisionmaking at trial. Applying a normative theory of representational competence that balances concerns of autonomy, reliability, and fairness, the Article concludes by suggesting a subset of abilities that may be critical for self-representation at trial...|$|R
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMSection 105 A of the Criminal Procedure Act {{is unconstitutional}} {{with regard to}} its failure to extend {{benefits}} to <b>an</b> <b>unrepresented</b> accused. Unlike <b>a</b> represented accused, <b>an</b> <b>unrepresented</b> accused cannot benefit from section 105 A. The only recourse available {{to him or her}} is to enter a plea of guilty under section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Act. This plea of guilty does not offer him the benefits under section 105 A. This causes the section to operate unfairly against the unrepresented accused based on his/her failure to secure legal representation. This continued operation of section 105 A infringes on the rights of an accused by not affording this protection to the accused. This is in terms of a right to equality before the law, freedom from discrimination and what constitutes a justifiable limitation under section 36 of the Constitution. South Africa has ratified or acceded to international and regional treaties which require, inter alia that the right to equality before the law is respected. This requires a model framework to be put in place to ensure that unrepresented accused can benefit from section 105 A. An evaluation of the viability of adding the unrepresented accused to the protection under section 105 A is done. This is informed by experiences from other jurisdictions, which aid the need for reform...|$|R
30|$|Factor {{reference}} gestures locate abstract entities in distinct spatial locations. They {{either do}} this explicitly, as when locating both factors simultaneously (Fig.  1 <b>a),</b> or implicitly, <b>as</b> when locating <b>a</b> single factor {{on one side}} of space and implying a contrast with <b>an</b> <b>unrepresented</b> factor (Fig.  1 e). The other three types of gestures represent abstract relations spatially and thus provide a first type of evidence that spatial analogies are at play. Factor change gestures represent changes in quantity (a relation between an entity at one point in time and the same entity at another point in time) as movements. Causal relation gestures represent a higher-order relation (that a change in one factor results in a change in the other factor) <b>as</b> <b>an</b> action through space. Finally, whole system gestures represent the system’s behavior through time as movement.|$|R

Women in engineering groups are an excellent medium through which to empower young girls, support female engineering students, work towards equality, and achieve a more balanced professional workforce.|$|R

Although the Hougang {{by-election}} had been held, rendering the basis for Vellama's application factually moot, there were a real interest and real controversy at hand. The public undoubtedly had an interest in the outcome of the case as [...] "casual vacancies can arise from time to time whereupon the issue will become real". Regarding the third requirement of the Karaha Bodas test, the Court did not expressly decide whether a private right was involved as the Attorney-General did not raise this issue. Even though Vellama first brought the action <b>as</b> <b>a</b> voter who had been directly affected by being resident in <b>an</b> <b>unrepresented</b> constituency, the Court noted that there was [...] "considerable doubt" [...] whether a private right had been violated as the Prime Minister had expressed an intention to call a by-election.|$|R

Illness is conceived as the result of abandonment and fragility, marked by histories told through generations, preventing affective investment.

Family therapist’s analytic listening makes it possible to understand the repressed material present in myths, censuring, and family secrets. From this standpoint, family clinic facilitates the retaking, the re-elaboration, and the strengthening of psychological processes, aiming at promoting the group’s emotional health...|$|R

5000|$|At one time, all {{real estate}} brokers and agents, or Realtors, practiced [...] "single agency," [...] meaning they {{represented}} only the buyer or the seller. In the 1990s, {{the concept of}} buyer agency became popular, allowing a buyer to retain an agent who would represent {{the best interests of}} the buyer alone. The first national company to provide this service was The Buyer's Agent, Inc. A 2008 study by Consumer Reports indicates that prior to this development, a Realtor was presumed by state law to be working for the seller. The same study shows that buyers using buyer agents obtained a savings of $5000 in the price of the home as compared to prices paid by unrepresented buyers. It remains true that <b>an</b> <b>unrepresented</b> real estate buyer can still call the sellers agent to arrange a showing of the property. In such cases, the buyer should be advised by Agency Disclosure Laws (a state law in every state in the U.S.) that any information obtained, as well as all conversations and negotiations undertaken, will be for the benefit of the seller.|$|R
