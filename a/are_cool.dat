5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces <b>are</b> <b>cool</b> enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E

In the final stage, the magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a volcano, creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye.|$|R
25|$|The City of Cerritos, {{as well as}} most {{of coastal}} Southern California, {{generally}} has a Mediterranean climate and shares the climate of areas along the Mediterranean Sea.

25|$|Damascus has a cold {{desert climate}} (BWk) in Köppen-Geiger system, {{due to the}} rain shadow effect of the Anti-Lebanon {{mountains}} and the prevailing ocean currents.

25|$|Urfa has a {{hot summer}} Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Csa). Urfa is very hot during the summer months. Temperatures in the height of summer usually reach 39°C (102°F). Rainfall is almost non-existent during the summer months. Winters <b>are</b> <b>cool</b> and wet. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. Spring and autumn are mild and also wet.|$|E
25|$|To {{properly}} cool a fire, splash {{water on}} all embers, including {{places that are}} not glowing red. Splashing the water is both more effective and efficient in extinguishing the fire. The water boils violently and carries ash {{in the air with}} it, dirtying anything nearby but not posing a safety hazard. Pour the water until the hissing stops. Then stir the ashes with a stick {{to make sure that the}} water penetrates all the layers. If the hissing continues, add more water. When the fire is fully extinguished, the ashes <b>are</b> <b>cool</b> to the touch.|$|E
25|$|Winters {{are cold}} and {{prolonged}} while summers <b>are</b> <b>cool</b> and short. The temperature decreases with the altitude, {{which is more}} visible in summer. The mean annual temperature is around 9–10°C in the low, 5–7°C {{in the middle and}} 2–3°C in the high altitude zone. The coldest month is January with average temperature varying between −5 and −2°C. The hottest month is July with temperature averaging 20°C at 1600m and 15°C at 2000m. Temperature inversions, i.e. increase in temperature with height, are observed in 75% of the winter days.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} can {{be adapted}} to provide longitudinal as well as transverse cooling by using a dipole magnet as a dispersive prism to divide the particles by energy, and then passing the resultant [...] "rainbow" [...] beam though a tapered wedge of cooling material. Thus, faster particles <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> more and slower particles <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> less. A simple way is to fill the dipole itself with cooling material, so that more energetic particles following a larger orbit pass <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> more.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Being</b> <b>cool</b> <b>was</b> {{not just}} about being bad, but it was to take {{ownership}} in oneself. To <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> <b>was</b> to be stoic in regards to emotion.

This is the culture that transformed the Harlem Renaissance—living differently and in style.|$|R

25|$|Gaborone has a hot {{semi-arid}} climate (Köppen climate classification BSh). Most of the year, Gaborone is very sunny. The summers {{are usually}} hot. The nights <b>are</b> <b>cool.</b> Usually, the summers with little rainfall are warmer than summers with regular rainfall. If {{there is a}} drought, the hottest temperatures of the year are usually in January or February. If there is normal rainfall, the hottest temperatures are usually in October, right before the rain starts. During the winter, days are still warm, and the nights are cold.|$|E
25|$|Northern California has warm or mild to cold climate, {{in which}} the Sierra gets snow in the late fall through winter and {{occasionally}} into spring. Summers are warm and dry while winters <b>are</b> <b>cool</b> and usually wet. The high temperatures range from 50's to 30's in the winters while as summers temperatures range is 90's to 60's or 50's, with highs well into the 100s for the Sacramento region. Snow gets covered on the mountains in mid January through February. Fog occurs infrequently or occurs normally {{in the west and}} coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate is}} classed as subpolar oceanic climate {{according}} to the Köppen climate classification: Cfc, with areas having a tundra climate, especially in the mountains, although some coastal or low-lying areas can have very mild-winter versions of a tundra climate. The overall character of the islands' climate {{is influenced by the}} strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the North Atlantic Current. This, together with the remoteness of any source of warm airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0nbsp&°C or 37 to 39nbsp&°F) while summers <b>are</b> <b>cool</b> (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5nbsp&°C or 49 to 51nbsp&°F).|$|E

25|$|Mediterranean to {{continental}} Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa) and {{highland climate}} (Köppen H). These are the innermost lands and those {{at a higher}} elevation (cities included here are, amongst others, Alcoy, Morella, Requena and Villena). Here winters <b>are</b> <b>cool</b> to cold, especially at night (a few days of snow are not unusual), summers mild to hot and rainfall more evenly distributed through the year. The lower registered temperatures in the Valencian Community were in these inland areas during the cold wave of 1956. Temperatures plunged to nearly −20°C; as in Vistabella del Maestrat (−19°C) and Castellfort (–17°C).|$|E
25|$|Proper Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa). It roughly {{goes along}} {{the coastal plain}} from the northernmost border through the Benidorm area (cities {{included}} here are, amongst others, Castellón de la Plana, Gandia and Valencia). It covers in various grades the lower inland areas. In this area, winters <b>are</b> <b>cool,</b> summers are long, dry and hot; rainfall occurs mostly during spring and autumn, usually totalling around 600mm. with a remarkably wetter micro climate in the Marina Alta and the Safor comarques just north of Cap de la Nau cape, which accumulates an average of up to 1000mm. due to an orographic lift phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The Alicante {{province}} {{also has}} a mostly dry Mediterranean to Continental Mediterranean climate. These are the innermost part of the province (for example Villena) and some closer to the sea but at a higher elevation (for example Alcoy). Here winters <b>are</b> <b>cool</b> to cold {{and a few days}} of snow are not unusual; summers are mild to hot and rains at about 500mm average and slightly more evenly distributed through the year than in the previous mentioned areas. The innermost part of this domain is more quite dry while the mountainous part reach slightly higher precipitation figures which allow Kermes Oak woods to thrive, such as the one in La Carrasqueta or in the Mariola range, both near Alcoy.|$|E
