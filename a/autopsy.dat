5|$|When PD diagnoses are {{checked by}} <b>autopsy,</b> {{movement}} disorders experts are found on average to be 79.6% accurate at initial assessment and 83.9% accurate {{after they have}} refined their diagnosis at a follow-up examination. When clinical diagnoses performed mainly by nonexperts are checked by <b>autopsy,</b> average accuracy is 73.8%. Overall, 80.6% of PD diagnoses are accurate, and 82.7% of diagnoses using the Brain Bank criteria are accurate.|$|E

25|$|As <b>autopsies</b> on paupers did {{not require}} the coroner's permission, <b>autopsies</b> became common at the hospital. From 1845 {{the results of these}} <b>autopsies</b> were {{recorded}} in detail by Dr Hitchman.|$|R
5000|$|Until 2008, Hayne {{performed}} about 80 to 90 {{percent of}} criminal <b>autopsies</b> in Mississippi, and has testified to performing more than 1,500 <b>autopsies</b> per year. Performing more than 325 <b>autopsies</b> per year {{is considered a}} [...] "Phase II deficiency" [...] by the National Association of Medical Examiners, and prevents an office from being accredited. [...] While performing these <b>autopsies,</b> Hayne also regularly appeared in court to testify as a forensic expert, and held down two hospital jobs.|$|R
50|$|Clinical <b>autopsies</b> serve {{two major}} purposes. They are {{performed}} {{to gain more}} insight into pathological processes and determine what factors contributed to a patient's death. <b>Autopsies</b> are also performed to ensure the standard of care at hospitals. <b>Autopsies</b> can yield insight into how patient deaths can be prevented in the future.|$|R
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want the FBI {{to get the job}} done fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an <b>autopsy</b> on the body. Even after an <b>autopsy,</b> Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or chemical agents in the subway.|$|E

5|$|An <b>autopsy</b> of Hawkins {{showed that}} he had 200 nanograms per {{milliliter}} of Valium in his system, which is {{the low end of}} its therapeutic-use range (100-1500ng/mL). No trace of any other drug was found in his system.|$|E
30|$|The {{policy makers}} need to declare {{clinical}} <b>autopsies</b> {{as a useful}} investigative tool that can have futuristic implications in development of health care practices. Simultaneous awareness among lay public is necessary as they are important stake holders and the decision makers for the procedure, unless clinical/hospital <b>autopsies</b> are made mandatory (Turnbull et al., 2015), that obviously is highly unlikely. Consequently, facilities should be made easily available in terms of forensic-pathology laboratories, equipment, and forensic experts for clinical <b>autopsies</b> to be conducted. At the same time needless medico-legal <b>autopsies</b> need to be curtailed for the better utilization of already limited resources chiefly {{in terms of the}} manpower and expertise that can be utilized for clinical <b>autopsies</b> whenever required.|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Modern medical {{practice}} involves cost analysis of therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. There are no papers {{dealing with this}} theme in relation to forensic <b>autopsies</b> in our country. OBJECTIVE: Analysis of direct costs of forensic <b>autopsies.</b> TYPE OF STUDY: Cost analysis. SETTING: São Paulo Medical Examiner's Central Office. SAMPLE: Year 2001 activity. PROCEDURES: Routine forensic <b>autopsies.</b> MEAN MEASUREMENTS: Analysis of direct costs of personnel and material. RESULTS: Cost of personnel represents 90. 38 % or US$ 93. 46. Material expenses comprised 9. 62 % or US$ 9. 95. Total costs were calculated to be US$ 103. 41. CONCLUSIONS: Forensic <b>autopsies</b> have a high cost. Cases to be <b>autopsied</b> should be judiciously selected. Our results are similar to international studies if data are rearranged {{based on the number}} of annual necropsies...|$|R
50|$|Guyanese {{authorities}} waived their {{requirement for}} <b>autopsies</b> {{in the case}} of unnatural death. Doctors in the U.S. performed <b>autopsies</b> on only seven bodies, including those of Jones, Moore, Dr. Lawrence Schacht, and Carolyn Layton. Moore and Layton were selected among those <b>autopsied,</b> in part, because of the urging of the Moore family, including Rebecca Moore, the sister of the two victims, who was not a Temple member herself.|$|R
5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an <b>autopsy</b> is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an <b>autopsy</b> is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E

30|$|Some studies used normal {{prostate}} tissues biopsies (Rodríguez-Berriguete et al. 2010). Normal <b>autopsies</b> {{could not}} be used in this study, however, owing to methodological limitations. We could not obtain <b>autopsies</b> because the families did not consent.|$|R
50|$|Tools like {{multislice}} helical {{computed tomography}} {{can be used}} for detailed documentation of injuries, tissue damage and complications like air embolism and pulmonary aspiration of blood.

30|$|It is {{an irony}} {{that while the}} {{clinical}} <b>autopsies</b> are ignored in instances when utmost necessary, medico-legal <b>autopsies</b> are conducted in vast number of cases where it can easily be avoided. In India, ‘needless autopsies’ where cause of death is very obvious, are conducted ‘in the name of law’ ignoring the observations of the Supreme Court of India and the existing provisions in the law itself. India is suffering from burden of “Unnecessary post-mortems” that leads to waste of resources and certainly is a cause of concern (Medico-legal News, 2015). A dearth of trained and qualified forensic experts to conduct medico-legal <b>autopsies</b> in government centres that are authorised for conducting <b>autopsies</b> further complicates the situation.|$|R

Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
40|$|Background: Suicidal {{behavior}} {{is a major}} public health problem. Aims: To know the socio-demographic factors affecting suicidal attempts and the modes of suicidal death. Design: The retrospective observational study. Setting: Forensic Medicine and Toxicology Department of a tertiary care hospital. Subjects and Methods: All <b>autopsies</b> performed between January 2001 to December 2005 were analysed for total number of <b>autopsies</b> performed, allegedly suicide <b>autopsies,</b> mode of suicidal deaths, variation in suicidal deaths in relation to age, sex, place of residence and religion. Statistical Analysis Used: Chi-square {{test was used to}} analyse the variability of suicidal deaths with age, sex, place of residence and religion. P-value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Out of total 3485 <b>autopsies</b> 16. 24 % (566) were allegedly suicidal <b>autopsies.</b> 335 (59. 18 %) and 231 (40. 82 %) victims were males and females respectively (p= 0. 080). 223 (39. 39 %) and 343 (60. 61 %) victims were from urban and rural area respectively (p= 0. 030) ...|$|R
40|$|The semiquantitative {{scoring system}} of the {{multiple}} organ failure(MOF) in <b>autopsies</b> of adults was applied. A randomized prospective longitudinal study was performed. The sample {{was taken from the}} total number of <b>autopsies</b> made from July to December, 2001, but excluding fetuses, children and <b>autopsies</b> that did not have the established fragments. The processing was carried out by the standard methods and the modified MOF criteria according to the experience gained in experimental study was: causal factor, lesions in three or more organs and immune system reactivity. Pursuant to the criteria, MOF reached 46, 55 % of <b>autopsies.</b> Causes of death were related to causal factors or complications. MOF disturbances present in the studied cases show a high frequency of such disturbances and the moderate MOF was the most common. The usefulness of the diagnostic criteria of MOF, the need of applying the scoring system of MOF and of performing quality <b>autopsies</b> was demonstrated. The validation of this semiquantitative scoring system of MOF was recommended...|$|R
