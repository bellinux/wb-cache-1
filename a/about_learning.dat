5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information <b>about</b> <b>learning</b> every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

40|$|This study {{responds}} to the possible changes in beliefs that teachers hold nowadays <b>about</b> language <b>learning.</b> As for a pre service teacher, the experience being {{a student in the}} 20 th century would somehow influence his or her beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>learning.</b> In this respect, this study aimed to investigate the pre-service ESL teachers' beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>learning</b> and the influence of the reported beliefs with their teaching approaches. The research was conducted using a modified questionnaire based on Beliefs <b>About</b> Language <b>Learning</b> Inventory by Horwitz. It was conducted to identify the pre-service teachers' beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>learning</b> solely. Other than that, interview was also conducted to elicit information regarding their beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>learning</b> and teaching approaches. Fifty seven pre-service teachers from the Department of Languages, Institute of Teacher Education Dato' Razali Ismail Campus were selected at random for the study. Ten of them were selected for the interview survey, unfortunately {{on the day of the}} interview only two of them came for the interview due to their personal reasons. The beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>learning</b> of these pre-service teachers were collected from both data sources. Then, their beliefs were analyzed and discussed to study the relationship between the pre-service teachers' beliefs and their teaching approaches. Consequently, this study may beneficial for further research in the area of beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>learning</b> among pre-service teachers of English...|$|R

Twice as many Waldorf students as state school pupils report having good relationships with teachers; they also report significantly fewer ailments such as headaches, stomach aches, and disrupted sleep.|$|E

25|$|Letchworth Croquet Club {{is based}} at Letchworth Sports and Tennis Club in Muddy Lane. Letchworth Garden City Croquet Club was founded in 1987 by {{a small group of}} enthusiasts {{and with the help of}} the (then) {{corporation}} were provided with a venue for their activities on the site of the old Spirella tennis courts adjacent to Willian Way. After much work on the playing surface, including using the ancient heavy roller left behind after the demise of the Spirella Sports Ground two nearly full-sized croquet lawns were created and the club members set <b>about</b> <b>learning</b> the finer points of the game with plenty of assistance from the East Anglian Croquet Association. Very surprisingly, after only two years the club won the Longman Cup, the premier national handicap competition; something that the majority of croquet clubs never achieve! The club moved to Muddy Lane to become part of Letchworth Sports and Tennis Club in Spring 2006. A special event was held with lunch and AC and GC tournaments. Dr Ian Vincent, Chairman of the Croquet Association, officially opened the lawns by running the first hoop. Since moving the club's membership has risen to over 70 people with a wide age range. The club is active in regional and national events and each year hosts the national final of the Croquets Association's Inter Club Golf Croquet Championship. The croquet lawns at Letchworth were constructed with assistance from the Sports Turf Research Institute and were laser levelled and 76 tons of Leighton Buzzard washed sand ameliorated into the top surface. In the ensuing years the club has conducted a rigorous lawn maintenance regime with the result that the two lawns are now amongst the finest in the UK.|$|E

500|$|Pole had Pistrucci create three {{portraits of}} the King in {{different}} sizes. [...] Only two were used, one for the obverse of the half crown, {{and the other for}} the shilling and sixpence. Both were modified by Thomas Wyon of the Mint, who engraved the designs in steel. What was dubbed the [...] "bull head" [...] of the King on the 1816 half crown was disliked by the public, and it was replaced by another in 1817. The criticism incensed Pistrucci, who blamed Wyon for bungling the design, and who set <b>about</b> <b>learning</b> to engrave in steel himself.|$|E
500|$|The Guitar Trio {{continued}} touring in 1980. De Lucía reportedly {{suffered from}} headaches and backaches while performing because {{he found it}} difficult to improvise and follow McLaughlin and Coryell's advanced knowledge of jazz improvisation. Paco professed, [...] "Some people assume that they were learning from me, but I can tell you it was me learning from them. I have never studied music, I am incapable of studying harmony—I don't have the discipline, playing with McLaughlin and Di Meola was <b>about</b> <b>learning</b> these things." [...] In 1981, Coryell was replaced with Di Meola, and The Guitar Trio released one of their most successful records, Friday Night in San Francisco, which sold over 1 million copies and generated a significant interest in flamenco music in America and Europe. It featured an extended combination of Mediterranean Sundance and Río Ancho; this became arguably the piece most associated with the musicians. De Lucía also formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 (which included his brothers Ramón and Pepe), and released the first of its three albums that same year. On 30 August 1981, de Lucía performed a solo set at St. Goarshausen in Germany, where he performed Monasterio de Sal and Montino among others and later performed with The Guitar Trio. The event was broadcast on national WDR television.|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{process of}} connecting instances {{to each other}} is essential to many types of learning: from generalization over instances, to category learning, to learning from analogies. The present work seeks an understanding of these processes by studying how adults <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> relations. <b>Learning</b> <b>about</b> relations requires <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> two kinds of entities: arguments and predicates. Gentner (2003) proposes that arguments, and particularly arguments that {{take the form of}} concrete objects, are psychologically prior to predicates. Further, she has shown that object-object similarities {{play a key role in}} the relational mappings that both children and adults make. This suggests that when learners are presented with a set of instances in the form of arguments and predicates, th...|$|R

2500|$|Because parkour {{philosophy}} is <b>about</b> <b>learning</b> to control oneself in {{interaction with the}} environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour.

Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task." [...] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} empirical {{and theoretical}} {{issue in the}} study of learning is the manner in which one’s <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> one cue affects <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> another cue. In most cases, one’s <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> one cue competes with <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> other cues (i. e., overshadowing or blocking), and these cue competition effects have inspired and guided some of the most influential ideas about the mechanisms of learning (see, e. g., Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). In other cases, the presence of one cue can facilitate <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> a second cue. For example, taste cues have been found to facilitate <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> odor cues in food aversion learning (e. g., Rusiniak, Palmerino, Rice, Forthman, & Garcia, 1982).
