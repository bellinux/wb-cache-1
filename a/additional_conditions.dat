5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), <b>additional</b> <b>conditions</b> are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|The Abu Ghosh clan, {{based in}} the Jerusalem-ara village of Qaryat al-Inab, {{traditionally}} served as toll collectors for the Jerusalem-Jaffa road, and were increasingly considered by Ibrahim Pasha to be extortionists. They were targeted by the authorities in 1833. The clan's leadership was arrested, including their head sheikh Ibrahim Abu Ghosh, and were temporarily sentenced to forced labor in Acre. Relations between the authorities and the Bedouin tribes of south-central Palestine were also antagonistic. Traditionally, during Ottoman rule, the Bedouin were allowed to collect tribute payments from travelers and {{the inhabitants of the}} area in return for services to the state. Ibrahim Pasha saw the Bedouin as raiders who exceeded their privileges and abolished this practice. He also imposed <b>additional</b> <b>conditions</b> on the Bedouin, primarily the requirement of transporting grain for Egyptian troops in return for the right to graze livestock. In 1833, the Dura-based Amr tribe of the Hebron Hills, which was headed by Isa Amr and Abd al-Rahman Amr, were subject to a military campaign by Ibrahim Pasha. The Abu Ghosh, the Ras Karkar-based Simhan clan, and the Amr tribe were essentially at war with the Egyptians.|$|E

25|$|Most {{countries}} {{provide a}} variety of services to assist homeless people. These services often provide food, shelter (beds) and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations (often {{with the help of}} volunteers) or by government departments or agencies. These programs may be supported by the government, charities, churches and individual donors. Many cities also have street newspapers, which are publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people. While some homeless have jobs, some must seek other methods to make a living. Begging or panhandling is one option, but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities. People who are homeless may have <b>additional</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as physical or mental health issues or substance addiction; these issues make resolving homelessness a challenging policy issue.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, news analysts, lawyers, {{current and}} former {{government}} officials of the Thai justice system, such as Seripisut Temiyavet, came out to state that the DSI was not handling {{the investigation of the}} temple with proper legal procedure. It was questioned why the DSI would not let the abbot acknowledge the charges at the temple, which many considered legitimate under criminal law. The DSI replied that {{they did not want to}} visit the abbot at the temple at this stage, because the temple was crowded with people, who could force the DSI to commit itself to <b>additional</b> <b>conditions.</b> A spokesperson of the temple also questioned why the DSI did not pursue lawsuits that were still running against Paiboon and Phra Suwit. Was the DSI biased because they received orders from someone not disclosed? The DSI had seen its independence questioned before, even by leading people within the department itself. In short, the temple's practitioners and spokespeople felt the charges were politically motivated, and had no confidence in the justice system under the junta. Moreover, they felt that if the former abbot would turn himself in, this would set a precedent for more baseless persecutions of other monks.|$|E

In fact, <b>additional</b> <b>conditions</b> were laid out {{as part of the deal}} to ensure that Pixar remained a separate entity, a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal. Some of those conditions were that Pixar HR policies would remain intact, including the lack of employment contracts.
