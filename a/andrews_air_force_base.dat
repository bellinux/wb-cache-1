5|$|Brown's tour of Vietnam {{ended in}} September 1970, {{and he became}} Commander, Air Force Systems Command, with {{headquarters}} at <b>Andrews</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Base,</b> Maryland. This job involved handling a number of troublesome projects, including the F-111.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{the capital}} began when Reagan's casket arrived at <b>Andrews</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Base,</b> Maryland. It {{was removed from the}} plane, driven by hearse in a {{procession}} through the Maryland and Virginia suburbs and the nation's capital, across the Memorial Bridge, and onto Constitution Avenue.|$|E
5|$|After the service, {{the casket}} {{was removed from}} the cathedral and driven to <b>Andrews</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Base</b> for the return to California, passing crowds along its route. The family and close friends boarded the VC 25-A Presidential Aircraft, and as she had done previously, Nancy Reagan waved {{farewell}} to the crowds just before boarding the plane.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "cocked" [...] or [...] "on alert" [...] E-4B is manned 24 hours a {{day with}} a watch crew on board {{guarding}} all communications systems awaiting a launch order (klaxon launch). Those crew members not on watch {{would be in the}} alert barracks, gymnasium, or at other base facilities. The 24-hour alert status at Andrews AFB ended when President Clinton ordered the aircraft to remain at Offutt unless needed, though relief crews remain based at <b>Andrews</b> and Wright-Patterson <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Base.</b> One E-4B is kept on alert at all times.|$|R
40|$|Differences {{in the use}} of ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) phraseology in some {{countries}} complicate understanding; especially to pilots whose English is an acquired language. United States and Canada form a region where such differences are mostly noticeable. Effective communication starts with the knowledge and respect of ATC procedures and aircraft performance data. Effective radio communication abroad also requires proficiency in general English. A well-known saying "Seeing once is better than hearing twice" gives the worst fit when it concerns radiotelephony phraseology. While preparing for flights in the North America and looking through materials that were at hand, there was no expectation of a bolt from the blue. But the first landing at Gander, followed by Ottawa, Toronto, Boston, New York, Chicago, <b>Andrews</b> and McGuire <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Bases,</b> {{have made it clear that}} what was read by eyes in a book was rather difficult for ears to hear. A deeper study of American aviation regulations has shown that radio communication over the US was a trouble not only to the crews, but also to American regulating authorities and aviation industry. In the fall of 1988 the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and airlines called for a joint action to improve communications between pilots and controllers. Today, 18 years after this call, let's try to look into the real radio communication in the US and find out its differences from the one used in Europe and South America. Distinctions could be divided into three groups - language, phraseology, and procedures...|$|R
