5000|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> is a {{technique}} of sowing seeds by spraying them through aerial mechanical means such as a drone, plane or helicopter. <b>Aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> is considered a broadcast method of seeding. It {{is often used to}} spread different grasses and legumes to large areas of land that are in need of vegetative cover after fires. Large wildfires can destroy large areas of plant life resulting in erosion hazards. <b>Aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> may quickly and effectively reduce erosion hazards and suppress growth of invasive plant species. <b>Aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> is an alternative to other seeding methods where terrain is extremely rocky or at high elevations or otherwise inaccessible. [...] <b>Aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> is also often used to plant cover crops. Below is a small list of plants that are often seeded by this method.|$|E
50|$|When <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> a {{cover crop}} one must seed {{them at least}} 7 to 10 days before drilled cover crops. The {{reason for this is}} because the <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> method is slower than that of the drilled method. Seeding rates for most plants should be 25% to 50% higher with <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> when {{compared}} to other more conventional methods like drilling. These higher seeding rates are needed to establish same yields as other methods. This is mostly because with <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> the seed can be often on the soil surface longer making the seed more susceptible to predation by birds, insects and other animals.|$|E
50|$|According to the National Agricultural Aviation Association, {{the birthplace}} of <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> in America {{happened}} 1921 in Ohio. Lt. John A. Macready, a U.S. Army pilot, used a modified Curtis JN-6 to dust a field of catapla trees with arsenate to kill sphinx moth larvae. This early crop dusting lead to <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding.</b> Aerial reforestation, a type of <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding,</b> specifically to repopulate forest land after some type of disaster was being used {{as early as the}} 1930s. Planes were used to seed mountain areas in Honolulu that were inaccessible to traditional methods after forest fires. By 1946 <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> was being used in Oregon to seed more than 500 acres of Douglas fir, and Port Orford cedar as well as 100 acres of grassland and other trees that were burned by fire. In 1947 the Crown Zellerbach Corporation seeded over 1000 acres in Oregon.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>seed</b> {{banks are}} {{potentially}} {{the main source}} of sexual recruitment for woody wetland plants. Whilst the importance of soil seed banks for the persistence and recruitment of wetland plants has been examined in many studies, the role of <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> banks has been largely neglected. We used seed traps and the seedling emergence technique to quantify the <b>seed</b> rain from <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> banks of the Swamp Paperbark Melaleuca ericifolia Sm. (Myrtaceae) in Dowd Morass, a Ramsar-listed, brackish-water wetland in south-eastern Australia. Nine plant species germinated from material collected in seed traps over 2004 – 2005, but emergents were dominated (80 – 97 %) by M. ericifolia. The mean number of M. ericifolia emergents ranged from < 1 to < 100 seedlings m− 2 day− 1, and showed a peak in the summer–autumn period. Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation (r 2 = 0. 738) between the number of M. ericifolia emergents and water depth. Water depth and salinity were negatively correlated (r 2 = 0. 819), and increases in the number of M. ericifolia emergents as water levels fell were also associated with high salinities. Increasing air temperature and vapour pressure deficit also stimulated seed release during periods of drying. This study {{is one of the first}} to demonstrate the importance of <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> banks for sexual recruitment in woody wetland plants and the release of seed in relation to environmental factors. <b>Aerial</b> <b>seed</b> banks warrant consideration alongside soil seed banks for the establishment and long-term survival of woody plants in wetlands...|$|R
50|$|A canopy <b>seed</b> bank or <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> bank is the {{aggregate}} of viable seed stored by a plant in its canopy. Canopy seed banks occur in plants that postpone seed release for some reason.|$|R
30|$|Fire {{can cause}} {{mortality}} of <b>aerial</b> or soil-stored <b>seed,</b> {{but it can}} also stimulate germination. The combined effects of these two processes will determine germination response from seed banks. Seed depths and heat tolerances will affect soil seed bank responses to fire, while the characteristics of seed capsules will have an important influence on <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> banks.|$|R
50|$|The major {{advantage}} of <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> is the efficient {{coverage of a}} large area in {{the least amount of}} time. <b>Aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> facilitates seeding in areas that otherwise would be impossible to seed with traditional methods, such as land that is too hard to reach by non aircraft or ground conditions being far too wet. <b>Aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> may be used when existing crops are already planted. This is important when living in an area where there is a small window between harvesting the crop {{and the end of the}} growing season, because seeding cover crops after harvest can cause poor stand establishment due to cold temperatures or moisture.|$|E
50|$|Soil {{moisture}} plays a {{large role}} in the success of <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding.</b> Adequate soil moisture for germination and establishment of seed requires that the top 0.5 -1 inch be moist. These conditions should be {{at the time of the}} seeding or within 10 days of the seeding. If the required soil moisture is not present at these times, the seeds may become the target of predation by insects and other animals. Along with soil moisture, surface conditions also play a key role in the success of <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> and establishment of seed. The best soil surface conditions are those that are moist and friable. A loose and rough soil surface with cracks or residue cover is also very conducive to seed germination. These conditions allow for the seed to make the best contact with moist soil while adequately allowing the seed to settle into the ground. Another important factor besides soil surface conditions are that of timing of <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> and seeding rates.|$|E
50|$|After the fire, {{efforts were}} made to {{stabilize}} the landscape by burned area emergency response teams. Waterbars, s and K-rails were put in place and there were over two weeks of <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding,</b> dropping around 50000000 lb of winter wheat or indigenous grass seeds over 180000 acre.|$|E
40|$|The forest annual, Amphicarpaea bracteata L. can {{reproduce}} via aerial chasmogamous, aerial cleistogamous, and subterranean cleistogamous flowers. Both plant {{size and}} light intensity influenced {{the utilization of}} the three modes of reproduction. Chasmogamous and aerial cleistogamous flower number and the ratio of chasmogamous flowers to {{the total number of}} aerial flowers increased with plant size. The latter demonstrated a shift to xenogamy and outbreeding in larger plants. Light intensity indirectly influenced reproductive modes through its influence on plant size. Seed set by both types of aerial flowers was low and unrelated to plant size. Subterranean seed number and the total dry weight of subterranean seeds per plant increased with size. The subterranean seeds of Amphicarpaea bracteata are thirty-four times larger than the <b>aerial</b> <b>seeds</b> (fresh weight). Under field conditions, subterranean seeds had greater germination after one year than <b>aerial</b> <b>seeds.</b> The plants arising from subterranean seeds were significantly larger and more fecund than those from <b>aerial</b> <b>seeds.</b> <b>Seeds</b> produced by <b>aerial</b> cleistogamous, hand self-pollinated chasmogamous, and naturally pollinated chasmogamous flowers had equivalent germination rates and produced plants of equal size and fecundity. This suggests that the outbred progeny from chasmogamous flowers have no advantage over the inbred progeny from aerial cleistogamous flowers...|$|R
30|$|Proposed {{components}} of a more complete model of first-order fire effects on shrubs and herbs are summarized in Figure 1. As pointed out previously, with exceptions including a model of <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> capsule heating (Mercer et al. 1994) and one describing the heating of rhizomatous grass buds (Choczynska and Johnson 2009), most process-based modeling efforts have focused on trees (see Butler and Dickinson 2010, Kavanagh et al. 2010). Based on current understanding, it appears that efforts to develop process models for herb and shrub response to fires may be most fruitfully focused on reproductive structures partially exposed at the surface, below ground organs and <b>seed</b> banks, and <b>aerial</b> <b>seeds</b> stored in protective structures.|$|R

50|$|Surplus planes from World War II were {{initially}} used for <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding,</b> with the open cockpit Stearman biplane used frequently.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{regeneration}} method on three wood properties of jack pine, along different vertical positions, grown in northwestern Ontario were evaluated. A multi-staged nested sampling design {{was used to}} randomly select 12 trees, approximately 25 years of age, from four stands that were <b>aerial</b> <b>seeded,</b> Brcke seeded, planted and post fire naturally regenerated. Within each tree, small clear wood samples (2 cm 2 cm 30 cm) were obtained from three vertical positions: 1 m, 2 m and 4 m, for the determination of static bending properties - modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) - and specific gravity. Data analysis revealed that all three wood properties, MOE, MOR and specific gravity {{were not significantly different}} statistically (? 0. 05) between regeneration methods. Further analysis into the influence of vertical positions revealed that MOE was not significantly different with height for all regeneration methods. In contrast, MOR was found to significantly vary between the bottom and top positions for the <b>aerial</b> <b>seeded</b> and naturally regenerated stands...|$|R
50|$|Banksia baxteri is serotinous, that is, {{it has an}} <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> bank in its canopy in {{the form}} of the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened with fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 9 to 12 years old have been found to have seed that remains 100% viable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fourth and}} most recent {{phase of the}} project, started in 2003, has two parts: the use of <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> to cover wide swathes of land where the soil is less arid, and the {{offering}} of cash incentives to farmers to plant trees and shrubs {{in areas that are}} more arid. A $1.2 billion oversight system (including mapping and surveillance databases) is also to be implemented. The [...] "wall" [...] will have a belt with sand-tolerant vegetation arranged in checkerboard patterns in order to stabilize the sand dunes. A gravel platform will be next to the vegetation to hold down sand and encourage a soil crust to form. The trees should also serve as a windbreak from dust storms.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} much debate with regards to which type of {{aircraft}} is better for <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding.</b> There {{is some evidence that}} shows helicopters may be best at the job when seeding in fields that are already established. This is because the wind from the blades of the helicopter causes the canopy of the already established crop to shake and open. This allows for more seed to reach the soil below. Another advantage for the helicopter is they are more maneuverable and can handle irregular shape fields while a plane has a harder time with such fields. The real advantage of the plane is it is faster than a helicopter and has the ability to carry a much heavier load. This allows the plane to finish the job much faster which equals less money spent in the air.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1947, Airwork (NZ) Limited {{had been}} {{operating}} Tiger Moths for rabbit killing by spreading poisoned carrots in Canterbury. In early May 1949 Charles Brazier used ZK-ASO to spread lime. Airwork {{was aware that}} Fred [...] "Popeye" [...] Lucas had conducted <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> as well as rabbit poisoning and discussed the possibility of dropping seeds with fertiliser (as Pritchard had done) with Ces Worrell, a grain and seed merchant. He suggested spreading superphosphate alone would be more profitable, (a suggestion he may have wished he had kept to himself—the following year, Worrell started a rival firm, Aerial Sowing). Acting on Worral's suggestion, Airwork arranged a public demonstration on Sir Heaton Rhodes's property at Tai Tapu, south of Christchurch, on 27 May 1949. They advertised spreading superphosphate for £5 per ton, and several orders came from the audience.|$|E
40|$|O conhecimento dos mecanismos de reprodução de uma espécie de planta daninha, principalmente em relação à dormência e germinação de suas sementes, é de grande importância na determinação do método e da época ideal de seu controle. Com o objetivo de avaliar a germinação de sementes aéreas e subterrâneas de Commelina benghalensis, plantas desta espécie foram cultivadas em vasos, em casa de vegetação, nas condições de Viçosa, Estado de Minas Gerais, Brasil. Semente subterrânea grande (SSG) e semente aérea pequena (SAP) apresentaram o maior e o menor peso (8, 81 e 1, 90 mg/semente, respectivamente). Semente aérea grande (SAG) e semente subterrânea pequena (SSP) apresentaram pesos intermediários (3, 65 e 3, 51 mg/semente, respectivamente), porém semelhantes entre si. A data de coleta das sementes aéreas influenciou seu peso, observando-se, nas condições do experimento e no intervalo considerado (setembro a dezembro), maior peso de semente na primeira coleta (24 / 9 / 1999). A germinação das sementes aéreas não foi influenciada pelo tempo de armazenamento. Sementes aéreas pequenas germinaram melhor a 20 - 35 ºC, e as grandes, a 25 ºC. A germinação de sementes aéreas recém-colhidas variou de 7, 50 % em SAP a 21, 67 % em SAG/E (semente aérea grande com envoltório). O armazenamento por quatro meses aumentou a porcentagem de germinação de SAG e não alterou a de SAG/E e SAP. Sementes subterrâneas pequenas e grandes armazenadas por três meses apresentaram 32, 5 e 92, 5 % de germinação, respectivamente. O aumento do tempo de armazenamento de três para seis meses diminuiu a porcentagem de germinação de SSG e SSP. O calor seco aumentou a porcentagem de germinação de SAG/E e SSP, não alterou a de SAG e SAP e diminuiu a de SSG. O grau de dormência diferiu muito entre os quatro tipos de sementes. A produção de sementes polimórficas com grandes diferenças no grau de dormência permite que C. benghalensis germine e se estabeleça nos mais diversificados ambientes e épocas do ano, o que dificulta o manejo desta espécie daninha. Understanding the {{reproductive}} mechanisms of a weed species, mainly concerning to its seeds' dormancy and germination {{is of great}} importance for determining the method and right time for its control. To evaluate the germination of <b>aerial</b> and underground <b>seeds</b> of Commelina benghalensis. plants were grown in pots under greenhouse conditions in Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The large underground seed (SSG) and the small <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> (SAP) had the largest and the smallest seed weight of 8. 81 and 1. 90 mg/seed, respectively. Large <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> (SAG) and small underground seed (SSP) had similar intermediate weights (3. 65 and 3. 51 mg/seed, respectively). The <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> harvest date influenced their weight, with a production of heavier seeds in the first harvest (September, 24 1999) being observed during the experimental period and interval studied (September to December). <b>Aerial</b> <b>seed</b> germination was not influenced by storage time. SAP showed better germination percent at 20 - 35 ºC and SAG at 25 ºC. Germination of freshly harvested <b>aerial</b> <b>seeds</b> varied from 7. 50 % for SAP to 21. 67 % for SAG/E (large <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> with covering). Four-month storage increased SAG germination percent without altering it in SAG/E and SAP. Small and large underground seeds stored during three months showed 32. 5 and 92. 5 % of germination, respectively. Increasing storage time from {{three to six months}} decreased SSG and SSP germination percent. Germination percent was increased by dry heat in SAG/E and SSP, had no alteration in SAG and SAP, and decreased in SSG. The degree of dormancy differed among the four seed types. The production of polymorphic seeds showing great differences in dormancy degree allows C. benghalensis to germinate and establish in the most diversified environments and seasons of the year, making difficult the management of this weed species...|$|R

50|$|The {{fire was}} a {{combination}} of six wildfires caused by lightning in south-central Idaho and north-central Nevada that started on July 16-17, 2007. The four largest fires were called the Rowland, Elk Mountain, Smith Crossing and Buck Flat fires. They merged over the weekend of July 21, 2007, and the wildfire was renamed the Murphy Complex Fire. It spread quickly due to the hot and dry conditions and threatened or damaged a wide variety of natural resources, plants, animals, people and property. By the time it was contained on August 2, 2007 an estimated 483000 acre in Idaho and 170000 acre in Nevada had burned. It was the largest Idaho wildfire since 1910. Afterward, the BLM undertook a large scale reclamation effort, which included fencing, seedling planting, shrub planting, drill seeding, <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding,</b> cultural inventory, weed treatment and monitoring. Monitoring is planned for 425815 acre.

40|$|Several {{restoration}} methods {{intended to}} increase the success of aerially‐seeded perennial grasses were assessed to determine their effects on cheatgrass metrics and soil nutrient bioavailabilities. These methods were: 1) imazapic herbicide application (140 g ai ∙ ha‐ 1, 210 g ai ∙ ha‐ 1, and no application [control]), 2) vegetation manipulation treatments (50 % sagebrush overstory thinning, 100 % sagebrush overstory thinning, sagebrush overstory and/or vegetative thatch burning, and no manipulation [control]), and 3) alternative seeding treatments (<b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> with raking, <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> with activated carbon [AC] addition, <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> with sucrose addition, and regular <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> [control]). Treatments were arranged in 3 ‐way factorial designs, which allowed main effects and interactions between treatments to be assessed. Responses were followed for two growing seasons following treatment. Main effects of treatments and their interactions on cheatgrass metrics are described in Chapter 2. Herbicide reduced cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in 2009, but these variables were greater than in no‐herbicide plots in 2010. Burning decreased cheatgrass densities but increased weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in both years. One hundred percent sagebrush thinning resulted in greater cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in both years and greater densities in 2010. Sucrose addition decreased cheatgrass weights and tiller and spikelet numbers in 2009, but increased these variables in 2010. An interaction between AC and herbicide treatment was observed, with AC potentially sequestering and lessening the negative effect of herbicide on cheatgrass. <b>Aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> with raking and 50 % sagebrush thinning treatments were not found to significantly affect cheatgrass either year. The effects of treatments (herbicide, 50 % sagebrush thinning, <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> on snow, and <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> with raking treatments omitted) on soil nutrient availabilities are described in Chapter 3. We used ion exchange resin (IER) membrane probes to measure extractable quantities of 15 ions over three time periods following treatment applications. Burning resulted in short‐term increases in many soil nutrient availabilities, including nitrate (NO 3 ‐), phosphate (H 2 PO 4 ‐), and sulfate (SO 4 2 ‐).

40|$|The {{existence}} of non-serotinous, non-sprouting species in fire regimes where serotiny confers an adaptive advantage is puzzling, particularly when these species recruit poorly from soil seed banks or from burn edges. In this paper, white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) {{was used to}} show that the timing of fire relative to seed development can control <b>aerial</b> <b>seed</b> bank availability for non-serotinous species. To estimate seed survival in closed cones during crown fires, cone heating was simulated using a one-dimensional conduction model implemented in a computational fluid dynamics (Navier–Stokes) fire spread model. To quantify the area burned when germinable seed would be contained in closed cones, empirical fire occurrence and seed development (germinability and cone opening) data were compared for multiple locations across the white spruce range. Approximately 12 % of cones contained viable seed following crown fire simulations (0. 072 m s&minus; 1 mean spread rate; 9147 kW m&minus; 1 mean intensity), and roughly half of the historical area burned resulted from fires that occurred when closed cones would contain germinable seed.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2012. Major: Soil science. Advisors: Dr. John M. Baker and Dr. Deborah L. Allan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 103 pages. Incorporating cover crops in the corn-soybean rotation {{is one way}} to improve soil quality over time and reduce nitrogen and erosion losses. In the Upper Midwest, however, cover crops can be difficult to establish after harvest of the main crop due to the short growing season. Overseeding prior to harvest may allow more time for growth. Three experiments were conducted to determine what factors are most likely to affect successful establishment of overseeded winter rye into standing corn and soybeans. The first experiment field tested <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> at multiple locations in southeastern Minnesota to characterize the physical and chemical properties that affect fall biomass production. Precipitation within a week of seeding was found {{to be the most important}} factor in establishing a successful cover crop. The second experiment further elaborated on this by testing soil water potential and temperature on germination of rye seeds under laboratory conditions. Total germination was significantly decreased by decreasing water potential in the sandy loam, but not the clay or silt loam, suggesting that moisture content may be more important than water potential at the soil surface. Increasing temperature decreased total germination, most likely due to the increased incidence of mold at higher temperatures. The third experiment evaluated three overseeding techniques for standing soybeans: <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> (AS), tractor-mounted air-flow spreader (TAF), and tractor-mounted fertilizer broadcast spreader (TBS). The AS treatment resulted in the lowest seeding density overall while the TBS treatment resulted in the highest density and was the most variable across plots. The differences in seeding density led to significant above-ground rye biomass differences in fall, although by spring, biomass was not different across seeding treatments. Soybean yields were not different across seeding techniques, suggesting that any of these practices are viable for on-farm use. Finally, the potential for overseeding cover crops, <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> in particular, as a practice in the Upper Midwest was evaluated. Some of the current limitations include unpredictable weather, lack of aerial applicators, inconsistent stands due to pilot error and seed predation, and high costs...|$|E

40|$|A Professional Project Report Submitted in Partial Fulfillment ofthe Requirements For the Degree of Master of Water Resources, Hydroscience Option, Water Resources Program University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, December 2005. The {{suppression}} of wildfires {{has created the}} opportunities for catastrophic wildfires, which can increase suspended-sediment, stream temperature, stream flows, erosion and sedimentation in surrounding waterways. Burn Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) has utilized {{a number of different}} treatments to minimize these effects following a wildfire. Induced meandering is a new concept that utilizes rock structures to promote the stabilization of incised degrading channels, by simulating river riffles, elevating channel bottoms, establishing channel slope, to encourage channel meander and the formation of an active floodplain. This project evaluates the effectiveness of rock baffles, one-rock dams, and <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> in stabilizing an incised discontinuous gully channel post wildfire. The methods used to evaluate the effects of treatment include photo documentation, vegetation percent cover, cross-sectional measurements, streambed geology, and a riparian habitat assessment. Results of the photo documentation of the channel illustrate that meandering is clearly happening, while cross-sectional data suggests the channel has stabilized. Vegetation percent cover and streambed geology support these findings. Photo documentation and vegetation percent ground cover suggest that <b>aerial</b> <b>seeding</b> on the upland slopes was successful. The riparian habitat assessment confirms that gullies are not suitable riparian habitat.

In ecological literature, the species that are killed by fire but regenerate from seed are referred to as [...] "fire-sensitive" [...] or [...] "seeders", while those that typically survive by resprouting from a trunk or underground lignotuber are called [...] "fire-tolerant" [...] or [...] "sprouters".|$|R
