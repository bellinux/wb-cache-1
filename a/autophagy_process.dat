Moreover, inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation significantly abolished the dioscin-induced apoptosis. In addition, dioscin triggered cell autophagy in early stages.

Autophagy can be said non-selective or selective; it is classified into three main forms, namely macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), the former process being by far the most intensively investigated. The role of CMA remains largely underappreciated in autoimmune diseases, even though CMA has been claimed to play pivotal functions in MHC class II-mediated antigen processing and presentation. Therefore, hereby, we give a special focus on CMA as a therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases, based in particular on our most recent experimental results where a phosphopeptide modulates lupus disease by interacting with CMA regulators.

40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) {{remains the}} most {{aggressive}} and lethal brain tumor due to its molecular heterogeneity and high motility and invasion capabilities of its cells, resulting in high resistance to current standard treatments (surgery, followed by ionizing radiation combined with Temozolomide chemotherapy administration). Locus amplification, gene overexpression, and genetic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are hallmarks of GBM that can ectopically activate downstream signaling oncogenic cascades such as PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Importantly, alteration of this pathway, involved also in the regulation of <b>autophagy</b> <b>process,</b> can improve radioresistance in GBM cells, thus promoting the aggressive phenotype of this tumor. In this work, the endogenous EGFR expression profile and autophagy were modulated to increase radiosensitivity behavior of human T 98 G and U 373 MG GBM cells. Our results primarily indicated that EGFR interfering induced radiosensitivity according to a decrease of the clonogenic capability of the investigated cells, and an effective reduction of the in vitro migratory features. Moreover, EGFR interfering resulted in an increase of Temozolomide (TMZ) cytotoxicity in T 98 G TMZ-resistant cells. In order to elucidate {{the involvement of the}} <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> as pro-death or pro-survival role in cells subjected to EGFR interfering, the key autophagic gene ATG 7 was silenced, thereby producing a transient block of the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process.</b> This autophagy inhibition rescued clonogenic capability of irradiated and EGFR-silenced T 98 G cells, suggesting a pro-death autophagy contribution. To further confirm the functional interplay between EGFR and autophagy pathways, Rapamycin-mediated autophagy induction during EGFR modulation promoted further impairment of irradiated cells, in terms of clonogenic and migration capabilities. Taken together, these results might suggest a novel combined EGFR-autophagy modulation strategy, to overcome intrinsic GBM radioresistance, thus improving the efficacy of standard treatments. J.

40|$|Autophagy {{refers to}} the catabolic process in {{eukaryotic}} cells that delivers cytoplasmic material to lysosomes for degradation. This highly conserved process {{is involved in the}} clearance of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Consequently, autophagy is important in providing nutrients to maintain cellular function under starvation, maintaining cellular homeostasis, and promoting cell survival under certain conditions. Several pathways, including mTOR, have been shown to regulate autophagy. However, the impact of lysosomal function impairment on the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> has not been fully explored. Basic lipophilic compounds can accumulate in lysosomes via pH partitioning leading to perturbation of lysosomal function. Our hypothesis is that these types of compounds can disturb the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process.</b> Eleven drugs previously shown to accumulate in lysosomes were selected and evaluated for their effects on cytotoxicity and autophagy using ATP depletion and LC 3 assessment, respectively. All eleven drugs induced increased staining of endogenous LC 3 and exogenous GFP-LC 3, even at non toxic dose levels. In addition, an increase in the abundance of SQSTM 1 /p 62 by all tested compounds denotes that the increase in LC 3 is due to autophagy perturbation rather than enhancement.

Detection of these bacteria in faecal samples of patients with gastroenteritis, and intestinal biopsies and faecal samples of patients with Crohn’s disease, led us to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms used by both C. ureolyticus and C. concisus to infect host cells and cause gastrointestinal disease. Investigation of the ability of C. ureolyticus to interact with intestinal epithelial cell lines showed that it was able to adhere to both Caco- 2 and HT- 29 cell lines. This was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (ScEM), showing that C. ureolyticus UNSWCD employed a “sticky-end” mechanism to attach to the microvilli of Caco- 2 cells resulting in cellular damage and microvilli degradation. In contrast, gentamicin protection assays revealed that C. ureolyticus was unable to invade either cell line, a finding confirmed by ScEM. Furthermore, addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ to these cell lines prior to infection had no effect on attachment or invasion. Investigation of the secretome of C. ureolyticus UNSWCD revealed the presence of putative virulence and colonisation factors. Given that previous studies had demonstrated varying abilities of C. concisus strains to invade intestinal cell lines, this thesis explored the potential of C. concisus strains to survive within host cells by manipulating the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process.</b> Gentamicin protection assays revealed that autophagy inhibition resulted in 2 - 4 fold increases in intracellular levels of C. concisus UNSWCD within Caco- 2 cells, whereas autophagy induction resulted in a reduction in intracellular levels or bacterial clearance. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed co-localisation of the bacterium within autophagosomes, while an optimised transmission electron microscopy procedure identified intracellular bacteria persisting within autophagic vesicles.

Gentamicin protection assays were employed to assess intracellular levels of C. concisus within Caco- 2 cells, following autophagy induction and inhibition. To assess the interaction between C. concisus and autophagosomes, confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were employed. Expression levels of 84 genes involved in the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> were measured using qPCR. Autophagy inhibition resulted in two- to four-fold increases in intracellular levels of C. concisus within Caco- 2 cells, while autophagy induction resulted in a significant reduction in intracellular levels or bacterial clearance.

In this study, the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> was investigated, and in vitro modulated, in two different GB cell lines, T 98 G and U 373 MG (known to differ in their radiosensitivity), after IR or combined IR/TMZ treatments. T 98 G cells showed a high radiosensitivity (especially at low and intermediate doses), associated with autophagy activation, assessed by Beclin- 1 and Atg- 5 expression increase, LC 3 -I to LC 3 -II conversion and LC 3 B-GFP accumulation in autophagosomes of irradiated cells; differently, U 373 MG cells resulted less radiosensitive. Autophagy inhibition, using siRNA against BECN 1 or ATG- 7 genes, totally prevented decrease in viability after both IR and IR/TMZ treatments in the radiosensitive T 98 G cells, confirming the autophagy involvement in the cytotoxicity of these cells after the current GB treatment, contrary to U 373 MG cells. However, Rapamycin-mediated autophagy, that further radiosensitized T 98 G, was able to promote radiosensitivty also in U 373 MG cells, suggesting a role of <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> in enhancing radiosensitivity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} and the increasing production of manufactured nanoparticles (NP) are raising safety concerns {{because of the potential}} effects of NP on human health, particularly at the respiratory level. Several studies have shown that exposure to manufactured NP can induce pathogenic biological effects, with lung remodelling (fibrosis, emphysema…), depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the NP. Currently, oxidative stress and inflammation are the most widely accepted paradigms of NP toxicity; however, the exact underlying mechanisms in the biological effects of NP still remain unknown. Autophagy is a physiological process that allows the autodigestion of the subcellar components and which is also involved in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. It has been shown that this process can negatively regulate inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, the hypothesis {{of this study is that}} a defective autophagy could be a new mechanism explaining, at least in part, NP effects. We choose to focus on TiO 2 NP since it is one of the most abundantly produced and widely used NP. We used seven TiO 2 NPs presenting different physicochemicals properties (size, crystal phase, surface embedding) and compared their effects to those of micron-size TiO 2 and carbon black (CB - for chemical composition effects). NPs were characterized by electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and X-ray diffraction. Murine macrophages (RAW cell line) were exposed to 50 μg/mL TiO 2 and CB NP for 6 hours. Effects of NP on the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> were analysed by looking at the expression of autophagy markers (LC 3 -II and p 62) and lysosomal proteins (LAMPs and cathepsins). We also analysed the cytoskeleton network by fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, expression of inflammatory cytokines was determined in macrophages exposed to NP. All particles, except the micrometric one, induced an increase of LC 3 -II protein expression, indicating an accumulation of autophagosomes. These particles also increased p 62 protein level, suggesting an autophagy blockade. This perturbation of the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> by NP does not seem to result from a disruption of the cytoskeleton but from a defect in the lysosome function as suggested by a decrease of mature cathepsins expression.

Baseline autophagy {{contributes to the}} maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and autophagic flow is upregulated in response to many adverse conditions, including nutrient or growth factor deprivation, accumulation of unfolded proteins, and intracellular infection. Although autophagy frequently exerts cytoprotective functions by acting as a stress response mechanism, in some settings, it may contribute to the execution of cell death, representing the type 2 programmed cell death. Moreover, autophagy drives key processes in cancer, including glioblastoma (the most frequent and malignant brain tumor in adults). An effective autophagy function may protect cells against the consequences of gene mutation and altered signal pathways leading to tumor initiation, promotion, and progression toward highly aggressive behaviors, such as enhanced proliferation, infiltration, and metastases. Moreover, autophagy activation has been extensively reported as able to modulate effectiveness of current anticancer agents, such as chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, target therapy, and immunotherapy.

40|$|Abstract Background Methylotrophic yeast species (e. g. Hansenula polymorpha, Pichia pastoris) {{can grow}} on {{methanol}} as sole source of carbon and energy. These organisms are important cell factories {{for the production}} of recombinant proteins, but are also used in fundamental research as model organisms to study peroxisome biology. During exponential growth on glucose, cells of H. polymorpha typically contain a single, small peroxisome that is redundant for growth while on methanol multiple, enlarged peroxisomes are present. These organelles are crucial to support growth on methanol, as they contain key enzymes of methanol metabolism. In this study, changes in the transcriptional profiles during adaptation of H. polymorpha cells from glucose- to methanol-containing media were investigated using DNA-microarray analyses. Results Two hours after the shift of cells from glucose to methanol nearly 20 % (1184 genes) of the approximately 6000 annotated H. polymorpha genes were significantly upregulated with at least a two-fold differential expression. Highest upregulation (> 300 -fold) was observed for the genes encoding the transcription factor Mpp 1 and formate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the methanol dissimilation pathway. Upregulated genes also included genes encoding other enzymes of methanol metabolism as well as of peroxisomal β-oxidation. A moderate increase in transcriptional levels (up to 4 -fold) was observed for several PEX genes, which are involved in peroxisome biogenesis. Only PEX 11 and PEX 32 were higher upregulated. In addition, an increase was observed in expression of the several ATG genes, which encode proteins involved in <b>autophagy</b> and <b>autophagy</b> <b>processes.</b> The strongest upregulation was observed for ATG 8 and ATG 11. Approximately 20 % (1246 genes) of the genes were downregulated. These included glycolytic genes as well as genes involved in transcription and translation. Conclusion Transcriptional profiling of H. polymorpha cells shifted from glucose to methanol showed the expected downregulation of glycolytic genes together with upregulation of the methanol utilisation pathway. This serves as a confirmation and validation of the array data obtained. Consistent with this, also various PEX genes were upregulated. The strong upregulation of ATG genes is possibly due to induction of <b>autophagy</b> <b>processes</b> related to remodeling of the cell architecture required to support growth on methanol. These processes may also be responsible for the enhanced peroxisomal β-oxidation, as autophagy leads to recycling of membrane lipids.
