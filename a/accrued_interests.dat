50|$|As the {{bankruptcy}} of Landsbanki was one of 3 big systemically important financial institutions going bankrupt {{within a few days}} in Iceland, the Tryggingarsjóður however had already been drained from capital reserves, and had no money left to repay the legally required €4.0bn of minimum deposit guarantees to the 343,306 foreign retail customers from United Kingdom and Netherlands, who had lost all their €6.7bn of deposits in the Icesave branch of Landsbanki. Because nothing was expected immediately to be repaid by any Icelandic institutions/authorities, both the Dutch and British state decided to step in and cover all these account losses in full; while however at the same time demanding the Icelandic state should sign a loan guarantee agreement concerning repayment of the €4.0bn of Icelandic minimum deposit guarantees plus <b>accrued</b> <b>interests.</b> Subsequently the terms for these loan guarantee agreements were negotiated between the states in the so-called Icesave bills, where Iceland to meet its obligations was offered a £2.35bn (€2.7bn) loan by UK and a €1.3bn loan by the Netherlands. Repayment of the €4.0bn of minimum deposit guarantees, was supposed to happen partly/entirely through the liquidation of remaining positive assets by the Landsbanki receivership in 2009-2015, with the Icelandic state only to overtake/guarantee for the potential remaining repayments in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{recently}} discovered design {{flaws in the}} Icesave bill 2 agreement, which had put an equal stand to the priority of all the creditor's [...] "priority claims" [...] towards the Landsbanki receivership, meaning that the Icelandic state as an unwanted consequence suddenly faced much higher liabilities compared to how the Icelandic law normally would regulate the matter, it was now a fact in February 2010 that basically all Icelandic politicians had started to recommend the Icelandic people to vote no for the Icesave bill 2 in the referendum being scheduled to take place on 6 March 2010. On this background, it was decided by the Icelandic politicians instead {{to start a new}} round of negotiations to attempt fixing the issue and reach a new better compromise in the Icesave dispute. An Icelandic delegation was sent to London with a proposal for a new repayment agreement to remove the unwanted negative effects for the Icelandic state, while solving the dispute by still accepting the Icelandic state make a guarantee for a full repayment of the €4bn big loan to cover the minimum deposit guarantee obligation. This new Icelandic offer, was described as focusing to maximize the amount of Landsbanki assets received by the UK and the Netherlands, by secreting and transferring asset values (equal to their claims without <b>accrued</b> <b>interests)</b> from the Landsbanki receivership over to a public owned liquidation unit in the two countries.|$|E

5000|$|After the referendum, new {{negotiations}} commenced. On 16 February 2011, the Icelandic parliament {{agreed to}} a repayment deal with the votes 44 for and 16 against, formally entitled Act 13/2011 but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Icesave bill 3. The third version of the Icesave bill entailed new terms and conditions for repayment of the full and remaining Icesave debt to UK and Netherlands, throughout a period stretching from one to 30 years starting from 2016 (with the length depending on how much time Iceland would need to repay its remaining obligations), to the sound of a fixed constant interest rate at 3.2% for 2009-15, which then ultimately would be substituted by a variable interest rate for the years beyond. Another improvement compared to the previous Icesave bills, was that it included an interest rate moratorium (rate being fixed to 0%) for the first three quarters of 2009. The yearly repayment amount would also be capped at the lowest of these two ceilings: Maximum 1.3% of Icelands GDP (i.e. €0.13bn in 2011), or maximum 5% of the total Icelandic government revenue from the previous year (i.e. €0.23bn in 2011). A minimum repayment was however also guaranteed by the mutual agreement, as it could never be less compared to a situation with traditional amortisation over 30 years. Finally the new deal also in practise had removed the demand for equal footing for all [...] "priority claims" [...] towards the Landsbanki receivership, meaning that it was now likely the receivership would repay 100% of the €4bn of owed minimum deposit guarantees during 2011-15, with the <b>accrued</b> <b>interests</b> being the only remaining responsibility for the Icelandic state subsequently to guarantee and cover. It was noted in the bill, that the expected remaining liabilities for the Icelandic state would now only amount to ISK 47bn (€0.24bn) in 2016, meaning it was now likely for the Icelandic state to repay all the remaining liabilities after only two years of amortisation in 2016 and 2017. The Icelandic president however once again refused to sign the new deal on 20 February 2011, and thus triggered a new Icesave referendum to be called. A referendum was held on 9 April 2011, asking the Icelandic electorate to vote yes/no for Icesave bill 3. A group of 15 concerned citizens organised under the name of Advice.is and campaigned for a No in Iceland and internationally.|$|E
40|$|The {{dissolution}} of the federation, war in the immediate environment, the UN sanctions, scarce investment {{as well as the}} NATO air-attacks had disastrous consequences for trade and financial relations of Serbia with foreign countries. Simultaneously, its foreign debt rose sharply due to the <b>accrued</b> <b>interests,</b> being at the end of 2000 substantially higher than Serbian gross domestic product. Thanks to the write-off of 51 % of debt towards the Paris club, a windfall of donations and obtaining new favorable medium-term and long-term credits, the condition of Serbia's international financial relations considerably improved in the period 2001 - 2003, thus enabling it to run a foreign-exchange surplus during this period. Due to the policy of de facto floating exchange rate, sudden and drastic liberalization of imports and the lack of non-tariff protection, exports of goods and services in the last three years, contrary to plans, have increased much more slowly than imports, resulting in a large increase in growth and an enormously high level of trade deficit unsustainable in the long run. Due to new credits euro-denominated and other foreign-currency denominated debts being converted into the increasingly weaker dollar and the accrual of interests Serbian foreign debt increased sharply reaching an all-time high {{at the end of last}} year and being twice as high as was officially predicted three years before. The level of foreign debt is very high. Trade deficit and foreign indebtedness have become the most serious problems of Serbian economy and unless appropriate measures are taken, it will soon face a serious debt crisis...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} file-sharing {{networks}} demonstrates {{that there is}} a huge potential market for digital music services, if the music industry can find a service model that is attractive to listeners. The concept of digital distribution is appealing to the music industry, because it suggests the possibility of direct access to the consumer. In this thesis, we present Smart Radio, a prototype for an alternative distribution approach, one in which the consumers themselves are producers, building playlists of music which can be streamed to like-minded listeners. In this approach the service provider is an enabler of community and social processes, allowing information and recommendations to flow between users of the system, rather than engaging in targeted marketing. However, developing recommendation and personalisation techniques for music systems is problematic. Whereas information retrieval systems use keyword extraction to represent the subject matter of a document for indexing and retrieval, the comparable process for audio artefacts is still a subject of much research. The alternative is to rely on human input for content-description which can be a knowledge-intensive process. Automated Collaborative Filtering (ACF) is a technique which uses user ratings as a means of countering the problem of content elicitation. One serious drawback with ACF {{is that it is not}} sensitive to a user?s interests at a particular moment. ACF recommendation sets typically contain a mix of items reflecting the user?s <b>accrued</b> <b>interests,</b> rather than localised interests. We solve this problem using a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) technique, in which we rank ACF recommendations according to their similarity to the user context. We call this technique context-boosted ACF. We define the context using a case-like representation of the user?s last playlist. The case representation describes the composition of a playlist in terms of the basic meta-tags we have been able to extract from each mp 3 file associated with the playlist. We consider the light-weight case representation we use to be appropriate for an extension to ACF, which is often used in domains where content description is scarce. Increasingly, there has been a demand for objective evaluation criteria for automated recommendation systems. Conventional off-line techniques are not suitable for directly comparing recommendation strategies that produce different types of ranking, such as ACF and context-boosted ACF. We introduce a novel on-line evaluation technique in which two algorithms simultaneously compete to provide the user with recommendations. Unlike the off-line analysis, the on-line methodology judges the relative degree of success of each strategy according to whether recommendations were used by the on-line user. Our experiment, conducted over 15 weeks, found context-boosted ACF to be significantly more popular than ACF for all usage ranges. We demonstrate that the ACF mechanism is similar to an interactive CBR technique called case completion in which an incomplete target query is incrementally filled out in an interactive iv dialogue with the user. Using this insight we address some of the problems inherent in ACF systems such as query efficiency and memory overhead by applying techniques used in CBR. We implement our ACF component using a Case Retrieval Net (CRN) which reduces memory overhead by storing each feature-value pair once. We demonstrate how the calculation of the Pearson coefficient can be distributed among the nodes of the CRN. It has been recognised in ACF literature that the use of this measure is a computational bottleneck when calculating neighbours from a large set of users. Accordingly, we showed how retrieval time is speeded up because local similarity calculations are performed once for each node and distributed to indexed cases. Given that the structure of CRNs can be adapted for parallel processing, we suggest that this technique can be extended for large ACF data sets...|$|E
