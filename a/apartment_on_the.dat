There were also four wine cellars on the same level. The cellars belonged to the apartments on the upper levels. On the third floor, the apartment consisted of eight residential rooms, a foyer, a kitchen, dish washing room, two rooms for servants, a bathroom, and two toilets. This apartment was placed slightly lower than the level of Bankova Street, from the front entrance.|$|E

On the floor above was an apartment similar in size and design to Horodecki's apartment. The <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top floor had one less room; {{to make up for}} this, there was a connecting terrace which provided a panoramic view of the city.|$|E
5|$|The story flashes back to March 1983 where Homer, Marge and Bart {{originally}} {{lived in}} an <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower east side of Springfield. Homer and Marge {{had to cope with}} Bart, who was two years old at the time. Marge reveals to her husband and their son that she is pregnant again, and points out to Homer that they will probably need a bigger place.

5|$|An <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 16th and 17th floors {{has been}} the {{official}} residence of the premier of Quebec since 2001. These two floors, the highest habitable ones since the 18th floor is taken up by machinery, had originally been reserved for a CDP executive suite. There had been a previous attempt at offering the premier an official residence. In 1994, the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce had bought a large residence at 1080 rue des Braves and donated it to then premier Jacques Parizeau. There were issues of security and neighbour relationships, however, and Lucien Bouchard declined to use it. He {{lived in a small}} apartment on Parliament Hill for most of his mandate.|$|E

5|$|His parents' {{marriage}} {{dissolved in}} July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, {{and moved to}} America {{to start a new}} life. The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life. Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, {{but when it came to}} light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, after Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party won {{the federal}} election, Edith Frank and the {{children}} went to stay with Edith's mother, Rosa, in Aachen. Otto Frank remained in Frankfurt, but after receiving an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, he moved there to organize the business and to arrange accommodations for his family. He began working at the Opekta Works, a company that sold fruit extract pectin, and found an <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Merwedeplein (Merwede Square) in the Rivierenbuurt neighbourhood of Amsterdam. By February 1934, Edith {{and the children}} had joined him in Amsterdam. The Franks were among 300,000 Jews who fled Germany between 1933 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{was born}} in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Julius Oppenheimer, a wealthy Jewish textile {{importer}} who had immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1888, and Ella Friedman, a painter. Julius came to America with no money, no baccalaureate studies, and {{no knowledge of the}} English language. He got a job in a textile company and within a decade was an executive with the company. Ella was from Baltimore. The Oppenheimers were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews. In 1912 the family moved to an <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 11th floor of 155 Riverside Drive, near West 88th Street, Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses. Their art collection included works by Pablo Picasso and Édouard Vuillard, and at least three original paintings by Vincent van Gogh. Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist.|$|E

5|$|Originally, Walter Chrysler had {{a two-story}} <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 69th and 70th floors with a {{fireplace}} {{and a private}} office. The office also contained a gymnasium and the tallest bathrooms in the world. Chrysler also had a triplex unit on the 58th through 60th floors, which served as his residence. However, Chrysler did not use his gym much, instead choosing {{to stay at the}} Chrysler Corporation's headquarters in Detroit. Later, the 69th and 70th floors were converted into a dental clinic. In 2005, a New York Times report found that one of the dentists, Charles Weiss, had operated at the clinic's current rooftop location since 1969. The office still had the suite's original bathroom and gymnasium.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah's {{given name}} at birth was Mahomedali, and he was born most likely in 1876, to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi, Sindh, now in Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's family was from a Gujarati Ismaili background, though Jinnah later {{followed}} the Twelver Shi'a teachings. According to Akbar Ahmed however, Jinnah moved to the Sunni sect early in life. Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background, {{his father was a}} merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state of Gondal (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his mother was also of that village. They had moved to Karachi in 1875, having married before their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay. Jinnah was the second child; he had three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah. The parents were native Gujarati speakers, and the children also came to speak Kutchi and English. Except for Fatima, little is known of his siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.|$|E
5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had {{turned a blind eye}} to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E

5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was born}} Neumann János Lajos to a wealthy, acculturated and non-observant Jewish family (in Hungarian {{the family name}} comes first. His given names equate to John Louis in English). His Hebrew name was Yonah. Von Neumann's was born in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the eldest of three children. He had two younger brothers: Michael, born in 1907, and Nicholas, {{who was born in}} 1911. His father, Neumann Miksa (English: Max Neumann) was a banker, who held a {{doctorate}} in law. He had moved to Budapest from Pécs {{at the end of the}} 1880s. Miksa's father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of Szerencs), Zemplén County, northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann); her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels. Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von Neumann's family occupied an 18-room <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top floor.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the true}} {{extent of their}} {{financial}} rewards from the tour, the Mozart family continued to live in their cramped <b>apartment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Getreidegasse, while Leopold resumed his duties as a court musician. However, travel and public display dominated {{the next six years}} of Wolfgang's life. In September 1767 the family was on the move again, this time to Vienna, remaining there (apart from an enforced evacuation during a smallpox epidemic) until January 1769. In December of the same year Leopold and Wolfgang left for Italywithout Nannerl who, now 18, was no longer exhibitable as a child wonder. They were away for sixteen months, and returned to Milan in August 1771 for five months, to attend rehearsals and the performance of Wolfgang's opera Ascanio in Alba. A third and final visit to Italy, from October 1772 until March 1773, was the last of the extended trips; the new Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Hieronymous Colloredo, had distinct views about the roles of his court musicians, which precluded the freedoms that Leopold—and now Wolfgang, himself employed by the court—had formerly enjoyed.|$|E
