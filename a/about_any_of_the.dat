5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other homicides, and only became interested in this one {{when it became clear}} that one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11. That's one thing.|$|E
5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have been informed <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed {{in time for the}} fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} the Umayyads {{were not aware of}} the true {{strength}} of the Franks. The Umayyad forces were not particularly concerned <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Germanic tribes, including the Franks, and the Arab chronicles of that age show that awareness of the Franks as a growing military power only came after the Battle of Tours.|$|E
25|$|Although {{originally}} decrying Pantera as a rip-off {{of their}} sound, lead vocalist of Exhorder, Kyle Thomas, {{has stated that}} he does not care <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criticism and is sick of seeing Exhorder's name tied to Pantera's. He also stated that he and the members of Pantera were great friends who used to tour together, and that he mourns the loss of Dimebag Darrell.|$|E
25|$|Hemmer {{noted that}} the coal company, which had been quite {{punctual}} in its dealings with the media throughout the rescue attempt, had not given any information to corroborate the allegations that 12 miners had been rescued, and that the always-available Manchin {{was nowhere to be}} found, yet the cable news channels continued to report the story anyway until doctors in a hospital many miles away stated that they had had no contact with emergency service personnel <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miners except for McCloy.|$|E

25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E

She said her initial reaction was surprise and [...] "a certain air of disbelief" [...] because during her 44-minute interview for the story, Erdely never brought up Jackie or asked <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allegations made in the article. Sullivan said: [...] "I was plainly not prepared for what the story looked like. Nor do I think her characterization of my interview was fair." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune {{commented that}} [...] "Smiles don’t come easy for Madonna. [...] Instead, {{there are usually}} smirks, sneers, pouts, leers and thin-lipped, tough-as-nails {{displays}} of contempt for anyone who would dare mess with her. Madonna, she's one tough dominatrix, and she's got better developed biceps than just <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fans who filled the United Center on Sunday {{for the first of}} two concerts." [...] Adrian Thrills from Daily Mail commented [...] "Nobody does a big stadium show quite like Madonna. She might be pop's greatest female icon, but she does not rest on her laurels and this was a theatrical, two-hour blockbuster, featuring 16 dancers and a 12-piece band." ...|$|E

500|$|Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle {{called the}} episode [...] "pretty good" [...] {{noting that he}} [...] "wasn't crazy <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs" [...] but enjoyed the plot development, {{particularly}} the confrontation between Terri and Will. Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal {{was happy to see}} the [...] "convoluted" [...] fake pregnancy storyline end, and called the performance of [...] "Jump" [...] "lively" [...] and the stunts [...] "incredible", though he wrote that it was [...] "the only memorable song of the episode". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted that in previous reviews, he had [...] "never been shy of [...] disdain for Mrs. Schuester", but that his hatred of Terri [...] "vanished" [...] once the lie was over, praising the confrontation between Will and Terri. MTV Aly Semigran praised both actors, especially [...] "a devastated Matthew Morrison" [...] for having [...] "nailed just what a scary, sad, and life-altering moment" [...] it was. She deemed [...] "Jump" [...] both [...] "delightful" [...] and the [...] "giddiest musical number on the show to date".|$|E

50|$|There is {{considerable}} argument <b>about</b> whether <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health bills currently before congress will introduce rationing.

However, Politico has pointed out that all health systems contain elements of rationing (such as coverage rules) and the public health care plan will therefore implicitly involve some element of rationing.|$|R

50|$|The Commission {{protected}} National Lottery players {{by ensuring}} that clear information was provided to them; and by setting rules and procedures for each game.

2500|$|Father Hennepin {{wrote that}} Le Griffon {{was lost in}} a violent storm. Some charged fur traders, and even Jesuits with her destruction.

Leach testified that through this role, Fred had gradually begun to view her as a confidante, and had confided in her that on the evening prior to his 25 February arrest, he and Rose had formed a pact whereby he would take full responsibility for all the murders, many of which he had privately described to her as being [...] "some of Rose's mistakes". He had further divulged that Rose had indeed murdered Charmaine while he had been incarcerated, and had also murdered Shirley Robinson. Fred had also confided that although he had actually dismembered the victims, Rose had participated in the mutilation and dismemberment of Shirley Robinson, and had personally removed Robinson's unborn child from her womb after her death. In reference to the remaining eight murders for which Rose was charged, Leach testified that Fred had confided Rose had [...] "played a major part" [...] in these murders.|$|E
