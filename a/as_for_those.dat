The facility in Intramuros was burned on February 8, 1944. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> in Sampaloc, though they were not destroyed, some portions were slightly damaged during the shellings, including the rooms on the West of the Main Building, some rooms of the Education building, and the University gymnasium.|$|E

40|$|The discriminatory {{power of}} ten factors has been {{explored}} {{in relation to the}} presence or absence of muscular rigidity in patients with Huntington's disease. The sex and neurological sign of an affected parent were the only two significant determinants of rigidity or choreoathetosis in offspring. It was shown, using the Mantel-Haenszel method of adjusting for confounding variables that the risk of a patient displaying rigidity (and thereby having a graver prognosis) is five times <b>as</b> great <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with rigid parents <b>as</b> it is <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with non-rigid parents. Additionally, the risk of a patient displaying rigidity is more than three times <b>as</b> great <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with affected fathers <b>as</b> it is <b>for</b> <b>those</b> with affected mothers. Some implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Recent {{focus has}} been to reduce therapy for low and {{intermediate}} risk neuroblastoma while maintaining survival rates at 90%. A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort. Future plans are to intensify treatment for those patients with aberration of 1p36 or 11q23 chromosomes as well <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who lack early response to treatment.|$|E

Bicalutamide specifically may also be a safer drug than cyproterone acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity relative to cyproterone acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, bicalutamide does have a very small risk of hepatotoxicity itself, as well as of interstitial pneumonitis.|$|E

500|$|Arguably, the cadre most historically-associated {{with this}} method of {{execution}} were the foreign-occupiers and subordinate collaborators prosecuting the British-occupation of India. In what the British-occupiers imagined would convey their willingness to mete out violence, revenge and humiliation on the resistance in India following the First War of Indian Independence, [...] "blowing from a gun" [...] was the method they chose to execute soldiers fighting for Indian liberation as well <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> natives found guilty of desertion. Using the methods previously practised by the Mughals, the British began implementing blowing from guns {{in the latter half}} of the 18th century, with the most intense period of use being during the First War of Indian Independence, when both the British-occupiers as well as soldiers fighting for the liberation of India, used it frequently.|$|E

500|$|A few radical {{philosophers}} like Xenophanes of Colophon {{were already}} beginning to label the poets' tales as blasphemous lies in the 6th century BC; Xenophanes had complained that Homer and Hesiod attributed to the gods [...] "all that is shameful and disgraceful among men; they steal, commit adultery, and deceive one another". This line of thought found its most sweeping expression in Plato's Republic and Laws. Plato created his own allegorical myths (such as the vision of Er in the Republic), attacked the traditional tales of the gods' tricks, thefts and adulteries as immoral, and objected to their central role in literature. Plato's criticism was the first serious challenge to the Homeric mythological tradition, referring to the myths as [...] "old wives' chatter". For his part Aristotle criticized the Pre-socratic quasi-mythical philosophical approach and underscored that [...] "Hesiod and the theological writers were concerned only with what seemed plausible to themselves, and had no respect for us ... But it is not worth taking seriously writers who show off in the mythical style; <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who do proceed by proving their assertions, we must cross-examine them".|$|E
