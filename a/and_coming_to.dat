5|$|Route31 {{crosses the}} Musconetcong River into Washington Township, Warren County, where it heads north into the {{agricultural}} Musconetcong Valley. It heads into Washington Borough, {{where the road}} becomes four lanes, passing under Norfolk Southern's Washington Secondary and crossing Route57 (Washington Avenue). Past the Route57 intersection, Route31 narrows to three lanes, and becomes a two-lane road again as it crosses back into Washington Township at the Essex Road intersection. It heads into farmland before turning northwest and heading across Oxford Mountain, entering Mansfield Township. While crossing Oxford Mountain, Route31 skirts along the border between Mansfield Township and Washington Township. The route enters Oxford Township, where it heads through the community of Oxford as a four-lane road. Route31 continues north through a mix of woods and agricultural areas past Oxford, crossing into White Township at the East Quarry Road intersection <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> its terminus at US46.|$|E
5|$|At this point, DE 404 {{continues}} northeast concurrent with US 9 on East Market Street {{through the}} downtown area. The road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision railroad line {{and runs through}} residential areas with a few businesses. US 9/DE 404 heads east-northeast out of Georgetown and becomes Lewes Georgetown Highway, passing through farmland and woodland with some development. The two routes intersect the eastern terminus of US 9 Truck/DE 404 Truck a short distance east of Georgetown. In Gravel Hill, the road intersects DE 30. Following this intersection, US 9/DE 404 passes through more rural land, reaching a junction with DE 5 in Harbeson. Past here, the two routes cross a Delaware Coast Line Railroad line. Farther east, residential development near the road begins to increase. Upon reaching {{the area of the}} Five Points intersection in Nassau, US 9/DE 404 runs past homes and businesses, widening into a divided highway <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> an intersection with DE 1D/DE 23. DE 23 joins US 9/DE 404 for a concurrency on a four-lane divided highway before the road comes to a junction with DE 1. Here, DE 23/DE 404 ends, US 9 Bus. continues northeast, and US 9 heads east for a concurrency with DE 1.

5|$|Being {{the head}} {{official}} for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo {{was an avid}} scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock. For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time. Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely. This came about due {{to the position of}} the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of the pole star (halfway between Tian shu, at −350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.|$|E

5|$|Domitian {{appears to}} have met with several conspiracies during his reign, one of which led to his {{eventual}} assassination in 96. The first significant revolt arose on 1 January 89, when the governor of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and his two legions at Mainz, Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, rebelled against the Roman Empire {{with the aid of}} the Chatti. The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain, although it {{appears to have}} been planned well in advance. The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of appeasement towards Decebalus. At any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, whilst Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard. By a stroke of luck, a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> Saturninus' aid. Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.|$|E
5|$|Here, {{the road}} heads through {{residential}} areas with some commercial establishments, crossing County Route 610 {{in the center}} of town. As the road continues north, it heads through a mix of homes and farmland with a few commercial areas. Route 47 enters inhabited areas again as it crosses into Glassboro. The road continues north and enters business areas before heading into neighborhoods <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> an intersection with High Street, which runs east as U.S. Route 322/County Route 536 and west as County Route 641. Here, U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 join Route 47 for a concurrency. The three routes head through commercial areas before U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 turn to the west on West Avenue. Past this intersection, Route 47 continues north as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, passing more buildings. The route intersects County Route 553 and forms a concurrency with that route which lasts until County Route 553 turns north onto Woodbury Avenue. Along this concurrency, the road widens to five lanes as it passes a couple shopping centers. Past the concurrency, Route 47 runs north through suburban localities as a two-lane road, entering Washington Township at the crossing of Kressey Lake. In Washington Township, the road passes more populated areas as well as businesses. Route 47 runs to the east of Bethel Mill County Park before entering more residential areas, crossing County Route 635. The road passes through a mix of homes and commercial establishments with some farmland and wooded areas as it continues through more of Washington Township.|$|E
5|$|McCudden joined No. 20 Squadron on 8 July 1916. The {{unit was}} {{equipped}} with Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 and flew from Clairmarais, near Saint-Omer. He flew his first operational sortie two days later and continued as the Battle of the Somme raged. The Squadron was ordered to intercept and shoot down German reconnaissance aircraft. He patrolled the Ypres and Roulers region. He did not spot any enemy reconnaissance machines but did {{come into contact with}} a single Fokker near Lille. Flying in formation, the British were well placed to deal with lone German fighters since they could use their gunners to form a formidable defence screen. This particular German would climb above the British, make a diving attack at the rear-most aircraft and dive away if he did not score a decisive hit. Two days later McCudden ran out of fuel in the Lille district. Disorientated because of heavy mist, he force-landed in Allied territory, crashing <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> halt in the garden of a French farmhouse. Little damage was done to the machine. On 2 August he took part in an operation to bomb the Zeppelin sheds at Brussels. The flight was unmolested, though the familiar lone Fokker made an appearance and then withdrew without attacking.|$|E

5|$|PA 997 {{begins at}} the Maryland state line in Washington Township, Franklin County, where the road {{continues}} south into that state as MD 64. From the state line, the route heads north-northwest as two-lane undivided Anthony Highway through farmland with some trees and homes. The road crosses the East Branch Little Antietam Creek and soon enters the borough of Waynesboro, where the name becomes State Hill Road, where it passes residences and commercial development. PA 997 curves northwest and immediately turns northeast onto Clayton Avenue, passing homes <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> an intersection with PA 16. Here, the route turns northwest to form a concurrency with PA 16 on East Main Street, passing homes and businesses before continuing into the downtown area. At the center of town, PA 997 splits from PA 16 by turning northeast onto North Church Street, heading through more residential areas with a few businesses. The route leaves Waynesboro for Washington Township again and becomes Anthony Highway, passing more development before heading into a mix of farms and woods. The road crosses into Quincy Township and curves northwest and north again as it runs through more rural areas with some residential and commercial development, passing through the communities of Quincy and Knepper.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E
