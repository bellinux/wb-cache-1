40|$|Activated sludge was {{successfully}} incorporated as the biocatalyst in the fast, ferricyanide-mediated {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (FM-BOD) bioassay. Sludge preparation procedures were optimized for three potential biocatalysts; aeration basin mixed liquor, aerobic digester sludge and <b>return</b> <b>activated</b> sludge. Following a 24 h starving period, the <b>return</b> <b>activated</b> sludge and mixed liquor sludges reported the highest oxidative degradation of a standard glucose/glutamic acid (GGA) mixture and the <b>return</b> <b>activated</b> sludge also recorded the lowest endogenous FM-respiration rate. Dynamic working ranges up to 170 mg BOD 5 L- 1 for OECD standard solutions and 300 mg BOD 5 L- 1 for GGA were obtained. This is a considerable improvement upon the BOD 5 standard assay and most other rapid BOD techniques. Time-series ferricyanide-mediated oxidation of the OECD 170 standard approached that of the GGA 198 standard after 3 - 6 h. This is noteworthy given the OECD standard is formulated as a synthetic sewage analogue. A highly significant correlation with the BOD 5 standard method (n = 35, p < 0. 001, R = 0. 952) was observed for a wide diversity of real wastewater samples. The mean degradation efficiency was indistinguishable from that observed for the BOD 5 assay.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{corporate}} real estate ownership negatively affects shareholder value. If this is indeed the case, then why do most firms own and use substantial amounts of real estate? Borrowing from the IO literature on entry deterrence, I argue that product market competition affects the relation between real estate ownership and expected stock <b>returns.</b> <b>Capacity</b> expansions often require substantial real estate investments. In competitive industries where potential benefits from investments in excess capacity are competed away, firms that own a lot of real estate suffer a value discount. On the other hand, investors are likely to favorably view real estate ownership for firms operating in concentrated industries since investments in additional capacity may insulate profit margins by deterring new entries. Using a large sample of industrial firms from 1973 to 2010, this study finds the documented positive relation between real estate ownership and stock returns to be specific to competitive industries. In concentrated industries, real estate ownership is largely negatively related to stock returns. This finding is robust to various definitions of real estate and industry classifications. In fact, controlling for industry structure alleviates the identification problem. This is the first study to examine the potential role of product market competition in the interaction between real estate and shareholder value. ...|$|R
