500|$|During 1940, Friedman was {{appointed}} {{an assistant professor}} teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and {{decided to return to}} government service. From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government, as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation. He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war. He later said, [...] "I have no apologies for it, but I really wish we hadn't found it necessary <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> there were some way of abolishing withholding now." ...|$|E
500|$|Released {{during the}} {{dominant}} Gangsta rap era of West Coast hip hop, Bizarre Ride {{was described as}} [...] "refreshing" [...] due to its playful, light-hearted humor and lush, jazzy production. Along with albums such as To Whom It May Concern... by Freestyle Fellowship, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> My Brother George Was Here by Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Bizarre Ride helped establish a new alternative scene on the West Coast, followed by artists such as Hieroglyphics, The Coup and Jurassic 5. Despite its wide critical acclaim, the album produced only moderate sales, peaking at No. 75 on the Billboard 200 album chart in 1993. However, {{on the strength of}} the second single, [...] "Passin' Me By", the album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 1996.|$|E
500|$|Rob Owen, {{television}} {{editor of}} the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said that the documentary provided an interesting, entertaining and detailed look {{behind the scenes of}} the show. Owen said that this was [...] "rare, because TV doesn't usually reveal details about itself. It's nice to see PBS pulling back the curtain on its competition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> it happened more often." [...] Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News praised it, calling it [...] "a documentary as rare to public TV as Homicide is to commercial television", but said that it [...] "falls short of being definitive" [...] because it cannot address all elements of the series due to its brief running time. Several commentators praised the humorous scene in the documentary in which Yoshimura goes line-by-line through his script and replaces curse words based on orders from NBC censors.|$|E

500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E
500|$|In October Robert Dudley {{returned}} to court, many believed, [...] "in great hope {{to marry the}} Queen". Elizabeth's affection and favour towards him was undiminished, and, importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert, she declared the inquest had shown [...] "the matter … to be contrary to which was reported" [...] and to [...] "neither touch his honesty nor her honour." [...] However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, {{which seems to have}} convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had no illusions about his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: [...] "God's will be done; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> he had made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me." [...] In September 1561, a month after the coroner's verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley's principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.|$|E

Harvard later commented in an interview, [...] "Fringe was so much fun and not even stressful compared to [...] Hamill. It was very fast and rapid. Playing the dead guy was very easy. Working with Anna Torv was so much fun, she is a great, great actress and very sweet. I did not think she would be that kind of person." [...] He continued, [...] "There was a stunt which {{she did not want to}} do herself, but I told her 'You want to be authentic so I want you to pull me,' so she obliged.

500|$|In a 2010 Oprah interview, Presley {{admitted}} that they spent {{four years after the}} divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up", until she felt she [...] "had to push it away." [...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him.

500|$|Auditions {{were held}} for the part of Sarah, the eldest {{daughter}} of the Barnes family and actress Loui Batley secured the role. On 1 July 2009, Digital Spy reported that Loui Batley had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of}} the year. Loui's decision matched co-worker Zoë Lister (Zoë Carpenter). The Hollyoaks website officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Batley and Lister would leave towards the end of that year. Their final storyline was described as a [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", stating that either Sarah or Zoë would die. Batley wanted to quit the serial in December 2008 when her contract ran out. Kirkwood asked her to stay another six months with the promise of a good exit storyline. The plot also involved Zoe and Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). She made it clear to Kirkwood and new executive producer Lucy Allan that she would leave afterward. Allan then came up with the idea of writing Batley out of the serial in its sister show Hollyoaks Later. Upon hearing Kirkwood's ideas for her exit storyline, Batley said: [...] "I've been there for quite a while and it was a great ending for the character - I couldn't have asked for a better way to go..." [...] Hollyoaks Later producer Bryan Kirkwood said: [...] "Loui's been brilliant in Hollyoaks and she's massively underrated. She's been at the centre of some of the biggest storylines on the main show. She never turned in a performance less than top-notch <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> she had a little more recognition for that. She's a very strong actress and it's been fantastic to work with her - and great to be involved in her exit." ...|$|E
500|$|By June {{the stench}} {{from the river}} had become so bad that {{business}} in Parliament was affected, and the curtains on the river {{side of the building}} were soaked in lime chloride to overcome the smell. The measure was not successful, and discussions were held about possibly moving the business of government to Oxford or St Albans. The Examiner reported that Disraeli, on attending one of the committee rooms, left shortly afterwards with {{the other members of the}} committee, [...] "with a mass of papers in one hand, and with his pocket handkerchief applied to his nose" [...] because the smell was so bad. The disruption to its legislative work led to questions being raised in the House of Commons. According to Hansard, the Member of Parliament (MP) John Brady informed Manners that members were unable to use either the Committee Rooms or the Library because of the stench, and asked the minister [...] "if the noble Lord has taken any measures for mitigating the effluvium and discontinuing the nuisance". Manners replied that the Thames was not under his jurisdiction. Four days later a second MP said to Manners that [...] "By a perverse ingenuity, one of the noblest of rivers has been changed into a cesspool, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to ask whether Her Majesty's Government intend to take any steps to remedy the evil?" [...] Manners pointed out [...] "that Her Majesty's Government have nothing whatever to do with the state of the Thames". The satirical magazine Punch commented that [...] "The one absorbing topic in both Houses of Parliament... was the Conspiracy to Poison question. Of the guilt of that old offender, Father Thames, there was the most ample evidence".|$|E
