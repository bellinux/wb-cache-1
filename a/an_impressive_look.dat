Haggard and red-eyed, his hopes plainly had deserted him, his {{sanguine}} mood was gone, and all his worst misgivings had come back.

50|$|The 1919-20 season opened {{well with}} good sized crowds being entertained by a winning team. Stoke {{collected}} maximum points in eleven {{of the first}} 15 matches and they only failed to score in one. Bob Whittingham, who {{had been such a}} stalwart during the war, rejoined the club on a permanent transfer from Chelsea {{and at the same time}} (October) David Brown arrived from Dundee to give Stoke's forward line <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>look.</b> But amazingly and completely out of context, Stoke's fortunes took a dramatic turn as they lost the next five matches. The team did manage to recover and in the end finished in 10th spot. A mid-table position was acceptable since the club had sought, initially, to consolidate its position in the Second Division. But the supporters were disappointed with the end result after such a good start to the season.|$|E

On June 25, 2009, he had his first career walk-off hit, off Cleveland Indians closer Matt Herges. Teammates Jack Wilson and Eric Hinske both singled prior to McCutchen, who then hit a bloop single to left to score Wilson for the winning run.

5000|$|Stoke then {{travelled}} to West Brom {{looking to}} keep their impressive run of 1 defeat in 24 matches against the Baggies going. After a dour first half Stoke were awarded a penalty {{early in the second}} half when Scott Carson came off his line and fouled Jones, Matthew Etherington made no mistake from the spot to score his first of the season. West Brom came back at Stoke through and went close through Somen Tchoyi before Stoke were given a second penalty when Simon Cox took down Whitehead and substitute Walters sent Carson the wrong way. Stoke gave the scoreline <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>look</b> when Walters scored his second goal to make it 3-0 to the Potters. The result also gave Stoke two new records: the largest away win in the Premier League and the largest top division away win since 1982, as well as {{the first time since the}} 1983-84 season Stoke have won three top-flight matches in a row. Manager Pulis hailed the new records as [...] "A Fantastic Achievement".|$|E
5000|$|Bhura Hayal {{has a very}} {{beautiful}} landscape. The towering minaret of Jamia Masjid (Farooqia), situated {{in the center of}} the village gives it <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>look.</b> On its northern side there are layers of Kahuta, Murree and Kashmir mountains of varying heights. Beautiful low-lying ridge line where in the recent past DHA Islamabad and Bahria Town have developed their housing scheme i.e. [...] "DHA Valley" [...] is just 3-4 Kilometers towards West. Occasionally, on a clear sky day one can see [...] "Faisal Mosque", the main Jamia Mosque of Islamabad towards North West. The peak of Pir Panjal Range is also visible occasionally early in the morning (prior to sunrise only, in the north-east direction). Kallar Syedan a major Potohar town lies on its South Eastern side. A ridge forms a crest line on its immediate East, shielding the view towards Thoa Khalsa. An interesting feature of this ridge line is that it is a watershed to two different rivers i.e. Indus and Jehlum. The water that flows towards East and south of this line goes into Jehlum River, while that flowing in the western and northern directions goes into River Indus. This watershed line then turns towards village Bhura Hayal itself. On a few houses on upper crest of the Bhura Hayal and Maira ( [...] a close by small village), this interesting phenomena can practically be observed where water from roof top goes to Indus River while that from the courtyard to the Jehlum River. Road passing through the village goes to Hijra and Rawalakot in Kashmir. Another road going to Kashmir through Kahuta joins in this road at Beor near River Jehlum. The average temperature in winter remains from 13 to 20 degrees Celsius and in summer from 25 to 38 degrees Celsius. The maximum spell of heat in summer is felt in June, July, August and up to the middle of September only, in all other months the weather remains pleasant. Sehora, Kaka, Rakh, Nullah, Karlahi, Dhaniam, Hallan, Dehri, Mandhar, Qibli, Pari, Aara, Dhok Peeple Wali are some other villages around. Sai, Kot, Bamlot, Mowara,Pamana, are slightly away.|$|E

His plan shows a cruciform church, with a nave 147 feet in length, by 36 feet in width, divided into 7 bays. The chancel is 67 feet long by 30 feet wide. The north and south transepts from chapels accommodating 189 and 146 people respectively. East of the chapels are the vestries and organ chamber, the latter being over the clergy vestry, and speaking into the south chapel and chancel. Only the nave was completed, which is the present cathedral of St John the Evangelist.|$|R

So we found out which way they were coming in, got the gear over the fence and set it up thinking that any minute now, we'll be out of here and it will be all over. But I think the people who saw us - a band set up and playing music - though they must have permission otherwise it's too ridiculous, so they left us to get on with it. So we got what we needed then quickly got out of there." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea was}} the {{brainstorm}} of Harry Hays Lattimore, William Lattimore and anonymous {{partners in the}} Ardsley Park Land Corporation. No one is certain how the Ardsley name evolved though some have theorized that it was borrowed from a British neighborhood. The area was laid out in grids with squares, similar to the plan used in downtown Savannah by Gen. James Edward Oglethorpe, founder of the colony. The northern and western boundaries of Ardsley Park were marked at Estill Avenue and Bull Street by <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> <b>looking</b> retaining wall made of Belgian block {{similar to those used}} as ballast on ships sailing from England. At key intersections stone pillars with Spanish-looking tile roods marked the entrances to the park. Adjacent to Ardsley Park was a much larger piece of acreage known as the Granger Tract. Owner Harvey Granger was something of a transportation visionary who is credited with paving the first concrete road in the state and finishing the Atlantic Coastal Highway, which ultimately connected the seaboard states with Florida.|$|R

50|$|HMS Orlando was a Mersey-class wooden-hulled steam-powered (although fully rigged with sails) screw frigate {{built for}} the Royal Navy from 1856 to 1858 but not {{commissioned}} until 1861.

Prem Panicker of Rediff criticized the film saying [...] "A more taut script, a little less of indulgence in directing, a tad more ruthlessness in editing, and this film could have pulled off a badly needed box office heist." [...] A reviewer at Sify awarded the film three and a half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "A film far ahead of its time in terms of execution, Kaante is a visual delight.

60|$|Evidently, however, Sir David {{was not at}} dinner, a {{circumstance}} sufficiently explained by the other circumstance which constituted our friend's principal knowledge of him--his being ninety years of age. Oliver Lyon had looked forward with great pleasure to the chance of painting a nonagenarian, and though the old man's absence from table {{was something of a}} disappointment (it was an opportunity the less to observe him before going to work), it seemed a sign that he was rather a sacred and perhaps therefore <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> relic. Lyon <b>looked</b> at his son with the greater interest--wondered whether the glazed bloom of his cheek had been transmitted from Sir David. That would be jolly to paint, in the old man--the withered ruddiness of a winter apple, especially if the eye were still alive and the white hair carried out the frosty look. Arthur Ashmore's hair had a midsummer glow, but Lyon was glad his commission had been to delineate the father rather than the son, in spite of his never having seen the one and of the other being seated there before him now in the happy expansion of liberal hospitality.|$|R
