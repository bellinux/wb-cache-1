40|$|The {{construction}} of the EU's area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) has been established around a few common issues of concern. One important pillar is migration, <b>asylum,</b> <b>visa</b> policy and external border control. Another pillar is that of judicial cooperation in criminal {{as well as in}} civil matters. The control of transnational organized crime and terrorism through enhanced police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters forms a fundamental field within the AFSJ.

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{exodus from}} Kosovo {{occurred in the}} winter 2014 / 15, raising urgent questions about its underlying drivers and implications for both Kosovo and the destination countries. This policy brief provides a first-hand qualitative snapshot of key migration drivers, as well as insights on some particularities of the phenomenon. We find that the exodus {{is the result of}} a struggling Kosovar state, which failed to maintain the enthusiasm and hope of its young nation and turn it into sustainable development. Instead, a lack of perspectives and accumulated frustration about the existing political caste, nepotism and corruption drive out even middle class people. The extent and timing of the migration wave was closely connected with facilitated travel conditions and incentivising rumours that caused a snowball effect. We argue that EU countries will have to react with patience and care in handling incoming migrants. Changes in the <b>asylum</b> and <b>visa</b> regimes are recommended, but a smart timing of measures is important. Ultimately, to prevent a deepening crisis and possible unrest in Kosovo, temporary legal migration opportunities are needed. Within Kosovo, only breaking up existing structures and establishing efficient institutions and functioning social models in their place could allow the country to overcome its economic deadlock...|$|R

40|$|In 1997, the European Union set out {{the broad}} aims of its next big project: the {{construction}} of an ‘area of freedom, security and justice’. The EU has set itself a task at least as ambitious as the single market project. To guarantee freedom and justice, while enhancing security, the EU will have to do the following: make national criminal laws more similar; make national police forces and prosecutors work together more effectively; build a common border guard; develop common <b>asylum</b> and <b>visa</b> policies; make the EU courts more efficient; guarantee the rights of individuals and ensure that EU agencies are accountable for their actions.

But in the case of the draft Constitutional Treaty, it is the member states that have failed to deliver a more effective Union. This is surprising and regrettable.

40|$|This {{article will}} {{critically}} examine the traditional interpretation of Article 12 EC-prohibiting {{discrimination on the}} basis of nationality-as not applying to third country nationals (TCNs). Different arguments, both for and against this 'classic' interpretation, will be considered. Analysing the question of the 'scope of application of the EC Treaty', with a view to determining the scope of application of Article 12 EC, it will be emphasised that this is not restricted to the right of free movement, in that the latter's restricted personal scope of application does not determine that of Article 12 EC. This is all the more true following the Treaty of Amsterdam's partial 'Communitarisation' of policies on <b>visas,</b> <b>asylum</b> and immigration, which tend to apply principally to TCNs. In extending the material scope of application of the EC Treaty, this 'Communitarisation' simultaneously leads to an extension of the specific scope of application of Article 12 EC. Working from the hypothesis that Article 12 EC could indeed apply to TCNs, we will then examine the eventual consequences of such an application. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|On 5 December 2014, the Australian Senate {{passed the}} Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 (Cth). This article {{discusses}} the intersections between {{an aspect of}} the new law – the ‘fast track assessment’ Refugee Status Determination (RSD) procedure, mental ill health and vulnerability of <b>asylum</b> seekers. Insecure <b>visa</b> status, post-arrival stressors and living in constant uncertainty and fear of rejection and repatriation are known to compound existing pre-migration trauma for asylum seekers. The ‘fast track assessment’ procedure, in which a large number of asylum seekers' claims for protection will be processed under the new law, suggests a likely worsening of mental distress, despair and deterioration. The combined nature of mental health and legal support are an increasing feature of a co-ordinated and much needed integrated response to assist vulnerable asylum seekers living in the community. It is suggested that asylum seekers with an existing mental health condition who receive negative outcomes during the RSD process are particularly vulnerable. All asylum seekers should have mental health support made available to them when visa decisions are handed down or shortly afterwards...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. A New Title ‘Visas, asylum, {{immigration}} and other policies {{related to the}} free movement of persons’ (IIIa). In the ‘old’ Third Pillar construction, there are nine matters of common interest. Some of these matters have been found eligible for transfer to Community law, namely immigration, <b>asylum,</b> external borders (<b>Visa</b> Policy) and judicial cooperation in civil matters. This Title – in which communautarian instruments, methods of decision-making and legislation will apply. The new Treaty of Amsterdam has been characterized as extraordinarily difficult by dignitaries, journalists and academics alike. The tremendous complexity of the Amsterdam Treaty {{is largely due to}} the many changes that were made in the area of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Cooperation. Before Amsterdam, cooperation in this field was already split between communautarian and intergovernmental action. In particular visa policy, fraud, money laundering, customs cooperation and drugs were topics that were scattered around in the Treaty. The fragmentation of some justice and home affairs issues will continue after Amsterdam. The three main ‘zones’ of cooperation will be: 1) A New Title ‘Free Movement of Persons, Asylum and Immigration’, which will eventually be subject to full Community competence; 2) The incorporation of the Schengen Acquis into the new Treaty; and 3) A revamped Third Pillar with provisions on Police and Judicial Cooperation...|$|R
