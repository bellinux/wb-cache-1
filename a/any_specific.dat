Purposeful breeding after World War II led to the original Russian Spaniel standard in 1951. Further revised standards were issued in 1966 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{scholars}} divided inference {{into three}} types.

The final type of inference is the authority as to the revealed laws previous to Islam.|$|E

5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} <b>any</b> <b>specific</b> legislation {{in the field of}} mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate <b>any</b> <b>specific</b> boundaries, merely stating that the zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability {{would be more likely}} in the galaxy's thin disk. However, later research conducted in 2004 by Lineweaver and colleagues did create boundaries for this annulus, {{in the case of the}} Milky Way ranging from 4 kpc to 10 kpc from the galactic center.|$|E
5|$|Halotus died {{sometime}} {{in the latter part}} of the 1st century. At the time of his death, he still held the procuratorship that he had been granted by Galba. He kept this position despite Galba's unseating very soon after it was bestowed and the political uproars of The Year of the Four Emperors. At the time of his death, Halotus' public reputation had been at least partially restored and he had accumulated some degree of wealth after he had been cleared by Galba. Details relating to his death are not recorded in any of the writings of ancient historians, and neither are <b>any</b> <b>specific</b> dates.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} for {{arguments}} which commit this fallacy to omit <b>any</b> <b>specifics</b> about exactly how, or how badly, a proposed solution is claimed to fall short of acceptability, expressing the rejection only in vague terms.

5|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Teresa Maryańska {{proposed that}} the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened {{the weight of the}} skull, housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely, and noted that the sinuses may not have had <b>any</b> <b>specific</b> function. It is also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.|$|E

One entry noted that Braun owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000. Braun's name was not listed next to <b>any</b> <b>specific</b> PEDs, unlike some of the other players mentioned in the records. Braun released a statement maintaining that his attorneys had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any further dealings with the clinic.|$|E
5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble <b>any</b> <b>specific</b> organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to <b>any</b> <b>specific</b> tradition).|$|E

As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E
