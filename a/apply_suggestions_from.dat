40|$|Thispaper reviews aspects ofthe {{literature}} on international investing {{that should be}} of interest to individual investors. Three modern issues are covered: (I) the bene$ts of international diversijcation as the global markets continue to integrate; (2) the problem of currency exposure; and (3) effective means of achieving international diversijcation. Strategies are discussed which enable the individual to <b>apply</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>from</b> the research. By restricting the scope of the review to issues of most interest to the individual, we do not review research on international asset pricing theory and international market eficiency and “anomalies. ” Individual investors have seen, and are continuing to see, significant growth in international investment opportunities. The globalization of investment ownership is part of the general integration of the world’s financial markets, made possible by technological advances and a worldwide liberalization of regulations regarding foreign ownership. Domestic mutual funds now offer easy access to individuals interested in international funds, global funds, and country-specific funds. Today, the existence of international mutual funds allows individual investors to purchase stocks i...|$|E
40|$|In depression, {{the ability}} to {{experience}} daily life positive affect predicts recovery and reduces relapse rates. Interventions based on the experience sampling method (ESM-I) are ideally suited to provide insight in personal, contextualized patterns of positive affect. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether add-on ESM-derived feedback on personalized patterns of positive affect is feasible and useful to patients, and results in a reduction of depressive symptomatology. Depressed outpatients (n= 102) receiving pharmacological treatment participated in a randomized controlled trial with three arms: an experimental group receiving add-on ESM-derived feedback, a pseudo-experimental group participating in ESM but receiving no feedback, and a control group. The experimental group participated in an ESM procedure (three days per week over a 6 -week period) using a palmtop. This group received weekly standardized feedback on personalized patterns of positive affect. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 (HDRS) and Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS) scores were obtained before and after the intervention. During a 6 -month follow-up period, five HDRS and IDS assessments were completed. Add-on ESM-derived feedback resulted in a significant and clinically relevant stronger decrease in HDRS score relative to the control group (p< 0. 01; - 5. 5 point reduction in HDRS at 6 months). Compared to the pseudo-experimental group, a clinically relevant decrease in HDRS score was apparent at 6 months (B=- 3. 6, p= 0. 053). Self-reported depressive complaints (IDS) yielded the same pattern over time. The use of ESM-I was deemed acceptable and the provided feedback easy to understand. Patients attempted to <b>apply</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>from</b> ESM-derived feedback to daily life. These data suggest that the efficacy of traditional passive pharmacological approach to treatment of major depression can be enhanced by using person-tailored daily life information regarding positive affect. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|When {{engaging}} in social interactions, humans {{are capable of}} recognizing that other individuals have different cognitive or emotional states than they do, and ability referred to as Theory of Mind (TOM). Despite almost 50 years of effort investigating the topic, however, it remains unclear whether any animal species possesses this ability. This ambiguity {{is due to a}} combination of conceptual and methodological issues rendering investigation of TOM incredibly challenging. At present, these problems have become so daunting that empirical research has largely been replaced with pessimistic philosophical speculation about the possibility of ever detecting TOM in a non-human species. This thesis uses a combination of empirical investigation and a critical review of the literature to develop a framework for making progress on this topic. ^ In the first chapter, I review the current state of TOM research as well as considering historical trends. The main conclusion is that the lack of empirical progress is largely due to the anthropocentric approach of the researchers which relies on attempting to confirm the presence of TOM rather than falsifying other possible explanations for behavior. I make several suggestions for possible improvements to research strategies that include taking additional behavioral measurements and making specific predictions about other potential cognitive mechanisms. In the second chapter, I describe a study that <b>applies</b> the <b>suggestions</b> <b>from</b> the review chapter to test the framework that was developed. I used the most common TOM task (Hare et al. 2000) but measured additional variables and added several novel manipulations. These changes allowed for the disambiguation of several competing explanations for behavior during the typical TOM task. In this case, it was determined that pinyon jays were unlikely to be relying on TOM. Instead, they were probably using more general associative rules to solve the task^ The framework developed in this thesis has strong implications for the study of TOM. The additional measurements and manipulations could be applied to any existing TOM paradigm, possibly providing a means of answering the question of whether any non-human species possesses a theory of mind. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis discusses development of a future visioning system model that can be adopted to create new product concepts for consumer electronics companies operating in a highly competitive business environment. The research work investigates consumer electronic product companies and their market environment to identify problematic issues and indicates that a proactive new product strategy which opens new markets through developing concept-led products is a strategic priority, thus the concept development stage in new product development process {{is in need of}} improvement. An evaluation of existing concept development tools for the purpose of proactive product strategy is presented and concludes that future visioning procedure is the most appropriate tool. To develop a future visioning system model as a concept development tool, the theoretical future visioning system models are analysed and mapped to extract essential structure and contents of future visioning procedure. The consequent future visioning system model is then revised according to the findings and <b>suggestions</b> <b>from</b> the field research work which investigated four major consumer electronics product companies in practice. The findings also validates the necessity of adopting a proactive product strategy and evaluates acceptability of the future visioning system model for practical use. The final future visioning system model is defined after the opinions of the design managers are considered and <b>applied.</b> The major <b>suggestions</b> <b>from</b> the research findings are: (1) Executing proactive product strategy can be a valuable strategic tool (2) A new process is necessary for the companies to create one-step-ahead product (3) Future visioning system is recommended as an advanced approach that creates new product concept. (4) Future visioning system model should consist of eight stages: project initiation, environmental scanning, future visioning, generating product concepts, scenario planning, concept testing, concept visualisation, and finalized concepts. (5) Product concepts can be generated from future vision by applying backcasting. (6) Scenario planning should be used in the future visioning system model as a concept testing tool providing objective validating criteria. (7) Executing a future visioning system model creates new roles for the designer such as information integrator, process moderator, and futurist...|$|R
