40|$|The proliferating {{skin cells}} {{in a case}} of acute disseminated histiocytosis-X (<b>Abt-Letterer-Siwe</b> <b>disease)</b> {{confirmed}} by electron microscopy, were characterized by a panel of monoclonal antibodies using an immunoperoxidase technique. The "histiocytes" were found to stain with OKT- 6 (anti-T 6) and anti-HLA-DR antibodies. Unexpectedly, slight staining was also observed with Leu 3 a (anti-T 4) and OKM- 1. A proliferative process of T 4, T 6, HLA-DR, OKM- 1 positive Langerhans' cells has not yet been described and may be specific for histiocytosis-...|$|E
30|$|Eosinophilic {{granuloma}} (EG) is {{a benign}} disease related {{to any of}} the three forms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). Depending upon the number of lesions and lesion distribution, LCH comprises the following groups: unifocal LCH (also called EG), multifocal unisystem and multifocal multisystem. The combination of diabetes insipidus, lytic bone lesions and exophtalmus is known as Hand-Schüller-Christian triad, whereas the multifocal multisystem LCH is also called <b>Abt-Letterer-Siwe</b> <b>disease</b> (with typical abdominal involvement and poor prognosis) [19]. LCH is caused by clonal proliferation of activated dendritic cells and macrophages [20]. Any bone can be affected, such as the skull, mandible, ribs and long bones, as well as any organ system (lung, skin, spleen, lymph nodes, central nervous system). Therefore, cross-sectional whole-body imaging is essential for the initial work-up of patients with active disease and for post-therapeutic follow-up purposes.|$|E
