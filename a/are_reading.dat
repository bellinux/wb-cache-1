5|$|Reading {{is a major}} {{junction}} point of the National Rail system, and hence Reading station is a major transfer point and terminus. In a project that finished in 2015, Reading station was redeveloped {{at a cost of}} £850m, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. Other stations in the Reading area <b>are</b> <b>Reading</b> West, Tilehurst and Earley. Green Park railway station is planned on the Reading to Basingstoke Line to serve Green Park Business Park.|$|E

Gaga wears a yellow jumpsuit with circular glasses and shoulder pads. The Guardian compared this look with that of Minnie Mouse. She finally takes her revenge on her boyfriend by discreetly poisoning his drink with white powder concealed in her ring. As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that she just killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone corkscrew wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame. The video ends with Gaga posing for mug shots like a fashion model while wearing a tulip shaped metallic dress similar to the single cover.|$|E

Critics argue judges are making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators ("legislating from the bench"), they <b>are</b> <b>reading</b> doctrines and principles into the Constitution that are not expressed in or implied by the document, or they are claiming power to expand the liberty of some people {{at the expense of}} other people's liberty (such as in Dred Scott v.

25|$|Shoujo, as a tradition, {{is defined}} by this {{contrast}} against a prevailing and dominant masculine culture. Its female-ness is incalculable and omnipresent. Rather than taking comfort {{in the knowledge that}} this difference exists, Hagio uses her narratives to question its very foundation, specifically, gender. By undermining the reader's sense of gender and applying scrutiny to the interpretive structures related to it, she is calling into question the very conventions that define the work that they <b>are</b> <b>reading.</b>|$|E

500|$|Some studies use a [...] "probe verification" [...] task {{rather than}} an overt {{acceptability}} judgment; in this paradigm, each experimental sentence {{is followed by a}} [...] "probe word", and subjects must answer whether or not the probe word had appeared in the sentence. [...] This task, like the acceptability judgment task, ensures that subjects <b>are</b> <b>reading</b> or listening attentively, but may avoid some of the additional processing demands of acceptability judgments, and may be used no matter what type of violation is being presented in the study.|$|E
500|$|The Jabala Upanishad {{is one of}} the 20 Sannyasa Upanishads. The Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh, in 1656 helped {{organize}} and publish a collection of 50 Upanishads translated into the Persian language, with the title of Oupanekhat; in this collection the Jabala Upanishad is listed at number 29 and [...] "Jabala" [...] is spelled [...] "Djabal". This Persian translation was itself translated into Latin by Anquetil du Perron in 1801–02, wherein Anquetil remarked that the Indians <b>are</b> <b>reading</b> this collection of Upanishads all the time [...] "knowing it to be the best book on religion". The Anquetil translation brought the Upanishads to the attention of Arthur Schopenhauer and other western philosophers.|$|E

500|$|But this linear {{detection}} narrative soon starts to unravel. [...] The Supreme casts doubt {{even on the}} presumption that the declaration is indeed a forgery, or rather suggests that the forgery could itself be forged: [...] "Suppose that I myself am an author of pasquinades." [...] Moreover, the literary genre is undone {{by the introduction of}} footnotes (which blur the line between fiction and fact), and the narrative transparency subverted {{by the fact that the}} novel asserts its own materiality with interpolations such as [...] "(the rest of the sentence burned, illegible)" [...] and [...] "(edge of the folio burned)". [...] The effect of these notes is to remind readers that they <b>are</b> <b>reading</b> a book, and that this book is incomplete, damaged, and fallible.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure to}} prosecute the trio with federal charges caused some {{speculation}} about a government cover-up, particularly revolving around Troy Eid, who was appointed U.S. Attorney by President George W. Bush, and {{has been accused of}} showing political biases. Some questioned why Eid did not pursue federal charges against Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, but filed similar charges against Marc Harold Ramsey, who allegedly sent a threatening letter to 2008 Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain from behind bars in the Arapahoe County Jail. Ramsey, who faced five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted, sent McCain a package with a harmless white powdery substance and a letter that read, [...] "Senator McCain, If you <b>are</b> <b>reading</b> this then you are already DEAD! Unless of course you can't or don't breathe." [...] Eid said the Ramsey case was [...] "absolutely distinguishable" [...] from that of Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson because {{there was no evidence of}} actual planning on the part of the trio.|$|E
500|$|In {{speculative}} fiction, extrapolation allows {{writers to}} focus {{not on the}} way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called [...] "cognitive estrangement": the recognition that what we <b>are</b> <b>reading</b> is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.|$|E

He then breaks out on the other side, with no understanding of what just happened. Lois calls on Brian saying {{he was too busy}} eye-balling Glenn Close on Redbook magazine. Chris watches the movie The Blob. Peter riding Falkor the luckdragon is a reference to fantasy novel The Neverending Story.
