American men's team coach Phill Drobnick said [...] "The team watched {{it together and}} we gave it two thumbs up, they {{did a great job}} and it was reaching out to a new audience for our sport, so that's <b>always</b> <b>great</b> for us too."

500|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by English street artist D*Face. Barker was a fan of his work, having bought many of his pieces at his {{galleries}} in the past. According to D*Face, the trio [...] "wanted the artwork to represent California, but with a subversive side to show that it's not <b>always</b> <b>great</b> and there's always something under the surface, in the underbelly." [...] The artist was particularly busy, and employed pre-existing but unfinished illustration for the album cover. He also offered two alternate pieces that were rejected, but later posted on NME website. Skiba and Barker were pleased, but Hoppus was not as immediately receptive, according to the artist. While he did not admit to being {{a fan of the}} group, D*Face was happy with the commission, commenting, [...] "To have a band with such a great legacy and talent like Blink ask to work with you is a great honour and privilege." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are <b>always</b> <b>great</b> parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E

500|$|In the mid-16th {{century the}} Rhondda, {{at that time}} known as the Vale of Rotheney, belonged to the large but sparsely {{inhabited}} parish of Ystradyfodwg, 'St. Tyfodwg's Vale'. For administrative purposes the parish was divided into three hamlets: the Upper or Rhigos Hamlet to the north, the Middle or Penrhys Hamlet and the lower or Clydach Hamlet. Throughout the post-Medieval period the Rhondda was a heavily wooded area and its main economic staple was the rearing of sheep, horses and cattle. The historian Rice Merrick, in describing the upland area of the Vale of Glamorgan, stated that there [...] "was <b>always</b> <b>great</b> breeding of cattle, horses and sheep; but in elder time therin grew but small store of corn, for in most places there the ground was not thereunto apt..." [...] While English cartographer John Speed described that the rearing of cattle was the [...] "best means unto wealth that the Shire doth afford". As there was no fair held in the Rhondda the animals would be taken to neighbouring fairs and markets at Neath, Merthyr, Llantrisant, Ynysybwl and Llandaff. However, to be self-supporting, the farmers of the area grew crops such as oats, corn and barley in small quantities. Crops were grown in {{the lower part of}} the Rhondda on narrow meadows adjoining the riversides, though during the Napoleonic Wars scarce supplies forced the cultivation of the upland areas such as Carn-y-wiwer and Penrhys. Merrick would describe the diet of the upland inhabitants as consisting of [...] "bread made of wheat...and ale and bear" [...] and over two hundred years later Benjamin Malkin showed how little the diet had changed when he wrote that the people still ate [...] "Oatmeal bread, with a relish of miserable cheese; and the beer, where they have any, is worse than none".|$|E

[...] Woomble, Jones and Newton were tagged in the photo of a recording/rehearsal studio. On 5 November, Roddy Woomble confirmed that the band {{were in the process}} of writing a new album, stating: [...] "I have been getting asked about this a lot recently, and it is no secret that Idlewild are making a new album (There are some photographs of a recent writing session in a Hebridean cabin up on the Idlewild facebook page) it is being written and recorded slowly and intermittently, and I have no idea when it’ll be done. Not for a while. I’m just enjoying the process. It is <b>always</b> <b>great</b> to work with Rod and Colin, we have been making up songs together since 1995 – not far off 20 years! Gareth and Allan have not been involved much so far due to both their other touring commitments, but they will be in time, as will others." [...] In January 2014 the band started recording their next studio effort and had two 'live' dates, one at Musicport. Through his blog Roddy Woomble revealed that Gareth Russell had left the band back in 2013 and Lucci Rossi had joined the band as new bassist.|$|E
