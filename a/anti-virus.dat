He hid the T-virus and <b>anti-virus</b> on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. He retrieves the <b>anti-virus,</b> but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the <b>anti-virus</b> to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.|$|E

In the ensuing battle, Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is {{attacked}} by a now-zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, causing her head to hit a trapdoor button, opening it and dropping the Licker under the train which ultimately kills it for good. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the <b>anti-virus,</b> the mansion doors burst open {{and a group of}} Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the Nemesis Program.|$|E

40|$|International audienceData {{compression}} is ubiquitous to {{any information}} and communication system. It often reduces resources required to store and transmit data. However, the efficiency of compression algorithms also makes them an obvious target for hackers to mount denial-of-service attacks. In this work, we consider decompression quines, a specific class of compressed files that decompress to themselves. We analyze all the known decompression quines by studying their structures, {{and their impact on}} <b>anti-viruses.</b> Our analysis reveals that most of the <b>anti-viruses</b> do not have a suitable architecture in place to detect decompression quines. Even worse, some of them are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks exploiting quines. Motivated by our findings, we study several quine detectors and propose a new one that exploits the fact that quines and non-quine files do not share the same underlying structure. Our evaluation against different datasets shows that the detector incurs no performance overhead at the expense of a low false positive rate...|$|R

He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's <b>anti-virus</b> software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E

The real Alice boarded beforehand and attempts to execute Wesker, only for him to injects her with an <b>Anti-Virus</b> to remove her superhuman abilities. Wesker is revealed to have used the T-Virus to gain his own superhuman abilities and prepares to kill Alice, before the autopilot crashes the plane into the mountains and only Alice survives.|$|E

Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the zombie mob and blowing them all up, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. Ordered by Wesker to terminate Isaacs, Slater arrives {{with a group of}} commandos and finds the scientist locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of <b>anti-virus</b> in an attempt to counteract the infection. Slater reveals that his employment is terminated and shoots him, triggering his mutation into a monstrous Tyrant. Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater and all the facility employees, but is confined to the lab's lower levels.|$|E

As the research begins to require increasingly unethical practices, he lies and rationalises in the struggle to maintain the loyalty of his colleagues. Unbeknownst to the other workers (all of whom had lost loved ones in the pandemic), he had secreted his wife (portrayed by Alisa Arnah) and young son within the facility, violating protocol. His true motives are suspect, as he answers to someone called Mr. Landry, with whom he communicates over a satellite video link. Until his death he was using stolen <b>anti-virus</b> produced from Abby's blood for himself, keeping it from the others, who died when the virus got into the lab after Abby infected his wife.

40|$|Achieving {{accurate}} and efficient metamorphic malware detection remains a challenge. Metamorphic malware {{is able to}} mutate and alter its code structure in each infection that can circumvent signature matching detection.

N-gram features are extracted directly from malware binaries to avoid disassembly, which these features are then masked with the extracted known malware signature n-grams. These masked features {{reduce the number of}} selected n-gram features considerably. Our method is capable to accurately detect metamorphic malware with ~ 99 accuracy and low false positive rate. The proposed method is also superior to commercially available <b>anti-viruses</b> for detecting metamorphic malware...|$|R

30|$|However, {{encryption}} {{keys and}} login credentials can be breached, exposing the network {{to all kinds}} of threats. Furthermore, the prevention capabilities of firewalls and <b>anti-viruses</b> are limited by the prescribed set of rules and patches. Hence, it is imperative to include a second line of defense that can detect early symptoms of cyber-threats and react quickly enough before any damage is done. Such systems are commonly referred to as Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS). IDSs monitor the network for signs of malicious activities and can be broadly classified into two categories—Misuse- and Anomaly-based systems. While the former rely on signatures of known attacks, the latter is based on the notion that intrusions exhibit a behavior that is quite distinctive from normal network behavior. Hence, the general objective of anomaly-based IDSs is to define the “normal behavior” in order to detect deviations from this norm.|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} new trend in Critical Infrastructures (e. g. power plants, nuclear plants, energy grids etc.) is the massive migration from the classic model of isolated systems, to a system-of-systems model, where these infrastructures are intensifying their interconnections through Information and Communications Technology (ICT) means. The ICT core of these industrial installations {{is known as}} Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA). Traditional ICT security countermeasures (e. g. classic firewalls, <b>anti-viruses</b> and IDSs) fail in providing a complete protection to these systems since their needs {{are different from those}} of traditional ICT.

The theoretical framework is supported by tests conducted with a Intrusion Detection System prototype implementing the proposed detection approach. JRC. G. 6 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R

30|$|Each Fog {{platform}} should implement resource efficient network monitoring mechanisms. They {{should be}} considered {{as an integral part of}} every Fog system, so that malicious activity can be identified and terminated before any real damage occurs. The fundamental underlying process comprises of scanning dynamic and large networks to mark suspicious and malicious network packets based on pre-defined rules and policies. A Fog platform can deploy efficient tools like CLOUDWATCHER [118] for partial network monitoring by selecting specific devices and PayLess [119] for scanning SDN communication with minimal computing resources. The network scanning process can be classified as static, dynamic or a combination of both. Scanning is typically achieved by assorting Firewalls, <b>Anti-viruses</b> and Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems [120 – 122]. For further improvement, the network monitoring applications can start operating in distributed and intelligent manner. They can use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and rule matching [123] for threat detection as a large number of heterogeneous (IoT) devices are transmitting and processing heterogeneous data on multiple levels (hypervisor, operating system, and applications). Furthermore, due to the localised nature of Fog devices, the implementation of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can also help in isolating the network from external attacks.|$|R
