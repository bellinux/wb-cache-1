40|$|Wireless power {{transfer}} (WPT) technology is becoming attractive {{in a wide}} variety of applications such as electric-vehicle charging, induction heating, charging portable applications, industrial robots, and biomedical implants. Recent studies have shown various techniques to implement wireless {{power transfer}} and these techniques differ based on the type of applications. For example, for electric vehicle charging, the power levels are in the range 5 kW to 25 kW and the operating frequency is in the range 70 kHz to 110 kHz. On the other hand, for consumer applications, the power levels vary from a few watts to hundreds of watts and operates at frequencies of the order of 5 MHz to 10 MHz. This thesis addresses the analysis, design, implementation, and simulation of a wireless charging system targeted towards a high-frequency, low-power portable application with wide separation between transmitter and receiver. The WPT system is composed of three important blocks: inverter (or transmitter), transformer (or coil), and rectifier (or receiver). Hard-switching inverters and rectifiers have major drawbacks at high frequencies due to large switching power loss. Therefore, soft-switching Class-E topology is chosen. The Class-E dc-ac inverter with CLL resonant tank, also referred to as pi 2 a impedance matching network is analyzed, designed, and simulated to observe its superior performance over other topologies at varying coupling coefficients and loads. Four soft-switching rectifier topologies are analyzed, designed, and simulated to evaluate their behavior at high frequencies. Their compatibility with Class-E inverters in the presence of loosely-coupled transformers is discussed. The physical and commercial limitations of using transformers with magnetic core is presented. Therefore, the preferred solution, an <b>air-core</b> <b>transformer</b> is designed and integrated with the rectifier to evaluate their characteristics at selected coupling coefficient.

40|$|Nowadays, {{buildings}} environmental certifications {{encourage the}} implementation of initiatives aiming to increase energy efficiency in buildings. In these certification systems, increased energy efficiency arising from such initiatives must be demonstrated. Thus, a challenge to be faced is how to check the increase in energy efficiency related {{to each of the}} employed initiatives without a considerable building retrofit. In this context, this work presents a non-destructive method for electric current sensing to assess implemented initiatives to increase energy efficiency in buildings with environmental certification. This method proposes the use of a sensor that can be installed directly in the low voltage electrical circuit conductors that are powering the initiative under evaluation, without the need for reforms that result in significant costs, repair, and maintenance. The proposed sensor consists of three elements: an <b>air-core</b> <b>transformer</b> current sensor, an amplifying/filtering stage, and a microprocessor.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of areas of {{research}} for transformers at present which are focussed on reducing the losses in transformer cores as well as the steel weight. One way to reduce core losses is to remove the core altogether making an <b>air-core</b> <b>transformer</b> which have been primarily used in pulse transformers and superconducting transformers However these designs have issues with large magnetising currents. Alternatively, the use of partial-core transformers (PCT), which have been developed as resonant test transformers, power transformers, and superconducting transformers, {{can be seen as a}} compromise between the transformer performance and a reduction in the use of materials. In a PCT there is a steel core down the centre of the windings, however the steel limbs and yoke of a traditional core have been removed as shown in Figure 1. As the remainder of the magnetic flux path is now through air instead of steel, there is a much higher reluctance path in a PCT than a full core transformer [5]. The University of Canterbury (UoC) has developed a number of partial-core transformers (PCTs) in an attempt to reduce the electrical losses of the PCTs. Towards the ends of the core in a PCT, the magnetic flux tends to spread outwards radially within the core. This increases the eddy current losses in the core compared to that seen in traditional full core design. Thus, PCT designs tend to have significantly higher eddy current losses per unit weight in the core compared with full core counterparts. This paper starts by providing a background into partial core transformers and their applications as well as a look into the performance of transformer steel. A radially laminated core is then designed and constructed to be compared with a traditional parallel stacked core for use in PCT. The two cores have been tested under open circuit conditions and their core losses computed from measured results. The core losses have also been compared to the modelled core loss as a test of the model accuracy...|$|E

40|$|A {{transformer}} is {{a device}} that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through inductively coupled conductors—the transformer's coils. A varying current in the first or primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer's core and thus a varying magnetic field through the secondary winding. This varying magnetic field induces a varying electromotive force (EMF), or "voltage", in the secondary winding. This effect is called inductive coupling. If a load {{is connected to the}} secondary, current will flow in the secondary winding, and electrical energy will be transferred from the primary circuit through the transformer to the load. In an ideal transformer, the induced voltage in the secondary winding (Vs) is in proportion to the primary voltage (Vp) and is given by the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary (Ns) to the number of turns in the primary (Np) as follows: By appropriate selection of the ratio of turns, a transformer thus enables an alternating current (AC) voltage to be "stepped up" by making Ns greater than Np, or "stepped down" by making Ns less than Np. In the vast majority of transformers, the windings are coils wound around a ferromagnetic core, <b>air-core</b> <b>transformers</b> being a notable exception. Transformers range in size from a thumbnail-sized coupling transformer hidden inside a stage microphone to huge units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect portions of power grids. All operate on the same basic principles, although the range of designs is wide. While new technologies have eliminated the need for transformers in some electronic circuits, transformers are still found in nearly all electronic devices designed for household ("mains") voltage. Transformers are essential for high-voltage electric power transmission, which makes long-distance transmission economically practical. Finite element modeling (FEM) is a useful and commonly used tool in the solution of electromagnetic problems that arise in the design of power transformers. With approximately 30 % of all transformer failures being due to insulation breakdown (due to excessive electrostatic stress), electrostatic FEM techniques are providing engineers with a valuable means of more accurately quantifying the electric stress in their designs. The validity of FEM, in general, always depends on having sound modeling assumptions and techniques. In addition, this problem introduced further complications that required carefully considered assumptions and treatments...|$|R

Portable electronics, an area where a premium is placed on size, weight, and cost, are driving the development of power systems with greater density and better manufacturability. This motivates a push to higher switching frequencies enabling smaller passive components and better integration. To realize these goals this thesis explores devices, circuits, and passives capable of operating efficiently into the VHF regime (30 - 300 MHz) and their integration into power electronic systems of high power density. A good integrated power MOSFET presages high-density converters. Previous VHF systems were demonstrated with bulky and expensive RF Lateral, Double-Diffused MOSFETs (LDMOSFET). We show that {{through a combination of}} layout optimization and safe operating area (SOA) extension integrated devices can achieve near-parity performance to their purpose-built RF discrete cousins over the desired operating regime. A layout optimization method demonstrating a 2 x reduction in device loss is presented alongside experimental demonstration of SOA extension. Together the methods yield a 3 x reduction in loss that bolsters the utility of the typical (and relatively inexpensive) LDMOS IC power process for VHF converters. Passive component synthesis is addressed {{in the context of an}} isolated VHF converter topology. We present a VHF topology where most of the magnetic energy storage is accomplished in a transformer that forms an essential part of the resonant network.

The biological tissue of the model has three layers including the skin, fat, and muscle. The results of simulation analysis show SARs to be very small at any given transmission conditions, about 2 – 14 mW/kg, compared to the basic restrictions of the International Commission on nonionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP; 2 W/kg), while the current density divided by the ICNIRP’s basic restrictions gets smaller as the frequency rises and the output voltage falls. It is possible to transfer energy below the ICNIRP’s basic restrictions when the frequency is over 250 kHz and the output voltage is under 24 V.

As a result, {{there is a}} serious threat to security and reliability of power systems. There are several traditional approaches to limiting the fault current, such as the <b>air-core</b> reactor, high-impedance <b>transformer</b> and network splitting. However, these approaches have some drawbacks [1]. The fault current limiter (FCL) {{has been one of the}} most promising methods to limit fault currents in power systems.

The FCLs can be regarded as a variable-impedance device in series with the lines to provide low steady-state impedance under normal conditions and high limiting impedance during fault conditions [6]. But in power systems, the advantages of FCLs depend on the number, location and impedance of FCLs. Therefore, considering the efficiency and mitigation effect, the optimal allocation of FCLs, in terms of their number, locations and impedances, has become a difficult multi-objective problem. Some research has been published on optimal allocation of FCLs [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial electrical and mechanical design of two phase-locked 30 Megawatt RMS, 150 kHz oscillator systems used for current drive and plasma sustainment of the ''Translation, Confinement, and Sustainment'' (TCS) field reversed configuration (FRC) plasma. By {{the application of}} orthogonally-placed saddle coils {{on the surface of}} the glass vacuum vessel, the phase-controlled rotating magnetic field perturbation will induce an electric field in the plasma which should counter the intrinsic ohmic decay of the plasma, and maintain the FRC. Each system utilizes a bank of 6 parallel magnetically beamed ML 8618 triodes. These devices are rated at 250 Amperes cathode current and a 45 kV plate voltage. An advantage of the magnetically beamed triode is their extreme efficiency, requiring only 2. 5 kW of filament and a few amps and a few kV of grid drive. Each 3. 5 uH saddle coil is configured with an adjustable tank circuit (for tuning). Assuming no losses and a nominal 18 kV plate voltage, the tubes can circulate about 30 kV and 9 kA (pk to pk) in the saddle coil antenna, a circulating power of over 33 megawatts RMS. On each cycle the tubes can kick in up to 1500 Amperes, providing a robust phase control. DC high-voltage from the tubes is isolated from the saddle coil antennas and tank circuits by a 1 : 1 coaxial <b>air-core</b> balun <b>transformer.</b> To control the ML 8618 's phase and amplitude, fast 150 Ampere ''totem-pole'' grid drivers, an ''on'' hot-deck and an ''off'' hot-deck are utilized. The hot-decks use up to 6 each 3 CPX 1500 A 7 slotted radial beam triodes. By adjusting the conduction angle, amplitude may be regulated, with inter-pulse timing, phase angle can be controlled. A central feedback timing chassis monitors each systems' saddle coil antenna and appropriately derives each systems timing signals. Fiber-optic cables are used to isolate between the control room timing chassis and the remote power oscillator system. Complete system design detail will be presented in addition to anticipated (computer generated) performance characteristics. Initial design and construction began in FY 97, and will continue through FY 98, with delivery to the experiment in FY 99, for commencement of physics experiments on sustaining the FRC...|$|R
