40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{connection}} between two important threads of economic research offering different approaches to studying the dynamics of an industry with heterogeneous firms. Elemental models of the form pioneered by Ericson and Pakes (1995) capture the dynamics of {{a finite number of}} heterogeneous firms as they compete in an industry. Available algorithms can determine Markov perfect equilibrium behavior, though computational requirements become onerous when {{there are more than a}} few incumbent firms. <b>Aggregative</b> <b>models</b> of the form pioneered by Hopenhayn (1992), on the other hand, assume that firms are infinitesimal and infinite in number. The industry state in stationary equilibrium is constant due to averaging effects among firms, and this dramatically simplifies analysis and computation of equilibrium behavior. The main result of this paper provides conditions under which stationary equilibria of <b>aggregative</b> <b>models</b> approximate Markov perfect equilibria of elemental models arbitrarily well in asymptotically large markets. Our conditions require that the distribution of firm states in stationary equilibrium obeys a certain “light tail ” condition. In addition, we explore {{the connection between}} stationary equilibria in <b>aggregative</b> <b>models</b> and oblivious equilibria in elemental models, as introduced in Weintraub, Benkard, and Van Roy (2008) ...|$|R

Estimations performed on aggregate data constrain sector elasticities to homogeneity, which creates a heterogeneity bias. The paper shows such a bias exists in two prominent approaches used to estimate elasticities, which has meaningful consequences for the calibration of the trade elasticity in one-sector, <b>aggregative</b> <b>models.</b> With elasticities calibrated to aggregate data, macroeconomic models can have predictions {{at odds with the}} implications of their multi-sector counterparts.

40|$|Knife—edge {{stability}} {{is a common}} property of dynamic monetary models assuming perfect foresight or rational expectations. These models can be closed {{with the assumption that}} the economy's equilibrium lies on the unique convergent path (the saddlepath). While this empirically plausible assumption yields sensible results, <b>aggregative</b> <b>models</b> are not specified in sufficient detail to allow one to prove that the saddlepath is the unique equilibrium path. Brock (1974, 1975) and Stock and Scheinkman (1980) have advanced models in which individual preferences are more fully specified and in which, under certain conditions. the uniqueness and stability of equilibrium can be rigorously demonstrated. This paper shows that these uniqueness conditions are economically unreasonable. Therefore, the question these maximizing models address remains unresolved...|$|R
40|$|This paper surveys intergenerational {{altruism}} in neoclassical growth models. It first examines Barro's {{approach to}} intergenerational altruism, whereby successive generations are linked by recursive altruistic preferences. Individuals have an altruistic concern {{only for their}} children, who in turn also have altruistic feelings for their own children. The conditions under which the Ricardian equivalence (debt neutrality) theorem applies are specified. The effectiveness of fiscal policy is further analysed {{in the context of}} an economy populated by heterogeneous families differing with respect to their degree of intergenerational altruism. Other forms of altruism, referred to as ad hoc altruism, are also examined, along with their implications for fiscal policy.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to scrutinise the {{economic}} use of phase transitions formalisms and to assess their relevance. The formal correspondence between the issue of micro-macro passage when agents are interacting and the physics problem of phase transition is first set out. The second section presents two formal tools likely {{to be associated with}} these problems and to exhibit the typical phenomena of phase transition. It is then possible to highlight the key points upon which the phase transition phenomena in these formal representations rely, and then to assess the relevance of their economic "counterparts" associated with these crucial characteristics. A more general appraisal of these formalisms for economics is finally sketched.

40|$|We {{document}} {{a negative}} {{trend in the}} leisure of men married to women aged 25 - 45, relative to that of their wives, and a positive trend in relative housework. Taken together, these trends rule out a popular class of labor supply models in which unitary households maximize {{the sum of the}} spouse’s utility. We develop a simple bargaining model of marriage, divorce and allocations of leisure-time and housework. According to the model, a rise in women’s relative wage will reduce husband’s leisure and marriage rates when the quality of single life is relatively high for women. Calibration to US data shows the trend in relative wages explains most of the trend in relative leisure and {{about a third of the}} trend in housework, while the simultaneous trend in home-durables prices explains the balance of the housework trend.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a synthesis of}} the 1983 - 98 published literature on the empirical evidence regarding the interaction between government policies and growth. Five policy areas are considered: general government consumption, tax rates, education expenditures, defense and public infrastructure. The most conclusive results in the literature relate to the positive impact of education expenditures on growth. Public infrastructure also appears important. Regression analysis remains the most commonly adopted research methodology. A better link with current theories will be obtained when parameter calibration methods formicro-foundations based models replace parameter estimation of regression models with ad hoc specifications. Nonetheless, there remain severe limitations on what can be learned for policy from highly <b>aggregative</b> <b>models</b> of endogenous growth. Better data are needed at the regional macro and meso levels to complement thecurrently available pooled cross-section time-series country data. The potential endogeneity of government fiscal variables can be resolved through the selection of appropriate instrumental variables, {{such as those that}} arise in cases of "natural experiments".

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} nature of paths in the {{standard}} neoclassical <b>aggregative</b> <b>model</b> of eco-nomic growth that are maximal according to the Suppes-Sen grading principle. This is accomplished by relating such paths to paths which are utilitarian maximal when an increasing (but not necessarily con-cave) utility function evaluates each period’s consumption. Dynamic properties of Suppes-Sen maximal paths, which lie entirely above or entirely below the golden-rule, are analyzed. An example is presented in which an explicit form of a consumption function is described, which generates only Suppes-Sen maximal paths. This consumption function is shown to generate consumption cycles, and violate the Pigou-Dalton transfer principle...|$|E

Analyses {{of discrete}} choice model consider social-economic variables to study traveler’s mode choice and demand. However, to calibrate the discrete choice model {{needs to have}} plenty of questionnaire survey. Also, an <b>aggregative</b> <b>model</b> is proposed.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} a non-equilibrium continuous-time dynamical {{model of the}} price of a single asset traded by a population of heterogeneous interacting agents in the presence of uncertainty and regulatory constraints. The model takes into account (i) the price formation delay between decision and investment by the second-order nature of the dynamical equations, (ii) the linear and nonlinear mean-reversal or their contrarian in the form of speculative price trading, (iii) market friction, (iv) uncertainty in the fundamental value that controls the amplitude of mispricing, (v) nonlinear speculative momentum effects and (vi) market regulations that may limit large mispricing drifts. We find markets with coexisting equilibrium, conventions and business cycles that depend on (a) the relative strength of value-investing versus momentum-investing, (b) the level of uncertainty on the fundamental value, and (c) the degree of market regulation. The stochastic dynamics is characterized by nonlinear geometric random walk-like processes with spontaneous regime shifts between different conventions or business cycles. This model provides a natural dynamical framework to model regime shifts between different market phases that may result from the interplay between the effects (i-vi).
