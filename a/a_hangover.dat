5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, {{which was the}} only one he received. Southern Miss wanted him to play defensive back, but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over the starting position {{in the second half of}} the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering <b>a</b> <b>hangover</b> from the night before and vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes. Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to Bramall Lane {{under the}} captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested {{and stayed in}} London with the team manager.

5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. <b>A</b> <b>hangover,</b> {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all aircraft, equipment, materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force inoperable. During the Civil War the Taylor government made a variety of different air support arrangements; a seemingly inoperable Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central Monrovia in mid-2005, apparently <b>a</b> <b>hangover</b> from the war. Meanwhile, during the Taylor era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft. However, on shore, both late 1990s and 2005 sources indicate the Navy included the 2nd Naval District, Buchanan, the 3rd Naval District, Greenville, and the 4th Naval District, Harper.|$|E
5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage has been used as <b>a</b> <b>hangover</b> cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from <b>a</b> <b>hangover,</b> including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E
5|$|In a bid {{to impress}} Martin and his colleagues, Rhys {{purchases}} a barbecue and invites them over for dinner. He is granted {{an interview with the}} surgical board to join their training program at the hospital. Following a night out with Dane Canning (Luke Pegler), Rhys gets <b>a</b> <b>hangover</b> and is horrified to learn his interview has been moved to an earlier time. Rhys struggles to answer the panel's questions and he is not invited to join the program. He later visits his mother, Elaine, at her hospice, where he tells her he has joined the program. Rhys treats Chris Pappas (James Mason) after he is attacked, but fails to get him to stay for his X-rays. Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) spots that Chris has a broken rib, which is pressing on his lung and Rhys finds him collapsed on the floor of Fitzgerald Motors. Rhys performs an emergency decompression on his lung and saves his life. Rhys asks senior surgeon Jessica Girdwood (Glenda Linscott) to reconsider letting him join the surgical program, but she declines. Rhys tries unsuccessfully to get Robbie O'Brien to quit the program and he turns his attentions to Erin Salisbury. He pretends to be romantically interested in her and tries to distract her from her studies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from <b>a</b> <b>hangover</b> after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} <b>a</b> new alcohol <b>hangover</b> symptom {{severity}} scale and compare its effectiveness with the Hangover Symptoms Scale (HSS), the Acute Hangover Scale (AHS), and <b>a</b> one-item <b>hangover</b> score. Data from 1, 410 Dutch students (Penning et al., Alcohol Alcohol 47 : 248 - 252, 2012) on {{the severity of}} 47 hangover symptoms were re-analyzed to develop the Alcohol Hangover Severity Scale (AHSS). The {{psychometric properties of the}} AHSS were compared with those of the HSS and the AHS. A survey among 1, 000 students compared the AHSS and HSS with <b>a</b> one-item <b>hangover</b> severity score. The AHSS was further tested in <b>a</b> naturalistic <b>hangover</b> experiment. The 12 items of the AHSS were fatigue, clumsiness, dizziness, apathy, sweating, shivering, nausea, heart pounding, confusion, stomach pain, concentration problems, and thirst. The Penning et al. (Alcohol Alcohol 47 : 248 - 252, 2012) data revealed that the predictive validity of the AHSS (92. 4 %) for the overall hangover score was significantly higher than that of the HSS (81. 5 %) and the AHS (71. 0 %). The survey data (N = 966) showed that scores on the AHSS (39. 7 %) and the HSS (47. 6 %) only moderately predicted the one-item <b>hangover</b> score. <b>A</b> total of 119 subjects completed the naturalistic study. On average, they consumed 9. 7 alcoholic consumptions, yielding a mean estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0. 16 %. During hangover, the AHSS score correlated significantly with the number of alcoholic consumptions (r = 0. 38, p < 0. 0001) and estimated BAC (r = 0. 40, p < 0. 0001). The AHS, HSS, and AHSS all seem appropriate for application in hangover research. The use of <b>a</b> one-item <b>hangover</b> scale is not recommended...|$|R

25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} whether certain types of alcohol cause worse hangovers. All four studies concluded that darker liquors, which have higher congeners, produced worse hangovers. One even showed that hangovers were worse and more frequent with darker liquors. In a 2006 study, an average of 14 standard drinks (330 ml each) of beer was needed to produce <b>a</b> <b>hangover,</b> but only 7 to 8 drinks was required for wine or liquor (note that one standard drink has {{the same amount of}} alcohol regardless of type). Another study ranked several drinks by their ability to cause <b>a</b> <b>hangover</b> as follows (from low to high): distilled ethanol diluted with fruit juice, beer, vodka, gin, white wine, whisky, rum, red wine and brandy.|$|E
