5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>Jew,</b> Kyle often defends {{and shows}} {{pride in his}} {{religion}} and ancestry.

5|$|In 1938, Benito Mussolini's fascist {{government}} passed anti-Semitic laws barring Jews from university positions. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>Jew,</b> Segrè was now rendered {{an indefinite}} émigré. At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence {{offered him a}} job as a research assistant. While at Berkeley, Segrè helped discover the element astatine and the isotope plutonium-239, which was later used to make the Fat Man nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|In June 1938, Segrè paid {{a summer}} visit to California {{to study the}} {{short-lived}} isotopes of technetium, which did not survive being mailed to Italy. While Segrè was en route, Benito Mussolini's fascist government passed racial laws barring Jews from university positions. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>Jew,</b> Segrè was now rendered an indefinite émigré. The Czechoslovakian crisis prompted Segrè to send for Elfriede and Claudio, as he now feared that war in Europe was inevitable. In November 1938 and February 1939 they made quick trips to Mexico to exchange their tourist visas for immigration visa. Both Segrè and Elfriede held grave fears for the fate of their parents in Italy and Germany.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>Jew,</b> Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Jew</b> during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone himself is Jewish, he was not raised as a practicing Jew {{and so he did}} not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own Hanukkah song while everybody else sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, Parker said it only made her feel more lonely and isolated.|$|E
