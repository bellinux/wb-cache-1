2500|$|How was it {{then that}} {{diseases}} {{native to the}} American continents did not kill off Europeans? Diamond posits that the most of these diseases were only developed <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> <b>in</b> large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through natural selection (see the Black Death and other epidemics) during a longer time than {{was the case for}} Native American hunter-gatherers and farmers.|$|E
2500|$|The convent's {{aim was to}} {{care for}} noble women, {{which was to be}} {{maintained}} and thus it became a Lutheran Damsels' Convent. [...] "The ancestors primarily dedicated, founded and endowed noble … monasteries with estates so that their descendants … who had no desire or were uncomfortable to get married, could be admitted to them <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> <b>in</b> them." [...] As far as known today, there were no commoners accepted among the nuns and later Lutheran conventuals. The nuns and conventuals originated - amongst others - from the families Brobergen, von der Brock, von Campe, von der Decken, Drew(e)s, , von Hadeln, Haken, , von Issendorff, , von der Lieth, Marschalck, , von Reimershausen, , , and von Weyhe.|$|E

60|$|An {{intrinsic}} and weightier defect is the want of {{ease and}} lightness {{in the general}} composition of the piece; a defect which, all its other excellencies will not prevent us from observing. There is action enough in the plot, energy enough in the dialogue, and abundance of individual beauties in both; but there is throughout a certain air of stiffness and effort, which abstracts from the theatrical illusion. The language, in general impressive and magnificent, is now and then inflated into bombast. The characters do not, as it were, verify their human nature, by those thousand little touches and nameless turns, which distinguish the genius essentially dramatic from the genius merely poetical; the Proteus of the stage from the philosophic observer and trained imitator of life. We have not those careless felicities, those varyings from high to low, that air of living freedom which Shakspeare has accustomed us, like spoiled children, {{to look for in}} every perfect work of this species. Schiller is too elevated, too regular <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> <b>in</b> his elevation, to be altogether natural.|$|E
6000|$|Next after curiosity come those {{desires and}} motives that one shares perhaps with some social beasts, {{but far more}} so as a {{conscious}} thing with men alone. These desires and motives all centre on a clearly apprehended [...] "self" [...] in relation to [...] "others"; they are the essentially egotistical group. They are self-assertion in all its forms. I have dealt with motives toward gratification and motives towards experience; this set of motives is {{for the sake of}} oneself. Since they are the most acutely conscious motives in unthinking men, there is a tendency on the part of unthinking philosophers to speak of them as though vanity, self-seeking, self-interest were the only motives. But one has but to reflect on what has gone before to realize that this is not so. One finds these [...] "self" [...] motives vary with the mental power and training of the individual; here they are fragmentary and discursive, there drawn tight together into a coherent scheme. Where they are weak they mingle with the animal motives and curiosity like travellers in a busy market-place, but where the sense of self is strong they become rulers and regulators, self-seeking becomes deliberate <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> <b>in</b> the case of the human being, vanity passes into pride.|$|E
6000|$|The New Testament is {{remarkable}} for its pure morality; {{the best of}} the Hindo Scripture, for its pure intellectuality. The reader is nowhere raised into <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> <b>in</b> a higher, purer, or rarer region of thought than in the Bhagvat-Geeta. Warren Hastings, in his sensible letter recommending the translation of this book to the Chairman of the East India Company, declares the original to be [...] "of a sublimity of conception, reasoning, and diction almost unequalled," [...] and that the writings of the Indian philosophers [...] "will survive when the British dominion in India shall have long ceased to exist, and when the sources which it once yielded of wealth and power are lost to remembrance." [...] It is unquestionably one of the noblest and most sacred scriptures which have come down to us. Books are to be distinguished by the grandeur of their topics, even more than by {{the manner in which they}} are treated. The Oriental philosophy approaches, easily, loftier themes than the modern aspires to; and no wonder if it sometimes prattle about them. It only assigns their due rank respectively to Action and Contemplation, or rather does full justice to the latter. Western philosophers have not conceived of the significance of Contemplation in their sense. Speaking of the spiritual discipline to which the Brahmans subjected themselves, and the wonderful power of abstraction to which they attained, instances of which had come under his notice, Hastings says:-- ...|$|E

60|$|The prime minister’s {{manifesto}} to {{his constituents}} at Greenwich was elaborate <b>and</b> <b>sustained.</b> <b>In</b> substance it did {{no more than}} amplify the various considerations that he had set forth {{in his letter to}} Lord Granville. The pith of it was a promise to diminish local taxation, and to repeal the income-tax. At the same time marked relief was to be given to the general consumer in respect of articles of popular consumption. One effective passage dealt with the charge that the liberal party had endangered the institutions of the country. “It is time,” said Mr. Gladstone, “to test this trite and vague allegation. There has elapsed a period of forty, or more exactly forty-three years, since the liberal party acquired the main direction of public affairs. This followed another period of about forty years beginning with the outbreak of the revolutionary war, during which there had been an almost unbroken rule of their opponents, who claimed and were reputed to be the great preservers of the institutions of the country.” He then invited men to judge by general results, and declared that the forty years of tory rule closing in 1830 left institutions weaker than it had found them, whereas the liberal term of forty years left throne, laws, and institutions not weaker but much stronger. The address was a fine bold composition, but perhaps it would have been more effective with a public that was impatient and out of humour, if it had been shorter.|$|E
