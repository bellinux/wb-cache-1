The project analyses the social, urban and cultural values of the central Auckland context in conjunction with an evaluation of architectural elements that increase experiential time, and create an engagement of people with the significant buildings, and restored stream.

40|$|In applications, {{choices of}} {{orthonormal}} bases in Hilbert space H may come about from the simultaneous diagonalization of some specific abelian algebra of operators. It was noticed recently {{that there is}} a certain finite set of non-commuting operators F_i, first introduced by engineers in signal processing, which helps to clarify this connection, {{and at the same time}} throws light on decomposition possibilities for wavelet packets used in pyramid algorithms. While the operators F_i were originally intended for quadrature mirror filters of signals, recent papers have shown that they are ubiquitous in a variety of modern wavelet constructions, and in particular in the selection of wavelet packets from libraries of bases. These are constructions which make a selection of a basis with the best frequency concentration in signal or data-compression problems. While the algebra A generated by the F_i-system is non-abelian, and goes under the name "Cuntz algebra" in C*-algebra theory, each of its representations contains a canonical maximal abelian subalgebra, i. e., the subalgebra is some C(X) for a Gelfand space X. A given representation of A, restricted to C(X), naturally induces a projection-valued measure on X, and each vector in H induces a scalar-valued measure on X. We prove a structure theorem for certain classes of induced scalar measures. In the applications, X may be the unit interval, or a Cantor set; or it may be an affine fractal, or even one of the more general iteration limits involving iterated function systems consisting of conformal maps.

40|$|We {{consider}} triangular {{holes on}} the hexagonal lattice and we study their interaction {{when the rest}} of the lattice is covered by dimers. More precisely, we analyze the joint correlation of these triangular holes in a ``sea'' of dimers. We determine the asymptotics of the joint correlation (for large separations between the holes) in the case when one of the holes has side 1, all remaining holes have side 2, and the holes are distributed symmetrically with respect to a symmetry axis. Our result has a striking physical interpretation. If we regard the holes as electrical charges, with charge equal to the difference between the number of down-pointing and up-pointing unit triangles in a hole, the logarithm of the joint correlation behaves exactly like the electrostatic potential energy of this two-dimensional electrostatic system: it is obtained by a Superposition Principle from the interaction of all pairs, and the pair interactions are according to Coulomb's law.
