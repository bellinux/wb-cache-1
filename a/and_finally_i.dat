500|$|... "Live Together, Die Alone" [...] {{has been}} {{generally}} well received. IGN's Eric Goldman praised actor Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond Hume) for giving [...] "a likable, sympathetic performance". Goldman {{went on to}} say that the episode [...] "was a much better finale than last season", and that it contained one of the [...] "more interesting flashbacks of the entire season". Entertainment Weekly writer Scott Brown described his viewing experience as [...] "I was up, I was down, I was frustrated, I was thrilled, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> was...well, a bit numb." [...] Brown criticized the way Charlie reacted to the hatch explosion, stating that he felt the writers were trying to [...] "get us to hate Charlie".|$|E
500|$|On 18 September 1943, Pechersky, {{along with}} 2,000 Jews from Minsk {{including}} about 100 Soviet Jewish POWs, {{was placed in}} a train cattle car which arrived at the Sobibor extermination camp on September 23, 1943. Eighty prisoners from the train, including Pechersky, were selected for work in Lager II. The remaining 1,920 Jews were immediately led to the gas chambers. Pechersky later recalled his thoughts as the train pulled up to Sobibor, [...] "How many circles of hell were there in Dante's Inferno? It seems there were nine. How many have already passed? Being surrounded, being captured, camps in Vyazma, Smolensk, Borisov, Minsk... <b>And</b> <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> am here. What's next?" [...] The appearance of Soviet POWs produced an enormous impression on Sobibor prisoners: [...] "hungry hope-filled eyes following their every move".|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. <b>And</b> <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Aunor made five films. The {{first was}} Beloved, where Aunor reunited with Christopher de Leon {{together}} with Hilda Koronel and Dindo Fernando. The movie is about Four {{people who are}} torn between the love {{of power and the}} power of love and Infidelity. The film was also serialized in King Komiks. Next was Tinik sa Dibdib as Lorna, a long-suffering daughter of irresponsible parents who drove her to marry a security guard, [...] who himself is the breadwinner of a very dysfunctional family. Her next project was Till We Meet Again. This was followed by a trilogy movie, Mga Kwento ni Lola Basyang which was even stronger at the box-office <b>and</b> <b>finally,</b> <b>I</b> Can't Stop Loving You, an entry to the year-end Metro Manila Film Festival, which was a top-grosser for that year.|$|E
2500|$|The studio {{publicity}} {{department was}} concerned audiences would confuse Granger with British actor Stewart Granger, so they suggested he change {{his name and}} offered him a list from which to choose. [...] "The names were all interchangeable, like Gordon Gregory and Gregory Gordon. I didn't want to change my name," [...] Granger later recalled. [...] "I liked Farley Granger. It was my father's name, and his grandfather's name. They kept bringing me new combinations, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> offered to change it to Kent Clark. I {{was the only one}} who thought it was funny." [...] Eventually the studio issued a press release announcing Farley Granger, a senior at North Hollywood High School, had been cast in The North Star after he responded to an ad in the local paper. [...] "I thought that was a really dumb story," [...] said Granger. [...] "The truth was much more interesting." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, Haggard and {{his third}} wife Leona Williams {{divorced}} after five stormy years of marriage. The split served as a license to party for Haggard, who {{spent much of the}} next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems. Haggard has stated that he was in his own mid-life crisis, or [...] "male menopause," [...] around this time. He said in an interview from this period: [...] "Things that you've enjoyed for years don't seem nearly as important, and you're at war with yourself as to what's happening. [...] 'Why don't I like that anymore? [...] Why do I like this now?' <b>And</b> <b>finally,</b> <b>I</b> think you actually go through a biological change, you just, you become another.... Your body is getting ready to die and your mind doesn't agree." [...] He was briefly a heavy user of cocaine, but managed to kick the habit.

2500|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{transfer}} to Chicago, during continued fieldwork in Arizona, MacNeish set out his future goals. [...] “First I {{would learn to}} dig well and skillfully, then I would become able to analyze archaeological findings, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> would become a theoretician”. [...] It was during his fieldwork as an undergraduate and graduate student that he worked on his first goal. [...] At field schools across the United States, MacNeish absorbed the knowledge and techniques of anyone he worked with. [...] Synthesis of this knowledge came to fruition during fieldwork {{in the state of}} Tamaulipas in Mexico. [...] Here MacNeish made one of his important contributions to the field methods of archaeologists, fulfilling his first goal. [...] He pioneered a method of excavating caves that involved the stripping the strata off alternate squares from a vertical profile. [...] This allowed for greater detail and more meaningful divisions of an excavation. [...] Where many previous methods involved digging by arbitrary levels, the new method [...] dubbed the La Perre technique after the cave in which it was first developed [...] dug each distinct strata, or floor, separately.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two {{look at each other}} in growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result {{was one of the most}} suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script. MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: [...] "...When I... turned the key I remember I was doing it fast and Billy kept saying, 'Make it longer, make it longer,' <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> yelled, 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not going to hold that long,' and he said, 'Make it longer,' and he was right." ...|$|E

2500|$|John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, remarking, [...] "...more than most adaptations, this is a film true to Shakespeare's practice of employing all means at hand to keep the crowd entertained". Tom Clift of Moviedex complimented the director's use of subtle visual humor, while Lou Lumenick of the New York Post commented that [...] "this is the funniest Shakespeare film I can recall seeing". The Guardian scored the film {{four out of five}} stars, calling it [...] "...the first great contemporary Shakespeare since Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet". Christopher Schobert of IndieWire wrote, [...] "The result is an utter joy, Whedon's most emotionally resonant and fully realized feature film to date. And I say that as one who is not a devoted member of the Whedon army". Sheila O'Malley of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, noting that [...] "Much Ado About Nothing {{is one of the best}} films of the year". BBC Radio 5 Live's Mark Kermode said of the film, [...] "One of the things that it manages to do is, firstly, make all the dialogue and the language completely comprehensible". He proceeded to note that [...] "it makes sense to its audience. I think that the comedy is funny, and I don't say that lightly. [...] <b>And</b> <b>finally,</b> <b>I</b> think in terms of the way in which it deals with that gender politics issue is really well done. [...] It's a very hard trick to pull off, and he did it in two weeks!" [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire believed that, while keeping a sense of noir to compensate the romance, it was [...] "in balancing these competing elements and characters that this version really shines". The Village Voices Chris Packham said that the director [...] "approaches the story with a tremendous amount of joy".|$|E
