5|$|Kjetil André Aamodt of Norway is the most-decorated Olympic <b>alpine</b> skier {{with eight}} medals (four gold, two silver, two bronze). He {{was the oldest}} gold {{medalist}} (age 34 in 2006) in Olympic <b>alpine</b> skiing, until passed by several months in 2014 by Mario Matt, also 34. Austrian Traudl Hecher remains the youngest medalist in Olympic <b>alpine</b> skiing; she won bronze in the downhill at age 16 in 1960. Michela Figini of Switzerland is the youngest champion in Olympic <b>alpine</b> skiing history, with {{a gold medal in}} downhill at age 17 in 1984. Two Americans set age records in 2014: Mikaela Shiffrin, age 18, became the youngest Olympic slalom champion and Bode Miller became the oldest medalist in Olympic <b>alpine</b> skiing, with a bronze in the super-G at age 36. Croatian Janica Kostelić has won the most medals of any woman, with six (four gold, two silver). In 1952, American Andrea Mead Lawrence became the first female <b>alpine</b> skier to win two gold medals; Henri Oreiller of France won two golds and a bronze in 1948. Alberto Tomba of Italy was the first to successfully defend an Olympic <b>alpine</b> title, in giant slalom in 1992. Five others have since repeated, Aamodt in super-G in 2006, his third win in the event, and four women: Katja Seizinger, Deborah Compagnoni, Kostelić, and Maria Höfl-Riesch.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Alpine</b> chough lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than its relative, {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of the juvenile red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for the <b>Alpine</b> it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for <b>Alpine,</b> but is unknown for red-billed.|$|E

5|$|The most {{predominant}} {{plant species}} in the <b>alpine</b> zone around the pass are the grass species adapted to the harsh climate. Other <b>alpine</b> flora, such as moss and lichens on the rocks, and wildflowers in season, make appearances. Shrubs that survive among them include strawberry, snowberry, willows and bog birch. Animals in the <b>alpine</b> zone include ptarmigans, small burrowing species like pika, marmots, and pocket gopher, and mountain goats.|$|E
5|$|As a high {{altitude}} species with limited contact with humans until {{the development of}} mountain tourism activities, the <b>Alpine</b> chough has little cultural significance. It was, however, featured together with its wild mountain habitat in Olivier Messiaen’s Catalogue d'oiseaux ("Bird catalogue"), a piano piece written in 1956–58. Le chocard des alpes ("The <b>Alpine</b> Chough") is the opening piece of Book 1 of the work.|$|E

5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} <b>alpine</b> pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and <b>alpine</b> pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. <b>Alpine</b> plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E

5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} every Winter Paralympics since the inaugural games in 1976. Their sole {{participant}} in 1976 was Ron Finneran, {{although he was}} not an official entrant.

The number of Australian athletes increased to three, five, five and six at the next four games, respectively, and all of the athletes were <b>alpine</b> skiers. The participation decreased to four in 1998 and climbed back up to six in 2002. Australia won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992, and has medalled at every games since then.

5|$|Both choughs {{occupied}} {{more extensive}} ranges in the past, reaching to more southerly and lower altitude areas than at present, with the <b>Alpine</b> chough breeding in Europe {{as far south}} as southern Italy, and both the decline and range fragmentation continue. Red-billed choughs have lost ground in most of Europe, and <b>Alpine</b> choughs have lost many breeding sites in the east of the continent. In the Canary Islands, the red-billed chough is now extinct on two of the islands on which it formerly bred, and the <b>Alpine</b> was lost from the archipelago altogether.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude <b>Alpine</b> chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for <b>Alpine</b> chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
