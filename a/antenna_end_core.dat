40|$|Disclosed is a tapered double balun for {{use with}} rotationally-symmetrical, frequency-independent antennas that are fed using spiral-mode number 2. The tapered double balun {{may be used to}} provide a four-terminal line, where all {{terminals}} carry the same voltage, but adjacent terminals are out of phase and opposite terminals are in phase. The antennas may be spirals, sinuous, or other four-arm antennas. The tapered double balun is a stripline device comprising two outer ground planes and a center conductor that is dielectrically separated from the ground planes. The outer ground planes each taper from a wide dimension at the connector end of the device to a narrow dimension at the <b>antenna</b> <b>end</b> of the device. The narrow opposing strips comprising the ground planes are configured to connect to two opposed arms of the antenna. The center conductor is a single conductor at the connector end of the device that tapers to a larger conductor at the <b>antenna</b> <b>end</b> or may bifurcate to form two laterally separated conductors at the <b>antenna</b> <b>end</b> of the device. The center conductor is configured so that, whether single or bifurcated, it connects to the two remaining opposed arms of the antenna. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

This thesis investigates the response of periodic arrays of nanomonopoles and nanodipoles on a silicon substrate, covered by water, to variations of antenna dimensions.

By characterizing the properties of this mode certain response behaviours of the system were explained. Expressions are offered to predict approximately the resonant length of nanomonopoles and nanodipoles, by accounting for the fringing fields at the <b>antenna</b> <b>ends</b> and the effects of the gap in dipoles. These expressions enable one to predict the resonant length of nanomonopoles within 20 % and nanodipoles within 10 % error, which significantly facilitates the design of such antennas for specific applications...|$|R

We present a novel antenna design based on Au–SiO –Au single nanorod integrated on the facet of a quantum cascade laser operating in the midinfrared region of the optical spectrum. Finite-difference time-domain simulations showed that for sandwiched dielectric thicknesses {{within the range of}} 20 – 30 nm, peak optical intensity {{at the top of the}} <b>antenna</b> <b>ends</b> is 500 times greater than the incident field intensity. The device was fabricated using focused ion beam milling.

Such high intensity, hot spot locations can be used in increasing photon interaction with bio-molecules for sensing applications.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a loading {{technique}} for improving pulse radiation from bow-tie antennas is introduced. This technique al-lows transmission of short transient pulses with very small late-time ringing and relatively high radiation efficiency. It {{makes use of}} a combination of a constant resistive loading along the antenna and a capacitive loading with linearly increasing reactance toward the <b>antenna</b> <b>ends.</b> The constant resistive loading is applied using volumetric microwave absorbers to cover one side of the antenna and the linear capacitive loading is realized by constructing narrow slots on the antenna surface. Relatively high radiation efficiency is achieved by choosing the location of the slot nearest to the feed point {{in such a way that}} radiation from it combines constructively with radiation from the feed point. Using a 0. 8 -ns monocycle for ex-citation, the technique results in a level of late-time ringing of lower than 40 dB and at the same time the peak value of the transmitted pulse is 54 % higher than that of the same antenna without loading.

40|$|We {{examined}} the nucleated polymerization of actin {{from the two}} ends of filaments that comprise the microvillus (MV) core in intestinal epithelial cells by electron microscopy. Three different in vitro preparations were used to nucleate the polymerization of muscle G- actin: (a) MV core fragments containing "barbed" and "pointed" filament ends exposed by shear during isolation, (b) isolated, membrane-intact brush borders, and (c) brush borders demembranated with Triton-X 100. It has been demonstrated that MV core fragments nucleate filament growth from both ends with a strong bias for one end. Here we identify the barbed <b>end</b> of the <b>core</b> fragment as the fast growing end by decoration with myosin subfragment one. Both cytochalasin B (CB) and Acanthamoeba capping protein block filament growth from the barbed but not the pointed <b>end</b> of MV <b>core</b> fragments. To examine actin assembly from the naturally occurring, membrane-associated <b>ends</b> of MV <b>core</b> filaments, isolated membrane-intact brush borders were used to nucleate the polymerization of G-actin. Addition of salt (75 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO 4) to brush borders preincubated briefly at low ionic strength with G- actin induced the formation of 0. 2 - 0. 4 micron "growth zones" at the tips of microvilli. The dense plaque {{at the tip of}} the MV core remains associated with the membrane and the presumed growing ends of the filaments. We also observed filament growth from the pointed <b>ends</b> of <b>core</b> filaments in the terminal web. We did not observe filament growth at the membrane-associated <b>ends</b> of <b>core</b> filaments when the latter were in the presence of 2 microM CB or if the low ionic strength incubation step was omitted. Addition of G-actin to demembranated brush borders, which retain the dense plaque on their MV tips, resulted in filament growth from both ends of the MV core. Again, 2 microM CB blocked filament growth from only the barbed (tip) <b>end</b> of the <b>core.</b> The dense plaque remained associated with the tip-end of the core in the presence of CB but usually was dislodged in control preparations where nucleated polymerization from the tip-end of the core occurred.
