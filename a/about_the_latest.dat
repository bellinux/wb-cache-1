The complaints received detailed concerns that housemate Shilpa Shetty had been subjected to bullying. Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara's behaviour towards Shetty sparked widespread anger and demonstrations in India, where the alleged racism was reported on the news, and led Big Brothers main sponsor Carphone Warehouse to suspend its sponsorship of the show. As of 19 January 2007, a Channel 4 spokesman agreed that participants should {{be made aware of}} the controversy, which would probably explain the subsequent statements and apologies tendered by the housemates and their complete lack of surprise after learning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> eviction.|$|E

[...] He criticized the American military involvement in the Kosovo War (1998–99) as an imperial action; and described the Iraq Liberation Act (1998), promulgated during the Clinton Administration, as the political license that predisposed the U.S. to invade Iraq in 2003, which was authorised with the Iraq Resolution (2 October 2002); and the continual support of Israel by successive U.S. presidential governments, as actions meant to perpetuate regional political instability in the Middle East.|$|E
500|$|Ryan White {{was seen}} by some as an [...] "innocent victim" [...] of the AIDS epidemic.

I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything. Well, if it comes to your son's life, you better start changing your heart and your attitude around.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Risely rated [...] "The Almost People" [...] 8 out of 10, {{noting that}} [...] "As a {{traditional}} two-parter, Matthew Graham wrote a tight and coherent {{but not entirely}} scintillating script that managed to 'flesh' out the themes of morality and humanity {{with a couple of}} interesting touches". Though he called the cliffhanger a [...] "perfectly pitched WTF moment", he too believed that it [...] "detracts from the episode as a whole". Richard Edwards of SFX was more critical of the episode, giving it three out of five stars. He stated he did not feel any [...] "genuine threat" [...] and considered the Gangers to be [...] "uninteresting" [...] and [...] "predictable". However, he did praise Smith's performance and the cliffhanger. Digital Spy listed the cliffhanger among five best of Doctor Who since its revival in 2005, explaining, [...] "it changes everything you thought you knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> series, and it's damn creepy".|$|E
