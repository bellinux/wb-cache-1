2500|$|While journeying to the Emerald City, Dorothy {{encounters}} a scarecrow, who represents a farmer. The Scarecrow {{believes he is}} a fool, since his head is full of straw and not brains. Four years before the book's release, William Allen White, a journalist from Chicago, published an article titled [...] "What's the Matter With Kansas?" [...] In the article White questions why Kansas is unsatisfied and sarcastically answers saying <b>America</b> <b>needs</b> [...] "fewer white shirts and brains", implying Western farmers were ignorant, lazy and bad businessmen. The Scarecrow shares this opinion and doubts himself, believing he is inferior without a brain. In the same year White published his article, William Jennings Bryan delivered his famous [...] "Cross of Gold speech" [...] at the 1896 Democratic Convention. Bryan fought for the farmers and argued against such accusations made by White, exclaiming: [...] "The farmer who goes forth {{in the morning and}} toils all day, begins in the spring and toils all summer, and by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of this country creates wealth, is as much a businessman as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain." [...] Baum shares Bryan's view on American farmers by showing that the Scarecrow is sharp and capable by his actions throughout the book. The book ends with [...] "farm interests achieving national importance" [...] and farmers' true potential in politics being revealed once the illusion of ignorance has been removed.|$|E
