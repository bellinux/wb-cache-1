5000|$|One notable {{feature of}} TENEX was its user-oriented command line interpreter. Unlike typical {{systems of the}} era, TENEX {{deliberately}} used long command names and even included non-significant noise words to further expand the commands for clarity. For instance, Unix uses [...] to print a list of files in a directory, whereas TENEX used [...] [...] "" [...] was the command word, [...] "" [...] was noise added to make {{the purpose of the}} command clearer. To relieve users of the need to type these long commands, TENEX used a command completion system that understood unambiguously <b>abbreviated</b> <b>command</b> words, and expanded partial command words into complete words or phrases. For instance, the user could type [...] and the escape key, at which point TENEX would replace [...] with the full command. The completion feature also worked with file names, which took some {{effort on the part of}} the interpreter, and the system allowed for long file names with human-readable descriptions. TENEX also included a command recognition help system: typing a question mark (...) , printed out a list of possible matching commands and then return the user to the command line with the question mark removed. The command line completion and help live on in current CLIs like tcsh.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S. Navy, the Captain's Gig {{varied by}} the size of the ship, with {{aircraft}} carriers and, until the mid-1990s when they were decommissioned, battleships, typically assigned a double cabin cruiser that was 33 to 35 feet in length. These boats were typically painted with a white superstructure and gray hull with a red waterline stripe and black hull below the waterline. They would also frequently have the parent ship's hull identifier and hull number marked on the port and starboard bows with chromed metal letters & digits with two half of an arrow in front and back of the hull identifier. The front half of an arrow, with the arrowhead pointed toward the bow was forward of and the back half of the arrow was aft of the hull identifiers. The name of the parent vessel was emblazoned on the transom with chrome letters. Because these capital ships also held a dual function as flagships for an embarked admiral, an identical vessel, albeit painted with a black hull and green waterline stripe functioned as an Admiral's Barge. Chromed metal star(s) adorned the port & starboard bow, the number of stars corresponding to the flag officer's rank. The flag officer's standardized <b>abbreviated</b> <b>command</b> name was mounted in chromed metal letters directly on transom or on wood board mounted on the transom. In early 2008, in an economy move, Captain's Gigs were eliminated from all U.S. Navy ships.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of Poock's {{influential}} work in the early 1980 s, command and control is generally believed to be one specific application where speech input holds great advantages over keyed data entry. However, a recent paper (Damper & Wood, 1995 “Speech versus keying in command and control applications ”,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 42, 289 - 305) has questioned this interpretation of Poock’s data because the experimental conditions seemed to bias the results against keyed entry. While Damper and Wood modelled their experiments on Poock's, however, there were important differences which mean that their conclusions are uncertain. The objective of the work reported here {{was to determine if}} the major difference-the omission of concurrent, secondary tasking from their study-could explain Damper and Wood's observed superiority of keying over speech. Simulated command and control experiments are described in which speech input, <b>abbreviated</b> <b>command</b> keying and full command keying are compared under dual-task conditions. We find that speech input is no faster (a nonsignificant 1. 23 % difference) and enormously more error-prone (1038 %, highly significant) than abbreviated keying for the primary data entry task, but allows somewhat more (11. 32 %, not significant) of a secondary information-transcription task to be completed. Full keying has no advantages whatsoever: we believe that this confirms the methodological flaw in Poock's work. If recognizer errors (as opposed to speaker errors) are discounted, however, speech shows a clear superiority over keying. This indicates that speech input has potential for the future-especially for high workload situations involving concurrent tasks-if the technology can be developed to the point where most errors are attributable to the speaker rather than to the recognizer...|$|E

One could also refer to files in this way, say, with [...] "PED H-W:" [...] which would refer to [...] "HELLO-WORLD:SYMB" [...] if this was the only file having H, any number of characters, a hyphen, a W, any number of characters, and any file ending.|$|R

50|$|Palo Alto Tiny BASIC was {{the fourth}} version of Tiny BASIC that {{appeared}} in Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia, but probably the most influential. It appeared in the May 1976 Vol 1, No. 5 issue, and distinguished itself from other versions of Tiny BASIC through a novel means of <b>abbreviating</b> <b>commands</b> to save memory, and the inclusion of an array variable ("@"). The interpreter occupied 1.77 kilobytes of memory and assumed {{the use of a}} Teletype Machine (TTY) for user input/output. An erratum to the original article appeared in the June/July issue of Dr. Dobb's (Vol. 1, No 6.)

5000|$|In {{the default}} uppercase-only {{character}} set, shifted characters {{appear as a}} graphics symbol; e.g. the <b>command,</b> , could be <b>abbreviated</b> [...] (which resembled [...] onscreen). Most such commands were two letters long, {{but in some cases}} they were longer. In cases like this, there was an ambiguity, so more unshifted letters of the command were needed, such as [...] (...) being required for [...] Some <b>commands</b> had no <b>abbreviated</b> form, either due to brevity or ambiguity with other commands. For example, the command, [...] had no abbreviation because its spelling collided with the separate [...] keyword, which was located nearer {{to the beginning of the}} keyword lookup table.

5000|$|On July 1, 1944, LLA {{declared}} {{the state of}} war and ordered all its able members to mobilize into platoons, stationed in forests. The organization, possibly drawing from {{the experiences of the}} 1941 anti-Soviet uprising, envisioned a brief uprising followed by establishment of the independent Lithuanian state. The departments were replaced by two sectors - operational, called Vanagai (Hawks or Falcons; abbreviated VS), and organizational (<b>abbreviated</b> OS). Vanagai, <b>commanded</b> by Albinas Karalius (codename Varenis), were the armed fighters while the organizational sector was tasked with passive resistance, including supply of food, information, and transport to Vanagai. Staff headquarters were in Plokštinė forest near Plateliai Lake, Samogitia where LLA had a training camp. In August 1944, to bolster LLA prestige among political groups, Ververskis together with general Motiejus Pečiulionis and engineer Bronius Snarskis established the short-lived Committee for the Defense of Lithuania (Lietuvos gynimo komitetas) which was supposed to unite all anti-Soviet resistance groups and factions.|$|R

Army Tank-automotive and Armaments <b>Command,</b> <b>abbreviated</b> TACOM- ARDEC), and United Defense Limited Partnership (UDLP) in the development and delivery of the Crusader Armament System. These relationships are unique because, although the armament system is being developed by TACOM-ARDEC and manufactured by Watervliet Arsenal, it is not being supplied to UDLP as Government-Furnished Property (GFP). Rather, a teaming relationship has been developed directly between TACOM-ARDEC and UDLP. OPM-Crusader transfers findings to TACOM-ARDEC which performs the work under the technical and programmatic direction of UDLP. TACOM-ARDEC's role {{is similar to that of}} a subcontractor. This research paper examines the relationships between the organizations, and contrasts them to the relationships that are found in traditional GFP situations. The research showed that these relationships should result in a better designed howitzer at a lower cost the Government. [URL] United States Arm...|$|R
