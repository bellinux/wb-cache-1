Thus, a two-lobed anther develops four pollen sacs situated at {{four corners of the}} anther.Development of pollen sacs begins with the differentiation of <b>archesporial</b> cells in the hypodermal region below epidermis at four corners of the young anther. The <b>archesporial</b> cells divide by periclinal division to give a subepidermal primary parietal layer and a primary sporogenous layer.

50|$|The male {{reproductive}} organs generally develop more rapidly and appear sooner than the female organs. The male organs contain microsporangia which divide to form sporogenous tissue, composed of cells which become <b>archesporial</b> cells. These develop into microspores, or pollen-mother cells, {{once they are}} rounded and filled with starch grains. When the microspores undergo meiosis in the spring, four haploid microspores are produced which eventually become pollen grains. Once the male strobilus has matured the microsporangia are exposed {{at which point the}} pollen is released.|$|E
40|$|The {{switch from}} the {{vegetative}} to the reproductive pathway {{of development in}} flowering plants requires {{the commitment of the}} subepidermal cells of the ovules and anthers to enter the meiotic pathway. These cells, the hypodermal cells, either directly or indirectly form the <b>archesporial</b> cells that, in turn, differentiate into the megasporocytes and microsporocytes. We have isolated a recessive pleiotropic mutation that we have termed multiple <b>archesporial</b> cells 1 (mac 1) and located it to the short arm of chromosome 10. Its cytological phenotype suggests that this locus {{plays an important role in}} the switch of the hypodermal cells from the vegetative to the meiotic (sporogenous) pathway in maize ovules. During normal ovule development in maize, only a single hypodermal cell develops into an <b>archesporial</b> cell and this differentiates into the single megasporocyte. In mac 1 mutant ovules several hypodermal cells develop into <b>archesporial</b> cells, and the resulting megasporocytes undergo a normal meiosis. More than one megaspore survives in the tetrad and more than one embryo sac is formed in each ovule. Ears on mutant plants show partial sterility resulting from abnormalities in megaspore differentiation and embryo sac formation. The sporophytic expression of this gene is therefore also important for normal female gametophyte development...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Plant germlines arise late in {{development}} from <b>archesporial</b> initials in the L 2 {{layer of the}} anther and ovule primordia. These cells generate a radially symmetrical array of tissues that, in the Arabidopsis anther, comprises a core of sporogenous cells (meiocytes) and the enveloping tapetum, middle cell, and endothecium layers. The putative transcription factor NZZ/SPL {{is required for the}} specification of <b>archesporial</b> cells, but nothing is known of how their number is regulated, or what controls cell fate in the lineages they generate. Here, we report detailed characterization of extra sporogenous cells (exs), a male sterile mutant that generates extra meiocytes but lacks tapetal and middle cell layers. RESULTS: We identified the EXS locus by map-based cloning and found it to encode a putative LRR receptor kinase. In the anther, an increased number of L 2 layer cells assume an <b>archesporial</b> fate and divide to generate a larger number of sporogenous cells. In seeds, the exs mutation results in smaller embryonic cells, delayed embryo development, and smaller mature embryos. Consistent with the observed phenotype, EXS is expressed in the inflorescence meristem, floral apices, anthers, and in developing seeds. CONCLUSIONS: EXS regulates the number of cells that divide in the L 2 layer of the anther, and thus the number of functional male <b>archesporial</b> initials. In the young seed, EXS affects cell size in the embryo and the rate at which it develops. The apparently contrasting roles of EXS in the anther and embryo suggest that signaling through the EXS receptor kinase is a feature of a number of regulatory pathways in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|In {{angiosperm}} ovules and anthers, the hypodermal {{cell layer}} provides the progenitors of meiocytes. We have previously {{reported that the}} multiple <b>archesporial</b> cells 1 (mac 1) mutation identifies a gene that {{plays an important role}} in the switch of the hypodermal cells from the vegetative pathway to the meiotic (sporogenous) pathway in maize ovules. Here we report that the mac 1 mutation alters the developmental fate of the hypodermal cells of the maize anther. In a normal anther a hypodermal cell divides periclinally with the inner cell giving rise to the sporogenous <b>archesporial</b> cells while the outer cell, together with adjacent cells, forms the primary parietal layer. The cells of the parietal layer then undergo two cycles of periclinal divisions to give rise to three wall layers. In mac 1 anthers the primary parietal layer usually fails to divide periclinally so that the three wall layers do not form, while the <b>archesporial</b> cells divide excessively and most fail to form microsporocytes. The centrally located mutant microsporocytes are abnormal in appearance and in callose distribution and they fail to proceed through meiosis. These failures in development and function appear to reflect the failure of mac 1 gene function in the hypodermal cells and their cellular progeny...|$|E

Three different cultivars of this species viz ‘Senga Sengana’, ‘Selva’ and ‘Mount Everest’were investigated with the aim to characterise ovule development in strawberry. Special attention was paid to the formation of the archesporium. With this aim, fresh flower buds were collected at different developmental stages and fixed them in Navashin fixative (formalin, acetic acid, chromic acid – 3 : 3 : 0. 5). After preparing paraffin sections (6 - 8 µm thick) (following the standard paraffin method procedure) the material was stained with aqueous solutions of 1 % Safranin-O and ethanol solution of 0, 5 % Light Green. The stages of ovule development were observed under a Nikon Optiphot II optical microscope. The data obtained shows that in the three investigated strawberry cultivars the nucelli formation starts in the differentiating ovules located at the surface of the overgrown receptacle. Longitudinal sections of crassinucellar strawberry ovules on the early stages of development revealed that the most characteristic feature is the formation of a multicellular archesporium. It begins very often from at least two cells which are much larger than the other nucellus cells. These cells are derived in the result of longitudinal division of the original <b>archesporial</b> cell. After series of divisions along the long axis in each <b>archesporial</b> cells, the number of <b>archesporial</b> cells increases and multicellular archesporium arises. <b>Archesporial</b> cells are often surrounded by elongated, lens-shaped nucellus cells. At that time, the nucellus in strawberry ovules is composed of epidermal and subepidermal layers and inner integument is developed {{at the base of the}} differentiating nucellus. The investigated cultivars differ markedly in the number of the cells building the archesporium, the number of the archesporium cells which degenerate, and the further modes of female gametophyte development...|$|E

40|$|Colchicine {{has been}} applied to young {{developing}} anthers of Triticum aestivtim at varying stages of maturity from the last premeiotic mitoses of the <b>archesporial</b> and tapetal cells to the second meiotic divisions of the pollen mother cells. The developmental stage of the archesporium at which colchicine took effect was determined by cytological examination of the ploidy levels of the nuclei of the adjacent tapetal cells. The type of pollen abnormality induced depended on the time of application and the concentration of colchicine. Uninucleate monads with 4 randomly positioned pores and uninucleate monads without pores were obtained with 0 5 % colchicine. Multipored polyads and multipored uninucleate monads were observed together in anthers treated with o-oi % colchicine. Naturally occurring aberrant pollen types in hybrids of Triticum aestivum x Aegilops mutica or T. aestivum x Aegilops sharonensis have revealed a constant relation-ship between the disposition of the meiotic spindles and the siting of the pollen pores. The colchicine-induced abnormalities have further clarified the nature of this relationship leading to the interpretation that both the positioning of the spindles and the siting of the pores are pre-determined by events taking place in the premeiotic interphase at a time just after the last mitosis of the pollen mother cells and the penultimate mitosis of the tapetum. A reorganization of the <b>archesporial</b> cells (sensitive to colchicine) possibly occurs at this time. Various subsequent meiotic events are dependent on the reorganization.

This has resulted in high pollen fertility. Occassionally occurring two univalents in var. panicoides and one tetravalent in var. velutina are the only abnormalities observed. In all the varieties, the ovules are bitegmic, pseudocrassinucellate and hemianatropous. A single hypodermal <b>archesporial</b> cell differentiates in the nucellus and directly functions as megaspore mother cell. It undergoes meiosis forming usually a linear, rarely T-shaped tetrad.

During the interval from the <b>archesporial</b> phase until pachytene, the deriva-tive (or derivatives) reaching the anther loculi moved freely into the meiocytes. Subsequently, the tracer was excluded from the mother cells until the dissolution of the tetrads. The young spores readily took up tracer in the thecal fluid upon their release, and yielded strongly localized autoradiographs. These observations are interpreted as indicating that access of materials to the meiocytes is related to the formation of cytoplasmic links between mother cells in the early meiotic prophase, and the later severance of these links through the growth of the isolating callose wall which comes to invest the tetrads. Judged from the tracer retained in preparations extracted with trichloroacetic acid, thymidine incorporation occurs mostly in the premeiotic and early leptotene period, although there is some slight evidence of incorporation later in prophase.

Members of the gne 1 mutant class initiate all four layers of the anther wall and an appropriate number of sporogenous cells; however, as development proceeds the tapetal and middle-layer cells enlarge, eventually crushing the sporogenous cells. The gne 2 class anthers are disrupted at an earlier stage, with the middle and tapetal layers failing to form, and an excess of sporogenous cells developing until the germline aborts late in meiosis II.

About 8000 transcript tags, estimated at 30 % of the total transcriptome, were generated, of which around 6 % exhibited a modulated gene expression pattern at meiosis.

Four of them share strong homology {{with members of the}} RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, which in Arabidopsis thaliana is involved in silencing via DNA methylation. Analyzing loss-of-function alleles for two maize DNA methyltransferase genes belonging to that subset, dmt 102 and dmt 103, which are downregulated in the ovules of apomictic plants and are homologous to the Arabidopsis CHROMOMETHYLASEs and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE families, revealed phenotypes reminiscent of apomictic development, including the production of unreduced gametes and formation of multiple embryo sacs in the ovule. Loss of DMT 102 activity in ovules resulted in the establishment of a transcriptionally competent chromatin state in the <b>archesporial</b> tissue and in the egg cell that mimics the chromatin state found in apomicts. Interestingly, dmt 102 and dmt 103 expression in the ovule is found in a restricted domain in and around the germ cells, indicating that a DNA methylation pathway active during reproduction is essential for gametophyte development in maize and likely plays a critical role in the differentiation between apomictic and sexual reproduction...|$|E

The Phalaenopsis orchid takes 80 days to complete the sequence of ovule developmental events, making it a good system to isolate stage-specific ovule genes. We constructed cDNA libraries from orchid ovule tissue during <b>archesporial</b> cell differentiation, megasporocyte formation, and the transition to meiosis, as well as during the final mitotic divisions of female gametophyte development. RNA gel blot hybridization analysis revealed that four clones were stage specific and expressed solely in ovule tissue, whereas one clone was specific to pollen tubes. Two other clones were not ovule specific. Sequence analysis and in situ hybridization revealed the identities and domain of expression {{of several of the}} cDNAs. O 39 encodes a putative homeobox transcription factor that is expressed early in the differentiation of the ovule primordium; O 40 encodes a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase (CYP 78 A 2) that is pollen tube specific. O 108 encodes a protein of unknown function that is expressed exclusively in the outer layer of the outer integument and in the female gametophyte of mature ovules. O 126 encodes a glycine-rich protein that is expressed in mature ovules, and O 141 encodes a cysteine proteinase that is expressed in the outer integument of ovules during seed formation. Sequences homologous to these ovule clones can now be isolated from other organisms, and this should facilitate their functional characterization...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} RNA in situ {{hybridization}} to analyze the expression of transcripts encoding cytochrome c in different tissues and organs of sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Although northern-blot hybridization experiments indicate that the relative abundance of transcripts does not vary greatly, we have detected important changes in localization during flower development. Enhanced expression is observed in floral meristems {{as soon as they}} are discernible from the central portion of the capitulum containing the inflorescence meristem. As flowers develop, labeling is observed in all developing floral organ primordia. Later in development, expression in petals is reduced, and only the central portion of the flower becomes labeled. During the process of stamen formation, hybridization signals were obtained mainly in anthers. Less developed flowers at this stage showed expression through the <b>archesporial</b> tissue. During meiosis, the label was observed mainly in tapetal cells. Specific expression patterns, similar to those obtained for sunflower, were observed when Arabidopsis flowers were analyzed with a homologous cytochrome c probe. Specific patterns of expression were also observed in young sunflower roots. In this case, enhanced expression was detected in developing endodermis and pericycle and in protoxylem initials. We conclude that cell-specific mechanisms operate to regulate the abundance of cytochrome c encoding transcripts in different plant tissues. The overlap between the expression patterns of the nuclear encoded cytochrome c gene and some mitochondrial genes suggests the existence of coordinated mechanisms of expression...|$|E
40|$|InCymbidium sinense {{embryo sac}} {{development}} follows the bisporic pattern. This pattern of development {{is rare in}} orchids. Changes in the structure and organization of the microtubular cytoskeleton during megasporogenesis in this orchid were followed using an immunofluorescence technique and confocal microscopy. At the initial stage of development the microtubules in the archespore are randomly oriented throughout the cortex and cytoplasm. Later, microtubules undergo reorganization with more microtubules distributed in the cortex and around the nucleus. Megasporocyte formation is marked by the elongation of the <b>archesporial</b> cell. The cytoskeleton in the elongated megasporocyte is radially organized with microtubules extending from the nucleus to the peripheral region of the cell. In the megasporocyte some of the microtubules also show a polarized pattern of distribution with more microtubules at the chalazal end than the micropylar end. After meiosis I, a dyad is formed. Each dyad member possesses a complement of randomly oriented microtubules. But some microtubules in the dyad also show radial orientation. Soon afterwards microtubules in the degenerating micropylar dyad cell disappear. The functional (chalazal) dyad cell proceeds to meiosis II giving rise to a two-nucleate embryo sac. The pattern of microtubule organization in the two-nucleate embryo sac is quite complex. Each nucleus {{is surrounded by a}} set of randomly distributed microtubules. But the vacuolar region between the two nuclei is surrounded by a parallel array of cytoplasmic microtubules. No preprophase bands were observed during the development of the megasporocyte. This is the first description of microtubules in bisporic embryo sac development...|$|E
40|$|BcRISP 1, {{isolated}} from non-heading Chinese cabbage, decreases the seed set of transgenic Arabidopsis Tongkun Liu 1, 2, 3,*, Yu Qian 1, 2, 3,*, Weike Duan 1, 2, 3, Jun Ren 1, 2, 3, Xilin Hou 1, 2, 3 and Ying Li 1, 2, 3 Mitochondria are the energy sources of plant cells and {{are involved in}} regulating cell development. Ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur protein, which is necessary for mitochondrial respiration, is a subunit of mitochondrial electron transport chain multimeric enzyme complexes. To better understand the biological function of the ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase iron–sulfur protein, the full-length cDNAof BcRISP 1 was cloned; it was found to contain 810 base pairs and encode 269 amino acids. Unusually, high expression of the BcRISP 1 gene in the <b>archesporial</b> cell stages was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of cytoplasmic male sterile lines and maintainer lines. The seed set was affected by the overexpression of BcRISP 1, and shorter siliques with lower seed sets were observed in 35 S::BcRISP 1 Arabidopsis plants. These characteristics may have resulted from the reduced formation of pollen and impaired pollen tube growth. qRT-PCR results revealed that in 35 S::BcRISP 1 plants, the expression levels of themitochondrial respiratory chain-related genes, COX 10 and RIP 1, were enhanced, whereas the expression levels of QCR 7 and SDH 2 - 1 were reduced. This result implies that overexpression of BcRISP 1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants may disrupt the mitochondrial electron transport chain by affecting the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain-related genes and therefore, reducing the seed set...|$|E
40|$|Apomixis is {{a common}} feature of {{perennial}} plants, which occurs in ca. 60 % of the British flora, but has been largely ignored by reproductive theoreticians. Successful individuals may cover huge areas, and live to great ages, favoured by 'symmetrical' selection. Apomixis is favoured by colonizing modes, for instance post-glacially. Despite its theoretical advantages, apomixis usually coexists with sexuality, suggesting 'hidden' disadvantages. Agamospermy (apomixis by seed) is relatively uncommon, but gains from the attributes of the seed. It pays agamospermy genes, which discourage recombination, to form co-adapted linkage groups, so that they become targets for disadvantageous recessive mutant accumulation. Consequently, agamospermy genes cannot succeed in diploids and agamosperms are hybrid and highly heterotic. Agamospermous endosperm may suffer from genomic imbalance, so that nutritious ovules, which can support embryos without endosperm, may be preadapted for agamospermy. When primary endosperm nucleus fertilization ('pseudogamy') continues as a requirement for many aposporous agamosperms, selfing sex becomes preadaptive and <b>archesporial</b> sex remains an option. Apomictic populations can be quite variable although apomictic families are much less variable than sexuals. Only in some diplosporous species does sex disappear completely, and in those species some release of variability may persist through somatic recombination. The search for an agamospermy gene suitable for genetic modification should target fertile sexuals with a single localized agamospermy (A) gene, which therefore lack a genetic load. The A gene should coexist alongside sexuality, {{so that it would}} be easy to select seedlings of sexual and asexual origins. Plants with sporophytic agamospermy provide all these attributes...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of megasporocytes and the functional megaspore formation in Deschampsia antarctica were analyzed {{with the use}} of microscopic methods. A single <b>archesporial</b> cell was formed directly under the epidermis in the micropylar region of the ovule without producing a parietal cell. In successive stages of development, the meiocyte was transformed into a megaspore tetrad after meiosis. Most megaspores were arranged in a linear fashion, but some tetrads were T-shaped. Only one of the 60 analyzed ovules contained a cell in the direct proximity of the megasporocyte, which could be an aposporous initial. Most of the evaluated D. antarctica ovules featured monosporic embryo sacs of the Polygonum type. Approximately 30 % of ovules contained numerous megaspores that were enlarged. The megaspores were located at chalazal and micropylar poles, and some ovules featured two megaspores – terminal and medial – in the chalazal region, or even three megaspores at the chalazal pole. In those cases, the micropylar megaspore was significantly smaller than the remaining megaspores, and it did not have the characteristic features of functional megaspores. Meiocytes and megaspores of D. antarctica contained polysaccharides that were detectable by PAS-reaction and aniline blue staining. Starch granules and cell walls of megasporocytes, megaspores and nucellar cells were PAS-positive. Fluorescent callose deposits were identified in the micropylar end of the megasporocytes. During meiosis and after its completion, thick callose deposits were also visible in the periclinal walls and in a small amount in the anticlinal walls of megaspores forming linear and T-shaped tetrads. Callose deposits fluorescence was not observed in the walls of the nucellar cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} {{and development}} of ovules in orchid flowers are pollination dependent. To define the developmental signals and timing of critical events associated with ovule differentiation, we have examined factors that regulate the initial events in megasporogenesis and female gametophyte development and characterized its progression toward maturity and fertilization. Two days after pollination, ovary wall epidermal cells begin to elongate and form hair cells; this is the earliest visible morphological change, and it occurs at least 3 days prior to pollen germination, indicating that signals associated with pollination itself trigger these early events. The effects of inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis on early morphological changes indicated that ethylene, {{in the presence of}} auxin, is required to initiate ovary development and, indirectly, subsequent ovule differentiation. Surprisingly, pollen germination and growth were also strongly inhibited by inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis, indicating that male gametophyte development is also regulated by ethylene. Detailed characterization of the development of both the female and male gametophyte in pollinated orchid flowers indicated that pollen tubes entered the ovary and grew along the ovary wall for 10 to 35 days, at which time growth was arrested. Approximately 40 days after pollination, coincident with ovule differentiation as indicated by the presence of a single <b>archesporial</b> cell, the direction of pollen tube growth became redirected toward the ovule, suggesting a chemical signaling between the developing ovule and male gametophyte. Taken together, these results indicate that both auxin and ethylene contribute to the regulation of both ovary and ovule development and to the coordination of development of male and female gametophytes...|$|E
