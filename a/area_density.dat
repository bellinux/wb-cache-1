40|$|An {{application}} of statistic techniques for structure evaluation of packing of equal or distributed spherical particles is presented. The packing of particles generated by computer simulation is cut {{by a series}} of equally separated parallel planes, and the <b>area</b> <b>densities</b> of the cross-sections of particles on the cutting planes are used to analyse the packing structure. It is shown that as the number of the cutting planes increases, the mean of the <b>area</b> <b>densities</b> approaches the packing density. Then a time series analysis technique is applied to examine the randomness of the packing. The homogeneity of the packing is evaluated by testing the hypothesis that the particles are uniformly distributed within the packing space. The isotropy of the packing is evaluated both at micro-level, the distribution of projections of centre-to-centre lines between touching particles, and at macro-level, the variances of <b>area</b> <b>densities</b> on the cutting planes perpendicular to different directions. As case studies, the above techniques are applied to evaluate the packing structures of both equal and distributed particles obtained by a collective rearrangement simulation model...|$|R

50|$|Sloping armour can {{increase}} protection by a mechanism such as shattering of a brittle kinetic energy penetrator or a deflection of that penetrator {{away from the}} surface normal, even though the <b>area</b> <b>density</b> remains constant. These effects are strongest when the projectile has a low absolute weight and is short relative to its width. Armour piercing shells of the Second World War, certainly those of the early years, had these qualities and sloped armour was therefore rather efficient in that period. In the sixties however long-rod penetrators were introduced, projectiles that are both very elongated and very dense in mass. Hitting a sloped thick homogeneous plates such a long-rod penetrator will, after initial penetration into the armour's LOS thickness, bend toward the armour's normal thickness and take a path with a length between the armour's LOS and normal thicknesses. Also the deformed penetrator tends {{to act as a}} projectile of a very large diameter and this stretches out the remaining armour, causing it to fail more easily. If these latter effects occur strongly - for modern penetrators this is typically the case for a slope between 55° and 65° - better protection would be provided by vertically mounted armour of the same <b>area</b> <b>density.</b> Another development decreasing the importance of the principle of sloped armour has been the introduction of ceramic armour in the seventies. At any given <b>area</b> <b>density,</b> ceramic armour is also best when mounted more vertically, as maintaining the same <b>area</b> <b>density</b> requires the armour be thinned as it is sloped and the ceramic fractures earlier because of its reduced normal thickness.|$|E
