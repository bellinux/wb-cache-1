50|$|In data networking, telecommunications, and {{computer}} buses, an acknowledgement (or acknowledgment) is a signal passed between communicating processes, computers, or devices to signify <b>acknowledgement,</b> or <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> response, {{as part of}} a communications protocol. The negative-acknowledgement signal (NAK) is sent in many communications protocols to reject a previously received message, or to indicate some kind <b>of</b> error. <b>Acknowledgements</b> and negative acknowledgements inform a sender of the receiver's state, so that it can adjust its own state accordingly.|$|R

The new list {{is based on the}} responses received from questionnaires sent to organisations and individuals on the old mailing-list as well as on new applications. By the end of 1998 about 20, 500 (ACP-based) subscribers had been newly registered. The information you gave on your application forms has enabled us to send you subject publications lists which show books on our list most likely to interest you. Larger organisations will have received our full Publications Catalogue. The majority of you have used at least some of your credit points in the first year, and some subscribers are already placing their third orders. To help you get the best out of the new system and make good use of your credit points, please note the following: - Your credit points are free-of-charge; however, they do not represent any monetary value, nor can they be transferred to others. - Credit points remaining from one 12 -month period are valid for one more period. - Please return only {{the bottom half of the}} publications order forms we send you: your address is known to CTA through your unique subscriber number. - Returning the order form as a postcard is cheapest. - CTA sends all the books you order, provided there is sufficient stock and you have enough credit points available. Books are sent by post (priority mail). Some parcels may not arrive: though we regret this, we cannot refund credit points when this happens. - There is no need to send us <b>acknowledgements</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt.</b> - Books available to PDS subscribers are publicised in Spore, in our Publications Catalogue, in subject publications lists and in special mailings you will receive from time to time with your issues of Spore or by mail. Finally: please send your order forms by post or fax (never both) every time you need publications.

50|$|These {{are most}} popular and usually used by {{consumer}} service businesses, such as hotels and restaurants. They {{are less likely to}} be effective, as there is reduced assurance of their reaching the decision-making authorities. These also usually do not give any formal confirmation or tracking number to the complainant. Possibility of fake submissions also remains. Customers therefore have less confidence on such forms. Confidence can be strengthened if a central call center sends an <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> of such feedback. Another possible reinforcement may be done by taking digitized input, which can be processed using scantron machines.|$|E
50|$|Traditional TCP {{implementations}} {{uses the}} TCP Slow Start algorithm to detect how fast it can transmit without choking the receiver (or intermediate nodes). In a nutshell, it specifies that transmission should start {{at a slow}} rate, by transmitting a few packets. This number {{is controlled by the}} Congestion window - which specifies the number of outstanding packets that has been transmitted but for which an <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> from the receiver has not yet been received. As acknowledgements are received, the congestion window is expanded, one TCP segment at a time till an acknowledgement fails to arrive. Then the sender assumes that with the congestion window size of that instant, the network gets congested. However, a high bandwidth network can sustain a quite large congestion window without choking up. The slow start algorithm can take quite some time to reach that threshold - leaving the network under-utilized for a significant time.|$|E
50|$|Today, modern {{communication}} {{tools such as}} smartphones, flat-panel digital signage, GPS, and text-to-speech (among many others) are changing {{the way in which}} people are notified about emergencies. Of added value, with these more modern tools, is the ability to provide more specific instructions; so that, instead of merely notifying people about an emergency, it is now possible to provide specific instructions on what {{to do in order to}} mitigate the effects of an emergency. Furthermore, those instructions might even be customized for those peoples' specific and unique circumstances. For example, smart-phones may have geo-location abilities that would allow a map to be shown of safe locations (and perhaps routing there-to), relative to those devices' specific users — all with a singular alert being sent as the source of those warnings. Modern implementations directed at personal devices allow for <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt.</b> This way emergency services can gain insight on message reception and tally users that have reached safety.|$|E

Knowing he may need to bypass a landing in East London due to poor weather, Captain Lipawsky took on more fuel than would usually be loaded for the flight between Port Elizabeth and East London. He also told the {{passengers}} scheduled to disembark at East London aware that they may need to overfly the airport. One passenger stayed in Port Elizabeth {{to wait for a}} better chance to land, while the other passenger decided to continue with the flight, and stay overnight in Johannesburg if needed. At 4:41 pm GMT, Flight 406 took off from Port Elizabeth, and a 4:58 GMT, a weather report for East London was given. <b>Acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> of the weather report was given a minute later, and the pilot further requested descent clearance from flight level 90 (about 9,000 feet), which was granted. Air traffic control at East London requested the pilot to radio when he passed 4,500 ft. The pilot was recorded at Port Elizabeth tower saying that he was descending through 4,000 ft, seaward of the coastline and about 20 miles away from landing at 5:06 pm GMT. The pilot was made aware that lights for both runways were on, but runway 10 was not available due to poor visibility.

5000|$|This was {{the title}} that Cernuda gave in La realidad y el deseo to the {{revised version of}} his first {{published}} work Perfil del aire, which had been published by Litoral in April 1927. The collection was dedicated to Salinas, and Cernuda sent a copy to him in Madrid, where he was spending the university vacation. Cernuda later recalled that this book was greeted by a stream of hostile reviews that tended to concentrate on a perceived lack of novelty and on its indebtedness to Guillén. It also really stung him that Salinas merely sent back a brief <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> of the book. He dealt with the apparent debt to Guillén in an essay in 1948, in which {{he points out that}} in 1927, Guillén had yet to publish a collection. During the 1920s, Guillén had published poems here and there in various magazines - including 12 in two separate editions of the Revista de Occidente in 1924 and 1925 - but this is scarcely sufficient evidence to demonstrate significant influence, given that in December 1925 he himself had had 9 poems published in Revista de Occidente. His conclusion is that both of them were influenced by the works of Mallarmé - in the case of Guillén this influence was transmitted via Valéry - and shared an interest in pure poetry. José Bergamín, however, published a favourable review and Guillén himself sent him a letter praising the work and urging him to ignore the reviews. [...] Nevertheless, he was never able to forget the criticism that this work had engendered. He was too thin-skinned for that.|$|E
