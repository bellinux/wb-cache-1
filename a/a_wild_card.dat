30|$|As weak {{signals are}} seen to precede or {{indicate}} <b>wild</b> <b>cards,</b> identifying weak signals and interpreting them can produce information on <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> [38].

The identified <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> are assessed and their amount is narrowed down so that only the ones deemed most relevant will be considered in the following phases.
