40|$|CONTEXT: Recent {{evidence}} from both clinical and population research has pointed to psychotic symptoms as potentially important markers of risk for suicidal behavior. However, to our knowledge, {{there have been}} no epidemiological studies to date that have reported data on psychotic symptoms and suicidality in individuals who have been clinically assessed for suicidal behavior. OBJECTIVES: To explore associations between psychotic symptoms in nonpsychotic <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> <b>risk</b> for suicidal behavior in (1) the general population, (2) adolescents with psychiatric disorder, and (3) adolescents with suicidal ideation. DESIGN Two independently conducted case-control clinical interview studies. SETTING Population-based studies in Ireland. PARTICIPANTS Study 1 included 212 adolescents aged 11 to 13 years. Study 2 included 211 adolescents aged 13 to 15 years. Participants were recruited from schools. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suicidal behavior and psychotic symptoms, assessed by semi-structured diagnostic clinical interview. RESULTS Psychotic symptoms were associated with a 10 -fold increased odds of any suicidal behavior (ideation, plans, or acts) in both the early and middle adolescence studies (odds ratio [OR], 10. 23; 95...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} how adolescents compare monitoring efforts {{by their parents}} to those of a "good parent" standard and assessed {{the impact of these}} comparisons on <b>adolescent</b> self-disclosure <b>and</b> <b>risk</b> behavior <b>and</b> their perceptions of their parents' monitoring knowledge. Survey responses from 519 adolescents (12 - 17 years) at baseline of a larger, longitudinal study examining parental monitoring <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>risk</b> were examined. Adolescents' "good parent comparisons" differed greatly by monitoring areas (e. g., telephone use, health, money); however, between 5. 5 % and 25. 8 % of adolescents believed their parents needed to monitor their activities more than they currently were monitoring. Alternatively, between 8. 5 % and 23. 8 % of adolescents believed their parents needed to monitor their activities less often. These perceptions significantly distinguished adolescents in terms of their level of disclosure, perceived monitoring knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>risk</b> involvement. <b>Adolescents</b> who viewed their parents as needing to monitor more were less likely to disclose information to their parents (p<. 001), less likely to perceive their parents as having greater monitoring knowledge (p<. 001), and more likely to be involved in a risk behaviors (p<. 001) than adolescents who perceived their parents needed no change. Adolescent disclosure to a parent is a powerful predictor of <b>adolescent</b> <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> poor health outcomes. These findings demonstrate that adolescents' comparisons of their parents' monitoring efforts can predict differences in <b>adolescent</b> disclosure <b>and</b> future <b>risk.</b> Obtaining <b>adolescent</b> "good parent" comparisons may successfully identify intervention opportunities with the <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> parent by noting the areas of need and direction of monitoring improvement...|$|R

40|$|The {{rates of}} {{substance}} use and unsafe sexual practices among America's youth are a major public health concern. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine novel inter- and intrapersonal predictors of adolescent risk behavior. Aim 1 {{of this study was to}} examine how supportive and unsupportive parental responses to adolescents' negative emotions relate to <b>adolescent</b> substance use <b>and</b> sexual behavior, and to test whether the tendency to suppress unwanted thoughts and emotions mediates this link. Aim 2 was to further explore the putative link between suppression <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>risk</b> behavior by testing whether physiological arousal when viewing negative emotional stimuli mediates this link. Participants included 115 adolescents (mean age = 17. 19 years, SD = 1. 27; 48 % female) and 109 mothers. Aim 1 analyses revealed limited support for the hypothesized links: (a) adolescent-reported unsupportive maternal responses were associated with greater self-reported suppression (but not the other two measures of suppression), which in turn was related to more frequent sexual behavior in the past year and (b) adolescent-reported supportive maternal responses were negatively associated with adolescent substance use in the past year. Aim 2 analyses did not support any links between suppression and physiological arousal or between physiological arousal <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>risk</b> behavior. Overall, these results suggest some potential links among parents' responses to their adolescents' negative emotions, suppression, <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>risk</b> behavior. However, the hypothesized links that were significant in the path models were between variables measured by adolescent self-reports; therefore, the findings should be viewed as preliminary. I discuss these findings in the context of the available literature on parental emotion socialization, suppression, <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>risk</b> behavior, <b>and</b> suggest directions for future research that could move this area of inquiry forward...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{discover}} whether, {{and to what}} extent, children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> at <b>risk</b> of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) perceive themselves as lacking competence, control, social support and self-worth. In addition, the study aimed to discover whether, and to what extent, children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> at <b>risk</b> of DCD experience more trait and state anxiety than their peers. Fifty-eight children aged 8 - to 10 -years identified as being at risk of DCD were matched with 58 control children on age and gender, <b>and</b> fifty-one <b>adolescents</b> aged 12 - to 14 -years at risk of DCD group were matched with 51 control <b>adolescents.</b> Children <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> at <b>risk</b> of DCD were compared to the control group on measures of perceived competence, perceived control, perceived social support, self-worth and anxiety. Multivariate Analysis of Variance revealed that children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> at <b>risk</b> of DCD performed significantly more poorly {{than the control group}} on measures of perceived competence, perceived control, perceived social support, self-worth and state and trait anxiety. In addition, significant differences were found on some measures for age, whilst only the self-perception profile differentiated gender. Based on the assumption that children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> with poor motor coordination do have negative views of self and experience relatively high levels of anxiety, a second aim {{of the study was to}} test an aetiological model of anxiety. Harters (1987) model of the determinants of self-worth provided a sound theoretical basis for investigating the relationships between self-perceptions and affect. Self-perception, according to Harter, precedes emotional and behavioural outcomes. A series of path analyses conducted separately for each group revealed differences in the pattern of interrelationships between the dependent variables for children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> at <b>risk</b> of DCD ++and the control group. The salient findings were that for both groups physical appearance was an important and consistent determinant of self-worth. Few significant pathways were identified for those in the DCD group limiting the conclusions that could be drawn from this study. Overall, given the negative consequences of poor motor coordination identified in the current study it would seem imperative that early assessment and diagnosis of DCD be introduced into the school system...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} examines {{the relation between}} measures of childhood temperament at 54 months <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>risk</b> taking <b>and</b> externalizing problems. Three temperament factors were calculated from maternal reports: negative affectivity, surgency, and effortful control. At Age 15, data was gathered on <b>risk</b> taking <b>and</b> externalizing problems using self- and maternal reports. Analyses indicated that effortful control predicted self-reported risk taking. Different dimensions of temperament were related to externalizing behaviors, depending on {{the identity of the}} reporter. Maternal reports of externaliz-ing problems were predicted by all three dimensions, whereas self-reports of externalizing problems were predicted only by surgency. Additional analyses demonstrated that the prospective associations between childhood effortful control <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>risk</b> taking <b>and</b> externalizing behaviors were partially mediated by adolescent measures of self-regulation: impulse control and future planning. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of early emerging personality differences for understanding problem behaviors during the teen years. Keyword...|$|R

This is a novel risk assessment system comprising a set of screening questions and domain specific sub-schedules intended to be implemented in electronic format within a youth mental health setting. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was adopted with a series of focus groups conducted with three Child <b>and</b> <b>Adolescent</b> Mental Health Service (CAMHS) teams drawn from general and specialised services in a large NHS Trust in North-East England. A thematic analysis was used to explore the perceived clinical relevance, clarity and utility of the items that are contained within the FACE Child <b>and</b> <b>Adolescent</b> <b>Risk</b> Assessment Suite.

Dangers in the Adolescent River of Life: A Descriptive Study of Youth Risk Behavior among Urban and Rural presents prevalence estimates of four principal youth risk behavior domains—aggression, depression, substance use, and sexual behaviors among students primarily between the ages of 13 and 17 who attend public schools in El Salvador. The prevalence <b>and</b> distribution of <b>risk</b> behaviors is examined by gender, geographic school location, age, and subjective economic status. ^ Paper # 2.

The occurrence of five ACEs, the use of alcohol and tobacco and trying illicit drugs were investigated in the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort at the age of 15 (n = 4, 230). A score was created for the ACEs and their association with the use of substances was evaluated. Around 25 % of adolescents consumed alcohol, 6 % smoked and 2. 1 % reported having used drugs at least once in their lives. The ACEs were associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. A dose-response relation between the number of ACEs and the substance use was found, particularly with regard to illicit drugs. The occurrence of ACEs was positively associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs among <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> the <b>risk</b> may be different for men and women.
