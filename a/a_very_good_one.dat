Overall, the series had been <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> with two evenly matched sides {{competing}} well. England were unlucky not to win the first test at Lords due to rain, although they had had their chances.

He took 163 wickets at 17.50 and scored 1,183 runs {{at an average of}} 21.12 to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season for the only time in his career. With Maurice Tate, whose emergence as a pace bowler was encouraged by Gilligan, he established a bowling partnership which proved effective over the following two seasons. Gilligan scored two centuries and nine times took five or more wickets in an innings. As a result of his performances, he was named as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation noted that he was now [...] "among the leading amateur cricketers of the day", and was likely to play for England again. It concluded: [...] "It is not claimed for Arthur Gilligan, by even his warmest admirers, that he can be classed among great fast bowlers, but he is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> combining with the right temperament and tireless energy just the extra bit of pace that to many batsmen is so distasteful." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples". He described their constant glee as infectious and their [...] "bizarre logic" [...] as priceless. He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make {{the most of their}} screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

[...] Atomic went with a [...] "Pirate" [...] theme and were well organised during their production process thanks to Harry M.'s work on figures, and despite a slow start, they managed to sell all 601 of ice cream at Southend-on-Sea. By comparison, Kinetic, who went with a [...] "Treat and Trim" [...] theme, were severely disorganised while producing their ice cream and as Hayley, Lizzie and Hannah struggled with their figures, they had to throw away 40% of their mixture when the purchasing sub-team were unable to supply enough fruit, resulting in only 501 out of 801 being made. However, their location of Chessington World of Adventures proved to be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> and despite not selling all of their ice cream, their more daring price (£3.20 for a cone, compared to Atomic's £1.50) strategy paid off, with Kinetic winning with a profit of £708.34, compared to Atomic's £559.25.|$|E

2500|$|Continuing east the MCC team came to Melbourne to play Victoria, a {{stronger}} proposition than South Australia. Their captain was the Australian opener Colin McDonald and their wicket-keeper Len Maddocks {{and the two}} young bowlers Lindsay Kline and Ian Meckiff who had done well on the recent tour of South Africa. With Peter May still resting his knee vice-captain Colin Cowdrey was in charge, winning the toss and electing to bat on a good wicket. Fred Trueman and Frank Tyson were rested and after Adelaide {{it was decided to}} use both spin bowlers again even though it was thought only one would be used the Tests. Peter Richardson was caught off Meckiff's [...] third ball, whose action caused immediate interest. [...] "He bowled fast left-arm over the wicket with one or two really very quick ones which had the suspicion of a throw about them". Arthur Milton gloved a dropped catch going for hook, but settled down with his Gloucestershire team-mate Tom Graveney who was in fine form. [...] "Long Tom" [...] was out l.b.w. trying to pull a ball that stayed low with the score on 54, but Milton (116) added 197 with Raman Subba Row (83). McDonald brought on Kline (3/126), but his Chinaman were expensive and failed to turn. Meckiff removed Subba Row and Colin Cowdrey was run out by Ian Huntington after he stepped forward after an l.b.w. appeal. Tony Lock came in as nightwatchman and belted 44 in under an hour, which was appreciated by the 26,000 crowd more than Trevor Bailey's slow innings. Everybody made double figures except the first and last batsmen and the MCC totalled 396, Meckiff (4/69) being the best of the Victorian bowlers. Brian Statham and Peter Loader opened the bowling, but after [...] "George" [...] bowled opener Neil Crompton Laker and Lock were brought on and each took a wicket, Laker getting McDonald for 53 and Lock Allen Aylett for 23. After the rest day Victoria resumed on 119/3 and Statham demonstrated why his motto was [...] "if they miss, I hit" [...] catching one wicket leg before and clean bowling another five in his 7/47, including Ian Huntington for 73. When asked about the slow pitch he replied [...] "Well, if it's slow you’ve got to bowl faster" [...] With Victoria out for 252 the MCC had a lead of 144 and went for quick runs. Milton was run out by Huntington when sent back by Richardson (40), but Tom Graveney (78 not out) took the score to 149/3 and Cowdrey declared on the fourth morning after the two minutes silence for Remembrance Day. Victoria needed 296 runs in four hours and to McDonald's credit he went for the win, top-scoring with 62. Statham had no luck, Laker and Loader were ill with sun-stroke, but Tony Lock took 6/70, helped by three catches in a row by Milton. He managed to find turn and bounce and won the game by taking two wickets in the last over of the day. The tourists thought Ian Meckiff was a thrower, but not <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> no complaint was made and the MCC lost the chance ensure that he did not play in the Tests without too much fuss.|$|E
