The 'single ring' {{effect in the}} interaction of <b>a</b> <b>bunched</b> beam with <b>a</b> stack in the same ring. Here the coupling forces are fairly linear and are transmitted by machine elements. The 'two-ring' effect is the interaction of <b>a</b> <b>bunched</b> beam with <b>a</b> stack in the other ring. Here the coupling forces are nonlinear since they are produced by the beam-beam interaction. A brief outline of {{the general theory of}} these effects is given. The single ring and two-ring dipole effects have been observed and shown to cause a large increase in the transverse size of the stacked beam. (4 refs) ...|$|R

The experiment is designed to determine if such a scheme could be used to develop a compact, high power terahertz emitter. After acceleration to approximately 73 MeV, a mirror intercepts the beam.

40|$|It was {{observed}} that the vertical tune-spectrum of <b>an</b> electron <b>bunch</b> showed <b>an</b> asymmetrical distribution biased to a higher tune in normal colliding operations.

We found that a beam-beam interaction affected the asymmetry in the tune spectrum, although <b>a</b> measured <b>bunch</b> did not collide. The observations imply that the distortion in the spectrum is related to the field due to ions produced by colliding bunches placed forwards to <b>a</b> measured <b>bunch.</b> <b>A</b> tune-shift measurement supported the presence of ions...|$|R
5|$|The ninth day {{of racing}} {{resulted}} in <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint that was won by Sørensen. The {{next stage of}} the race was a forty-two kilometer individual time trial. Race leader Rominger won the leg by one minute and twenty-four seconds and increased his overall lead to three minutes over Casagrande, who was in second place overall. Enrico Zaina and Nelson Rodríguez Serna were the first two riders to reach the stage's final climb of Il Cioccio and the two stayed out in front until the finish which saw Zaina win the race to the line. With four kilometers left in the stage, Ugrumov and Berzin attempted to crack Rominger by attacking him repeatedly. After several attacks where the riders moves were marked, the riders agreed to ride to the finish together. The twelfth stage of the race saw the peloton arrive at the finish together ready for <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint. Cipollini originally won the stage but was relegated to last place on the stage after having {{been found to have}} leaned on Mario Manzoni during the dash to the line. Ján Svorada, who had come in second, was then made the stage winner.|$|E

The energy in the wave can be extracted by <b>a</b> second <b>bunch</b> (the trailing bunch), as this bunch propagates {{in the wake of}} the drive <b>bunch.</b> While <b>a</b> trailing electron <b>bunch</b> was accelerated in a plasma with more than a gigaelectronvolt of energy gain, accelerating <b>a</b> trailing positron <b>bunch</b> in <b>a</b> plasma is much more challenging as the plasma response can be asymmetric for positrons and electrons.
