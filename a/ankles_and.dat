5|$|OCD {{occurs when}} a loose piece of bone or {{cartilage}} partially (or fully) separates {{from the end of}} the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, <b>ankles,</b> <b>and</b> elbow but can affect any joint.|$|E
5|$|Supertunica – {{the second}} robe {{with which the}} {{sovereign}} is invested. It is a long coat of gold silk which reaches to the <b>ankles</b> <b>and</b> has wide-flowing sleeves. It is lined with rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven with national symbols and fastened by a sword belt. It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
40|$|Oscillotonometry using Dinamap {{machine was}} {{investigated}} for {{the measurement of}} <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> brachial blood pressures in our vascular practice. It was validated by comparison with intra-arterial pressure measured by transducer. Systolic <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> brachial pressures in 43 patients were compared using the Dinamap and Doppler techniques, and significant correlation was found. <b>Ankle</b> <b>and</b> brachial systolic, diastolic and mean pressures and ankle/brachial pressure indices for all three pressures were measured {{in a group of}} 12 normal subjects supine at rest, and after treadmill exercise, and a range of normal values defined. The main limitation of the Dinamap is its failure to measure pressures below 50 mmHg. The Dinamap technique is a noninvasive, simple, reproducible and quick method of measuring <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> brachial pressures in vascular surgical practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were 1) to document <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> subtalar motion during gait in 20 healthy subjects and in 25 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 2) to determine stride characteristics with and without the use of an extended University of California Biomechanics Laboratory orthosis in RA patients with painful <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> hindfoot deformity. An insole foot-switch system <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> subtalar electrogoniometers measured stride characteristics and dynamic range of motion (ROM). Arthritic patients demonstrated less ROM than healthy subjects except for ROM of hindfoot valgus. Arthritic patients also had slower gait velocity and less single limb support (SLS) time. In five new and five current orthotic wearers, a significant increase (p <. 01) in velocity and SLS time occurred with shoes and a further significant increase (p <. 01) occurred with the orthosis. Nine of 10 patients reported a decrease in <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> hindfoot pain after using the orthosis. This study demonstrates the value of an orthosis for the treatment of arthritic patients with <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> hindfoot pain and deformity.

5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, <b>ankles</b> <b>and</b> elbows).|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, <b>ankles</b> <b>and</b> instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E
5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his <b>ankles</b> <b>and</b> shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E

50|$|The final {{possible}} {{variation is}} in the foot, itself. One may either strike with the instep of the foot (with the <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> toes extended), or with the ball of the foot (<b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> toes bent back).

5|$|Textiles dyed with royal purple, {{a symbol}} of social status, {{were found in the}} royal hypogeum. Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes {{different}} from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his <b>ankles</b> <b>and</b> the hem on his shawl {{would have been in the}} shape of a thick rope, while his beard was short and his headdress consisted of a broad band. For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with oil, heating the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. Elephants, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that their bones were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was {{a symbol of}} prestige that glorified the strength of the king.|$|E

40|$|Although {{patients}} with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) {{are more likely}} to fall than age-matched controls, the underlying causative factors are not yet fully understood. This study examines the effects of diabetes and neuropathy on strength generation and muscle activation patterns during walking up and down stairs, with implications for fall risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixty-three participants (21 {{patients with}} DPN, 21 diabetic controls, and 21 healthy controls) were examined while walking up and down a custom-built staircase. The speed of strength generation at the <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> knee and muscle activation patterns of the <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> knee extensor muscles were analyzed. RESULTS Patients with neuropathy displayed significantly slower <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> knee strength generation than healthy controls during stair ascent and descent (P < 0. 05). During ascent, the <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> knee extensor muscles were activated significantly later by patients with neuropathy and took longer to reach peak activation (P < 0. 05) ...|$|R
