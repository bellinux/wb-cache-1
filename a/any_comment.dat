5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit <b>any</b> <b>comment</b> they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E

25|$|Blackmore ceased writing epics for a {{time after}} Creation. In 1722 he {{continued}} his religious themes with Redemption, an epic on the divinity of Jesus Christ designed to oppose and confute the Arians (as he called the Unitarians). The next year, he released another long epic, Alfred. The poem was ostensibly about King Alfred the Great, but like his earlier Arthurian epics, this one was political. It was dedicated to Prince Frederick, the eldest son of King George II, but the poem vanished without causing <b>any</b> <b>comment</b> from court or town.|$|E
25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had <b>any</b> <b>comment</b> on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 2010, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals {{overturned}} two of {{the three}} remaining mail fraud counts. It left Black convicted of one count of mail fraud, of which his portion was $285,000 (USD), and one count of obstruction of justice. The court also ruled that he must be resentenced. On December 17, 2010, Black lost an appeal of his remaining convictions for fraud and obstruction of justice. The three-person panel did not provide reasons. On May 31, 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to grant Black leave to appeal his two remaining convictions without <b>any</b> <b>comment.</b> Resentencing on the two remaining counts by the original trial judge occurred on June 24, 2011. Black's lawyers recommended that he be sentenced to the 29 months he has already served, while the prosecution argued for Black to complete his original 6 1/2 year sentence. The probation officer's report recommends a sentence of between 33 and 41 months. On that date, Judge St. Eve resentenced him to a reduced term of 42 months and a fine of $150,000 returning him to prison to serve the remaining 13 months of his sentence.|$|E

500|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{classified}} Myrmeciites as incertae sedis (Latin for [...] "of uncertain placement") within the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, as the specimens are too poorly preserved {{to be assigned}} to any tribe. However, in a 2008 paper, Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel, Switzerland, classified Myrmeciites as incertae sedis within the insect order Hymenoptera (which comprises the sawflies, wasps, bees and ants) because the critical characters used to identify Myrmeciinae ants, or even the family Formicidae cannot be carried out on Myrmeciites. Despite these comments, a 2012 report by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky does not make <b>any</b> <b>comment</b> in regard to Baroni Urbani's views; instead, he accepts the classification of Archibald and colleagues.|$|E
500|$|The lawsuit {{alleges that}} Sony induced King’s release from his {{publishing}} contract {{and refused to}} pay compensation. The attorney Alicia Roman told The Huffington Post, [...] " [...] annul the release due to the fraud they committed. When it’s annulled, all of the rights to Elijah’s songs are returned to my client, particularly the song 'Vida' that Ricky Martin sang." [...] Martin has not made <b>any</b> <b>comment</b> on the lawsuit. Additionally, Luis Adrian Cortes Ramos, a finalist from the first season of Idol Puerto Rico filled a $10 million lawsuit towards Martin. He sued the singer for releasing [...] "Vida" [...] despite claims that he submitted {{his version of the}} track as part of SuperSong contest, a version that was never recognized. Ramos' lawyer released a statement saying [...] "Ramos was surprised, disillusioned and suffered mental anguish because the song was almost identical to the one he composed. Until that moment, Martin was an idol for Ramos." [...] However, Martin's representative never commented on the lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 October, Mugabe and Nkomo spoke in turn, giving emotionally charged speeches about the [...] "dreadful sacrifices which the white governments have exacted from the poor black people". Neither made <b>any</b> <b>comment</b> {{relevant}} to a new constitution. Muzorewa then {{told the story of}} the life of the Ndebele King Lobengula in reverent tones, before Sithole made the only directly relevant nationalist contribution of the day, saying simply that he hoped the two sides could come to an agreement. A few days' break were then agreed as constitutional lawyers drew up a plan based on Kissinger's for the delegates to discuss. The American election result came through on {{the morning of}} 2 November 1976; as expected, Carter had won. In Geneva, meanwhile, it soon became clear that while the Rhodesians wished to stick to the plan they had agreed with Kissinger, the nationalists had no intention of doing so, regarding those terms only as a starting point for further negotiation. They continually interrupted the lawyers' work with new demands, meaning that by 8 November practically no progress had been made.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked by}} Kotaku whether the Wii game [...] (2010) was {{what became of}} Metroid Dread, Metroid series {{designer}} Yoshio Sakamoto said it was not. Sakamoto also denied Dreads connection with the Nintendo 3DS game [...] (2017), and stated that Samus Returns is a remake of [...] (1991) and not {{something to do with}} Dread. GamesTM asked Sakamoto whether Dread ever existed; Sakamoto confirmed its existence but stated that if the staff went back to it, they would [...] "start from scratch." [...] Sakamoto also stated that they were [...] "waiting and watching and reading the comments to see what people are interested in before we make <b>any</b> <b>comment</b> on the project." [...] According to Sakamoto, questions about Metroid Dread were popular, especially in interviews following E3. In May 2010, Craig Harris confirmed that the story for Metroid Dread was fully written and that he had seen it. He claimed that Nintendo was able to [...] "bring it back at any time." [...] Metroid Dread is the only game on the internal software list that has not yet been released.|$|E
500|$|He also denounced Bihari MPs, {{saying they}} were [...] "spitting in the same plate from which they ate" [...] by criticising Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians. He also wrote, [...] "They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains". The {{outburst}} was apparently in response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted {{the proceedings of the}} Lok Sabha in protest against the attacks on North Indians. Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, upset with the remarks, demanded that the Prime Minister and the Centre intervene in the matter immediately. The Saamna editorial prompted at least 16Lok Sabha MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the RJD, JD (U), SP and the Congress, to give notice for breach of privilege proceedings against Bal Thackeray. After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said: [...] "If anybody has made <b>any</b> <b>comment</b> on our members' functioning in the conduct of business in the House, not only do we treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms. Nobody will be spared".|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, the Beatles had {{experienced}} popularity {{since the start}} of 1963. But in the United States, Capitol Records, owned by the band's record company EMI, had for most of the year declined to issue any of the singles. The phenomenon of Beatlemania in the UK was regarded with amusement by the U.S. press, once it made <b>any</b> <b>comment.</b> When newspaper and magazine articles did begin to appear towards the end of 1963, they cited the English stereotype of eccentricity, reporting that the UK had developed an interest in something that had come and gone a long time ago in the United States: rock and roll. Headlines included [...] "The New Madness" [...] and [...] "Beatle Bug Bites Britain", and writers employed word-play linking [...] "beetle" [...] with the [...] "infestation" [...] afflicting the UK. In late 1963, Capitol Records agreed to release the single [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] with a large accompanying promotional campaign, due to Ed Sullivan's agreement to headline the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Beatles' American television debut was on 18 November 1963 on The Huntley-Brinkley Report, with a four-minute long piece by Edwin Newman. On 22 November 1963, the CBS Morning News ran a five-minute feature on Beatlemania in the UK which heavily featured their then current UK hit [...] "She Loves You". The evening's scheduled repeat was cancelled following the assassination of JohnF. Kennedy the same day. On 10 December, Walter Cronkite decided to transmit the piece again on the CBS Evening News, and the resulting interest led to the rush-release of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] and—only weeks before the Beatles' arrival—a U.S. commercial breakthrough.|$|E
