Villa's first El Clásico against Real Madrid came on 29 November 2010, where he scored two goals as Barcelona won 5–0 at the Camp Nou. Talking about the match, he commented that, [...] "It's been a very {{important}} win. We looked for the victory <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it.

500|$|This episode {{does not}} feature Scully, as Gillian Anderson was busy still filming her final parts of Fight the Future. Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales. He was {{requested}} {{for the part}} especially by Chris Carter. Casting director Rick Millikan noted, [...] "McGavin was Chris's inspiration for writing this series. He always had Darren in mind to use somewhere, {{and that was really}} his doing. He said 'I want Darren McGavin for this,' and he happened to be available, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him." [...] McGavin had originally been casting directors' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson for the second season opener [...] "Little Green Men". McGavin was later sought out to be Mulder's dad, but he again eluded the staff. In the end, McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Dales, the agent who founded the X-Files.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, it was like I was looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E
500|$|The demo {{was very}} close to what Mottola wanted the {{finished}} product to be, according to Afanasieff. [...] "We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: {{a day and a half}} for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing." ...|$|E

500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the kind of beating we deserved. But now, we need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Los Angeles, California, which doubled for scenes set in a 1950s-era New York City. The Palladium Ballroom, a former New York City concert hall, was recreated {{to serve as a}} centrepiece in the film. [...] In {{describing}} the look of the film, production designer Stuart Wurtzel stated, [...] "There are lots of photographs and some film from that period. ... There's a film called Mambo Madness from 1955 with some footage of Tito Puente and Desi Arnaz we looked at, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> pictures from the Cuban Society in New York and from libraries. The Cuban community has been enormously supportive of the film, so we've also been privy to the private archives of many people." [...] Ann Roth served as the film's costume designer, using vintage textiles to create the custom-made wardrobe. [...] The I Love Lucy segment of the film was filmed at Ren-Mar Studios, the former site of Desilu Productions. The set of the Ricardos' living room was re-created, with film editors intercutting footage with Banderas, Assante and Arnaz, Jr. with an actual episode featuring Lucille Ball." ...|$|E
500|$|First {{announced}} by series creator {{and executive producer}} Seth MacFarlane {{in an interview on}} August 13, 2009, the episode was written by series regular Patrick Meighan, and directed by series regular John Holmquist shortly after the conclusion of the production of the eighth season. In the interview, with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane conceded that [...] "Family Guy tends to be very liberal because [...] "it's written by liberals." [...] In choosing the conservatives who would be featured in the episode, MacFarlane stated, [...] "we put it out there to a lot of Republicans— 'we're doing this show, who wants in?'— <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> some bites." [...] Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising director, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Elaine Ko and Spencer Porter serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for [...] "Excellence in Broadcasting".

500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Long and {{directed}} by Lance Kramer {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). The title is a reference to the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century; a postcard showing this horse was used as a reference by the animators for the scenes featuring the diving. When the animation process began, Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work. He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story, [...] "we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality. So when everybody knew how to draw the horse <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> that out of the way, they could animate the horse acting." [...] Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast {{is trying to}} get back to the {{elevator}} after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E

500|$|The sketch {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Erin Fox of TV Guide wrote that Tina Fey [...] "nails [...] Palin's mannerisms and accent. [...] Poehler is amazing as Hillary her timing {{is better than}} ever. My favorite line was Tina saying 'I can see Russia from my house!'" [...] Fox added that [...] "this was a much anticipated and hoped-for pairing <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it!" [...] Annie Wu of TV Squad thought that Fey's [...] "impression wasn't perfect {{but it was more}} accurate than Amy Poehler's Hillary Clinton, which [...] still find incredibly off." [...] Wu added that [...] "the mugging for the camera was absolutely hilarious." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine wrote that [...] "Fey's Palin was perfectly good enough" [...] and that [...] "the skit itself {{did a good job of}} what SNL—which has lately cultivated a strong set of female comics—tried hard to do through Hillary's campaign, which is try to address sexism without either simply going for the easy stereotypes or letting female candidates off the hook." [...] The Huffington Post's reviewer wrote that [...] "Fey bears a striking resemblance to Palin and nailed the candidate's distinctive accent." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 Entertainment Weekly interview, Ward, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a medical show before, stated {{that when she was}} young, her mother was sick for over nine years and she {{spent a lot of time}} in hospitals. This being the reason that, on the set of House, she felt [...] "at home, in a strange way". While she was initially hired to appear only in [...] "Three Stories" [...] and [...] "Honeymoon", the chemistry between Ward and House lead actor Hugh Laurie was strong enough for Ward to return for a multiple-episode story arc in the second season of the show. On working with Ward, Laurie commented [...] "We're professionals who were lucky enough to be extremely well-equipped with a very sound, true script, the fact that Sela is immensely attractive <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on well certainly is not an impediment." [...] Though Ward has expressed that she would like to return to the show, Shore told USA Today in 2006 that, although he was eager to write her back in, there were [...] "no specific plans" [...] to have the character return.|$|E
500|$|Although {{they wanted}} to {{reproduce}} an older sound, Saadiq and Brunghardt also wanted to capture more of the bass and drum parts to add a louder, modern element to the mix. They applied a more basic approach to miking the instruments and utilizing the outboard gear, using a Neumann U 47 for guitars, alternating overhead microphones for Saadiq's drum kit, a combination of dynamic and condenser mics for the kit's bass drum, and Ampex tape machines for extra warmth to the kit. Brungardt used various standard mics for the snare drum to achieve a more solid cracking sound, rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, and as Brungardt recounted, [...] "It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up so that I could play with the live room, using different reverbs to get a sound." [...] For Saadiq's bass, they used a DI unit to connect a microphone preamplifier, increased the gain on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.|$|E

500|$|Disillusioned {{at being}} typecast as the [...] "sarcastic {{interest}} of the guy", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel {{of the same name}} and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: [...] "Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter." [...] She was cast as Eugenia [...] "Skeeter" [...] Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was [...] "well-meaning and hugely likable" [...] despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Volk {{helped lead}} the Colts to another Super Bowl appearance, but were now {{representing}} the AFC following the merger of the two leagues (NFL and AFL) that year. [...] This time, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. [...] Volk was responsible for covering Pro Football Hall of Famers Bob Hayes and Mike Ditka in the Super Bowl, and he {{played a key role}} in the Colts' victory. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Colts trailed the Cowboys 136. [...] Volk intercepted a pass by Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton at the Dallas 33-yard line and returned it 30 yards to the 3-yard line to set up the tying touchdown. [...] Baltimore quarterback Earl Morrall later referred to Volk's interception as the play of the game. [...] Interviewed in 2009, Volk cited Super Bowl V as his fondest memory of playing in Baltimore. [...] He recalled team owner Carroll Rosenbloom flying the whole team, families included, to the Bahamas the day after the game: [...] "The next day we all got on the plane and flew over to the Bahamas. He took the whole family – my wife and one kid, at the time. I remember we were on the beach, Tom Mitchell and I, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the paper to make sure it was really true - that we did win.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with me until I get my point across. ... and then we met up <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E
