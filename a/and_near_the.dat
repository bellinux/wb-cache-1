5|$|July 27, 2014: An EF0 tornado caused {{minor damage}} in Wolcott, mostly at <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> high school.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe weather was issued for April 26 for {{portions}} of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas along <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Interstate 30 corridor as conditions became even more favorable for extreme weather. A large PDS tornado watch with very high tornado probabilities was issued that afternoon for that same area. Widespread tornado warnings were issued in that area later that evening.|$|E
5|$|All of the castellations around <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> bridge {{were built}} to protect it, {{including}} Cromwell's Castle, The Salt Battery (Fort Eliza), Fort Falkland and the Martello Tower. However, the guns mounted on these forts {{could be used}} to destroy the bridge if necessary, as well as to bombard attacking forces on the river.|$|E
50|$|Rainfall averages 5 mm {{per year}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Chilean border to 200 mm per year on <b>the</b> {{northern}} coast <b>and</b> <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> Andes.|$|R
60|$|Jonas {{was right}} in his conjecture: as they came <b>nearer</b> <b>and</b> <b>nearer,</b> <b>the</b> sounds became more distinct.|$|R
5000|$|Stigmatellin binds {{farther from}} heme bL <b>and</b> <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> Rieske Iron sulfur protein, {{with which it}} {{strongly}} interacts.|$|R
5|$|As far as {{the ground}} water {{necessary}} for the conversion could penetrate, the pyrite-carbonate was converted to a usable brown hematite iron ore along the outcrops <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> bedrock surface.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{retired to}} his homeland, Dalmatia. He {{moved into the}} {{expansive}} Diocletian's Palace, a heavily fortified compound located by {{the small town of}} Spalatum on the shores of the Adriatic Sea, <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> large provincial administrative center of Salona. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of Split, the second-largest city of modern Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in Worlds End State Park, as the area was once a river delta on an ancient coastline. This coast was home to an ancient {{ancestor}} of the lungfish, which would burrow in the mud to survive dry spells. Fossils of these burrows have been discovered in the red siltstone formations in <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> park.|$|E
60|$|The {{bargeman}} turned back. Approaching <b>nearer</b> <b>and</b> <b>nearer,</b> <b>the</b> bargeman became Bradley Headstone, {{in rough}} water-side second-hand clothing.|$|R
60|$|And now the First and Foremost, who was {{in advance}} <b>and</b> <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> Emerald City, began to cough and to sneeze.|$|R
25|$|The unit {{operates}} from 3 bases;- Havant (<b>near</b> <b>the</b> M27 <b>and</b> M275), Totton (<b>near</b> <b>the</b> M271 <b>and</b> M27) <b>and</b> Whitchurch (<b>near</b> <b>the</b> M3 & A34).|$|R
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable to move out of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|The Jantar Mantar observatory, {{constructed}} in 1737, is located above the ghats along the Ganges, and is {{adjacent to the}} Manmandir and Dasaswamedh Ghats <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> palace of Jai Singh II of Jaipur. While less equipped than the observatories at Jaipur and Delhi, the Jantar Mantar has a unique equatorial sundial which is functional and allows measurements to be monitored and recorded by one person.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the vicinity of Apple River Fort, probably miners, likely arrived more than a decade before the fort's construction. The miners settled the site and built log cabins around <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Kellogg's Trail, a route from Galena to Dixon's Ferry; they obtained fresh water from a nearby spring.|$|E
50|$|Kepler-87c is {{a planet}} {{orbiting}} Kepler-87, a star slightly more massive than <b>the</b> Sun <b>and</b> <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> {{end of its}} main-sequence period.|$|R
60|$|The {{tramping}} {{footsteps of}} <b>the</b> Germans came <b>nearer</b> <b>and</b> <b>nearer.</b> <b>The</b> {{voices of the}} officers were audible, giving the words of command.|$|R
50|$|A further {{complication}} is mixing. In general, more NO {{will form}} in <b>the</b> center <b>and</b> less <b>near</b> <b>the</b> walls, as {{the walls are}} cooler than the center. Thus, more ammonia must find its way to <b>the</b> center <b>and</b> less <b>near</b> <b>the</b> walls, otherwise NO in the center meets insufficient ammonia for reduction <b>and</b> excess ammonia <b>near</b> <b>the</b> walls slips through.|$|R
5|$|The main {{campus is}} located {{on the south side of}} the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41/SW 8th Street) between SW 107th and SW 117th Avenue next to Florida's Turnpike <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> western {{terminus}} of the Dolphin Expressway.|$|E
5|$|The main rock {{formations}} in <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> watershed of Nanticoke Creek include the Mauch Chunk Formation (which dates to Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian times), the Pottsville Group (from Pennsylvanian times), and the Llewellyn Formation (also from Pennsylvanian times). The Lower Red Ash coal seam is present near {{the headwaters of}} the creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{most modern}} actions are {{primarily}} electronic, which connect the console and windchests via narrow data cables {{instead of the}} larger multiconductor cables of electric actions. Boxes containing small embedded computers in the console <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> windchests translate console commands into fast serial data for the cable, and back into electrical commands at the windchest.|$|E
50|$|Longest Drive <b>and</b> <b>Nearest</b> <b>the</b> Pin {{are most}} usually competed for {{by all of}} those taking part on Golf Society or {{corporate}} days with prizes for the winners.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the breeze}} fell, the words grew indistinct, but the {{procession}} still moved forward. As it came <b>nearer</b> <b>and</b> <b>nearer,</b> <b>the</b> {{voice of the}} reader was again plainly heard:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark! The thunder {{becomes less}} muttering. It is <b>nearing</b> us, <b>and</b> <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> earth, too. Hark! One crammed crash! All the {{vibrations}} made one by nearness. Another flash. Hold!" ...|$|R
5|$|The park lies on {{the borders}} of Grevena and Ioannina {{regional}} unit, north {{of the town of}} Metsovo <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> villages of Vovousa, Perivoli and Milea. There are no settlements or any facilities inside the protected area's borders.|$|E
5|$|The use of M85S cluster bombs by the Georgians and RBK 250 cluster bombs by the Russians {{resulted}} in civilian casualties. Georgia {{was reported to}} have used cluster munitions twice to hit civilians fleeing via the main escape road and admitted using cluster bombs against Russian troops <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Roki Tunnel. Russia denied using cluster bombs.|$|E
5|$|United Nations Security {{officers}} are generally responsible for security within the UN Headquarters. They {{are equipped with}} weapons and handcuffs and may be mistaken for NYPD officers, due to similarity in uniforms. The NYPD's 17th Precinct patrols the area around <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> complex, but does not have jurisdiction inside the UN headquarters themselves since the headquarters are considered international property.|$|E
50|$|He died {{of heart}} failure on December 22, 2011 at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home, {{to which he had}} {{recently}} moved when he felt he was failing <b>and</b> <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> end.|$|R
50|$|The parish church <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> pub, <b>The</b> Swan, are at Enford, while <b>the</b> {{local shop}} <b>and</b> <b>nearest</b> doctor's surgery are at Netheravon.|$|R
50|$|Alpnachstad {{station is}} one of two {{stations}} to serve Alpnach, the other being Alpnach Dorf, which is on the Brünig line some 1.5 km to <b>the</b> south, <b>and</b> <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> centre of Alpnach.|$|R
5|$|Wheat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, in <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Levant some 10,000 years ago. Its {{ancestors}} include {{wild emmer}} wheat; this was hybridised, harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains, in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms. It had been {{spread across the}} Mediterranean region as far as Spain by 5,000 BC.|$|E
5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after dismounting Dodge offered his men a chance {{to back out of}} the operation. No one opted out, and 21 men advanced with Dodge in an extended firing line, unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the volunteers at Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for Dodge to give the order before they entered the thicket and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks <b>and</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
50|$|On the {{posterior}} surface {{at the junction}} of the neck <b>and</b> body, <b>and</b> <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> lower than the upper border, is an eminence—the tubercle; it consists of an articular and a non-articular portion.|$|R
50|$|When European explorers first reached Salmon Creek, {{they found}} it {{inhabited}} by Coast Miwok people. Six Coast Miwok villages <b>near</b> <b>the</b> creek have been authenticated: Pulya-lakum, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the creek, Kennekono <b>and</b> Suwutenne <b>near</b> <b>the</b> present-day town of Bodega, <b>and</b> three <b>near</b> <b>the</b> present day town of Freestone: Oye-yomi, Pakahuwe, and Patawa-yomi.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17 mm. The forewings are very dark purplish {{with a white}} spot on the costa at the apical third, shaded with black anteriorly. There are two black discal spots shaded with white <b>near</b> <b>the</b> middle of the wing and a similar one on the fold, below <b>the</b> first <b>and</b> <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> base. The hindwings are yellowish.|$|R
