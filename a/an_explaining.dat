5000|$|Pleasure {{elicited}} by {{works of}} art can also have multiple sources. A number of theories suggest that enjoyment {{of a work of}} art is dependent on its comprehensibility or ability to be understood easily. Therefore, when more information about a work of art is provided, such as a title, description, or artist's statement, researchers predict that viewers will understand the piece better, and demonstrate greater liking for it. Experimental evidence shows that the presence of a title for a work increases perceived understanding, regardless of whether that title is elaborative or descriptive. [...] Elaborative titles did affect aesthetic responses to the work, suggesting viewers were not creating alternative explanations for the works if <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> title is given. Descriptive or random titles do not show any of these effects.|$|E

The behavior characteristics associated with the disorder severity may be potential stressors for family, relatives and caregivers. The burden on the family depends upon a range of interacting factors which require <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> model which {{takes into account the}} variables involved in the family’s adaptation to this chronic condition. We argue that the Bradford’s biopsychosocial model (1997), although originating in the health psychology field, may be useful for understanding developmental disorders to the extend that it emphasizes interactions between the following contextual factors; health beliefs, social support, disease challenges, coping strategies, and family communication patterns. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to make a critical review on studies regarding the impact of Pervasive Developmental Disorders in the family. As this phenomenon involves a range of interacting factors, in and outside the family and affect it’s vital cycle, we conclude that understanding could not be based upon linear relations between causes and its outcomes. As an alternative, this paper suggests the need of <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> model with respect to the range of variables involved on the family adaptative process when facing chronic disease. We emphasize the Bradford’s model (1997), which provides a psychosocial framework that integrates cognitive and systemic conceptions in a metamodel, specifically developed for a study of the impact of chronic illness in family.

The paper makes {{a review of}} literature and a research agenda on the anomaly of Brazilian monetary policy. Following a retrospect of the first 15 years after the Real Plan, there is a review of studies aiming to explain the high real interest rate. None of the summarized theses can completely explain the phenomenon. The main research opportunities are: deepening of empirical evidence of monetary policy efficacy loss; improvement in mensuration of its inefficacy; and improvement of alternative instruments to control inflation. The field of political economy is also fertile. One should assess the relevance of oligopolies as <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> factor of persistence of high inflation...|$|E

40|$|Mentalizing is an {{important}} actual topic, both in psychodynamic theory and in clinical practice. Remarkably, mentalizing has been explicitly related to religion or psychology of religion only to a limited extent. This article explores {{the relevance of the}} concept of mentalizing for psychology of religion by, firstly, describing mentalizing, its development and neuropsychological underpinnings. Secondly, to illustrate how the concept gives more insight into the psychology of religious phenomena, mentalizing is related to an almost universal religious practice, namely religious prayer. Empirical studies from different psychological subdisciplines are interpreted from the perspective of mentalizing. Finally, its relevance for the discipline of psychology of religion is discussed. In this way, the potential of the concept as both <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> psychological mechanism and a bridging notion that overcomes differences between psychological subdisciplines is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTLearning as an {{explanation}} of export developmentThis article aims to analyze the mechanisms that trigger and maintain durable exporting trajectories. By using the notion of trajectory, its major contribution lies in discussing how learning {{can be viewed as}} <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> factor of the exporting development. Empirically supported by a qualitative, longitudinal case study, one analyzes the permanence-continuity of exports of two shoe-makers during the years of 1970 - 2005. The results point out that the permanence-continuity of the exporting trajectory is related to a confluence of causes, which means the cycle of events-reflections that feed each one back and, as a result, triggers the permanence-continuity of the trajectory. According to a theoretical standpoint, these results suggest that the exporting development is a complex, non-linear phenomenon, which, by its turn, goes against the mainstream literature on exporting...|$|E

SEN, school setting, prosocial behaviour) for their occurrence. A subsample of 3 ’ 900 children from the National Educational Panel Study in Germany was analysed. Children and parents answered the items of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) subscales ‘peer problems’ and ‘prosocial behaviour’. Students with SEN (attending special schools or inclusive classes) {{were more likely to}} score within the abnormal range of the SDQ subscale peer problems than students without SEN. The results further show a low level of parent-child agreement on the subscale ‘peer problems’. Logistic regression analyses showed that having SEN is always <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> variable for ‘peer problems’ and that group differences cannot be fully explained by gender, school setting or ‘prosocial behaviour’...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Current {{architecture}} assessment models {{focus on}} either architecture maturity or architecture alignment, considering {{the other as}} <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> sub-variable. Based on an exploratory study, we conjecture that both alignment and maturity are equally important variables in properly assessing architecture organizations. Our hypothesis is that these variables conceptually differ, correlate, but do not explain one another. In this paper we describe our Multi-dimensional Assessment model for architecture Alignment and architecture Maturity (MAAM), which contains six main interrelated sub-variables that explain both alignment and maturity. We used existing models, literature from business and IS domains, and knowledge gained from previous research to identify the explaining variables. We constructed MAAM using structured modeling techniques. We are currently using a structured questionnaire method to construct an Internet survey with which we gather data to empirically validate our model. Our goal is to develop an architecture assessment process and supporting tool based on MAAM. ...|$|E
40|$|Both Norbert Elias and Pierre Bourdieu {{argue that}} both the {{research}} question and social theory should guide methodology and methods. Both theorists argue that any social theory {{should keep in mind}} the importance of macro-level structures; in micro-level interactions and social change. In order to fully grasp patterns of social change, social scientists would require a complex causal processed-oriented micro-macro-analysis. Because in research practice, it is almost never possible to implement the full methodology, both Elias and Bourdieu used a short-cut by using a six-step methodology, consisting of (1) self-reflexivity and detachment; (2) <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> of the theoretical perspective; (3) a reconstructing of the figuration’s/field’s socio-genesis; (4) a reconstructing of the micro-level; (5) a reconstructing of the macro-level; and (6) a theoretical synopsis. By using an example on local variation of economic practices, the paper illustrates this six-step methodology and concludes with further questions for future research...|$|E

It is a more interpreting thesis than it is <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> one. The examination shows that Turkey has considered Europe as a political model, while Europe has used the muslime Turkey as a threat to determine its own identity. The negotiations between EU and Turkey this autumn will have great impact on the identity of both sites. If the EU accepted Turkey as a member, the union could gain a chance to spread democracy to the islamic world and thereby earn global respect.

40|$|Abstract. Cryptographic {{protocol}} designers work incrementally. Having achieved some {{goals for}} confidentiality and authentication in a protocol Π 1, they transform it to a richer Π 2 to achieve new goals. But do the original goals still hold? More precisely, if a goal formula Γ holds whenever Π 1 runs against an adversary, does {{a translation of}} Γ hold whenever Π 2 runs against it? We prove that a transformation preserves goal formulas if a labeled transition system for analyzing Π 1 simulates a portion of an lts for analyzing Π 2, while preserving progress in that portion. Thus, we examine the process of analyzing a protocol Π. We use ltss that describe our activity when analyzing Π, not that of the principals executing Π. Each analysis step considers—for an observed message reception—what earlier transmissions would explain it. The lts then contains a transition from a fragmentary execution containing the reception to a richer one containing <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> transmission. The strand space protocol analysis tool cpsa generates some of the ltss used. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the migration}} between 109 local labour markets in Sweden during the 1990 s. This decade seems to differ {{a lot from}} earlier decades with respect to migration patterns – the industrial migration pattern has been substituted by a post-industrial one. This means also that the connection to the labour market situation has diminished as <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> factor for the migration choices. Most {{of the people in}} the ‘working ages’ move between local labour markets for other reasons than job opportunities. In this paper a lot of regressions are done with respect to the movers’ employment status before and after migration. Four the years 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1997 – and the analyses include differing categories as employed, unemployed, students and people outside these groups. The net-migration between the local labour markets are also analysed for the same groups and the same ‘explaining’ variables are used. From these cross-section analyses it seems obvious that the motives are different for various categories and that they also differ with respect to the economic situation. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine and explain Sweden’s defence and {{security}} policy during the twenty-first century.   The method that was used in this research was a case study. The material that was used were government documents focusing on this area of policy, and numerous books concerning the theoretical perspectives on international relations and defence security policy.   The study is of <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> art and the analysis explains Sweden’s security and defence policy during the twenty-first century. The analysis explains this by testing it against a liberal and a realist view on international relations.   The conclusion of the study is that Sweden’s defence and security policy has been liberal during this time period – and still is. When the cold war ended, Sweden started a new orientation that was carrying liberal ideas and ideals, which would transform the defence to this date. Realism was not part of the explanation at any point, not even when Russia was portrayed as violent, unreliable and with the now on-going rearmament and the conflict in Ukraine...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{knowledge}} map is {{a technique}} that increasing efficiency of <b>an</b> <b>explaining</b> associations of knowledge bodies {{with the purpose of}} managing knowledge in an organization by creating similar content associations. The most commonlyused algorithm is the prediction using association rules. However, this technique sometimes produced unsatisfactory results because the retrieved information hardly met the demand and could not explain associations of information contents to users deriving in less accessibility to knowledge. This research presents methods of explaining knowledge associations using a knowledge map, and estimating an appropriate association value for each piece of information. The value was then computed to find an assembly point of multiple-relation knowledge. A comparison, in which 1, 000 academic articles represented knowledge stored in an organization, revealed that the method of explaining associations hidden in the contents using the knowledge map yielded similar and more detailed prediction values compared to the method of defining categories from knowledge topics. This enabled users to see associations of knowledge in an organization and gave them access to knowledge stored within a knowledge base, consequently stimulating a knowledge spiral and integrated knowledge in a simple and effective manner...|$|E
