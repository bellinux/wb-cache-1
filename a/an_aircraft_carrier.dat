5|$|When <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> deploys, {{it takes}} a Strike Group, made up of several other {{warships}} and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a {{last line of defense}} against enemy missiles and aircraft. <b>An</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier,</b> as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. <b>An</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically has a huge target value.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{decided to}} build a class of two {{submarine}} tenders which could be converted into light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers. The first ship, Tsurugizaki, was commissioned into service in 1939. Construction of the second, Takasaki, was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier.</b> The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940. In early 1941, Tsurugizaki {{was taken out of}} service, converted to <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier,</b> and recommissioned as Shōhō in early 1942.|$|E

5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for <b>an</b> <b>{{aircraft}}</b> <b>carrier</b> that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, {{but had no}} way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier.</b> Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and the company began work on converting the ship.|$|E

5|$|During the war, both {{ships were}} mainly {{inactive}} due to Argentine neutrality. Rivadavia undertook a last diplomatic cruise to Trinidad, Venezuela, and Colombia in 1946, but both ships were immobile by 1948.

Rivadavia was stricken on 1 February 1957 and scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959.

5|$|Following its {{attacks on}} the Tokyo Bay area on 18July, the Allied fleet sailed away from Japan to be refueled.

These raids sank three battleships, <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> and several other {{warships}} but cost the Allies 133 aircraft and 102 aircrew killed.

5|$|Hotspur {{did not see}} {{any action}} during the Japanese Indian Ocean raid in April, but she did escort <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier</b> in September during the later stages of the {{invasion}} of Madagascar. In June 1942 the ship returned to the Mediterranean to escort another convoy to Malta (Operation Vigorous). She was converted to an escort destroyer beginning in March 1943 in the United Kingdom and was assigned to escort convoys in the North Atlantic {{for most of the}} rest of the war. After a lengthy refit in late 1944, Hotspur escorted convoys in the Irish Sea until the end of the Second World War in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at the June 1942 Battle of Midway, the IJN ordered the ship's unfinished hull converted into <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>carrier.</b> Her hull was only 45 percent complete by that time, with structural work complete {{up to the}} lower deck and most of her machinery installed. The main deck, lower side armor, and upper side armor around the ship's magazines had been completely installed, and the forward barbettes for the main guns were also nearly finished. The navy decided that Shinano would become a heavily armored support carrier—carrying reserve aircraft, fuel and ordnance in support of other carriers—rather than a fleet carrier.|$|E
