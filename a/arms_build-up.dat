50|$|To {{counter the}} threat posed by the massive Soviet <b>arms</b> <b>build-up</b> since 1928, the year Joseph Stalin took power, the French {{government}} on 4 July 1930 conceived the plan to form a projection force capable of assisting its allies in the Cordon sanitaire. This force would have to consist of five motorised infantry divisions and the five existing cavalry divisions, one brigade of each of which would have to be motorised. In 1934 the 4th Cavalry Division would have to be transformed into an armoured division. The plan called for the introduction of many specialised vehicles, among which was an Automitrailleuse de Cavalerie type Reconnaissance (AMR), specified on 16 January 1932 as a vehicle of three tons, armed with a light machine gun and having a range of 200 kilometres. Automitrailleuse was then the generalised term for any light armoured fighting vehicle armed with a machine gun and was also used to indicate a cavalry tank, as by law tanks (Chars) had {{to be part of the}} Infantry. Although the name might suggest otherwise, an AMR was not a specialised reconnaissance vehicle but a skirmisher without a radio.

5000|$|North Korea {{replied in}} regard to the nuclear issue in order to draw {{attention}} to the “unique security environment” that is threatened and blackmailed by the largest nuclear state. It sought to draw attention to certain points: In 1957 the United States introduced the first nuclear weapon into South Korea [...] and thus began a presence of nuclear weapon in the land; in the 1970s the number of nuclear weapons reached over 1,000 on the Korean Peninsula alone and thereby made the Korean peninsula the most densely populated nuclear weapons zone; in 2002 the U.S. administration named the D.P.R.K. [...] as part of the axis of evil and gave a “strong message” to the entire international community that the country is to be eliminated; and the “same administration” listed the D.P.R.K. onto its list of nuclear pre-emptive strikes and that, compounded with all these nuclear weapons, the U.S. and South Korea “every year take part in military drills as mentioned several times in the current session. In March 2013 when the situation was almost on the brink of war and it was the time when the international community realised how dangerous the situation was, which means an outbreak of nuclear war.” This also occurred with a massive <b>arms</b> <b>build-up</b> of nuclear weapons carried by the aircraft carrier , submarines and the B52 across the ocean. These events were viewed as blackmail and culminated in threatening the survival of the Korean nation as a whole (north and south). As a result of the unique security environment, the D.P.R.K. has no option but to go nuclear to defend its people and not allow “nuclear weapons to drop over the hills of the people. The nuclear deterrent made a great contribution to lasting peace in the Korean Peninsula and the world.” In addition, in accord with “the last speaker,” North Korea made a few more points: Israel has no justification to talk of another country as a full-fledged nuclear state; it is a “cancer in middle east;” it is “disturbing peace and security and shifting blame on all other regional countries;” and Israel and the U.S. are “making noise” about the D.P.RK. but are “mum and quiet and silent over the nuclear weapon of Israel.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the American military build-up of 1950 - 1951, a crucial event in starting the Cold War arms race. It examines the decision to initiate the <b>arms</b> <b>build-up,</b> and some consequences of that decision. In considering {{the beginning of the}} <b>arms</b> <b>build-up,</b> it accounts for the influence of external events, such as Soviet and European capabilities and actions, as well as internal factors, including public pressure and lobbying. In doing so, it seeks to assess the relative importance of the object being perceived, the Soviet military, and the lens through which that object was viewed, the political culture of the American foreign policy establishment. The dissertation makes critical judgements as to the timing, nature, and cause of the <b>arms</b> <b>build-up.</b> It argues that the critical period was between 25 June 1950 and 19 September 1950, that the decisive influence came from the President, and not from the military, and that it was the perception of the Soviet threat in Central Europe that was important, not the war in Korea...|$|E

40|$|Southeast Asia is arming massively. In {{the past}} decade, {{military}} spending by the region’s states has risen by 57 percent on average. China’s increasingly aggressive behaviour in the Pacific is frequently {{cited as the}} trigger for this leap in arms purchases. However, as this study will show, domestic and foreign-policy factors other than the ‘China factor’ have also been decisive for the increase: lasting territorial conflicts, domestic militant revolutionary movements and the powerful political influence of the military. Even if no direct link can be shown to exist between an arms race and an increasing likelihood of violent conflict breaking out, {{this does not mean}} that Southeast Asia is gaining in stability through the current <b>arms</b> <b>build-up.</b> On the contrary, the quantitative and qualitative expansion of military capacities has increased both threat perceptions and distrust in the region. In this context, Germany and many of its European neighbours would be well-advised to rethink their role as central arms suppliers to Southeast Asia more strategically and critically. Germany and the EU currently view the arms trade with Southeast Asian customers primarily from an economic perspective. What is needed, however, is a political and strategic discourse on the impact of their arms exports. (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|Both Venezuela and Chile have {{increased}} their defense spending since 2003. This thesis seeks {{to answer the following}} question: Is the commodities boom in South America responsible for the region's increased defense spending? First, it must be determined whether the increase in defense spending is due to an existing arms race, the historically high revenues of a commodity boom, or if it is simply a military modernization effort. What are the possible reactions of neighboring countries? Further, can game theory be used to provide predictions for regional conflict in South America? Despite the specter of an arms race in the region, this thesis explains that the increased defense spending in both Chile and Venezuela relates more to the 2003 - 2008 commodity boom than a competitive <b>arms</b> <b>build-up</b> in the region. The 2003 - 2008 commodity boom and resulting availability of resources, combined with the need to upgrade decades-old, dilapidated military hardware have resulted in a fury of military hardware purchases throughout the region. Additionally, this thesis will provide predictions from game theory literature for regional conflict in South America as {{other countries in the region}} have experienced the same benefits of the 2003 - 2008 commodity boom, and thus {{have increased}} defense spending.

40|$|Global {{military}} spending is decreasing. However this trend {{does not apply}} to some regions of the world, specifically Southeast Asia. This thesis describes the ongoing naval arms buildup in this region and examines why it is occurring {{when the rest of the}} world is decreasing {{military spending}}. Next, this thesis asks if this <b>arms</b> <b>build-up</b> is dangerous. Unlike many other arms races around the world, the Southeast Asian build-up is not particularly dangerous because of the parallel development of confidence and security building measures. I answer this question affirmatively and then examine the causes of this situation. Using three countries as case studies [...] Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia [...] I argue that a combination of three factors fuels an arms race. The three categories which drive a naval arms race are economic growth, changes in perceived threat, and prestige. Thai naval expenditures are affected by all three factors in roughly equal proportions. Singaporean expenditures are driven by economics and prestige considerations. Changes in Indonesian spending are the result of security and prestige considerations. The next question is whether the arms race is dangerous. Nations in the region have engaged in serious efforts to establish effective confidence and security building measures which have mitigated the negative effects of an arms race. As long as these efforts continue, there is little danger in the arms race degenerating into armed conflict. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{evidence}} produced during the 7 {{years of the}} Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), we here try to summarize the main effects of the talks concerning: <b>arms</b> <b>build-up,</b> strategic stability, crisis stability, detente, the focus of superpower relations, legitimation of the arms race, strategic supremacy vis-&agrave;-vis {{the rest of the}} world, and international status quo. The strategic relationship seems plagued by growing uncertainty and instability because of surging R&D efforts. Improved capabilities and doctrines for nuclear warfighting open up prospects for dangerous adventures in times of crises. Detente and peaceful cooperation to some extent have had to yield to intensified nuclear rearmament. In this paper, we try to outline the role of SALT in bringing about these trends, which clearly make strategic arms limitation more difficult. To the extent that it has contributed to them, SALT has sown the seeds of its own deadlock. This {{is not to say that}} SALT has come to an end. The superpowers probably see a long-term benefit from talking to each other to promote common interests under shifting circum-stances, such as the preservation of strategic supremacy over the rest of the world and main-tenance and maximization of influence and control in the face of third party challengers. There can be an element of harmony in the confrontation and competition between them.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{narrative}} and analytical {{history of the}} Hungarian air service. It follows its development from the Allied intervention of 1919 {{through the end of}} the Second World War. Denied an air force by the Treaty of Trianon, Hungarian airmen determined to thwart the inspection system and preserve national air power. The prohibition against military aviation persisted after the Commission was withdrawn, and through Hungarian diplomatic efforts, a relationship was established with Italy that included substantial assistance to the clandestine Hungarian air service. This low-grade <b>arms</b> <b>build-up</b> continued through the 1930 s, during which there was a robust discussion about air power theory and the nature of future aerial warfare in Magyar Katonai Szemle [Hungarian Military Review]. After the rise of Hitler, Germany offered arms credits and support for Hungary’s obsession with regaining the territory lost in the post-war settlement. The air service grew mainly through imported aeroplanes, the purchase of which ceased to be secret after the Little Entente recognised Hungary’s equality of arms. The Hungarian air force became independent in 1939, and enjoyed public acclaim after decisive air-to-air victories over Slovak pilots during the occupation of Upper Hungary. The General Staff never accepted its autonomy, however, and succeeded in reclaiming control of the air force in 1941. After Hungary joined the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, the air force provided air defence and interdiction in support of the Rapid Corps. Its mounting losses were made good by German aeroplanes, some of which were produced in Hungarian factories. As the Allied bombing campaign against Hungary intensified in 1944, most of its aircraft were devoted to homeland defence. The force ceased to exist as a true national service after the German-led coup in October 1944, but continued a fighting withdrawal to the west until captured by American forces.

40|$|This project {{provides}} {{an examination of}} the magazine industry in which Willa Cather worked and published; more specifically, it focuses on McClure’s Magazine and the Progessivist rhetoric Cather produced concerning immigration, women’s pay, ward politics, and war. Cather’s early political writing runs as an undercurrent in her major novels, especially The Song of the Lark, My Ántonia, and One of Ours. In considering Cather 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 work, 2 ̆ 2 I uncover and define Cather 2 ̆ 7 s duties as managing editor for McClure 2 ̆ 7 s Magazine (1906 - 1911). Part of my goal is to address concepts of 2 ̆ 2 authorship 2 ̆ 2 within the magazine industry. In most cases, ownership and authorship of writing were determined by legal contracts and by designated bylines. The working culture of the magazine office, however, relied on multi-authored and ghost-authored texts. Cather, for example, almost never carried a byline for the magazine, {{despite the fact that she}} spent half of each workweek writing articles for McClure 2 ̆ 7 s. Thus, her writing oftentimes was not equated with authorship, at least in the public arena. ^ In addition to studying issues of authorship, I examine Cather’s role as a rhetor, or public speaker. As managing editor for McClure’s, she assumed the corporate voice of one of the leading forums of public opinion. In this role, she organized and edited articles on social reform issues, including immigration, prostitution, and labor, in addition to international issues, including the <b>arms</b> <b>build-up</b> between Britain and Germany and the issue of torture for Russian political prisoners. In short, in order to understand her position as a rhetor, we must understand the political and social programs supported within the pages of the journal. ^ Cather’s role as rhetor takes on overt political significance. Twenty years ago, the general assumption within Cather scholarship was that Cather was staunchly apolitical; in the last ten years, however, more political and cultural inquiries have emerged. My research resituates Cather’s writing within its highly politicized context, thereby revealing the author’s participation in, and production of, national Progressive rhetoric. ...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Cold War, the gathering of intelligence on the Soviet Union's current and future military capability seemed a near-impossibility. Soviet high-level communications were secure against decryption. Agent networks in the USSR were very difficult to establish and of uncertain reliability. Aerial reconnaissance of warrelated targets in the Soviet Union was risky and could only be occasional. But valuable intelligence was gathered in the years 1945 - 55 on the USSR's frantic <b>arms</b> <b>build-up,</b> thanks to its policy towards Germans and their country. Its exploitation of Germans and its Zone of Germany in its war-related research and development and the reconstruction of its war-related industries gave British Intelligence penetrable targets in the Soviet Zone and gave great numbers of Germans sought-after information on the USSR itself. The ease of recruiting age nts in East Germany and the flight (including enticed defections) of refugees from it allowed research and development projects and uranium. -mining operations there to be penetrated. Intelligence of Soviet weapons development and of the quality of Soviet military technology was obtained. The mass interrogation of prisoners-of-war returned by the Soviets to the British Occupation Zone in the late 1940 s yielded a wealth of valuable information on war-related construction and the locations of numerous intelligence targets in the Soviet Union: most importantly, those of atomic and chemical plants, aircraft and aero-engine factories, airfields, rocket development centres and other installations. When, in the period 1949 - 58, some 3, 000 deported German scientists, engineers and technicians were sent back to their homeland from the USSR, promising sources among them were enticed West and interrogated for their knowledge of the Soviets' research and development projects. The cream of the information they provided was crucial intelligence on the locations of atomic plants and laboratories and uranium deposits; useful information on structural weaknesses in the Soviet system of scientific and economic management; expert (if out-of-date) assessments of the quality of Soviet accomplishments in atomic science, electronics and other fields; and well-informed indications as to possible lines of development in guided missile and aircraft design. One Soviet scientific defector in Germany provided similar information which influenced British perceptions of the Soviet Union's scientific potential and missile development plans. Refugees entering the British Zone from East Germany, intercepted letters and monitored telecommunications, informal contacts and, of course, secret agents all made significant contributions to the gathering of scientific and technical intelligence in Germany too. The British passed to the Americans much of the intelligence they acquired in Germany and the installations identified and located by German sources were overtlown by spyplanes in the 1950 s and particularly by U- 2 s in the latter half of-the decade. Priceless information was obtained, which establi shed that the USSR's war-related scientific research and development and its actual military capability were both inferior to those of the West. Thus the Germans enabled Soviet security to be deeply penetrated and helped to stabilize the Cold War. They are the missing link between Ultra and the U- 2...|$|E
40|$|Conflicts {{within the}} Roman Catholic {{hierarchy}} poses {{risks to the}} organizational effectiveness of the Church, but the hierarchy 9 ̆ 2 s approach to conflict handling has rarely been subjected to systematic, empirically grounded study. This research addresses that deficit by means of case study, wherein a six-year-long conflict is examined {{in the light of}} theoretical expectations generated through a literature survey, {{and with the help of}} critical discourse analysis and conflict theory. The research identifies organizational and societal pressures on bishops 9 ̆ 2 conflict handling and various strategies that bishops employ in center-periphery conflicts: that is, in conflicts between the Vatican and bishop leaders of local churches. The theoretical literature conceptually places center-periphery conflict in the context of the Church organization and in the broader context of the modern world. On the basis of the theoretical literature, expectations about the strategies bishops are likely to adopt in center-periphery conflict situations are specified. These expectations are then tested against the empirical example of the Rome-Hunthausen case (1983 - 89), which involved the papacy of John Paul II, Archbishop Raymond of Seattle and the American Bishops 9 ̆ 2 Conference. Documents produced by multiple bishop participants in the conflict serve as an embedded unit of analysis in the case study. These are subjected to critical discourse analysis (following the approach of Norman Fairclough, Lancaster University), conflict analysis and validation techniques with control documents. Hunthausen 9 ̆ 2 s conflict with the Vatican (1983 - 1989) focused on Rome 9 ̆ 2 s effort to establish greater pastoral discipline within the local church. Hunthausen was popularly known as the progressive leader of a progressive archdiocese and he gained much personal attention as an outspoken opponent of the Reagan administration nuclear <b>arms</b> <b>build-up.</b> (He protested by refusing to pay half of his income tax to the government.) To achieve its objectives in Seattle, which ostensibly focused on liturgical, Church teaching and governance and Church legal issues, Rome appointed an auxiliary bishop and forced Hunthausen to hand key powers of archdiocesan leadership over to the auxiliary. Hunthausen fought this redistribution of power and took his case to the national bishops 9 ̆ 2 conference. Remarkably, Hunthausen was able to make the Vatican retreat and restore his power, but not without making concessions of his own, which included acceptance of a coadjutor archbishop with right of succession. Adding intrigue to the case was the suspicion that the Reagan administration asked the Vatican to put pressure on Hunthausen in return for recognition of the Vatican ambassador (which was granted by the US in 1984). This speculation has never died, but evidence for this belief is, at the present time, circumstantial at best. The investigation concludes that Catholic bishops show a strong tendency to protect the power and appearance of the Church organization and of their own personal position in conflict situations. Bishops place a high priority on legitimating their actions in ways in keeping with the Church 9 ̆ 2 s normative character. The research highlights nine key strategies that bishops employ to manage conflicts. These are (1) showing deference to the structural order and mindset of the Church, (2) associating one 9 ̆ 2 s own efforts with the best interest of the Church, (3) minimizing the appearance of conflict, (4) showing fraternity, (5) practicing courtesy, (6) employing secrecy, (7) recruiting allies, (8) using persuasive argumentation and (9) asserting personal identity. Other strategies used include: gamesmanship, establishing procedural control, avoidance, revealing and threats.

How the missile defence (MD) policy in each country has developed {{as a response to}} the proliferation problem in the context of the broader security and foreign policy; 2. how it is located in the overall domestic setting and 3. how the MD policy can be explained. What accounts for the variety of missile defence policies of the democracies? In a nutshell, it is neither their formal status as a democracy, nor their different quality as a democratic country within the spectrum of the stable, new, and deficient democracies in the cases of Turkey and even more so of Russia. The two traditional explanatory factors - the role of military alliances such as NATO and the geographical/ geopolitical position of the democracies examined - are secondary. In the final analysis it is the combination of the foreign policy orientations in connection with the particular domestic power constellations (in some cases strong economic and bureaucratic interests), the role of the US and the relevance of perceived threats that account for either a sceptical/critical or a supportive policy (threats defined mostly as missiles from non-democratic adversaries, but to a lesser extent as the US menacing the basic foreign policy orientations of other democracies). The research report finally lists several major problems ahead associated with missile defence systems. To mention two of them: In the case of basing radars or interceptors on Central European territory, Russia in particular would be affected. What if Moscow chooses to obstruct those kinds of missile defence plans, establishes stronger ties with Beijing, intensifies its arms trade in the rocket area with countries of concern, bypasses arms control agreements, continues to intensify its <b>arms</b> <b>build-up</b> and aims its nuclear tipped missiles at Polish strategic targets? In addition, ecological and social risks are probably associated with the interception of an atomic, biological or chemical warhead which falls on European territory. The report concludes with research perspectives. They focus on the conflict potential to be assessed in view of rising nations (economically and technologically) and in terms of their 'rising' rocket and space-faring capabilities. Here, Brazil, China, India, and Iran are the case in point. Finally, the research question is raised: What role is missile defence likely to play in the context of a ballistic missiles free zone? Would missile defence enhance or hamper such a zone?" (excerpt) "Der Fokus dieses Forschungsberichtes liegt auf der gesellschaftlichen Debatte in 16 Demokratien, deren jeweilige Raketenabwehrpolitik miteinander verglichen und erklärt werden soll. Die einzelnen Fallstudien möchten die folgenden drei Forschungsfragen beantworten: 1. Wie hat sich die jeweilige Raketenabwehrpolitik im Kontext des umfassenderen außen- und sicherheitspolitischen Konzepts als Antwort auf das Proliferations- Problem entwickelt? 2. Wie ist Raketenabwehr in den Gesamtzusammenhang der politischen Diskussionen und Kräftekonstellationen des jeweiligen Landes einzuordnen? 3. Wie lassen sich die auf die ersten beiden Fragen gefundenen Antworten erklären? Der Forschungsbericht nennt eine Reihe von Problemen, die im Zusammenhang mit den Raketenabwehrsystemen zu erwarten sind: Zum einen die Reaktion Moskaus auf die Stationierung von Radarsystemen oder Abfangraketen in Zentraleuropa: Was geschieht, wenn sich Russland entschließt, derartige Pläne verhindern zu wollen und daher seine Beziehungen mit Peking intensiviert, den Waffenhandel - auch im Raketenbereich - mit 'Problemstaaten' ausbaut, Rüstungskontrollabkommen ignoriert, eigene Rüstungsbemühungen weiterhin erhöht und seine Raketen mit Nuklearsprengköpfen gegen strategische Ziele in Polen oder Tschechien richtet? Zum anderen kommen ökologische Risiken hinzu, die mit dem Abschuss eines atomaren, biologischen oder chemischen Sprengkopfes über europäischem Gebiet verbunden sein dürften. Darüber hinaus zeigt der Forschungsbericht zu bearbeitende Forschungsfragen auf. Sie konzentrieren sich auf das Konfliktpotenzial, das mit dem erhöhten Raketen- und Weltraumpotential aufstrebender Mächte (in wirtschaftlicher und technologischer Hinsicht) verbunden ist. Brasilien, China, Indien und der Iran sind hier zu nennen. Zudem sollte die Forschung eine zentrale Frage beantworten: Welche Rolle kommt Raketenabwehrsystemen im Zusammenhang mit raketenfreien Zonen zu - würden sie die Entstehung solcher Zonen begünstigen oder blockieren?"

40|$|Speaking at a Perth International Writers Festival {{panel on}} ’The State We’re In’, Peter Mares {{argued that the}} cost of war will be high. I KNOW that the state we are {{supposed}} to be in is ‘alert’ but not ‘alarmed’. But it is impossible not to be alarmed when you consider the current trajectory of this federal government, this country and indeed the world. It now seems certain that the state we will soon be in will be a state of war. The US has made it quite clear that it will attack Iraq, with our without United Nations backing; and Australia will clearly be one of the so-called ‘coalition of the willing’ that joins them. Prime Minister John Howard has argued repeatedly that the UN Security Council must act or lose all credibility, because it will have allowed Saddam Hussein to defy its will. Two points are worth making here. 1. On numerous occasions in the past, nations have defied the United Nations and the Security Council. Israel is the most obvious example, having refused to withdraw from the Occupied Territories. But there are others, too, who have thumbed their nose at the UN with impunity. For nearly a quarter of a century, Indonesia ignored Security Council resolutions number 384 and 389, calling on the government of Indonesia to ‘withdraw without delay all its forces’ from the territory of East Timor. So if the line of Mr Howard’s argument is to hold true, then the Security Council has very little credibility left to lose in any case. 2. The second point worth making is essentially the obverse of the Prime Minister’s argument. He says the UN will lose all credibility if it does not vote to attack Iraq, but we must ask the question in return: what credibility will the UN and the international system have if the US attacks Iraq without a UN resolution? Surely that too will mean that international law is meaningless. If the world’s one superpower can launch an attack - call it anticipatory self defense, call it a pre-emptive strike, or what you will - without UN sanction, then what use is there in having an international system of checks and balances and rules and treaties? I think it is worth quoting General Peter Gration (retired) at this point. Gration, you will remember, is no radical. He was the head of Australia’s defence force from 1987 to 1993, {{at the time of the}} first Gulf War. He is alarmed by the fact that the US has ‘changed from the containment and deterrence used successfully through 40 years of the Cold War to an open-ended doctrine of the right to pre-emptive strike if the US perceives a threat developing to its global supremacy’. This ‘strike[s] at the very heart of efforts to create a rules-based international order It signals that unprovoked offensive military action is permissible if it is directed against something that looks like it might developed into a threat. If this becomes acceptable international behaviour then the world will become a much less stable place. ’ The question here is not so much whether Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction and is attempting to hide such things from UN inspectors. I think we can assume that it does and it is - that much of the Bush/ Blair/ Howard case for war is based in fact. The question is what to do about this; about whether this really requires urgent military action and regime change, or whether the Iraqi threat, like the North Korean threat, can be contained through a range of measures such as no-fly zones, inspections and sanctions, and, ultimately, the threat of massive retaliation should Iraq launch aggressive military action. Again let me quote Peter Gration: ‘Saddam Hussein has been contained and deterred from using his WMD (like the Soviet Union, China and North Korea before him), and there is no reason why containment and deterrence should not continue to be effective [...] . It is simply incredible to suggest that a decrepit desert state such as Iraq, still battered from the Gulf War, poses a threat to the only global superpower, let alone to the world. ’ And if containment is an option, as Gration and others suggest, then how do the costs and benefits of that strategy stack up against the risks of opting for war? The 500, 000 potential casualties that the UN has discussed in a confidential report suggest that war is difficult to justify on any grounds. (Middle East specialist Professor Amin Saikal suggests that Saddam Hussein is unlikely to really pay much attention to the plight of the Iraqi people in the event of war. ‘I think his basic objective would be to make an American victory as difficult as possible,’ he told ABC Radio National, ‘and he will unleash whatever he has at his disposal, and if that means that a lot of Iraqi civilians are targeted by the Americans in order to penetrate Saddam Hussein’s security and armed forces, then Saddam Hussein will let that be the case. ’ And war could be a high risk strategy for other reasons. If Saddam Hussein is going to use his WMD, it will most likely be at that point when his back is to the wall. In other words just such a scenario as the coming war will bring. Peter Gration says the point when Iraq’s weapons might be used ‘could be as a desperate last gesture by Iraq in self defence against a US or Israeli attack, when the Iraqi leadership realised they were facing extinction’. An even more alarming scenario, suggested by Saikal, is that Saddam Hussein will deliberately seek to provoke a US nuclear attack on Iraq, ‘because an American nuclear response will not only put the whole of Iraq in flames, but also will outrage the entire Arab and Muslim world, and that’s what Saddam Hussein’s strategy would be, to really basically stir up the Arab world as well as the Muslim world, in support of what he may consider to be self-adulation in history for himself’. Some people might argue here that I have missed the point - that the real threat posed by Saddam Hussein and his WMD is that Iraq will supply those weapons to a terrorist outfit like Al Qaeda. Most analysts agree this is the weakest link in the chain of US argument; Saddam’s regime and Al Qaeda are at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. If terrorists were to get hold of weapons of mass destruction I suggest that they might come from a different quarter. Take the case of Pakistan. It is a country where democracy has been suspended and power is concentrated in the hands of one man. It is a country where religious and ethnic minorities suffer discrimination and abuse. It has a powerful military intelligence organisation that has been responsible for funding and organising extremist groups, and encouraging them to carry out terrorist attacks outside its territory. This country has fought a bitter war with an immediate neighbour. It is a country where the economy is on the brink of collapse, which could serve as an encouragement to military adventurism. Perhaps most disturbing of all, Pakistan is known to have the capacity to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction, and the risk of war with India is real, given that Kashmir remains one of the world’s most dangerous flash points. Of course, Pakistan is one of the United States’ key allies in the war on terror, and of course it is different from Iraq in many ways. Pakistan has an independent and lively media and opposition political parties are still able to function. President Musharraf has not displayed the same ruthlessness as Saddam Hussein in dispatching his opponents or launching war on minority groups within his own country. But there is every indication that Musharraf is endeavouring to entrench himself in power, and if he succeeds then who knows what kind of leader he will become in the future. After all, Saddam Hussein was himself once a trusted friend of Washington, his secular, modernist regime seen as a bulwark against the theocratic revolutionaries in Iran. So if there is a threat of terrorists getting hold of nuclear weapons, then perhaps Pakistan is a more likely route than Iraq. All it would take would be a disaffected nuclear scientist or senior military office with Islamist leanings. My point in drawing these comparisons is not to diminish in any way the threat that Saddam Hussein represents to his own people or to the rest of the world but to suggest how our perceptions of threat are constantly shifting (and, if you like, constantly manipulated). It was not so long before 11 September 2001 that the focus of official western concern was China. Remember the spy plane incident? China as an emerging power in the Asia Pacific region, China’s <b>arms</b> <b>build-up,</b> China’s export of weapons technology [...] . Canberra was being reminded by senior officials in Washington that if the US ended up at war with China over Taiwan, then Australia would be expected to play its part. Now China, too, is an ally in the war on terror. Before September 11, there was concern about Russia’s actions in Chechnya. It has now evaporated. Post September 11, the United States has developed close alliances with governments in Central Asia - the ‘stans’, Khazakstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikstan, Kyrgistan - governments run by oppressive remnants from the Soviet era whose suppression of dissent, particularly dissent expressed through Islam, is probably helping to breed the next generation of religious extremists. Again - I do not wish to diminish or underplay the nature of the regime in Iraq. It seems to me that ‘regime change’ in Iraq would be no bad thing; the question is what comes next. It seems to me that before embarking on military action, it would be helpful to consider the figure of the refugee. As Arthur Helton writes in his recent book The Price of Indifference, refugees ‘provide important insights into the modern dilemmas of statecraft’, not least because their very presence reflects past ‘failures in governance and international relations’. Human displacement sows seeds of instability that can blossom into ugly flowers. (Look at Israel and the Palestinian territories.) Before following George W. Bush to Baghdad, we should contemplate the figure of the refugee and think carefully about what the possible consequences of our actions. BUT could the war in Iraq be a quick, clean war, like the war in Afghanistan to oust the Taliban supposedly was? There are many answers to this question. Firstly of course, no war is really quick and clean, though it may be sanitised. Secondly, while the battle against the Taliban was won quickly, the war in Afghanistan has only just begun. The ‘peace’ in Afghanistan does not reach far beyond Kabul, where the international assistance force patrols the streets. The Karzai government is years or decades away from becoming a stable regime, let alone a democratic one, if it ever does. The huge task of rebuilding Afghanistan’s shattered infrastructure has barely started. In other words, Afghanistan remains a failed state, fuelled by one viable crop, opium, replete with uncontrolled guns and liable to produce and harbour more extremists like Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden (both of whom, it should be remembered, apparently remain at large). Let us ask ourselves: how much attention will Afghanistan get once the world is called upon to rebuild a freshly liberated Iraq? In military terms, Iraq is also a different proposition to Afghanistan. The Iraqi military, demoralised as it may be, is not a student militia. Iraq is not controlled by regional warlords who will take down one flag of allegiance and run up another as soon as the prevailing wind changes direction. Thirdly, the long term repercussions of an attack on Iraq are unpredictable and may be grave. In the Middle East and parts of Asia, the war will be perceived (and in some cases deliberately represented) as a white, Christian war against the Muslim world. It will be seen as another injustice, another insult to Islam, and could lead to greater long term instability. As Malaysia’s Prime Minister Dr Mahathir has warned, it will be seen as ‘a clash of civilizations, that of the West against the Islamic civilisation’, Samuel Huntington’s thesis made real. ‘The West does not care to find out the causes of terrorism and remove them,’ says Mahathir, and indeed, in our current debate, it seems that examining the causes of terrorism is often equated with justifying terrorism. To point out that the unresolved dispute between Palestine and Israel remains a source of great anger in the Muslim world is not the same as saying that the US had it coming to them. Of course there is no simple trajectory from injustice to terrorism. It has been pointed out often enough that Osama bin Laden comes from a family of billionaires. But this does not invalidate the view that, unless injustice is overcome - or at least, unless a sincere effort is made to acknowledge and tackle injustice - then the war on terror will be never-ending. This question of perception is particularly important for Australia, given our geographical location. While John Howard is planning to stop in Jakarta on his way back from Washington it is clear that the federal government has no real inclination to listen to what the Indonesians have to say. There is no real consultation with our neighbours, and I think very little recognition of how this war could play out in terms of Australia’s image in the region. Nor is there much discussion of the destabilising effect that the war could have on Indonesia’s fragile domestic political balance in the lead-up to national elections in 2004. This war could be just what the Indonesian Islamists need to strengthen their position and rebuild in Indonesia after the damage done to their credibility by the atrocity of the Bali bombing. I think, however, it will be a long time before Australian government ministers realise that they could actually listen to, and learn from, their Indonesian counterparts, instead of just telling them things. Fourthly, the war in Iraq could produce the exact opposite of its supposed aims. Rather than preventing terrorism and making the world a more stable place, it could provoke instability and provide the motivation for a new wave of attacks. To quote Peter Gration again, ‘this action against Iraq could spawn a whole new generation of suicidal terrorists targeting the US and its allies, and hence actually worsen our security situation’. There are many and varied voices opposing the war in Australia, but I expect the real dilemma for the anti-war movement, and in particular for the federal Labor Party, is about to come. It will come when the Security Council does give the green light to George Bush’s war plans, as I suspect it ultimately will. France has not used its veto power in the Security Council since 1956. As Peter Hartcher has argued, it is unlikely to do so now, given that the war is going to happen anyway, and if France does not support it, then it risks losing ‘any say over the conduct of the Iraq war, and the disposition of its oil and other spoils afterwards’. If the UN backs a war, then Simon Crean must back it also; this is the logic of his position in advocating that UN processes must be followed. This will split the Labor party and seriously weaken the anti war movement, and Howard may once again come out on top. As with Howard’s Tampa victory in the November 2001 election, there will be a high price to pay for this short term gain; the long term result will be a more defensive, frightened, intolerant and divided Australia.
