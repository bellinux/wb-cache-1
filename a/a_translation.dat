5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> of source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> of an original literary work {{expressed in a}} material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E

5|$|The early {{models for}} the Imagist group were from Japan, and H.D. often visited the {{exclusive}} Print Room at the British Museum {{in the company of}} Richard Aldington and the curator and poet Laurence Binyon in order to examine Nishiki-e prints that incorporated traditional Japanese verse. However, she also derived her way of making poems from her reading of Classical Greek literature and especially of Sappho, an interest she shared with Aldington and Pound, each of whom produced versions of the Greek poet's work. In 1915, H.D. and Aldington launched the Poets' Translation Series, pamphlets of translations from Greek and Latin classics. H.D. worked on the plays by Euripides, publishing in 1916 <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis, in 1919 <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis and Hippolytus, an adaptation of Hippolytus called Hippolytus Temporizes (1927), <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> of choruses from The Bacchae and Hecuba (1931), and Euripides' Ion (1937) a loose translation of Ion.|$|E

5|$|After A Song to David, {{he tried}} to publish a {{collection}} of his Psalms translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations. Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart {{to find a new}} publisher, delaying the printing of his Psalms. Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed <b>A</b> <b>Translation</b> of the Psalms of David, which included Hymns and Spiritual Songs and a second edition of A Song to David. This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's. However, modern criticism has received Smart's version in a more favourable light. While working on this project, he was also working on <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> of the Phaedrus and a verse translation of Horace. His verse Horace was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.|$|E

5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from being used as <b>a</b> <b>translation</b> template. Differently from siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
