500|$|Karan Grewal, {{who shared}} a suite with Cho at Harper Hall, {{reported}} that Cho [...] "would {{sit in a}} wood rocker by the window <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lawn below". According to Grewal, [...] "Cho appeared to never go to class or read a book during his senior year," [...] adding that Cho just typed on his laptop, went to the dining hall and clipped his hair in the toilet, cleaning up the hair afterwards. Grewal also reported that he witnessed Cho riding his bicycle in circles {{in the parking lot}} of the dormitory.|$|E
500|$|Vikings coach Dennis Green {{has been}} criticized for his {{decision}} to kneel on 3rd down and play for overtime instead of attempting to score before the end of regulation. Radio host Bob Sansevere, author of The Best Minnesota Sports Arguments, called it [...] "one of the all-time boneheaded decisions a coach has ever made in any sport." [...] Of Green's play call, Peter King of Sports Illustrated wrote, [...] "Minnesota coach Dennis Green did a great job this year, but if he doesn't wake up <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling {{in the next few days}} and say out loud: 'Boy, I screwed that one up,' then he's not being honest with himself." [...] Nonetheless, local Minneapolis newspaper Star Tribune has contended that taking a knee was the correct decision due to the performance of the Vikings' offense, whose struggles that day were also noted by Carter.|$|E
60|$|Zeb {{shook the}} reins to rouse the cab-horse from his stupor of amazement, {{for the people}} were {{beginning}} to gather around <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> strangers.|$|E
60|$|He {{suddenly}} paused, flushed red <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl uncertainly.|$|R
60|$|Still Gerald stood <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> blind haze of snow outside.|$|R
60|$|Duncan turned {{deliberately}} round <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> person {{whom they}} were discussing.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{was getting}} nervous, {{and was so}} slow that even Gordon (who could sit <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> board a full half hour without moving) began to be impatient.|$|E
60|$|Hare's appeal pierced Naab's frenzied brain. The Mormon Elder saw his old Bishop pause <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dark shapes {{suspended}} from the cottonwoods and hold up his hands in horror.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must, or I'll {{pull off}} this shade <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun {{as hard as}} ever I can stare. Come now!" [...] and he half rose, as if ready to execute the threat.|$|E
60|$|The Angel, shivering, {{sat down}} on <b>the</b> tree trunk <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Doctor.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, we made up {{our minds}} {{we would all}} lie on our backs <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky until we saw God. So we put the big rug on the lawn and then we all lay down side by side, and stared and stared. I saw nothing, and Dimples saw nothing, but Baby says she saw God." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were quite}} fearless, almost senseless, at such times. I would stretch {{out my hand}} from the shadow, pick up an unresisting frog that {{threatened}} too soon to climb onto the float, and examine him at leisure. But Chigwooltz is wedded to his idols; the moment I released him he would go, fast as his legs could carry him, to put {{his elbows on the}} float <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> light again.|$|E
6000|$|But {{this was}} not the only reason for her black. Only a day or two before, she told me, a letter had come from her mother.... "My father is dead." [...] The words dropped out as if they were quite {{accustomed}} to one another's company. But those which followed--"blood-poisoning," [...] "mortification," [...] hung up in my mind--in that interminable gallery--a hideous picture. I could only sit <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> motionless figure outlined against the sepulchral window.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Butterwell {{dropped the}} paper from his hands, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{secretary}} over his spectacles.|$|R

6000|$|For {{all this}} while, Amyas had never {{for a moment}} lost sight of his darling desire for a sea-life; and when he could not wander on the quay <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shipping, or {{go down to the}} pebble-ridge at Northam, and there sit, devouring, with hungry eyes, the great expanse of ocean, which seemed to woo him outward into {{boundless}} space, he used to console himself, in school-hours, by drawing ships and imaginary charts upon his slate, instead of minding his [...] "humanities." ...|$|E
6000|$|The camp {{is about}} a mile off. Voluptuous English authors reposing from their {{literary}} fatigues (on their laurels) are expected, when all other things fail, to lie on straw {{in the midst of}} it when the days are sunny, <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> blue sea until they fall asleep. (About one hundred and fifty soldiers have been at various times billeted on Beaucourt since we have been here, and he has clinked glasses with them every one, and read a MS. book of his father's, on soldiers in general, to them all.) ...|$|E
60|$|And, indeed, {{though it}} was high morning, sleep {{was still in the}} air. Wrought upon at last by the {{combined}} influences of sea and sky and atmosphere, I succumbed, and lay down on one of the boulders of a little stony slope that gave upon the sea. The great Atlantic lay before me, not yet quite awake, but slowly heaving the rhythmical expiration of slumber. There was no sail visible in the misty horizon. There {{was nothing to do but}} to lie <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> unwinking ether.|$|E
60|$|Kennedy went across, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ghastly head {{which lay}} loosely on the {{shredded}} and mouldering mitre.|$|R

6000|$|Thus she {{had what}} she called her [...] "silent hours" [...] when she would suffer no one to come near her, not her ladies or her foster-mother, Asti herself, nor even Rames. Then, {{followed}} by the women at a distance, she would wander among the great columns of the temple and study the sculptures on the walls; and, since all places were open to her, Pharaoh's child, enter the sanctuaries, <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gods that sat in them fashioned in granite and in alabaster. This she would do even in the solemn moonlight when mortals were afraid to approach these sacred shrines, and come thence unconcerned and smiling.|$|E

"'An' whin {{that time}} comes,' sez he, 'I'll {{come to you}} for ghostly consolation, Father Terence,' an' at that he wint off afther some more divil's {{business}} - for to get expayrience, he tould me. He was wicked - rank wicked - wicked as all Hell! I'm not construct by nature to go in fear av any man, but, begad, I was afraid av Larry. He'd come in to barricks wid his cap on three hairs, an' lie on his cot <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceilin', and now an' again he'd fetch a little laugh, the like av a splash in the bottom av a well, an' by that I knew he was schamin' new wickedness, an' I'd be afraid.

60|$|Up {{went the}} Union Jack duly, and {{presently}} through our glasses {{we saw the}} slavers running about {{in a state of}} excitement; also we saw the poor slaves turn <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bit of flapping bunting and then begin to talk to each other. It struck me as possible that someone among their number had seen a Union Jack {{in the hands of an}} English traveller, or had heard of it as flying upon ships or at points on the coast, and what it meant to slaves. Or they may have understood some of the remarks of the Arabs, which no doubt were pointed and explanatory. At any rate, they turned and stared till the Arabs ran among them with sjambocks, that is, whips of hippopotamus hide, and suppressed their animated conversation with many blows.|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{stiffened}} {{his fingers}} on <b>the</b> rifle <b>at</b> his hip, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last figure with growing astonishment.|$|R

6000|$|From a great {{proposal}} for reform, {{to a small}} eccentricity in costume, the English are the most intolerant people in the world, in their reception of anything which presents itself to them under {{the form of a}} perfect novelty. Let any man display a new project before the Parliament of England, or a new pair of light-green trousers before the inhabitants of London, let the project proclaim itself as useful to all listening ears, and the trousers eloquently assert themselves as beautiful to all beholding eyes, the nation will shrink suspiciously, nevertheless, both from the one and the other; will order the first to [...] "lie on the table," [...] and will hoot, laugh, <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> second; will, in short, resent either novelty as an unwarrantable intrusion, for no other discernible reason than that people in general are not used to it.|$|E
6000|$|Carl's father {{assured him}} in every letter {{that he was}} extravagant. He ran through the two dollars in {{practically}} no time at all. He was a member in good and regular standing of the informal club that hung about the Corner Drug Store, to drink coffee soda and discuss athletics <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> passing girls. He loved to set off his clear skin and shining pale hair with linen collars, though soft roll-collar shirts were in vogue. And {{he was ready for}} any wild expedition, though it should cost fifty or sixty cents. With the sophomore second vice-president and John Terry of the freshman class (usually known as [...] "the Turk") he often tramped to the large neighboring town of Jamaica Mills to play pool, smoke Turkish cigarettes, and drink beer. They always chorused Plato songs, in long-drawn close harmony. Once they had imported English ale, out of bottles, and carried the bottles back to decorate and distinguish their rooms.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was quite}} close to the other gent, Mr. Morrison was," [...] the waiter continued, [...] "but they didn't say nowt to each other. All of a sudden I see Mr. Morrison set down his glass <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other chap as though he'd seen {{something}} that {{had given him a}} turn. I leaned over the counter and had a look, too. There he sat--this tall, fair chap {{who had been in the}} place so long--with his big pocket-book on the table in front of him, and even from where I was I could see that there was a great pile of bank-notes sticking out from it. All of a sudden he looks up and sees Mr. Morrison a-watching him and me from behind the counter. Back he whisks the pocket-book into his pocket, calls me for my bill, gives me two mouldy pennies for a tip, buttons up his coat and walks out." ...|$|E
60|$|Jean saw Ellen {{catch the}} blouse {{and try to}} wrap it around her, while she sagged against <b>the</b> wall <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. The hoof beats pounded to a solid thumping halt just outside.|$|R
60|$|The exclamation was so {{pronounced}} that it awoke Hal, and {{the youth}} {{opened his eyes}} wide, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man.|$|R
