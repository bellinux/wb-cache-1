5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|The lowest {{elevations}} of Pinkham Notch are {{occupied by}} a northern hardwood forest. This forest type is primarily deciduous and consists mostly of sugar maple, <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> and yellow birch. There is also a proliferation of understory and forest floor plants; common examples include wild sarsaparilla, painted trillium, hobblebush, and Indian cucumber-root.|$|E
50|$|At {{the heart}} of the Garden is the old-growth forest, the largest {{existing}} remnant of the original forest which covered all of New York City before the arrival of European settlers in the 17th century. The forest, which was never logged, contains oaks, <b>American</b> <b>beeches,</b> cherry, birch, tulip and white ash trees, some more than two centuries old.|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} {{was established}} in 1959, and designed by Gustav Malmborg. It now contains 104 varieties of trees including <b>American</b> chestnuts, <b>beeches,</b> firs, and 3 Franklinia trees.|$|R
50|$|The 13 acre {{arboretum}} features plants {{indigenous to}} Arkansas's West Gulf Coastal Plain region, plus flowering azaleas and camellias. Signs identify {{many of the}} trees, including shortleaf and loblolly pines, southern and sweet bay magnolias, black gum, white ash, <b>American</b> sycamore, Carolina <b>beech,</b> <b>American</b> holly, black cherry, sugar maple, and oak species such as water, post, southern red, white and overcup.|$|R
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), <b>American</b> <b>beech</b> (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|Nuts have a {{rich history}} as food. For many {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas, {{a wide variety of}} nuts, including acorns, <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> and others, served as a major source of starch and fat over thousands of years. Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for Indigenous Australians for many centuries. Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is the peanut. Its usage was popularized by the work of George Washington Carver, who discovered and popularized many applications of the peanut after employing peanut plants for soil amelioration in fields used to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E
40|$|When European {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the land that is now the northeastern United States, they found a vast forest with rich living resources. Stretching from the Coastal Plains to the Mississippi River was an environment shaped by trees. The climate, soils, and glacial history produced a forest that was unique in the world. In the 300 years since the arrival of Europeans, however, human activities have drastically changed this landscape. Still, as immense as the changes have been, they largely altered the appearance, but not the processes, of the ecosystems of the Northeast. A comparison of pictures of the Northeast from the 1700 ’s with the 1900 ’s would reveal striking differences. Early Europeans encountered great forests of <b>American</b> <b>beeches,</b> maples, birches, eastern hemlocks, and spruces from New England to northern Pennsylvania, and oaks, hickories, American chestnuts, and pines from Maryland through Ohio. Inhabiting these great forests were many wildlife populations...|$|R
50|$|The Arboretum {{currently}} contains 50 {{species of}} conifers, and {{many species of}} oak, maple, rowan, hawthorn, Rhododendron, Kalmia, and wildflowers. Other plantings include Turkish Fir, weeping katsura, Japanese Larch, Dawn Redwood, Bald cypress, Incense-cedar, Rocky Mountains Bristlecone Pine, goldenseal, ginseng, maidenhair fern, Hepatica, blue cohosh, flowering crabapples, fantail pussy willows, ash, viburnum, lilac, fringe tree, Fothergilla, daylilies, Clethra, Stewartia, bottlebrush buckeye, <b>American</b> holly, <b>beeches</b> and bayberry.|$|R
25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{in what would}} be Newburgh Township were David Bryant and his son, Whitman, who arrived in June 1797. East of the Portage Escarpment, they found dense forests of <b>American</b> sycamore, <b>beech,</b> black walnut, eastern hemlock, eastern redcedar, northern red oak, Ohio buckeye, shagbark hickory, sugar maple, and white oak. West of the escarpment were <b>American</b> elm, ash, <b>beech,</b> and black cherry. In some places, settlers would have seen artificial meadows, created by Native Americans using controlled fire. On the flats which formed {{the valley of the}} Cuyahoga River bluegrass, white clover, and wild rye grew in profusion. American bison, eastern elk, and the extremely plentiful white-tailed deer were the most common game animals inhabiting the area. Canada geese, ducks, grouse, passenger pigeon, quail, and wild turkey were the most common game fowl.|$|R
25|$|There {{was a high}} {{concentration}} of beech mast in the area of North Mountain as of 1920. Pine and hemlock have also been observed on the mountain. Originally, there were mature and primeval forests, but after the lumbering industry, they were largely replaced by northern hardwood trees, such as sugar maple, red maple, <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> and black cherry.|$|E
25|$|Shiitake {{mushrooms}} grown under a forested canopy {{are considered}} {{non-timber forest products}} In the Northeast shiitake mushrooms can be cultivated {{on a variety of}} hardwood logs including oak, <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> sugar maple and hophornbeam. Softwood should not be used to cultivate shiitake mushrooms. The resin of softwoods will oftentimes inhibit the growth of the shiitake mushroom making it impractical as a growing substrate.|$|E
25|$|Northern {{hardwood}} forests grow at Elk Knob State Park. This type {{of forest}} consists of sugar maple, <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> yellow buckeye and yellow birch trees. The trees that grow near the summits of Rittle and Elk Knobs have been stunted {{by the low}} temperatures, high elevation and high winds. Trees that {{are just a few}} feet high can be well over one hundred years old.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the premiere}} botanical gardens in the United States, the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx was {{modeled after the}} Royal Botanic Gardens in London. With 48 {{different}} gardens and plant collections, nature enthusiasts can easily spend a day admiring the serene cascade waterfall, wetlands, a 50-acre (200,000 m²) tract of old-growth oaks, <b>American</b> <b>beeches,</b> cherry, birch, tulip and white ash trees [...] - [...] some {{more than two centuries}} old. Garden highlights include an 1890s-vintage, wrought-iron framed, [...] "crystal-palace style" [...] greenhouse; the Peggy Rockefeller memorial rose garden (originally laid out by Beatrix Farrand in 1916); a Japanese rock garden; a 37-acre (150,000 m²) conifer collection, extensive research facilities including a propagation center, 50,000-volume library, and a herbarium archive {{of hundreds of thousands of}} botanical specimens dating back more than a century. At the heart of the Garden are 40 acres (162,000 m²) of virgin woodlands which represent the last stretch of the original forest which covered all of New York City before the arrival of European settlers in the 17th century. The forest itself is split by the Bronx River and includes a riverine canyon and rapids, and along its shores sits the landmark Lorillard snuff-grinding mill dating back to the 1840s.|$|R
50|$|The park {{contains}} {{thousands of}} {{species in the}} life domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. There may be over 200 fungus species in the park, including artist's fungus, black locust shelf fungus, hedge-hog fungus, hen-of-the-woods, pear-shaped puffball, and turkey-tail fungus. Its trees include ashleaf maples, <b>American</b> <b>beeches,</b> <b>American</b> elms, black haws, cottonwoods, eastern redbuds, eastern sycamores, princesstrees, spicebushes, trees-of-heaven, tuliptrees, and white oaks. Its spring ephemerals include spring-beauties and cutleaf toothworts. Other wildflowers in the park are asters, elephant's-foot, wingstem, and yellow jewelweed. Two native plant species that are evidently now extinct in the park are round-lobed hepatica and trailing arbutus. Both ground and climbing forms of poison-ivy are common in Glover Archbold Park. In about 2000, highly pestiferous Asian tiger mosquitoes {{first appeared in the}} park. In 2004, adult 17-year cicadas were common there. A rare harvester butterfly was seen in the park. Some of its other insects are black swallowtails, Chinese mantids, eastern carpenter bees, eastern-tailed blues, eastern tiger swallowtails, Andrena erigeniae bees, false honey ants, impatient bumblebees, imperial moths, monarchs, Peck's skippers, Pennsylvania soldier beetles, sachem skippers, silver-spotted skippers, spicebush swallowtails, spring azures, summer azures, western honey bees, and zebra swallowtails. The park has a significant invasion of nonnative plants, including Asiatic bittersweet, bamboo, common periwinkle, English ivy, garlic-mustard, gill-over-the-ground, Japanese honeysuckle, lesser celandine, wild-garlic, and wintercreeper. Once a 2-foot tall, nonnative, tropical papaya seedling grew in the stream bed. Because people have altered the park's landscape so much, native fish are no longer in the stream. Eastern box turtles, frogs, and toads are rare or extinct in the park, not to mention American black bears, American elk, bison, and timber wolves which once lived in the Washington, D.C. area. Its birds include American robins, barred owls, blue jays, Carolina wrens, catbirds, common crows, fish crows, northern cardinals, northern mockingbirds, and wood thrushes. Mammals in the park include common raccoons, coyotes, domestic cats, domestic dogs, gray foxes, humans, short-tailed shrews, Virginia opossums, white-footed mice, and white-tailed deer.|$|R

25|$|The native {{trees of}} the Paudash Lake area include the silver, red, sugar, mountain, and striped maple; the jack, red, and white pine; the largetooth and {{trembling}} aspen; the yellow and white birch; black, white, and possibly red spruce; the bur and red oak; the white, black, and red ash; the pin, black, and choke cherry, and the balsam fir, eastern tsuga (hemlock), tamarack (larch), balsam poplar, white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> ironwood (Ostrya virginiana), and speckled alder.|$|E
25|$|The High Alleghenies {{are noted}} for their forests of red spruce, balsam fir, and {{mountain}} ash, trees typically found much farther north. Hardwood forests also include yellow birch, sugar and red maple, eastern hemlock, and black cherry. <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> pine and hickory {{can also be}} found. The forests of the entire region are now almost all second- or third-growth forests, the original trees having been removed in the late 19th and (in West Virginia) early 20th centuries. The wild onion known as the ramp (Allium tricoccum) is also present in the deeper forests.|$|E
25|$|Growth and yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90ft) {{tall and}} {{occasionally}} reaches 37m (120ft), with d.b.h. of 91 to 122cm (36 to 48 in). The bole is often forked. Height and diameter by age {{are shown in}} table 1 for selected locations. Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with chestnut oak, white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and <b>American</b> <b>beech</b> is rated slow. Since hickories constitute 15 percent or less of the basal area of oak-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory. Yields of mixed oak stands (5,7,19) and of hickory stands (2) have been reported. Tree volume tables are available (2,19).|$|E

50|$|Among {{the trees}} {{planted in the}} park are several of the rare species in Serbia, {{including}} the living fossil ginkgo biloba, North <b>American</b> sequoia, red <b>beech</b> (Fagus silvatica f. atropunicea), curly willow, yellow beech, etc. The trees are mostly planted {{toward the center of}} the park, leaving an open low plant space surrounding it. The avenue in the central alley is made of the seedlings of the Weeping Birch, while the access walking paths to the center are made as an avenue of Norway maple and ash trees.|$|R
500|$|The most {{important}} {{tree in the}} park is the yellowwood (Cladrastis lutea). [...] This tree typically does not grow further north than central Kentucky, and has been designated as a state threatened species in Indiana. [...] Other trees found in the park include at least four types of oak (black, chestnut, red, and white) and three types of hickory (bitternut, pignut, and shagbark). [...] The park also contains at least two types of maple trees: [...] black and sugar. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an edible fruit. In areas with good moist soil, the black walnut tree grows, and this tree is {{an excellent source of}} wood for lumber or furniture. [...] Among other trees growing in the park are the <b>American</b> <b>beech,</b> basswood, black cherry, black gum, and red elm. [...] Also the sassafras, sycamore, white ash.

2500|$|The common English name {{hornbeam}} {{derives from}} the hardness of the woods (likened to horn) and the Old English beam [...] "tree" [...] (cognate with German Baum). The American hornbeam is also occasionally known as blue-beech, ironwood, or musclewood, the first from the resemblance of the bark {{to that of the}} <b>American</b> <b>beech</b> Fagus grandifolia, the other two from the hardness of the wood and the muscular appearance of the trunk, respectively. The botanic name for the genus, Carpinus, is the original Latin name for the European species.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 {{the school}} was {{transformed}} into the Military Aeronautics division (Aeronáutica Militar,) and five units were created {{as well as several}} airbases. Typical aircraft of the thirties and forties were European types like the Potez XXV A.2 TOE, the SPAD S.VII and S.XIII, the de Havilland DH 82A, and the IMAM Ro.37; but this era also saw the transition to aircraft of <b>American</b> pedigree. <b>Beech</b> AT-11 and Douglas C-47 transports, Waco JHD and NAA Texan trainers, and NAA B-25J bombers were used in this period. The arrival of F-51 Mustangs in the early 50s notably enhanced the capabilities of the air force. There were now nine Aviation Groups and the Military Aeronautics division was officially renamed the Military Air Force (Fuerza Aérea Militar) on 4 December 1952. This change in nomenclature was important because it signified the independence of the branch from the army command structure. The new force was reorganized into three commands (tactical, training, and material) and a brigade structure was implemented along with a fully staffed headquarters.|$|R
50|$|Wall {{units are}} often made from oak, maple, yellow cedar, paduk wood, <b>American</b> and European <b>beech,</b> purple heart wood, alder and cherry. Some {{companies}} combine solid and wood veneers or use MDF or particle board to create wall units that normally have amendable shelves. But aside from using wood, metal and glass {{can also be}} employed in their manufacture. Wall units are convenient for builders in {{that they can be}} easily installed. This kind of furniture can be utilised as storage, provide a surface for food preparation or to house whitegoods in kitchens, as entertainment centres for television or audio equipment or have many other household or office uses.|$|R
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of soil {{fertility}} exists as evidenced by soil orders-Alfisols and Mollisols which are medium to high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low in base saturation (24). Pignut hickory responds to increases in soil nitrogen similarly to <b>American</b> <b>beech</b> (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) (15). These species are rated as intermediate in nitrogen deficiency tolerance and consequently are able to grow {{with lower levels of}} nitrogen than are required by [...] "nitrogen- demanding" [...] white ash (Fraxinus americana), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and American basswood (Tilia americana). Hickories are considered [...] "soil improvers" [...] because their leaves have a relatively high calcium content.|$|E
2500|$|Eastern Hemlock {{trees are}} located along streams of the mountain's lower slopes, and the drier east and {{southeast}} {{face of the}} mountain is predominantly a Red and White oak and maple mix, with grapevines and some exotic invasive species where there are holes in the canopy. The north and west faces of the mountain contain Tulip poplar, <b>American</b> <b>Beech</b> and other associated hardwoods due to the richer soils.
