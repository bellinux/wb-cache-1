40|$|The paper {{describes}} a multistep conversion process from METAFONT sources to outline fonts (Adobe Type 1 format). An important step, finding contours, {{is based on}} an accurate algorithm fitting the envelope curve of a stroke drawn by a pen along a cubic Bézier curve by the least square method, specially extended (adapted) for a rotated elliptical pen applied, for instance, in the Devanagari font design. After converting the EPS files produced by METAPOST to the corresponding outline representation, the FontForge font editor is used for removing overlap, simplification, autohinting, generating outline fonts, and necessary manual modifications. The conversion results, the faithful Indic Type 1 fonts (significantly more precise and closer to optimal than earlier attempts made by <b>autotracing</b> bitmaps) will be released...|$|R
40|$|Neubau Forst Catalogue is the 432 -page print {{catalogue}} of a digital collection of tree silhouettes and sculptures seen at different seasons. Working by hand, the Neubau designers digitally removed the trees from their original Berlin surroundings and thereby crafted {{a body of}} visual material whose scope, outstanding quality of detail and excellent image resolution sets it clearly apart from conventional tree libraries compiled with <b>autotracing</b> tools. The trees, which were systematically photographed in summer and winter over several years, assume a timeless validity through Neubau’s process of selection and are thus universally applicable for future visualisations. From the existing stand-alone tree objects, which can be placed against both dark and light backgrounds of all kinds, Neubau has furthermore derived individual “tree modules”. These modules can be combined with the ready-to-use trees in an endless number of ways. Alongside detailed information about tree species, size, location, year of planting and file format, the catalogue contains also numerous impressive examples of how these images can be used. The corresponding Neubau Forst Archive, consisting of 683 individual elements, is the digital library of which architects, designers, graphic designers and illustrators have previously only dreamed.

40|$|Ultrasound imaging of {{the tongue}} is used for {{analyzing}} the articulatory features of speech sounds. In {{order to be able}} to study the movements {{of the tongue}}, the tongue surface contour has to be traced for each recorded image. In order to capture the details of the tongue’s movement during speech, the ultrasound video is generally recorded at the highest frame rate available. Detail comes at a price. The number of frames produced from even a single non-trivial experiment is often far too large to trace manually. The Arizona Phonological Imaging Lab (APIL) at the University of Arizona has developed a suite of tools to simplify the labeling and analysis of tongue contours. <b>AutoTrace</b> is a state-of-the-art automatic method for tracing tongue contours that is robust across speakers and languages and operates independently of frame order. The workshop will outline the software installation procedure, introduce the included tools for selecting and preparing training data, provide instructions for automated tracing, and overview a method for measuring the network’s accuracy using the Mean Sum of Distances (MSD) metric described by Li et al.

40|$|The {{application}} of three-dimensional (3 D) reconstructions to US has been recently proposed, but remains strongly {{limited by the}} difficulty to produce parallel and equidistant slices and by the obvious lack of method standardization. This work describes our experience with a workstation {{on the market in}} producing 3 D images from US exams. Reconstruction involved the following steps: acquisition (US examinations of different organs [...] i. e. carotid artery, parotid gland, kidney, gallbladder, urinary bladder [...] were recorded on VHS tape; a small, self-built, motor-driven mechanical arm was used to move the probe along the selected axis of the organ: a 486 -class computer with a framegrabbing card was used during the digitizing process to produce a set of slices, white were saved in 320 x 256 x 8 bit format), pre-processing and segmentation (we used interactive contrast enhancement as a pre-processing technique, to emphasize contrast between echoic and anechoic structures or between solid structures with a small difference in echogenicity; as a segmentation technique, we used <b>autotracing</b> with a selected seed point; in a small number of images, where the software could not provide an adequate delimitation, we had to operate manually) and rendering. A commercially available software for radiological use (Analyze-Mayo Foundation, USA) was used for processing, segmentation and rendering. The rendered images can be visualized with multiple zoom factors, rotated and cut on any plane, reconstructed from every user-definable point of view. The good results indicate that 3 D acquisition and reconstruction will probably change the way to obtain, display and study US findings...|$|R
40|$|ARCIMBOLDO is an {{ab initio}} phasing method for {{macromolecular}} crystallographic X-ray diffraction data, which combines location of model fragments such as polyalanine α- helices {{with the program}} PHASER and density modification and main chain <b>autotracing</b> with the program SHELXE. The method has been named after the Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo (1526 - 1593), who used to compose portraits out of common objects such as fruits and vegetables. Following the analogy, ARCIMBOLDO composes an unknown structure by assembling small secondary structure elements, which are conserved across families of unrelated tertiary structure. Exploiting this method requires a multi-solution approach due to the difficulty to recognize correct solutions at early stages. Moreover, phasing a structure starting from partial information provided by such {{a small percentage of}} the total model (around 10 % of the main chain atoms) is challenging and requires evaluation of alternative hypotheses under statistical constraints to avoid combinatorial explosion. ARCIMBOLDO methods have proven successful in many cases of previously unknown structures[3] and also on a pool of test structures[4]. The program can accept any Sohnke space group and all the most frequent ones are represented in the pool of structures solved so far. In both studies data were collected in the most common protein space groups. Data quality is crucial for phasing methods, and particularly sensitive for ARCIMBOLDO, where low resolution (worse than 2. 1 Å) and lack of completeness (less than 98 %) drastically decrease the chance of success. Location of secondary structure elements is not indicated as phasing method for large structures or complexes (over 400 residues) unless very long helices are present and high resolution data are available. Such cases would require the placement of many fragments in order to assemble 10 % of the main chain, which can lead to an unmanageable number of solutions. To approach correctly this different scenario we have implemented dedicated methods in ARCIMBOLDO_BORGES[7] and ARCIMBOLDO_SHREDDER[8]. These programs exploit libraries of folds or large search models and are described later in the text. The current implementation[4], coded in Python, is deployed as a standalone binary, freely available under registration from [URL] The binary is compatible with common Linux distributions and latest versions of the Mac OSX operating system. Users can find online manuals, tutorials and documentation in our website. As of 30 th April 2015, it has been downloaded 664 times and distributed to 121 research groups; furthermore, it has been installed in many European synchrotron facilities such as the Alba Synchrotron in Spain, the Diamond Light Source in United Kingdom and SOLEIL Synchrotron in France. The software is also available through SBGrid Consortium ([URL] a network of institutions across 19 countries, which provides a distributed grid network of computers to run structural biology software. We have recently started a collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center ([URL] in California (USA), to develop optimized and dedicated versions of the programs for their platform with the aim of addressing difficult phasing cases. Due to this recent spread in the crystallographic community ARCIMBOLDO has been presented in many international conferences such as the International Union of Crystallography Meeting in Madrid (ES) 2011 and in Montreal (CA) 2014; the European Crystallographic Meeting in Bergen (NO) 2012, Warwick (UK) 2013; and many schools and workshops such as the International School of Crystallography in Erice (IT) 2012 and Macromolecular Crystallography School in Madrid (ES) 2014.

ARCIMBOLDO es un método de resolución de estructuras macromoleculares cristalográficas ab intio, que combina la localización de pequeños fragmentos modelo tales como hélices alfa con modificación de la densidad electrónica y trazado automático de la cadena polipeptídica. El método ha sido denominado como el pintor italiano Giuseppe Arcimboldo, quien componía retratos con objetos comunes, tales como libros o vegetales. De modo análogo, nuestro método compone hipótesis estructurales colocando pequeños fragmentos de estructura, cuando la subestructura resultante es suficientemente próxima a la real, la modificación de la densidad electrónica muestra su “retrato”. Si por el contrario la hipótesis es incorrecta, el resultado es un mero “bodegón”. El presente trabajo se centra en el desarrollo de este método y su extensión del uso de fragmentos de estructura seundaria a pequeños plegamientos locales y estructuras terciarias derivadas de modelos de baja homología. • 	El método se ha caracterizado por necesitar computación masiva para tratar la enorme cantidad de hipótesis generadas, pero en el presente trabajo hemos implementado una versión tan optimizada que resuelve estructuras cristalográficas en una estación de trabajo única • 	Más allá de las hélices alfa de polialanina, se ha extendido el uso a fragmentos cortados de modelos de baja homología, desarrollando un método para determinar y extraer la subestructura de más similaridad contra los datos experimentales, en concreto la función de rotación. Implementación de SHREDDER. • 	La extensión del método ab initio del uso de estructura secundaria a terciaria requería utilizar librerías de hipótesis de plegamiento que representaran una vasta colección de posibilidades. Se ha desarrollado una herramienta para generar tales librerías, el programa BORGES y un formalismo subyacente basado en vectores característicos. • 	Desarrollo de un método e implementación de un programa para resolver estructuras empleando las librerías de plegamientos inespecíficos: ARCIMBOLDO_BORGES. Todos estos objetivos se han cumplido satisfactoriamente...|$|R
