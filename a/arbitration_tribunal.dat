40|$|Although over a {{third of}} all {{arbitration}} proceedings result in settlement agreements very little has been written on the legal status of consent awards in international arbitration. Drawing on comparative analysis of procedural rules and practice of major <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunals,</b> domestic law of common and civil law jurisdictions, this Article presents the first major study of consent awards in international arbitration. Consent awards, being effectively settlement agreements recorded by <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunals</b> as awards, raise a number of difficult legal questions, ranging from the right of arbitrators to refuse recoding the settlement as a consent award to the possible use of consent awards to cover illegal activities. Understanding what makes consent awards different from “normal” arbitration awards will help successfully navigate from settlement to enforcement...|$|R
40|$|Dispute {{resolution}} by arbitration {{is available}} in all post-communist Balkan countries {{but it has not}} become popular among businessmen. The article argues that this is a puzzle and not easy to rationalise. Arbitration services have advantages over state court services and some of these advantages arguably are particularly significant in post-communism. The article reports a survey of lawyers which suggests that even 15 years after the beginning of transition plain ignorance has remained a key explanatory factor for the failure of businessmen to use arbitration. Another finding is that trust in <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunals</b> tends to be shaky. An argument rooted in the incomplete law literature is used to show that in some cicumstances <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunals</b> may be more prone to favouritism than state courts. ...|$|R
25|$|The smelter in Trail, British Columbia is {{operated}} by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company (COMINCO) and has processed lead and zinc since 1896. Smoke from the smelter caused damage to forests and crops in the surrounding area and also across the Canada–US border in Washington. The smoke from the smelter distressed residents, resulting in complaints to COMINCO and demands for compensation. The dispute between the smelter operators and affected landowners could not be resolved, resulting in the case being sent to an <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunal.</b> Negotiation and resulting litigation and arbitration was settled in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, either {{position}} is potentially unfair; {{if a person}} is made to sign a contract under duress, and the contract contains an arbitration clause highly favourable to the other party, the dispute may still referred to that <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunal.</b> Conversely a court may be persuaded that the arbitration agreement itself is void having been signed under duress. However, most courts will be reluctant to interfere with the general rule which does allow for commercial expediency; any other solution (where one first had to go to court to decide whether one had to go to arbitration) would be self-defeating.|$|E
25|$|Procedures which {{necessarily}} lead to {{a determination}} which {{the parties to the}} dispute may not enter into an agreement upon: Some court procedures lead to judgments which bind all members of the general public, or public authorities in their capacity as such, or third parties, or which are being conducted in the public interest. For example, until the 1980s, antitrust matters were not arbitrable in the United States. Matters relating to crimes, status and family law are generally not considered to be arbitrable, as the power of the parties to enter into an agreement upon these matters is at least restricted. However, most other disputes that involve private rights between two parties can be resolved using arbitration. In some disputes, parts of claims may be arbitrable and other parts not. For example, in a dispute over patent infringement, a determination of whether a patent has been infringed could be adjudicated upon by an <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunal,</b> but the validity of a patent could not: As patents are subject to a system of public registration, an arbitral panel would have no power to order the relevant body to rectify any patent registration based upon its determination.|$|E

Introduced to address these concerns in 2011, the Equality Bill proposes a legislative solution to further maintain the principle of equality within alternative dispute resolution channels. This Note argues that, despite the Equality Bill’s laudable effort to curb discrimination and violations of England’s policy of equality, legislative reform alone will be unlikely to affect the Bill’s desired goals...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} {{the history of}} the {{philosophical}} understanding held by the major political parties towards the governance of the Australian industrial relations system. In so doing it notes there has been a long legacy of socialist and conservative political and ideological support for mediating industrial conflict through the institutional agencies provided by conciliation and <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunals.</b> The discussion notes the erosion of this legacy under the recent ascendancy of neo-liberal political and neo-classical economic thought, an ascendancy that has seen a significant retreat of state responsibility for mediating relations between the two sides of industry in the name of improving business productivity and national economic outcomes. The passing of the Workplace Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 is the latest legislative manifestation of this thinking. This paper challenges the labour market assumptions and expectations of the Bill by arguing that equality in bargaining power between the two sides of industry in the manner afforded by conciliation and <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunals</b> is essential for any genuine and lasting prosperity to exist between labour and capital. <br /...|$|R

Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod's treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of “Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl” “Sir, I never forget a face, but I will make an exception for yours”. He {{then moved on to}} a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that “I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.” He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as “high order jugular debating”, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunal.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Lower Courts are {{established}} by {{an act of}} Parliament and are bound by the four corners of legislation. There are several lower courts in Namibia. They are the magistrates' courts, the (labour) <b>arbitration</b> <b>tribunals</b> and the customary courts. Magistrates' courts deal with the most cases in the entire legal system. They are manned by magistrates who are employed by the Ministry of Justice. The decisions of magistrates' courts are written down; however, they are not recorded in any law report. The decisions have to be written in case either party to the proceedings feel prejudiced by the outcome and wants to go on appeal or review to the High Court. They are created by the Magistrates' Court Act no. 32 of 1944. The magistrates are governed by the Magistrates Act 3 of 2003. <b>Arbitration</b> <b>tribunals</b> {{are established}} by section 85 of the Labour Act No. 11 of 2007. <b>Arbitration</b> <b>tribunals</b> operate {{under the auspices of the}} Labour Commissioner. They deal with labour disputes, mainly arising from alleged contraventions of the Labour Act. Community courts, which apply customary law, were created by the Community Courts Act 10 of 2003. Prior to this date these courts operated informally without recognition as part of the legal system. These developments are extension of art 66 of the Constitution which holds that both the customary law and the common law of Namibia in force on the date of Independence shall remain valid to the extent to which such customary or common law does not conflict with this Constitution or any other statutory law. The courts have no reporting system, as the laws that they apply are very dynamic and may not be applied the same in any number of cases heard before them. The regional courts are the least used lower courts, and are slowly becoming obsolete.|$|R
