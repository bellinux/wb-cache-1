It does so through a comparative analysis of three different “types” of MDBs operating in Latin America—the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Corporación Andina de Fomento. The initial research phase discussed here compares financial performance and lending patterns using descriptive statistics accumulated from an extensive review of the <b>annual</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> {{of each of these}} MDBs from 1975 to 2007. The evidence suggests that each MDB has systematically different reactions to changing external conditions, pointing to inherent competitive strengths and weaknesses derived from differing composition of shareholding countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper mainly explores how and if {{sales and}} {{increased}} competition among financial certifiers, namely Fitch, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, affect the default rate of corporate bonds.

Data for econometric regressions was taken from three market leaders who have approximately 95 % of total market share - Fitch, Moody’s and S&P. The data was collected from each company’s <b>annual</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> and bond default rate reports. Two panel data models are constructed to test how corporate bond default rates are affected by sales and market share of credit rating companies. While market share indicated no significance on the bond default rate, the sales proved to be significant enough to increase the bond default rate in the future years. Based on these results, policy recommendations were made...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to give a {{financial}} synoptic, annual image of the state of the real economy, using the <b>annual</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of the economic agents. The objectives of the paper aim to implement some significant indicators (secondary, tertiary, aggregate, etc.) in the economic evaluation, with a higher significance than the known primary indicators, the current calculation of some indicators determined by the economic and financial theory which are not, however, used currently. The financial statistic aspects, with annual frequency and at the aggregate (national) level are recorded and published in official documents and reports (NBR, NSI, Governmental), but most of them are primary, macroeconomic indicators which, mist times, don’t give a structural image of the particular phenomenon. Within this context, the quantitative and qualitative interpretation of the economic and financial processes from the real economy is rather difficult. Hence, it is necessary that this huge mass of information from the accounting balances of the companies is processed with the purpose to produce significant indicators so that the economic-financial phenomenology from the real economy is revealed with more accuracy. ...|$|R

Purpose: To investigate which financial ratios are {{significant in the}} prediction of bank failure for the sample of Russian and Ukrainian banks and {{to see if there}} any similar ratios, which drive the bank to bankruptcy in both countries for the first decade of this century. Methodology: As an instrument for our analysis we use the linear probability and the binary choice models. They are used to analyze the significance of different financial ratios drawn from the publicly available <b>annual</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> for the period 2002 - 2008. Theoretical perspective: The theoretical framework is the previous research in the field of bank failure prediction and credit-risk management methodology. Conclusions: For the Ukrainian sample the capitalization and profitability measures influence the bank failure negatively, as well as a size of the bank. For the sample of Russian banks, the return on assets and the loans to total assets ratios are found to have a negative influence on the default, in contrast to the capitalization, which positively influence the bankruptcy according to the estimated coefficients.

40|$|This is {{the second}} of three papers {{investigating}} the differences between foreign and domestic firms in Colombia. The study uses a dataset containing <b>annual</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> and income statements for a sample of 3, 452 firms for the period 1996 to 2003. This period includes the 1999 economic crisis. The dataset {{was obtained from the}} Superintendencia de Sociedades. If the development of foreign majority-owned firms, as an aggregate, is compared to that of domestic firms, it is shown that foreign firms have, in terms of aggregate sales, grown faster than their domestic counterparts, and that they were less affected by the 1999 crisis. Profit developments have also been more positive for foreign firms than for domestic firms, both in terms of operating margin and net-profit margin. While the net-profit margin of domestic firms was seriously affected by the 1999 crisis, that of foreign firms was hardly affected at all. The leverage of foreign firms, measured as total liabilities to total assets, has, furthermore, increased during the period, while that of domestic firms have remained more or less flat. For foreign minorityowned firms, on the other hand, the results are less conclusive. ...|$|R
