At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem.

5|$|Gibraltar {{remained}} in Moorish hands until 1462 but was disputed between the Nasrids of Granada and Marinids of Fez.

Gibraltar was subsequently used by the Granadans as the base for raids into Christian territory, prompting Enrique de Guzmán, second Count of Niebla, to lay siege in 1436.

5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China.

Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E
