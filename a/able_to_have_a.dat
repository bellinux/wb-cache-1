25|$|For much {{of their}} career, Pentagram rehearsed at the American Mailing {{warehouse}} in Alexandria, {{due to the fact}} that both Liebling and O’Keefe lived in high-rise apartments. The latter’s father, George O’Keefe, was an executive at American Mailing. The younger O’Keefe had used this location for many of his previous musical projects, whether on his own or with Space Meat. At the warehouse, the group was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good practice room to store their equipment and play loudly without the worry of complaining neighbors. Many of these early rehearsals were recorded on O’Keefe's reel-to-reel tape recorder. The resulting rehearsal tapes, featuring the many early lineups the group went through in the early 1970s, were later traded extensively among Pentagram fans. When American Mailing moved locations, Pentagram eventually moved to rehearse at Mayne's house, which he was renting with an old friend, locally renowned keyboardist Knox Cockrell.|$|E
