Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he {{regarded as a}} holy crusade against the Slave Power.

5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>government</b> that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup.
