Tracy eventually appears on Late Night only to immediately fall asleep after sitting down.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{accepted}} {{a job with}} Tufts, where he became involved with the American Radio and Research Corporation (AMRAD), which began broadcasting music from the campus on March 8, 1916. The station owner, Harold Power, hired him to run the company's laboratory, at a salary greater than that which Bush drew from Tufts. In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, {{he went to work}} with the National Research Council. He attempted to develop a means of detecting submarines by measuring the disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field. His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it to work on a metal ship such as a destroyer failed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 August, both Montanan and West Bridge were still afloat, albeit with decks awash. Despite <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Montanan under tow, she foundered later in the morning. Meanwhile, Hawkins and his {{executive}} officer were taken by boat to West Bridge to assess her situation. After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised Burrows captain that the situation was hopeless and he would only be endangering his ship, crew, and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, Burrows departed for Brest, France, leaving destroyer Smith to stand by West Bridge.|$|E

In order to help attract producers they shot a low-budget short film {{of the same name}} from a scene out of the script. This proved successful in 2003 as producers from Evolution Entertainment were immediately attached and also formed a horror genre production label Twisted Pictures. The film was given a small budget and shot for 18 days.|$|E

Before he can do so, Alice appears with the news that the Prince has been prevented from marrying Isabelle.

5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E

However, {{when he goes to}} his room a house-elf named Dobby warns him not to return to Hogwarts and admits to intercepting Harry's post from his friends. Having failed to persuade Harry to voluntarily give up his place at Hogwarts, Dobby then <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him expelled by using magic to smash Petunia's dessert on a dinner party guest and framing it on Harry, who is not allowed to use magic out of school.

5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on the bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits {{in a very long}} line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
5|$|Tammi Peyton enters AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators {{and plays}} her message machine, which {{contains}} the victim's {{phone call from}} the previous night. She <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into her right desk drawer, when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about a message on the machine. She mentions the murder to Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that {{it would be difficult to}} miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{congested}} {{streets and}} {{the distance to the}} City from the stations to the north and west prompted many <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> parliamentary approval to build new railway lines into the City. None were successful, and the 1846 Royal Commission investigation into Metropolitan Railway Termini banned construction of new lines or stations in the built-up central area. The concept of an underground railway linking the City with the mainline termini was first proposed in the 1830s. Charles Pearson, Solicitor to the City, was a leading promoter of several schemes and in 1846 proposed a central railway station to be used by multiple railway companies. The scheme was rejected by the 1846 commission, but Pearson returned to the idea in 1852 when he helped set up the City Terminus Company to build a railway from Farringdon to King's Cross. Although the plan was supported by the City, the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed.|$|E
