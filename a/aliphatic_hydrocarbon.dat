40|$|<b>Aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{make up a}} {{substantial}} portion of organic contamination in the terrestrial environment. However, most studies have focussed on the fate and behaviour of aromatic contaminants in soil. Despite structural differences between aromatic and <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> both classes of contaminants are subject to physicochemical processes, which can affect the degree of loss, sequestration and interaction with soil microflora. Given the nature of hydrocarbon contamination of soils and the importance of bioremediation strategies, understanding the fate and behaviour of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is imperative, particularly microbe-contaminant interactions. Biodegradation by microbes is the key removal process of hydrocarbons in soils, which is controlled by hydrocarbon physicochemistry, environmental conditions, bioavailability and the presence of catabolically active microbes. Therefore, the aims of this review are (i) to consider the physicochemical properties of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and highlight mechanisms controlling their fate and behaviour in soil; (ii) to discuss the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in soil, with particular attention being paid to biodegradation, and (iii) to briefly consider bioremediation techniques that may be applied to remove <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from soil...|$|R

40|$|While {{it is well}} {{recognized}} that interstellar grains are made of amorphous silicates and some form of carbonaceous materials, it remains debated regarding what exact chemical and physical form the carbonaceous component takes. Contemporary grain models assume that the silicate and carbon components are either physically separated, or they form a core-mantle structure, or they agglomerate to form porous composites. The core-mantle model posits that the mantle is made {{of some sort of}} <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> materials and is responsible for the 3. 4 micrometer absorption feature ubiquitously seen in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and external galaxies. This model is challenged by the nondetection of polarization in the 3. 4 micrometer absorption feature as the 9. 7 micrometer silicate feature is observed to be polarized. To alleviate this challenge, we calculate the degree of polarization of the 3. 4 micrometer feature for spheroidal silicate dust coated by a layer of spherical <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> It is found that the 3. 4 micrometer feature polarization still exceeds the observational upper limit, even though spherical <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mantles are expected to cause much less polarization than nonspherical (e. g., spheroidal) mantles. We have also shown that the composite grain model which consists of amorphous silicate, <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> and vacuum also predicts the 3. 4 micrometer feature polarization to well exceed what is observed. These results support the earlier arguments that the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> component is physically separated from the silicate component unless the 3. 4 micrometer absorption feature is just a minor carbon sink in the ISM.

The influence of the compatibility of EBA hot melts on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA hot melts varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA hot melts showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with aromatic and <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion.

Soils were amended with 10 or 100 mg kg(- 1) of a model alkane n-hexadeccane and 100 Bq g(- 1) C- 14 -n-hexadecane. correlations between the extents of mineralisation and extraction of the C- 14 -contaminant were determined. Solvent shake extractions and aqueous CaCl 2 extractions were poor predictors of hexadecane bioaccessibility. However, the novel HP-alpha-CD shake extraction showed close correlation (r(2) = 0. 90, n= 36, p< 0. 05) to the mineralisation data.

Two zones have been chosen for this study. Zone 1 corresponds to Tangier’s bay and zone 2 corresponding to the fringe between Kabila and Kaâ Srass. The <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were extracted and analysed using chromatographic techniques (GC/FID and GC/MS). The results showed a more important accumulation of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in Tangier’s bay if compared with zone 2. Levels ranged within 128. 8 to 340. 31 µg/g dry weight, with two exceptions 611. 72 and 648. 16 µg/g dry weights and from 5. 25 to 22. 71 µg/g dry weights, for zones 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> distribution proves to be strongly influenced by the nearness to input sources and by oceanographic and hydrodynamic conditions. Thus, two distribution patterns were observed corresponding to the two areas studied.
