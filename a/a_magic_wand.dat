5|$|The Magic Wand {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} vibrator, a masturbation aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using <b>a</b> <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided <b>a</b> <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to each woman for these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause of vertigo, a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals. Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using <b>a</b> <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E

5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using <b>a</b> <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{first player}} moves {{the number of}} spaces along the track {{according}} to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instruction. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking <b>a</b> <b>magic</b> <b>wand.</b> He may play the wand {{at any time during}} the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness.

Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.|$|E
25|$|Many years ago, in the Enchanted Forest, a young Regina {{wishes that}} her mother Cora {{had more time to}} play. Without her mother {{watching}} her, Regina finds <b>a</b> <b>magic</b> <b>wand</b> and attempts to transform her doll into a real sister with whom to play, only to have the spell backfire, knocking her unconscious. Cora and Prince Henry realizes {{that the only way to}} save her is by bringing a magical family member to wake her up. Consequently, Cora visits Oz to bring back Zelena, who just used her magic to restock the logs she dropped. This angers her abusive adoptive father, who doesn't want Zelena to use her “wicked” magic. Cora immediately freezes the woodcutter as he is about to hit her (her adoptive mother wasn't around to protect Zelena this time), then gives Zelena the opportunity to prove that her magic can be used for good, which she accepts. As Zelena is able to wake Regina, the two are unaware of their being sisters at first, but over time become close, and quickly realize that they're related, when Zelena accidentally opens Cora's wand box, leading to Cora admitting that Regina and Zelena are sisters. Despite Regina's pleas to have Zelena in her life, Cora, believing that Zelena's presence will interfere with Regina's future of becoming the next queen, wipes both of their memories and sends Zelena back to Oz.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we review}} the {{development}} of protein scaling theory, starting from backgrounds in mathematics and statistical mechanics, and leading to biomedical applications. Evolution has organized each protein family in different ways, but scaling theory is both simple and effective in providing readily transferable dynamical insights complementary for many proteins represented in the 90 thousand static structures contained in the online Protein Data Base (PDB). Scaling theory is <b>a</b> simplifying <b>magic</b> <b>wand</b> that enables one to search {{the hundreds of millions}} of protein articles in the Web of Science, and identify those proteins that present new cost-effective methods for early detection and/or treatment of disease through individual protein sequences (personalized medicine). Critical point theory is general, and recently it has proved to be the most effective way of describing protein networks that have evolved towards nearly perfect functionality in given environments (self-organized criticality). Evolutionary patterns are governed by common scaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been developed bioinformatically by studying thousands of PDB structures. The most effective scales involve either hydropathic globular sculpting interactions averaged over length scales centered on membrane dimensions, or exposed beta strand propensities associated with aggregative (strong) protein-protein interactions.
