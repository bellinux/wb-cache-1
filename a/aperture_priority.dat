25|$|<b>Aperture</b> <b>priority</b> is a {{semi-automatic}} shooting mode used in cameras. It {{permits the}} photographer to select an aperture setting {{and let the}} camera decide the shutter speed and sometimes also ISO sensitivity for the correct exposure. This is {{also referred to as}} <b>Aperture</b> <b>Priority</b> Auto Exposure, A mode, AV mode (aperture-value mode), or semi-auto mode.|$|E
25|$|The camera offered <b>aperture</b> <b>priority</b> {{exposure}} {{with the}} option of manual settings. The Minox 35ML and Minox M.D.C offer program mode (P mode) exposure in addition to <b>aperture</b> <b>priority.</b> The 35mm/2.8 Minotar/Minoxar lens was very sharp, with low distortion, while the camera's metering-system's capability to produce excellent results especially under low-light conditions was outstanding – using exposure times of up to two minutes.|$|E

50|$|The {{aperture}} on {{the lens}} is set {{from the body}} by the same stop-down lever found on the original K-mount, but on KA-lenses this lever {{is proportional to the}} area of the aperture opening, rather than the diameter as on previous lenses. This allows the body to easily set a specific aperture, since the relationship to F stops is linear. The lenses add an 'A' setting on the aperture dial, which gives the body control of the aperture. Other, numeric settings are used for manual <b>aperture</b> modes—aperture <b>priority</b> and full manual mode.|$|R
50|$|The F10's sibling, the FinePix F11, {{which was}} not {{released}} in the United States except {{in the state of}} Hawaii, added <b>aperture</b> and shutter <b>priority</b> modes but still did not provide full manual control. It also had a slightly improved LCD screen and a few other minor improvements to the F10.|$|R
50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of the new}} {{wide angle}} lens in the F100 that the associated aperture has only two positions: wide open and closed. The F100fd has no continuous aperture. For this reason the F100fd (or a successor with the same lens system) cannot be equipped with the creative shooting modes (i.e. <b>aperture</b> or shutter <b>priority).</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Fujifilm FinePix F60fd was {{announced}} on 12 August 2008. It is {{almost identical to}} the FinePix F50fd except for a larger 3" [...] LCD and updated firmware that includes in-camera relighting (high dynamic range) functions and intelligent scene recognition. In contrast to the F100fd, the F60fd does have photography modes for creative shooting (i.e. <b>aperture</b> and shutter <b>priority).</b>|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, the Z5fd {{does not}} have an <b>aperture</b> or shutter <b>priority</b> setting, but the user can change ISO setting, white balance, and {{exposure}} compensation. Fujifilm supplies a 14-pin USB cord and utilizes fast USB 2.0 hardware to upload images to a computer. Unlike other camera manufacturers which supply a wall charger, charging the battery on the Z5fd uses the same 14-pin port on the camera combined with an AC adapter from Fujifilm.|$|R
5000|$|R4MOT/R4/R4S/R4S Mod2 - 1980-87 a new compact model {{based upon}} the Minolta XD-7/Minolta XD-11. The R4 set the design for all cameras up to and {{including}} the R7. The R4 offered Program mode, <b>Aperture</b> and Shutter <b>Priority,</b> and Manual, with Spot and Centerweighted metering. The R4MOT differed in designation only; all R4s and up accepted motors and winders. The R4 offered The R4S and R4S Mod2 were simplified models at slightly lower prices.|$|R

50|$|The K10D {{featured}} a pentaprism viewfinder (instead of the slightly dimmer pentamirror on some previous models), full programmed, <b>aperture</b> and shutter <b>priority</b> modes, {{and a new}} Sensitivity-priority mode where the rear dial adjusts light sensitivity and the camera adjusts shutter speed and aperture to maintain correct exposure. Power contacts on the lens mount were introduced to enable Pentax's SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) for silent focusing. The power contacts also provide the power zoom function in some FA lens that Pentax introduced in the 1990s. In addition, the K10D could write JPEGs and two versions of RAW files (PEF, and the Adobe specification DNG).|$|R
50|$|In 1977, Minolta {{introduced}} the XD-11, the first multimode 35 mm compact SLR to include both <b>aperture</b> and shutter <b>priority</b> {{in a single}} body. It {{was also the first}} camera to employ a computerised chip, which in shutter priority mode overrode the chosen speed if necessary to give a correct exposure, thus offering the first-ever 'programmed mode'. The XD-11 is {{considered by many to be}} the best manual-focus 35 mm SLR Minolta ever produced, and the last serious attempt by Minolta to enter the professional and semiprofessional 35 mm SLR market until the Maxxum 9 in 1998. Elements of the XD-11 design (called the XD-7 in Europe) were utilized by Leitz for the Leica R4 camera.|$|R
5000|$|With {{its small}} sensor size, {{different}} exterior color options and no <b>aperture</b> and shutter <b>priority</b> modes, this camera {{is being said}} by critics as a female users' camera.Although this camera has a picture stabilization feature called [...] "Anti-Blur", there is no mechanical stabilizer such as optical or CCD-shift stabilization. The camera only changes its sensitivity to ISO 1600 and high shutter speed.Face detection works well, {{but only if the}} person(s) in the image is not wearing headwear such as hats, sunglasses, or even eyeglasses and is facing directly into the camera.Some users have experienced pink fringing or pink vertical bands along {{the left side of the}} image. Fujifilm along with the Super CCD has been known for this problem and has yet to fix the problem completely.Fujifilm's proprietary xD-Picture cards are expensive compared to SD and CF counterparts and as of 2009 the largest size available to consumers is only 2 GB.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aperture</b> <b>priority</b> is a {{semi-automatic}} shooting mode used in cameras.

5000|$|For {{the first}} time, shutter {{information}} was displayed via an internal {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD) inside the viewfinder. Aperture information was relayed through Nikon's [...] "ADR" [...] (Aperture Direct Readout) which was a window at the top center of the viewfinder that got its information from a micro-prism that read small numbers {{at the top of}} the mounted lens, of which type 'AI' (Aperture Indexing) or 'AIS' (<b>Aperture</b> Indexing Shutter <b>Priority)</b> lenses had printed behind the normal aperture numbers. Though widely used today, LCDs were very hi-tech at the time. They proved somewhat difficult to see at night, so Nikon installed a button-operated light for use at night. The LCD is one of the few problem areas of the F3 design, since with age, LCDs lose contrast, blur, and become inoperative after a number of years. Fortunately, unlike modern autofocus cameras with LCD 'Command Center' panels, malfunction of the F3's LCD viewfinder display does not prevent full operation of the camera, since this is accomplished with manual dials and indicators. Many F3 cameras built in the 1980s were never used professionally, and therefore are still in perfect working order, including the LCD. On early production models the autoexposure lock button, originally a simple push-in part, is often missing; Nikon later redesigned this part so it was securely attached from inside the body. The later part can be fitted to early bodies but a partial stripdown is required.|$|R

50|$|As an image's {{depth of}} field is {{inversely}} proportional {{to the size of}} the lens's aperture, <b>aperture</b> <b>priority</b> mode is often used to allow the photographer to control the focus of objects in the frame. <b>Aperture</b> <b>priority</b> is therefore useful in landscape photography, for example, where it may be desired that objects in foreground, middle distance, and background all be rendered crisply, while shutter speed is immaterial. To obtain this large {{depth of field}}, a narrow aperture (identified by a high f-number, e.g. f/16 or f/22) is necessary. <b>Aperture</b> <b>priority</b> mode also finds use in portrait photography, where a wide aperture (identified by a low number, e.g. f/1.4 or f/2.8) and therefore smaller depth of field may be desired to throw the background out of focus and make it less distracting.|$|E
