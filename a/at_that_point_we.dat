25|$|In {{differential}} geometry, the {{two principal}} curvatures {{at a given}} point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different directions <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> <b>We</b> represent the surface by the implicit function theorem as the graph of a function, f, of two variables, {{in such a way}} that the point p is a critical point, i.e., the gradient of f vanishes (this can always be attained by a suitable rigid motion). Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at p is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian). (Recall that the Hessian is the 2-by-2 matrix of second derivatives.) This definition allows one immediately to grasp the distinction between cup/cap versus saddle point.|$|E

No new material was written during that time, and {{it was not until the}} beginning of 1998 that the band began rehearsal. At that point, Navarro had become dependent on drugs, with Kiedis also struggling to remain clean. The band decided they would have a talk with Navarro and attempt to convince him to enter rehab. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute, and Navarro fell over an amplifier in a drug-induced daze. In April 2010, Navarro discussed this incident, stating that: [...] "One [...] was [...] my drug use at the time. The other was musical differences.

[...] Facing hostility towards hardcore punk, SST groups like Black Flag and the Minutemen played wherever they could, mainly at house parties and in basements early on. Black Flag began traveling up the California coast to play Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, making seven trips in total. SST house record producer Spot went along as sound-man and tour manager, a job he would perform for several years, along with helping to record much of the label's music.|$|E

It too was a {{critical}} and commercial failure which, along with its two singles [...] "Stuck in a Loop" [...] and [...] "Post Post-Modern Man", hold {{the distinction of being}} Devo's worst-selling efforts; all failed to appear on the U.S. charts. Devo launched a concert tour in support of the album, but poor ticket sales and the bankruptcy and dissolution of Enigma Records, who was responsible for organizing and financing the tour, caused it to be cancelled part way through. They had a falling out and played one final show in March 1991 before breaking up.
