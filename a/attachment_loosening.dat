40|$|Background IRRPD offers {{patients}} {{the ability to}} upgrade their treatment planning to implant-supported-overdentures (ISOs) or implant-supported-fixed-prostheses (ISFPs) through insertion of more implants in the future after {{the loss of the}} remaining natural teeth. Aims The purpose of this prospective-clinical-study was to evaluate the success rate and treatment outcome of IRRPD for 15 patients, during at least 5 -year-follow-ups after prosthetic rehabilitation with respect to implant mobility, peri-implant-marginal-bone-levels, and prosthetic complications. Methods 15 successive patients were attended the Department of Implantology and Prosthodontics in TUMS, and received Implant-Retained-Removable-Partial-Dentures (IRRPDs). Two standard-size-dental-implants (Implantium/Dentium system, internal hexagon, Seoul, South Korea) were placed in distal-extension-areas for each patient. After the osseointegration period, all patients received IRRPDs using two Ball attachments. All the participated patients were followed-up at least for 5 years, and the survival rate of 30 implants was evaluated. The patients’ satisfaction of function, phonetics, and aesthetics was assessed by means of questionnaire. Results None of the studied patients reported any prosthetic complications during the follow-up-periods such as <b>attachment</b> <b>loosening,</b> metal housing loosening, or denture fracture. No implants failure was recorded, so that the cumulative-implant-survival rate was 100 per cent. The mean marginal-bone-resorption (MBR) around the two implants was 0. 9 mm with a range of 0. 5 – 1. 4 mm. Teeth aesthetics was judged as excellent or very good by 86. 7 per cent of the patients, while phonetics and mastication were considered excellent or very good by 66. 7 per cent and 73. 3 per cent of the patients, respectively. Conclusion 15 patients received 30 implants for the fabrication of IRRPDs in the posterior-edentulous-sites. The IRRPDs were delivered to the patients by the same practitioner. After 5 -year-follow-ups-schedule, this prospective-clinical-study supported the use of IRRPDs in the posterior region when the patients cannot afford more implants insertion for the construction of ISFPs. Within the limitation of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. The survival rate of all 30 implants was 100 per cent. 2. No prosthetic complications were occurred during 5 -year-follow-ups-period. 3. IRRPDs treatment option should be encouraged {{to be used in the}} posterior-edentulous-sites as an alternative option to ISFPs. 4. IRRPDs can provide appropriate function, phonetics, and aesthetic...|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from these}} harnesses, {{there are also}} caving and {{canyoning}} harnesses, which all serve different purposes. For example, a caving harness is made of tough waterproof and unpadded material, with dual attachment points. Releasing the maillon from these <b>attachment</b> points <b>loosens</b> the harness quickly.|$|R
40|$|Epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) is a phenotypic shift wherein {{epithelial cells}} lose or <b>loosen</b> <b>attachments</b> {{to their neighbors}} and assume a mesenchymal-like morphology. EMT drives a variety of developmental processes, but may also be adopted by tumor cells during neoplastic progression. EMT is regulated by both biochemical and physical signals from the microenvironment, including mechanical stress, which is increasingly recognized {{to play a major}} role in development and disease progression. Biological systems generate, transmit and concentrate mechanical stress into spatial patterns; these gradients in mechanical stress may serve to spatially pattern developmental and pathologic EMTs. Here we review how epithelial tissues generate and respond to mechanical stress gradients, and highlight the mechanisms by which mechanical stress regulates and patterns EMT...|$|R
40|$|We use {{data from}} a 12 -month ethnographic study of two medical-surgical units in a U. S. {{hospital}} to examine how members from different occupations can collaborate {{with one another in}} their daily work despite differences in status, shared meanings, and expertise across occupational groups, which previous work has shown to create difficulties. In our study, nurses and patient care technicians (PCTs) on both hospital units faced these same occupational differences, served the same patient population, worked under the same management and organizational structure, and had the same pressures, goals, and organizational collaboration tools available to them. But nurses and PCTs on one unit successfully collaborated while those on the other did not. We demonstrate that a social structure characterized by cross-cutting demographics between occupational groups—in which occupational membership is uncorrelated with demographic group membership—can <b>loosen</b> <b>attachment</b> to the occupational identity and status order. This allows members of cross-occupational dyads, in our case nurses and PCTs, to draw on other shared social identities, such as shared race, age, or immigration status, in their interactions. Drawing on a shared social identity at the dyad level provided members with a “dyadic toolkit” of alternative, non-occupational expertise, shared meanings, status rules, and emotional scripts that facilitated collaboration across occupational differences and improved patient care...|$|R
50|$|Once {{bacterial}} plaque has infiltrated the pocket, {{the transformation}} from biofilm into calculus continues. This {{results in an}} ulceration in {{the lining of the}} tissue, which begins to break down the attachment of the gum to the tooth. Gingival <b>attachment</b> begins to <b>loosen</b> further as the bacterial plaque continues to invade the space created by the swelling it causes. This plaque eventually transforms into calculus, and the process continues, resulting in deposits under the gum, and an increase in pocket depth. As the depth of the vertical space between the tooth and the gum reaches 5mm, a change occurs. The bacterial morphology, or make up, of the biofilm changes from the gram positive aerobic bacteria found in biofilm located supragingivally, or above the gumline. Replacing these gram positive bacteria of the general oral flora are obligate anaerobic gram negative bacteria. These bacteria are far more destructive in nature than their aerobic cousins. The cell walls of gram negative bacteria contain endotoxins, which allow these organisms to destroy gingival tissue and bone much more quickly. Periodontitis officially begins when these bacteria begin to act, resulting in bone loss. This bone loss marks the transition of gingivitis to true periodontal disease. In other words, the term periodontal disease may be synonymous with bone loss.|$|R
