5|$|As of Jan 2013, Directorate General of Civil Aviation(DGCA), AAI and Ministry of Aviation, and the Government of India {{have not}} {{implemented}} {{the recommendations of}} the 812 crash inquiry committee. Work on runway lengthening has not started. 812 Foundation, a Mangalore-based trust, has filed the criminal charges for negligence against regulatory authorities and the airline. Regulatory authority and other organisations named in the petition <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> seeking anticipatory bail for their top officials, as the petition seeks non-bailable arrest warrants against those responsible.|$|E

When the interviewer asked if the upcoming new release will be put out on Metal Blade Records, Leaman said their deal with them was done and they <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> releasing it independently.|$|E
500|$|In September 2017, Matt Cameron told Billboard {{that he and}} {{the other}} {{surviving}} members of Soundgarden had yet {{to make a decision about}} the future of the band following Cornell's death. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I don't think we're ready to say anything other than ... Kim and Ben and I are certainly aware of how much our fans are hurting, and we're certainly hurting right there along with them. But we're extremely private people, and we're all still processing our grief in our own way and on our own time. But we definitely <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> our fans and love them very much." ...|$|E

500|$|Walker {{published}} another {{professional article}} in 1933, entitled [...] "Bombardment Aviation: Bulwark of National Defense". [...] "Whenever we speak {{in terms of}} 'air force' we <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> bombardment aviation," [...] he wrote, dismissing other forms of aviation. This was orthodox at the Air Corps Tactical School, which taught that [...] "every dollar which goes into the building of auxiliary aviation and special types, which types are not essential for the efficient functioning of the striking force can only occur {{at the expense of}} that air force's offensive power." [...] Walker's major thesis was that [...] "a determined air attack, once launched, is most difficult, if not impossible to stop when directed against land objectives." [...] At the conclusion of his article, he renewed his call for the creation of an independent air force [...] "as a force with a distinct mission, of importance co-equal to that of the Army and the Navy." [...] Walker's persistent advocacy of strategic bombing led to frequent clashes with Captain Claire Chennault, who led instruction in pursuit aviation at the Air Corps Tactical School from 1931 to 1936. [...] Chennault believed that the right mix of fighters and ground defenses could successfully defeat a bomber assault and ridiculed Walker for suggesting that bombers could not be stopped, leading to [...] "legendary" [...] debates between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes then {{enjoyed a}} rare {{overseas}} captaincy triumph, leading Australia to a 3–0 victory in a one day series against India. However {{there was no}} extended respite for the Australians; the West Indies returned to Australia for the 1984–85 season. The Australian team remained positive; Allan Border said, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> beating them, Laugh all you want." [...] Despite this attitude, the Australians lost the first Test by an innings and 112 runs. Hughes made only four runs in the first innings, out ...|$|E

60|$|Rescued {{from death}} in the Arctic wastes, and reunited to a {{beautiful}} wife, the lieutenant looked, nevertheless, unaccountably anxious and depressed. What could he <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of?</b> He <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Clara.|$|R
60|$|She {{started a}} little. Strange {{that he should}} <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> her by her surname instead of her Christian name; but it mattered little {{as long as he}} <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> her.|$|R

6000|$|But you {{stated that}} {{there was much more}} {{interest}} taken in the intellectual developments of the working classes in foreign countries than in England?--Yes; but I <b>was</b> not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland or <b>of</b> Zurich.
