2500|$|Chrysler, {{together}} with the Bendix Corporation, introduced a computerized, three-channel, four-sensor all-wheel ABS called [...] "Sure Brake" [...] for its 1971 Imperial. It was available for several years thereafter, functioned as intended, and proved reliable. In 1970, Ford added an <b>antilock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> called [...] "Sure-track" [...] to the rear wheels of Lincoln Continentals as an option; it became standard in 1971. In 1971, General Motors introduced the [...] "Trackmaster" [...] rear-wheel only ABS as an option on their rear-wheel drive Cadillac models and the Oldsmobile Toronado. In the same year, Nissan offered an EAL (Electro Anti-lock System) developed by Japanese company Denso as an option on the Nissan President, which became Japan's first electronic ABS.|$|E

2500|$|Donohue chronicled {{his entire}} racing {{career in the}} book, The Unfair Advantage (co-written with noted {{motorsports}} and engineering journalist Paul Van Valkenburgh). The book documents his career from his first races to his final full season of racing the year before he was killed. This was not merely a celebrity autobiography, but a detailed, step-by-step record of the engineering approach he took to getting the absolutely highest performance from every car he drove, always looking for that elusive [...] "unfair advantage". Donohue (along with Penske) were pioneers in many rights, some as notable {{as the use of}} a skidpad as a tool for developing and perfecting race car suspension designs and setups. The book told how Donohue learned to exploit the <b>antilock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> and the powerful turbocharged engine of several prototype Porsches, as well as how he learned from various mishaps, including a near-fatal crash. The book was published shortly before Donohue's death.|$|E

5000|$|Automotive tests {{itself to}} enhance safety and reliability. For example, most {{vehicles}} with <b>antilock</b> <b>brakes</b> test them once per safety interval. If the <b>antilock</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> has a broken wire or other fault, the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> reverts to operating {{as a normal}} <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> Most automotive engine controllers incorporate a [...] "limp mode" [...] for each sensor, so that the engine will continue to operate if the sensor or its wiring fails. Another, more trivial example of a limp mode is that some cars test door switches, and automatically turn lights on using seat-belt occupancy sensors if the door switches fail.|$|R
40|$|The <b>antilock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> are {{designed}} to increase wheel traction by preventing the wheels from locking up during braking, while also maintaining adequate vehicle steerability; however, the performance is often degraded under harsh road conditions.

The simulation was developed based on the material displacement, deformation and deep drawing force on flange in the radial direction, that it is controlled by blank holder with <b>antilock</b> <b>brake</b> mechanic <b>system.</b> The force to blank holder was applied periodically and the magnitude of force was kept constant during simulation process. In this study, the mechanical properties of the material were choses such that they equivalent to those of low carbon steel with its thickness of 0. 2 mm. The diameter and the depth of the cylindrical cup-shaped product were 40 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The simulation results showed that the application of <b>antilock</b> <b>brake</b> mechanic <b>system</b> improves the ability to control the material flow during the drawing process, although the maximum blank holder force of 13000 N was applied. The optimum condition was found when the drawing process was performed using blank holder force of 3500 N, deep drawing force of 7000 N, friction coefficient of 0. 25 and speed of punch stroke of 0. 84 mm/sec.
