5|$|Whether or not {{the summit}} is {{considered}} important for its content, the meeting held some symbolic importance. First of all, {{it was the first}} NATO summit between the leaders of the North-American and Western European states, and Eastern European states, states that were finally, after decades of Cold War tensions, together in the same alliance. The media attention that these new members received during the summit, opened public debates <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was still a consensus about the purpose, the perceived threats and the future borders of NATO among its 26 members. That this was not the case, became clear {{in the run-up to the}} 2006 Riga Summit. Secondly, the holding of the summit in Istanbul made it the most eastern summit in NATO's history. It marked the increasingly key role played by Turkey as a major strategic hub due to its location close to the hotbeds of tension and conflict in the South Caucasus and the Middle East. The location of the summit made clear that NATO’s security concerns had shifted towards the southeastern part of the European continent. By shifting eastwards, the Alliance’s centre of gravity ventured into very different areas from those on which the Cold War military NATO had focused.|$|E

The main {{problem was that}} most of the personnel who had the authority to order evacuation had been killed when the first explosion destroyed the control room. This was a consequence of the platform design, which did not include blast walls. Another contributing factor was that the nearby connected platforms Tartan and Claymore continued to pump gas and oil to Piper Alpha until its pipeline ruptured in the heat in the second explosion. Their operations crews did not believe they had authority to shut off production, even though they could see that Piper Alpha was burning.|$|E

500|$|In royal {{charters}} he {{is often}} given the title [...] "royal chancellor", as he is styled in a 1062 charter in Latin regis cancellarius, {{but this does not}} necessarily mean that there was an official office known as chancellor similar to the later Lord Chancellor's office. Regenbald was probably in charge of Edward's royal clerks and scribes, but his position in the witness lists argues against his holding an actual office, as he is not listed early in the witness lists along with the magnates. He probably performed some of the duties that later were done by the chancellor, but the first chancellor in England is usually held to be Herfast, who held office from around 1069. Some historians, including David Bates, hold that Regenbald was chancellor, however. Some support for that position is the fact that Domesday Book lists Regenbald as [...] "chancellor". The entire issue of whether Regenbald was a [...] "true" [...] chancellor or not is bound up in the debate amongst medievalists <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was a recognisable chancery in England prior to the Norman Conquest. One school of thought, led by Pierre Chaplais, argues that no such office existed prior to the Conquest. Another group argues that there was, and among this group is the historian Simon Keynes. In Regenbald's case, a number of the documents that give him the title [...] "chancellor" [...] are either forgeries or have been altered in the copying process. Others, however, are not easily shown to be spurious.|$|E

Lean thinking has penetrated many industries.
