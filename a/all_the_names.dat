5|$|At {{this time}} in the United States, McCarthyism was at its height, {{generating}} fear and suspicion of entertainment industry figures, academics, military figures, and government officials by accusing them of real or suggested links to communist activities. The TSO was required to submit to United States immigration authorities <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of its musicians and other staff who would be accompanying the tour. The immigration department approved visas for all but seven musicians, suspecting them of communist activities. One of the musicians was later cleared, leaving six musicians who were denied entry.|$|E
5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ruth Brandon in {{an article}} for the New Scientist noted that William Huggins, Serjeant Cox, Crooke's wife and daughter, his {{laboratory}} assistant, and a Mrs Humphrey were all present during the Crookes experiments with Home. However, Barry Wiley has written that when Crookes published his report on the experiments in the Quarterly Journal of Science in 1871 {{he did not mention}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of the observers present in the room. Wiley has stated that four females were present during the experiments as was Crookes' brother and the original report by Crookes did not refer to any spirits but many years later in 1889 he revealed in his Notes of séances with D. D. Home the names of the observers and claimed Home was in communication with spirits.|$|E

5|$|Reginald Blomfield's Menin Gate was {{the first}} {{memorial}} to the missing located in Europe to be completed, and was unveiled on 24 July 1927. The Menin Gate (Menenpoort) {{was found to have}} insufficient space to contain <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker's Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing. Other memorials followed: the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet; the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme and the Arras Memorial designed by Edwin Lutyens; and the Basra Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. The Dominions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing: the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial for the forces of India, the Vimy Memorial by Canada, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial by Australia, the Delville Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont-Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland. The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Thiepval Memorial in 1932, though the Vimy Memorial would not be finished until 1936, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, partly because it mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) of the Tribal Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a miscellany of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions and spelling variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish a date for the original compilation. The Tribal Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in the list and the way in which the tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that the Tribal Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E

25|$|As H.J.

25|$|In {{early works}} Tolkien {{stated that the}} names of the {{prominent}} Easterlings were given to them by the Elves, and are thus from Sindarin language. The meanings proposed for the names as they were then are: Bór 'faithful vassal', Borthandos 'faithful intelligent (one)', Borlas 'faithful joy', Boromir 'faithful jewel'; Ulfang 'hideous beard', Uldor 'hideous ruler', Ulfast 'hideous shaggy hair' and Ulwarth 'hideous betrayer'. Later, however, Tolkien changed both the names and conception, assuming that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of the Easterlings are uninterpretable in languages of Eldar or Edain (this was true of Brodda even in early texts).|$|E

25|$|The Pauline epistles make no {{reference}} to Jesus' father; nor does the Gospel of Mark. The first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke. Each contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from king David, but through different sons; Matthew follows the major royal line from Solomon, while Luke traces another line back to Nathan, another son of David and Bathsheba. Consequently, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> between David and Joseph are different. Some scholars, such as Harry A. Ironside reconcile the genealogies by viewing the Solomonic lineage in Matthew as Joseph's major royal line, and the Nathanic lineage in Luke to be Mary's minor line.|$|E
25|$|To {{write the}} book, {{in his spare}} time, he {{collected}} {{a lot of information}} on Canton Hospital, scouring newspapers, books, journals published by the hospital, and annual reports written by the Canton Medical Missionary Society. He looked at every single report, which included <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of those employed at the hospital, names of all the patients, what diseases they had, what surgeries took place, income and expense sheets, donations to the hospital, and more. In both China and the USA, he searched for and interviewed previous staff of the hospital and graduates of the University Medical School. Part of the inspiration for writing the book came from his idol William Osler, who was both an internist and writer.|$|E
25|$|A manga {{spin-off}} of {{the series}} supervised by Kazuki Takahashi and {{written and illustrated by}} Naoyuki Kageyama began serialization in V-Jump on December 17, 2005. The chapters have been collected and published in nine tankōbon volumes by Shueisha starting on November 2, 2006. The manga is licensed for English language release by Viz Media, which serialized the first 37 chapters in its Shonen Jump manga anthology. The remaining chapters were published straight to graphic novel, beginning with volume 5. The plot of the manga is completely different from the anime and is more of a continuation to the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series with Shadow Games and the Millennium Items playing a major role within the story. There are also new monsters and changes to some of the characters' personalities. Unlike the original Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> used in the English version of the manga are taken from the dubbed anime. A one-shot of the GX manga was released on June 21, 2014 in the August issue of V-Jump. The one-shot was written and illustrated by Naoyuki Kageyama. An English version of this chapter was released on December 29, 2014 by Weekly Shonen Jump.|$|E
