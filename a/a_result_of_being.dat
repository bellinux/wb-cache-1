5|$|A Windows {{compatible}} Kinect 2.0 {{was released}} on July 15, 2014. Kinect 2.0 was released as a standalone and optional item in October 2014; it is bundled with a digital copy of Dance Central Spotlight. The Kinect {{was the source of}} controversy due to the huge price of the system as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> bundled with the system. It was removed from the Xbox One bundle in May 2014 and production stopped entirely on October 25, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of a protein {{very similar to that}} used in insect silk. It is initially a liquid, and hardens not by exposure to air but as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> drawn out, which changes the internal structure of the protein. It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as chitin, collagen and cellulose, but is much more elastic. In other words, it can stretch much further before breaking or losing shape.|$|E

5|$|The Panthers' all-time goaltender {{records are}} {{primarily}} held by two players. Roberto Luongo holds the franchise regular-season records for games played, wins, losses, ties, and shutouts. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the starting goaltender for the 1996 Stanley Cup run and the 1997 playoffs, John Vanbiesbrouck holds {{all of the}} Panthers playoff records, most by a wide margin.|$|E
5|$|With {{the villages}} co-ordinates at N 50.60223 W 1.29967, its climate is warm, with a sea breeze {{coming in from}} the coast. It {{benefits}} from Ventnor's micro-climate as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in a sheltered location on the cliff of the island's south coast. This offers the village more sunny days than much of the British Isles, and fewer frosts.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Evans {{returned}} to Arizona and resumed his studies. In 1985, he represented Australia at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan. The following year, {{he attempted to}} qualify for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh after only ten days training. He made the qualifying time, but was omitted. Evans later stated that he felt his admission of having only trained for ten days had lowered his standing {{in the eyes of the}} selectors. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> overlooked, Evans retired from competitive swimming.|$|E

5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> bred for {{the long}} chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They {{can be difficult to}} recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|Due to Alex {{committing}} treason {{by releasing}} classified U.S intelligence {{to the public}} at the Constitutional Convention, she is branded as a fugitive of the United States. Sitting together in a car, Owen mentions to Alex that she needs to maintain her cover so as to evade capture from domestic and international law enforcement agencies as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> issued an Interpol Red Notice for her arrest. Along with Ryan, she leaves the country on a plane to an unknown international destination.|$|E

50|$|A {{reduction}} in the number of hostel (shelter) bed-spaces in London as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> hostels <b>being</b> up-graded from dormitory accommodation into single room accommodation, leading to higher quality hostels but with fewer bed-spaces.|$|R
5|$|MEPs in Parliament are {{organised}} into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty non-attached members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S). These two groups {{have dominated the}} Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence {{have more in common}} with parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|Most E. coli strains do {{not cause}} disease, but virulent strains can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, {{neonatal}} meningitis, hemorrhagic colitis, and Crohn's disease. Common {{signs and symptoms}} include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, vomiting, and sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for bowel necrosis (tissue death) and perforation without progressing to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicemia, and Gram-negative pneumonia. Very young children {{are more susceptible to}} develop severe illness, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, however, healthy individuals of all ages are at risk to the severe consequences that may arise as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> infected with E. coli.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> built {{on the site of}} the former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E

5|$|The game's story (narrated by Peter Jason) {{follows the}} {{exploits}} of a wanted outlaw named Jericho Cross and his employment in an ancient vampire-hunting order known as the Darkwatch (hence the game's title). After unwittingly releasing the Darkwatch's greatest enemy, a vampire lord named Lazarus Malkoth, Jericho is conscripted into the Darkwatch as an elite operative. Jericho, however, is slowly turning into a vampire himself, as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> bitten by Lazarus. The game outlines either Jericho's struggle for humanity or his descent into darkness, depending on the player's actions.|$|E
5|$|Three-year-old Pauli Murray {{was sent}} to Durham, North Carolina, {{to live with her}} mother's family. There, her {{maternal}} aunts, Sarah (Sallie) Fitzgerald and Pauline Fitzgerald Dame (both teachers), as well as her maternal grandparents, Robert and Cornelia (Smith) Fitzgerald, raised her. She attended St. Titus Episcopal Church with her mother's family, as had her mother before Murray was born. In 1923, her father, who had been committed to the Hospital for the Negro Insane of Maryland, died as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> beaten by a white guard. Murray had wanted to rescue him when she reached legal age, but was just 13 when he died.|$|E
5|$|A silver boom {{occurred}} in England after {{the discovery of}} silver near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland – up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe. The result was a local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th-century royal finances. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting alluvial deposits and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments. Tin formed a valuable export good, initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for silver, with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, {{as well as in}} Devon. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> subsidised by silver production.|$|E

5|$|He {{was handed}} a two-match {{suspension}} after receiving his 10th yellow card {{of the season}} during a 1–0 home victory over Newport County in an FA Trophy second round replay on 26 January 2010. He returned in a 1–0 away win over Kettering on 6 February 2010, before being handed a three-match suspension as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sent off during a 1–0 away defeat to Ebbsfleet a week later after his elbow caught Dean Pooley. This resulted in a head wound that required three stitches for Pooley, and York's directors and manager apologised to Ebbsfleet manager Liam Daish for the tackle. Following Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference in March 2010, the three goals Brodie scored against them were discounted as their results were expunged. He scored {{for the first time}} in 12 matches with two goals in a 4–0 victory away to Grays on 30 March 2010. He scored two goals against Barrow on 13 April 2010 in a 3–0 home victory, a result that confirmed York's place in the play-offs.|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E
5|$|With {{the journal}} debugged, Data-Riku uncovers extra data that {{contains}} the secret to the journal's message. Mickey guides the reset Data-Sora to the extra world where he is tested by a virtual Roxas to endure the pain of having forgotten his friends as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> reset. Data-Sora defeats Data-Roxas and is allowed access to the deepest portion of Castle Oblivion. There he and Mickey encounter a virtual Naminé, who reveals the real Naminé {{as the one who}} left the message after discovering a set of memories relating to the people tied to the real Sora's heart—Roxas, Axel, Xion, Terra, Aqua, and Ventus—while restoring his lost memories; the bugs are also revealed to have been an unintentional side effect of her message. Before disappearing, Data-Naminé explains that it is the real Sora's duty to save these people. Mickey relays this message to Sora through the bottled letter shown at the end of Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E
