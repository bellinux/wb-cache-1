40|$|Mesna, {{the sodium}} salt of 2 -mercaptoethanesulphonic acid (MES), is a uroprotective agent used to prevent oxazaphosphorine-induced {{haemorrhagic}} cystitis during cancer chemotherapy. Oral administration of mesna is frequently associated with nausea and vomiting secondary to its unpleasant taste. <b>Argimesna,</b> a newly synthesised salt of MES in which sodium is replaced by arginine, has not been associated with similar adverse effects. In this study, the urinary excretion of the two salts of MES was compared after oral administration of either mesna 800 mg or <b>argimesna</b> 1800 mg (equivalent to 920 mg of mesna). The 2 drugs exhibited almost identical urinary excretion patterns. Percentage recoveries 12 hours after drug administration were 14. 8 and 13. 2 % of the dose for mesna and <b>argimesna,</b> respectively. Maximum urinary concentrations of free thiols were observed with both drugs during the 0 - to 4 -hour urine collection, and were 3. 9 mmol/L for mesna and 3. 3 mmol/L for <b>argimesna.</b> Since 0. 61 mmol/L is considered the minimum free thiol concentration required to confer uroprotection, it is concluded that <b>argimesna</b> ensures a uroprotective activity equivalent to that of mesna and may be advantageously substituted for mesna in oral therapeutic regimens...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Tolerability and {{efficacy}} of the new uroprotective agent <b>ARGIMESNA</b> was assessed within a randomized cross-over study comparing it to sodiummercaptoethanesul-fonate (MESNA), in patients treated with IFO. MESNA i. v., 20 % of IFO dose, was given to all patients before chemo-therapy; 4 h later, at random, they received <b>ARGIMESNA</b> p. o., 20 % of IFO dose every 2 h x 4, or MESNA p. o., 40 % of IFO dose every 4 h x 2. Overall, 78 cycles of oral uroprotec-tion were administered: 37 for <b>ARGIMESNA</b> capsules; 41 for MESNA vials p. o. <b>ARGIMESNA</b> was subjectively better tolerated, determining gastro-intestinal discomfort in only 12 out of 37 cycles versus 34 / 41 of MESNA p. o. (p < 0. 001). Both preparations were equivalent for subjective and objec-tive efficacy since no cycles were complicated by urinary symptoms (dysuria, stranguria, or hematuria). Nevertheless, 2 patients (7. 7 %) refused further oral assumption of both uroprotectors, whereas MESNA i. v. was added in other 7 patients because of nausea and vomiting caused by chemo-therapy. In conclusion, this new oral preparation of mer-captoethanesulfonate {{turned out to be}} well tolerated, safe and active in the prevention of haemorrhagic cystitis from IFO...|$|E
