500|$|As the Fringe {{division}} {{sets out}} to Roland's home, Roland injects Amanda's body {{with more of the}} serum, and she is brought back to life. By the time Fringe arrives, Roland gives himself up willingly, and they find Amanda dead again. Roland explains that though she was alive, when he looked into her eyes, he realized she wasn't the same person and thus terminated the process. As Roland and Amanda's body are taken away, Olivia breaks down in front of Peter; she questions that if Roland could tell that Amanda wasn't the same person by looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> why couldn't Peter do the same with Fauxlivia? Peter is unable to answer her, and a distressed Olivia leaves on her own. As Walter takes Peter to get a milkshake, the two are identified by an Observer, who reports on his phone that [...] "he is still alive".|$|E
60|$|The Princess dabbed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> with {{a little}} morsel of lace handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|The old {{cattleman}} stood mute before her, {{staring at}} her white face, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> of flame.|$|E
60|$|Hetty smiled faintly {{and put her}} arm within his. Adam {{looked down}} <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> but <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were turned dreamily towards another corner of the garden.|$|R
60|$|He bent towards <b>her.</b> She smiled <b>at</b> him. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were dancing.|$|R
60|$|Soft {{though her}} voice was, there was passion quivering in every sentence. When I {{turned to look}} <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and face seemed aflame with it. The color had {{streamed}} into her cheeks, she had drifted into my arms, and her clinging lips yielded unresistingly to mine.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed her}} eyes tightly. Gavin was in a quandary. I suppose he had looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> too long to know much about them.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Marygold {{slowly and}} disconsolately opened the door, and showed herself with her apron <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> still sobbing {{as if her}} heart would break.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is {{as full of}} {{mischief}} as tho' she had ten. Look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> Lady De Courcy. Did you ever see such eyes in a decent woman's head?" ...|$|E
60|$|Nehushta looked <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were wild, but she {{was still}} young and healthy, a Syrian peasant.|$|R
60|$|Fritz stared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with <b>eyes</b> that bulged {{behind his}} spectacles.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked down}} <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were dark and soft and unfolded, with a {{stricken}} look that roused him.|$|R
60|$|Page. Some twelve {{gentlemen of}} us, Sir--apostles {{of the blind}} archer, Love--owning no divinity but almighty beauty--no faith, no hope, no charity, but those which are kindled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|An old beggar, who {{had been}} {{watching}} her, came gently from behind. [...] "Gracious lady!" [...] he said, peering <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] "this is the lucky day for you. I have lost my luck." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} eyes aside, {{and looked at}} her hands as she washed the forks. They trembled slightly. Then he looked back <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again, that were {{watching}} him large and wistful and a little accusing.|$|E
60|$|The sprightly Dedlock is reputed, in that grass-grown {{city of the}} ancients, Bath, to be {{stimulated by}} an urgent curiosity which impels her on all {{convenient}} and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with a golden glass <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> peering into objects of every description. Certain it is that she avails herself of the present opportunity of hovering over her kinsman's letters and papers like a bird, taking a short peck at this document and a blink with her head on one side at that document, and hopping about from table to table with <b>her</b> glass <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> in an inquisitive and restless manner. In the course of these researches she stumbles over something, and turning her glass in that direction, sees her kinsman {{lying on the ground}} like a felled tree.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> him, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> expressionless {{and full}} of darkness. He could see no answer.|$|R
60|$|Dorothy {{sat down}} on an old stump and looked <b>at</b> them, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{twinkling}} with amusement.|$|R
60|$|She drew {{a sigh of}} content. She {{raised his}} hand to her lips. Then she dabbed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> with the few inches of perfumed lace which she called a handkerchief. It was passing, that evil moment.|$|E
60|$|Kitty {{answered}} not a word, but rose sobbing, {{with the}} end of her simple head-dress <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Captain Jorgan followed the lovers out, quite sheepishly, pausing in the shop to give an instruction to Mr. Pettifer.|$|E
60|$|The priest looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and then}} at the hawk's eyes. They were disagreeably like each other. He told his errand as courteously as he could, for he was not a bad-hearted man for a Norman priest.|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced up}} <b>at</b> him, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{abruptly}} and slightly moist, half with hurt, half with anger.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> him, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> soft with laughter. Somehow his {{confession}} {{seemed to have}} delighted her.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> me, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{round with}} inquiry, and {{a faint smile}} of {{uncertainty}} on her lips.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Fisker {{came to me}} with tidings from San Francisco which I had {{not heard}} before, and has offered to take me back with him.' Mrs Pipkin's apron was {{immediately}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> 'I must go some day, you knew.' ...|$|E
60|$|Adam {{looked at}} her. It was so sweet to look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> which had now a self-forgetful {{questioning}} in them--for {{a moment he}} forgot {{that he wanted to}} say anything, or that it was necessary to tell her what he meant.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her, at the black sweep of her hair under the white band, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> like jet; and {{suddenly}} realized, with a gladness new and strange to him, that he liked to look at her, that she was beautiful.|$|E
60|$|She {{was looking}} <b>at</b> me, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> shining. All the weariness {{seemed to have}} gone out of them.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{new phase}} {{of the man who}} unconsciously had grown so {{dominant}} in her life. She felt the pull <b>at</b> <b>her</b> heartstrings. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were soft with unshed tears as her arm stole through his.|$|R
60|$|She sat up {{and looked}} <b>at</b> him. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> began to shine, and the colour came into her cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Tulliver {{burst out}} crying afresh, and she sobbed with her {{handkerchief}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> a few moments, but then removing it, {{she said in}} a deprecating way, still half sobbing, as if she were called upon to speak before she could command her voice,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this moment}} Catherine Seyton entered alone, {{contrary}} to her custom; and not less contrary to her custom, she entered with her kerchief <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Roland Graeme approached her with beating heart and with down-cast eyes, and asked her, {{in a low}} and hesitating voice, whether the Queen were well? ...|$|E
6000|$|Deborah Debbitch, {{summoned by}} her master, now made her appearance, with her {{handkerchief}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and {{an appearance of}} great mental trouble. [...] "It was not my fault, Major Bridgenorth," [...] she said; [...] "how could I help it? like will to like--the boy would come--the girl would see him." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the same}} about {{attending}} church. Her parents went to one service on Sundays; she insisted on going to all three, and would sit and stand and kneel, book in hand, as if taking a part in it all, but always when you looked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> would meet yours and the sweet smile would come to her lips.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} head and looked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> his <b>eyes</b> dim with tears, his lips quivering.|$|R
60|$|Corey said he {{was sure}} of that, and looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with <b>eyes</b> of patient tenderness.|$|R
