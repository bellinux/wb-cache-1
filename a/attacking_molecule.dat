50|$|The {{function}} of Ca2+ {{in the active}} site of BamHI is known. It is an inhibitor of DNA cleavage, converting BamHI into the pre-reactive state. This revealed the water molecular is the <b>attacking</b> <b>molecule.</b> It donates a proton to the leaving group that is bounded to Ca2+ forming a 90o O-P-O bond angles. If Glu 113 is replaced by lysine, the cleavage is lost since Glu 113 accepts the proton from the attacking water molecule.|$|E
50|$|BamHI, type II {{restriction}} endonucleases, {{often requires}} divalent metals as cofactors to catalyze DNA cleavage. Two-metal ion mechanism {{is one of}} the possible catalytic mechanisms of BamHI since the BamHI crystal structure has the ability to bind two metal ions at the active site, which is suitable for the classical two-metal ion mechanism to proceed. Two-metal ion mechanism is the use of two metal ions to catalyze the cleavage reaction of restriction enzyme. BamHI has three critical active site residues that are important for metal catalyst. They are known as Asp94, Glu111 and Glu113. These residues are usually acidic. In the presence of a metal ion, the residues are pointed toward the metal ion. In the absence of metal ions, the residues are pointed outward. The two metal ions (A and B) are 4.1 apart from each other in the active site and are in-line with these residues. In general, when the two metal ions (A and B) are bonded to the active site, they help stabilize a cluster distribution of negative charges localized at the active site created by the leaving of an oxygen atom during the transition state. First, a water molecule will be activated by metal ion A at the active site. This water molecule will act as the <b>attacking</b> <b>molecule</b> attacking the BamHI-DNA complex and thus making the complex negative. Later, another water will bound to metal ion B and donate a proton to the leaving group of complex, stabilizing the build-up of negative charge on the leaving oxygen atom.|$|E

Some results relevant to practical engineering application in Diesel engines, obtained previously, are summarised. Assuming that the droplets are so small that their interaction with individual molecules can be described using the methods of the kinetic gas theory (they {{can be considered as}} clusters/nanodrops), it was shown that the evaporation rate depends on partial pressures, temperature, and the sizes and masses of molecules and clusters/nanodrops. The results of the analysis of the collision processes between ndodecane (approximation of Diesel fuel) molecules and clusters/nanodrops, based on the dynamic reaction coordinate (DRC) method, are described. It is concluded that the probability of the <b>attacking</b> <b>molecule</b> sticking to a droplet is maximal if the molecular plane is parallel or almost parallel to the droplet surface. If the kinetic energy of the attacking molecules is high (greater than that corresponding to the boiling temperature) then it is expected that it will scatter and be removed from the cluster/nanodrop surface...|$|E

50|$|The {{picture to}} the right shows the active site of ADPRase in complex with AMPCPR and Mg2+. AMPCPR is a nonhydrolyzable analog of ADP-ribose, and thus {{functions}} as an inhibitor of ADPRase. The picture below reveals {{the first and second}} Mg2+ ions, which serve to coordinate the <b>attacking</b> water <b>molecule</b> so that it is perfectly in line with the scissile bond (O-P-O bond is 177 degrees) and poised for attack. A glutamate side chain (E162) will deprotonate the water molecule, and then the hydroxide ion will attack nucleophilically. This occurs when the water molecule is 3.0 angstroms away from the phosphorus <b>molecule</b> it is <b>attacking.</b> By using H2O18, it has been found that the water <b>molecule</b> <b>attacks</b> the adenosyl phosphate.

Chronic allograft nephropathy is a relentlessly progressive process {{and a major}} cause of long-term graft dysfunction and ultimate failure. Interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerular and vascular lesions characterize this mechanistically unresolved disorder. Given the prominent role of TGF-β 1 in tissue repair and in fibrosis, we have explored the hypothesis that fibrosis and chronic allograft nephropathy would be distinguished by intragraft TGF-β 1 mRNA expression. This postulate was tested by mRNA phenotyping of RNA isolated from 127 human renal allograft biopsies. Reverse transcription assisted polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify and identify ingraft gene expression. Our investigation demonstrated a significant correlation between intra graft TGF-β 1 mRNA display and renal allograft interstitial fibrosis and chronic allograft nephropathy. In contrast, intragraft expression of mRNA encoding immunoregulatory cytokines, IL- 2, IFN-γ, IL- 4, IL- 10, or cytotoxic <b>attack</b> <b>molecules,</b> granzyme B and perforin was not a correlate of interstitial fibrosis or chronic allograft nephropathy.

Following this, alkenes such as acrylonitrile inserts into the Pt-P bond and then reductively eliminate to afford the hydrophosphinated acrylonitrile. Interestingly, this P-C bond forming step was found to occur through an outer-sphere, Michael-type addition because telomerization was occurring.

40|$|Acyl {{transfer}} {{is a key}} reaction in biosynthesis, including synthesis of antibiotics and polyesters. Although researchers have long recognized the similar protein fold and catalytic machinery in acyltransferases and hydrolases, the molecular basis for the different reactivity has been a long-standing mystery. By comparison of X-ray structures, we identified a different oxyanion-loop orientation in the active site. In esterases/lipases a carbonyl oxygen points toward the active site, whereas in acyltransferases a NH of the main-chain amide points toward the active site. Amino acid sequence comparisons alone cannot identify such {{a difference in the}} main-chain orientation. To identify how this difference might change the reaction mechanism, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of Pseudomonas fluorescens esterase containing a sulfonate transition-state analogue bound to the active-site serine. This structure mimics the transition state for the attack of water on the acyl-enzyme and shows a bridging water molecule between the carbonyl oxygen mentioned above and the sulfonyl oxygen that mimics the attacking water. A possible mechanistic role for this bridging water molecule is to position and activate the <b>attacking</b> water <b>molecule</b> in hydrolases, but to deactivate the <b>attacking</b> water <b>molecule</b> in acyl transferases. All in the loop: A structure comparison of hydrolases and acyl transferases revealed a different conformation of the main chain in the oxyanion loop. Hydrolases point a C=O, whereas acytransferase point a NH, toward the active site. An X-ray structure of a hydrolase containing a sulfonate transition-state analogue show how this loop interacts with the attacking water. 9 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Homing endonucleases are {{distinguished}} by {{their ability to}} catalyze the cleavage of double-stranded DNA with extremely high specificity. I-PpoI endonuclease, a homing endonuclease from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, is a small enzyme (2 20 kDa) of known three-dimensional structure that catalyzes the cleavage of a long target DNA sequence (15 base pairs). Here, a detailed chemical mechanism for catalysis of DNA cleavage by I-PpoI endonuclease is proposed and tested by creating six variants in which active-site residues are replaced with alanine. The side chains of three residues (Arg 61, His 98, and Asn 119) {{are found to be}} important for efficient catalysis of DNA cleavage. This finding is consistent with the proposed mechanism in which His 98 abstracts a proton from an <b>attacking</b> water <b>molecule</b> bound by an adjacent phosphoryl oxygen, Arg 61 and Asn 119 stabilize the pentavalent transition state, and Asn 119 also binds to the essential divalent metal cation (e. g., Mg 2 + ion), which interacts with the 3 ′-oxygen leaving group. Because Mg 2 + is required for cleavage of a substrate with a good leaving group (p-nitrophenolate), Mg 2 + likely stabilizes the pentavalent transition state. The pH-dependence of kcat for catalysis by I-PpoI reveals a macroscopic pKa of 8. 4 for titratable groups that modulate product release. I-PpoI appears to be unique among known restriction endonucleases and homing endonucleases in its use of a histidine residue to activate the <b>attacking</b> water <b>molecule</b> for in-line displacement of the 3 ′-leavin...|$|R
