5|$|Chapter 10 states {{meditation}} practice perfects one's {{ability to}} concentrate, wherein the object one concentrates on becomes {{the one of}} attachment, of oneness and one feels one's identity with it. Verses 10.6–15 suggest that one must concentrate on self as the supreme self, oneness with Brahman in everything, and this process of attachment of one's individual self to the supreme self leads to oneness <b>and</b> <b>liberation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Samuel {{states that}} Tantrism is a contested concept.

5|$|Nazi {{occupation}} {{ended on}} 30 August 1944 <b>and</b> <b>Liberation</b> slowly healed the town's wounds. It {{had been a}} catastrophe for the network: of the 76 trams in circulation in 1939, 24 had been destroyed and 25 damaged; track and overhead lines had been mutilated; the Trianon depot had been bombed several times Still, service was slowly restored, thanks to the staff's hard work and above all passengers' help in shunting trailing cars. In 1945, 38 locomotives and 14 trailing cars were operational, but, despite restoration of service across the Seine on 20 April 1946, the war had struck a fatal blow. Rouen was full of out-of-date equipment and so trams were progressively replaced by buses and trolleybuses.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the words}} {{exchanged}} by {{the bride and}} groom (including the speaking of the name of Eru Ilúvatar) and the consummation are required for marriage. More formally, the couple's families celebrate the marriage with a feast. The parties give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían having left Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs <b>and</b> <b>liberation</b> by her sons).|$|E
5|$|Operation Tonga {{originated}} in the planning of Operation Overlord, the Allied plan for the eventual invasion <b>and</b> <b>liberation</b> of German-occupied France. Invasion planning begun in May 1943, when President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met during the Washington Conference. The two Allied leaders decided that all available Allied forces should be concentrated in the United Kingdom, and that planning for the invasion of North-Western Europe should begin. A provisional target date of May 1944 was set with the code-name 'Overlord' decided upon. A joint Anglo-American planning staff was created under Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan, who was given the title of Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC).|$|E

5|$|The Annamalaiyar temple {{is one of}} the Pancha Bhoota Stalams, or five Shiva temples, {{with each}} a manifestation of a natural element: land, water, air, sky and fire. In Annamalaiyar temple, Shiva is said to have {{manifested}} himself as a massive column of fire, whose crown and feet could not be found by the Hindu gods, Brahma and Vishnu.

5|$|This is {{the point}} at which {{explicit}} constitutional authority for the creation of federal crimes runs out. But the statute went on to define additional crimes: theft or falsification of court records, perjury, bribery of federal judges, interference with judicial process, <b>and</b> <b>liberation</b> of federal prisoners. All of these were plainly necessary and proper to the operation of the federal courts; Marshall was to cite the perjury section as precedent for the existence of implicit powers in M'Culloch v. Maryland.|$|E
5|$|ZANU-PF won a {{landslide}} victory, with 61% {{of the presidential}} vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views {{out of fear of}} reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, <b>and</b> <b>liberation,</b> while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} Malta {{returned}} {{control of the}} central Mediterranean to Britain and was {{an important step in}} the invasion <b>and</b> <b>liberation</b> of Egypt from French rule in 1801. An essential condition of the Treaty of Amiens in the same year, which brought an end to the French Revolutionary War, was that the British leave Malta. Russian Tsar Alexander I had a long standing claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it be turned over to Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger flatly refused, and the Napoleonic Wars with France began soon afterwards, in part due to the failure of Britain to comply with this clause of the treaty. The island subsequently remained in British hands until its independence in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Voroshilov {{began her}} postwar {{modernization}} in April 1954, but encountered {{the same issues}} as Maxim Gorky.

The conversion process was quite prolonged, as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts; {{and she was not}} recommissioned as OS-24 until 31 December 1961. She was modernized under Project 33M from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965. Converted to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972, she was briefly redesignated as PKZ-19 before being sold for scrap on 2 March 1973.

5|$|Voroshilov was {{inspected}} in 1946 {{and found}} unsatisfactory, {{but she was}} given routine servicing. She began her postwar modernization in April 1954, but the Navy reevaluated {{the scope of the}} work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship. Unlike her half-sister , she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as Project 33 on 17 February 1956. The conversion process was prolonged, as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts. She consequently was not recommissioned as OS-24 until 31 December 1961. The ship was modernized under Project 33M from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965. Her final conversion was to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972 and she was redesignated as PKZ-19.

5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation <b>and</b> <b>liberation</b> (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E
