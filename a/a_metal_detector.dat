5|$|The {{discovery}} of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence, with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually. For example, in 2006 eight bodies of Canadian {{soldiers from the}} 78th Battalion (Winnipeg Grenadiers), CEF were discovered in a backyard in Hallu, France. In April 2013, the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> in 2009 were re-interred at H.A.C. Cemetery near Arras, France. In March 2014, the remains of 20Commonwealth and 30German soldiers were discovered in Vendin-le-Vieil, France, with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at Loos British Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The gun gallery was {{situated}} in the Recreation Yard and mounted {{on one of the}} dining hall's exterior walls. There was <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> outside of the dining hall for security purposes. The dining hall had tear-gas canisters attached to the rafters of the ceiling which could be activated by remote control, should prisoners riot or attempt to escape. The first warden, James A. Johnston, always entered the dining hall alone and unarmed, due to heavy guarding around him. Several riots did break out in the dining hall during Alcatraz's history. Those prisoners who were not involved in the fighting hid under the dining hall tables to escape possible gunfire.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Bart and Lisa {{stay at the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, {{and they}} {{discover}} <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen {{it turns out to}} be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it but one of the spectators, The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include this happy ending to the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E
50|$|Magnetometers {{can be used}} as metal detectors: {{they can}} detect only {{magnetic}} (ferrous) metals, but can detect such <b>metals</b> at <b>a</b> much larger depth than conventional metal detectors; they are capable of detecting large objects, such as cars, at tens of metres, while <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector's</b> range is rarely more than 2 metres.|$|R

5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E

50|$|The {{legislation}} to protect historic battlefields is relatively recent, and arose following several key incidents involving important sites e.g. the discovery in 1997 of an unprotected mass grave of soldiers who fought at the 1461 Battle of Towton and <b>a</b> large <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> rally {{held on the}} battlefield of Marston Moor in 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Security checks: Full body or {{hand-held}} <b>metal</b> <b>detectors,</b> such {{as those}} used at airport security controls, do not usually affect {{the function of the}} CCM device. However, where such detectors are used there are often signs warning people with cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, and CCM patients are therefore advised to present their device ID. In these cases, the security check will typically continue with the use of <b>a</b> hand-held <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> or by physical inspection.|$|R
25|$|On January 11, 2002, Foss, then 86, was in {{the news}} when he was {{detained}} by security at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

A search necessitated by his pacemaker precluding <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> screening had led {{to the discovery of}} the star-shaped Medal of Honor, along with a clearly marked dummy-bullet keychain, a second replica bullet and a small nail file (with MOH insignia).|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{creating}} an improvised firearm {{for personal use}} does not require licensure, registration, a background check, or the stamping of a serial number, but must be detectable by <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> per federal law. Though California passed a law in 2016 that requires anyone planning to build a homemade gun to obtain a serial number from the state (de facto registration) and pass a background check. However, such firearms are often illegal in other jurisdictions and are commonly associated with gangs, where they {{may be used to}} facilitate violent crime, such as homicide. In other cases, they may be used for other criminal activities not necessarily related to violent crime, such as illegal hunting of game.|$|E
25|$|The Middleham Hoard is a coin hoard {{found near}} Middleham, North Yorkshire in England. It {{dates from the}} period of the English Civil War, and {{consists}} of 5,099 coins, all silver. It is the largest hoard of coins buried during the Civil War to have been discovered. The hoard was discovered in June 1993 by William Caygill while using <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector.</b> Though referred to as one hoard, the coins were buried in three pots in two pits. These had slightly different deposition dates; likely in the later 1640s, though the person making the deposits was probably the same. The coins are dispersed between museums and private collections, 54 of them now in the Yorkshire Museum's numismatic collection.|$|E
5000|$|Court Security Officers are {{responsible}} for the security in both Baltimore City Circuit Court buildings (Mitchell and Courthouse East on Battle Monument Square) and the Juvenile Justice Center (on North Gay Street). They provide security to the judges, employees, citizens and prisoners entering the courthouses. The primary duty of the security officer assigned to court is the safety of the judge. Should an incident occur, the officer is to get the judge to safety and then respond to the disturbance. They also maintain order and decorum in the courtrooms and hallways. Each courthouse is equipped with <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> to scan all visitors for weapons and the buildings are regularly patrolled by K9 dogs and officers.|$|R

5000|$|Metal Detector: The {{detectability}} of a BCB {{is subject}} to the sensitivity of the <b>detector</b> and <b>metal</b> content of the BCB. High sensitivity leads to high false alarm rates, making detection problematic.

The level of inconvenience experienced by passengers is low-to-medium.|$|R
25|$|Bell is also {{credited}} with developing {{one of the}} early versions of <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President James Garfield. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.|$|E
25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector,</b> and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch Mine Kafon project, led by {{designer}} Massoud Hassani {{is working}} on a drone system that can quickly detect and clear land mines. The unmanned airborne de-mining system called Mine Kafon Drone uses a three step process to autonomously map, detect and detonate land mines. It flies above potentially dangerous areas, generating a 3D map, and uses <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> to pinpoint the location of mines. The drone can then place a detonator above the mines using its robotic gripping arm, before retreating to a safe distance. The firm claims its drone is safer, 20 times faster and up to 200 times cheaper than current technologies and might clear mines globally in 10 years. The project raised funds on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter with their goal set at €70,000 and receiving over €100,000 above it.|$|E
