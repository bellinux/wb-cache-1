25|$|Clarity {{and color}} {{enhanced}} diamonds sell at lower price points {{when compared to}} similar, untreated diamonds. This is because enhanced diamonds are originally lower quality before the enhancement is performed, and therefore <b>are</b> <b>priced</b> at a substandard level.

Therefore, treated diamonds {{appear to have a}} greater value than they would before treatment, but whether this is in fact the case is questionable.|$|E
