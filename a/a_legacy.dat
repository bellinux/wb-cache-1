5|$|In this manner, the Emperor's modern role {{is often}} {{compared}} {{to those of the}} Shogunate period and much of Japan's history, whereby the Emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power; which is often held by others nominally appointed by the Emperor himself.

5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{was the most}} radical administration in Syria's history. The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional branches of the Ba'ath Party and their respective National Commands, with many senior Syrian Ba'athists defecting to Iraq. As <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of the coup, during Jadid's rule, Syria initiated a propaganda campaign against the Iraqi Ba'athists. Jadid's government would be overthrown in the Corrective Movement of 1970, which brought Hafez al-Assad to power.|$|E

5|$|On 17 May 1882, {{two years}} after graduation, Druitt was {{admitted}} to the Inner Temple, one of the qualifying bodies for English barristers. His father had promised him <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of £500 (equivalent to £ today), and Druitt paid his membership fees with a loan from his father secured against the inheritance.

5|$|Set against this, the purges of the Red Army leadership, {{in which}} Molotov participated, {{weakened}} the Soviet Union's defence capacity {{and contributed to}} the military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war. The purges also led to the dismantling of privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture. This left <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under-production which the Soviet regime never fully rectified.|$|E

5|$|A {{common theme}} in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce {{protection}} {{of what he}} regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, {{at the height of}} the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.|$|E
5|$|After its founding, {{the school}} offered {{comprehensive}} secondary level Chinese education. It remained funded {{and supported by}} Tan Kah Kee until shortly before World War II.

During his tenure, the school faced the threat of closure several times due to financial difficulties, but managed to survive due to strong financial support from both Tan and Lee. Together they built <b>a</b> <b>legacy,</b> which the current school body commemorates them for.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of {{policies and practices}} that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E

5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|Erected at {{the behest}} of the Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} in the development of astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his army}} service in 1919, Marquis was restless and unsure of his future path.

He then decided to move to Whitehall, where he spent more and more of his time writing, at first on his wartime experiences, and then short articles on diverse subjects collected into volumes. He also wrote short stories during this period. However, he could not find a publisher.|$|E
