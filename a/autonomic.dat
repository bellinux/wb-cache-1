5|$|<b>Autonomic</b> effects: shivering, sweating, hyperthermia, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, nausea, diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. <b>Autonomic</b> disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic <b>autonomic</b> nervous system and spares the sympathetic <b>autonomic</b> nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autonomic</b> {{functions}} of the brain include the regulation, or rhythmic control of the heart rate and rate of breathing, and maintaining homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{can lead}} to death {{as a result of}} a number of complications: severe infections, blood clots, and cardiac arrest likely due to <b>autonomic</b> neuropathy. Despite optimum care this occurs in about 5% of cases.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Bell-Boeing {{set up the}} V-22 Readiness Operations Center (VROC) at Ridley Park, Pennsylvania {{to gather}} {{information}} from each aircraft to improve fleet performance {{in a similar manner}} as the F-35's <b>Autonomic</b> Logistics Information System (ALIS).|$|E
5|$|Other <b>autonomic</b> {{functions}} {{may also}} be disrupted. For example, problems with body temperature regulation mostly occur in injuries at T8 and above.|$|E
5|$|People with cranial CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of {{developing}} meningitis per year. If cranial leaks last more than seven days, the chances {{of developing}} meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of the leak site. When a CSF leak occurs at the temporal bone surgery becomes {{necessary in order to}} prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to <b>autonomic</b> dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The <b>autonomic</b> dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>autonomic</b> or {{involuntary}} nervous system, {{which is}} involved in the control of body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure, is affected in two thirds of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but the impact is variable. Twenty percent may experience severe blood-pressure fluctuations and irregularities in the heart beat, sometimes {{to the point that the}} heart beat stops and requiring pacemaker-based treatment. Other associated problems are abnormalities in perspiration and changes in the reactivity of the pupils. <b>Autonomic</b> nervous system involvement can affect even those who do not have severe muscle weakness.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} (X) {{provides}} sensory and <b>autonomic</b> (parasympathetic) motor innervation to {{structures in the}} neck and also {{to most of the}} organs in the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|There are {{circadian}} {{variations in}} CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, but potentially relating {{to differences in}} the activation of the <b>autonomic</b> nervous system {{over the course of}} the day.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{lead exposure}} {{is associated with}} high blood pressure, and studies have also found connections between lead exposure and coronary heart disease, heart rate variability, and death from stroke, but this evidence is more limited. People who {{have been exposed to}} higher concentrations of lead may be at a higher risk for cardiac <b>autonomic</b> dysfunction on days when ozone and fine particles are higher.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{contains}} a cyclopropylglutamine compound called coprine. Its active metabolite, 1-aminocyclopropanol, blocks {{the action of}} an enzyme, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which breaks down acetaldehyde in the body. Acetaldehyde is an intermediate metabolite of ethanol and is responsible for most symptoms of a hangover; its effect on <b>autonomic</b> β receptors {{is responsible for the}} vasomotor symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} contains orexinergic neurons {{that control}} appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system. The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through {{the release of}} peptides such as oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as dopamine into the median eminence. Through the <b>autonomic</b> projections, the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, sweating, and other homeostatic mechanisms. The hypothalamus also {{plays a role in}} thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever. The hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys – when blood pressure falls, the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink. The hypothalamus also regulates food intake through <b>autonomic</b> signals, and hormone release by the digestive system.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the <b>autonomic</b> nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognizable}} symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include <b>autonomic</b> dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms {{may be present}} {{at the time of}} diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The sensory ganglia are {{directly}} correspondent to {{dorsal root ganglia}} of spinal nerves and are known as cranial sensory ganglia. Sensory ganglia exist for nerves with sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X. There are also parasympathetic ganglia, which {{are part of the}} <b>autonomic</b> nervous system for cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X.|$|E
5|$|Three-quarters {{of people}} with LEMS also have {{disruption}} of the <b>autonomic</b> nervous system. This may be experienced as a dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Alterations in the <b>autonomic</b> {{nervous system}} {{can lead to}} orthostatic {{hypotension}} (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Another risk is <b>autonomic</b> dysreflexia (AD), {{a medical}} {{emergency}} involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{are often}} preceded by certain experiences, known as auras. They include sensory (visual, hearing, or smell), psychic, <b>autonomic,</b> and motor phenomena. Jerking activity may start {{in a specific}} muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it {{is known as a}} Jacksonian march. Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something.|$|E
5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been <b>autonomic</b> responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament {{and the extent to which}} attachment acts as a moderator. There is some evidence that the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1997, the EPB {{published}} {{a series of}} quotes attributed to Pedro Albizu Campos discussing a variety of topics, from the <b>Autonomic</b> Charter of 1897 granting Puerto Rico membership in the International Postal Union and its own currency to the suplantation of historic figures and events in public schools. Most of the article focuses on Albizu's belief that Puerto Rico was in a de facto path towards independence when invades in 1898, the need for armed revolution and his assessment that statehood would only be possible with an anglosaxon culture.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly <b>autonomic</b> in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas disease {{are due to}} cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the <b>autonomic</b> nervous system in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, <b>autonomic</b> responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} <b>autonomic</b> nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of light. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An <b>autonomic</b> response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The <b>autonomic</b> nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autonomic</b> {{seizures}} and <b>autonomic</b> status epilepticus as {{occur in}} Panayiotopoulos syndrome {{have not been}} described in other epileptic syndromes in that sequence though 10–20 per cent of children with the same seizure semiology may have cerebral pathology. The major problem is to recognize emetic and other <b>autonomic</b> manifestations as seizure events and not to dismiss them or erroneously to consider them as unrelated to the ictus and a feature of encephalitis, migraine, syncope or gastro-enteritis.|$|E
25|$|It {{plays a role}} in {{a variety}} of homeostatic {{functions}} related to basic survival needs, such as taste, visceral sensation, and <b>autonomic</b> control. The insula controls <b>autonomic</b> functions through the regulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. It has a role in regulating the immune system.|$|E
25|$|During a {{recorded}} <b>autonomic</b> seizure, {{there was a}} small increase in blood pressure (+5/4mm Hg, systolic/diastolic), pronounced increases in heart rate (+59 bpm) and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (+242 pg/mL), epinephrine (+175 pg/mL), and vasopressin (+22.1 pg/mL); serum glucose was also elevated (206mg/dL). The significant increase in plasma vasopressin may explain the emetic <b>autonomic</b> symptoms.|$|E
25|$|O’Sullivan {{and colleagues}} (2008) {{identified}} early <b>autonomic</b> dysfunction {{to be the}} most important early clinical prognostic feature regarding survival in MSA. Patients with concomitant motor and <b>autonomic</b> dysfunction within three years of symptom onset had a shorter survival duration, in addition to becoming wheelchair dependent and bed-ridden at an earlier stage than those who developed these symptoms after three years from symptom onset. Their study also showed that when patients with early <b>autonomic</b> dysfunction develop frequent falling, or wheelchair dependence, or severe dysphagia, or require residential care, there is a shorter interval from this point to death.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} with <b>autonomic</b> insufficiency, a high-salt diet may be appropriate.|$|E
25|$|CRH also {{regulates the}} actions of the <b>Autonomic</b> nervous system ANS and immune system.|$|E
25|$|Satellite glial {{cells of}} all <b>autonomic</b> and sensory ganglia, Schwann cells of all {{peripheral}} nerves.|$|E
25|$|Significant <b>autonomic</b> or {{peripheral}} neuropathy {{increases the risk}} of exaggerated hypotension when leaving the water.|$|E
