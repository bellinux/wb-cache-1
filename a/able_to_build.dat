5|$|Groups of players, {{large or}} small, are often {{required}} to complete objectives. In addition to forming teams and informal chat groups, joining a player organization is encouraged. These are, like guilds in similar games, officially recognized groups bound together for technical and social benefits. Organizations are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> their own cities across the game world, control areas of land, run player markets, and access other special content.|$|E
5|$|On {{the early}} Earth, {{reactive}} elements, such as iron and uranium, existed in a reduced form that would react with any free oxygen produced by photosynthesising organisms. Oxygen {{would not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up in the atmosphere until all the iron had rusted (producing banded iron formations), {{and all the other}} reactive elements had been oxidised.|$|E
50|$|With massive {{quantities}} {{of weapons and}} tanks from World War II, the Soviet Union was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help <b>build</b> the armoured forces of the satellite states within its sphere of influence quickly and the Polish Armoured Forces received some of these.|$|R
50|$|Juvenile {{hormone levels}} drop in honey bee colonies pre-swarming {{and it is}} {{expected}} that vitellogenin levels would therefore rise. One may surmise, that swarming bees would want to pack along as much vitellogenin as possible to extend their lifespan and <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>build</b> a new nest.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reasons for}} Eusebia's {{sponsorship}} of Julian are unclear. Julian himself attributes {{this to her}} kindness (though this may include literary and political embellishment), while Ammianus Marcellinus offers more politically sophisticated motives. Modern historians Shaun Tougher and J. Juneau suggest that Eusebia's role may in fact {{have been part of}} Constantius's own strategy, using her as a [...] "front woman" [...] in negotiations with Julian, as the two men had a contentious relationship. Eusebia may have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a valuable alliance where Constantius needed one.|$|R
5|$|Slaveowners {{and state}} governments tried to prevent slaves from making or playing musical {{instruments}} because {{of the use of}} drums to signal the Stono Rebellion in 1739. Blassingame, however, points out that in spite of restrictions, slaves were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a strong musical tradition drawing on their African heritage. Music, songs, and dances were similar to those performed or played in Africa. Instruments reproduced by slaves include drums, three-stringed banjos, gourd rattles, and mandolins.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} Lego Racers was {{initially}} created by High Voltage Software founder Kerry J. Ganofsky, {{with the idea}} of players being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> and race cars created with Lego bricks. After a year of development, Lego Media began production of the game, hiring Ganofsky's company to develop it. Lego Media and other facilities within The Lego Group collaborated with High Voltage Software during the production of the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and {{a larger number of}} spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{at making}} {{agreements}} by social actors (local government, residents, companies, and NPO etc) {{in the local}} policymaking and policy implementation process of Local Governance. This Paper will show the concept of Interactive Governance, institutional building for governance by administrator, problem of participants in policy process, and the analysis of intermediary groups and interaction zone for governance. Intermediary groups can connect social actors with the government. Interaction zone can cause interaction with them. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to study the potentialities of them since they may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up effective and responsive governance...|$|R

5|$|Tamar was proclaimed heir and co-ruler by her reigning father George III in 1178, but {{she faced}} {{significant}} {{opposition from the}} aristocracy upon her ascension to full ruling powers after George's death. Tamar was successful in neutralizing this opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by {{the decline of the}} hostile Seljuq Turks. Relying on a powerful military élite, Tamar was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated the Caucasus until its collapse under the Mongol attacks within two decades after Tamar's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrestrial}} Argonemertes dendyi is {{a native}} of Australia but has been found in the British Isles, in Sao Miguel in the Azores, in Gran Canaria, and in a lava tube cave at Kaumana on the Island of Hawaii. It can build a cocoon, which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported, and it may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Another terrestrial genus, Geonemertes, is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles, widely across the Indo-Pacific, in Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, in Frankfurt, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira and in the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Despite trials, James' life in Utah was {{punctuated by}} moments of joy. A daughter, Mary Ann, {{was born in}} May 1848—the first black child born in Utah. Eventually things began to get better for the Mannings: by the mid 1860s they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a {{comfortable}} home and had acquired both farmland and animals, including an ox, horses, and a small flock of sheep. By the end of 1865 the Jameses, while not wealthy, were fairly prosperous. Only four households in the area held more assets in 1865 than they did, while 31 held less. The family was growing quickly as well. Between 1848 and 1860 six children were born: Miriam, Ellen Madora, Jessie, Jerry, Isaac, and Vilate. James' oldest son, Sylvester, was listed {{as a member of}} the Nauvoo Legion in 1861.|$|E
50|$|Recognising this, Honda {{built the}} world's first indoor car-to-car {{omnidirectional}} crash test facility in its Tochigi R&D Center in year 2000. This allows Honda to now simulate collisions between multiple vehicles of any body type, from any direction. With results from tests done from this facility, Honda was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> further <b>build</b> on its G-Con technology to incorporate Advance Compatibility Engineering, Honda's term for crash compatibility body.|$|R
5000|$|Ford Motor Company {{uses the}} CD3 {{platform}} design from the Mazda partnership {{as its first}} fully [...] "digital" [...] car, allowing the company to cut months of development time, saving money and bringing the vehicles to market more quickly.

5000|$|Social Capital. Robert Putnam {{argues that}} certain {{characteristics}} make societies {{more likely to}} have cultures of civic engagement that lead to more participatory democracies. Putnam argues that communities with denser horizontal networks of civic association are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> better <b>build</b> the [...] "norms of trust, reciprocity, and civic engagement" [...] that lead to democratization and well-functioning participatory democracies. Putnam contrasts communities with dense horizontal networks, to communities built around vertical networks and patron-client relations which he asserts are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the culture of civic engagement necessary for democratization.|$|R
5|$|In 17 April 2015, Airbus Group {{distributed}} {{a project}} presentation video, {{made by the}} communication agency Clipatize, on its YouTube channel. In 25 September 2015, Toulouse métropole broadcasts a promotional video on its YouTube channel. Toulouse metropolis is presented as an attractive ecosystem, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the future and highlights its visibility internationally. The Air-Cobot demonstrator was chosen to illustrate the robotics research of this metropolis. Located at Laboratoire d'analyse et d'architecture des systèmes during development, researchers or engineers working on the project regularly present a demonstration to visitors (external researchers, industrial partners, or students); it was also demonstrated {{to the general public}} during the 2015 Feast of Science. Airbus Group, in 17 February 2016, broadcast a YouTube video presentation of its vision of the hangar of the future in which it plans to use Air-Cobot.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, {{to drop out}} of the gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation to take his place on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D. Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> on his new prominence in state politics. When the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis, he gathered a citizen militia to make a show of support for owners and management, and helped to mediate an agreement between the workers and management and to prevent the strike from widening.|$|E
5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
50|$|Supramolecular {{systems are}} rarely {{designed}} from first principles. Rather, chemists have {{a range of}} well-studied structural and functional building blocks that they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up larger functional architectures. Many of these exist as whole families of similar units, from which the analog with the exact desired properties can be chosen.|$|R

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> dreadnoughts that were superior in protection and armament, {{with the exception of}} the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and armor plates as well as shortages of labor. The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 diverted workers at the shipyards for repairs and maintenance of the ships participating in the war. The Italians imported the raw nickel steel for their armor from America and Britain and processed it into their equivalent of Krupp cemented armor, called Terni cemented, but there were problems with this process and suitable plates took longer to produce than planned.|$|E
5|$|The former Town Hall, {{adjoining}} the old marketplace, {{houses the}} Willis Museum (originally the Basingstoke Museum, until 1956). This was founded {{and directed by}} Alderman George W. Willis, a local clocksmith, who served as Mayor of Basingstoke in 1923-24. He established the museum in 1931 and with much public support was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> it up into a major collection on local history, with a particularly extensive collection (largely made by him) of prehistoric implements and of antique clocks and watches. His association with the expanding museum continued for forty years. Its central location today is where, once upon a time, Jane Austen and her sister {{used to go to}} dances. Although ostensibly set in Hertford, Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, written in 1797, is thought to have been based on her view of Basingstoke society two centuries ago.|$|E
5|$|Truman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the Warsaw Pact.|$|E

Students and faculty indicated that because of the various technologies they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> communicate, <b>to</b> <b>build</b> relationships, and <b>to</b> feel a sense of community. However, those at a distance also indicated they missed out on the informal conversations held among students who attended classes on campus.

5|$|Frederick II, {{ruler of}} the Holy Roman Empire in the 13th century, {{realised}} that his dynasty was losing its power and granted freedoms to many cities {{in order to keep}} their allegiance. These cities became Free imperial cities and Sélestat became one of them in 1217. Under the new status Sélestat was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> city walls and collect taxes on its own. Its serfs and settlers were freed. The German monarch Adolf of Nassau granted Sélestat a constitution in 1292. It was amended many times but it regulated local politics until 1789. Although the new status favoured trade and prosperity, free cities in Alsace were afraid {{that they would not be}} defended by imperial forces if a conflict was to occur. So they decided to form an alliance called the Decapolis in 1354, which comprised ten cities: (Haguenau, Colmar, Wissembourg, Turckheim, Obernai, Kaysersberg, Rosheim, Munster, Sélestat and Mulhouse). The seat of the alliance was in Haguenau but its archives were kept in Sélestat. Because the town was the most centrally located, it often hosted meetings of the association.|$|E
5|$|From 1933, Allen {{worked in}} the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was {{appointed}} England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played irregularly for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{was freed}} and {{returned}} to Israel after having served about {{three years in prison}} first in Israel and then in the United States. Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money, he allegedly had played a relatively minor role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin, who was arrested in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011, but refuses to testify against the Abergils. As a result, U.S. authorities reportedly were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a case against Meir Abergil, leading to a plea agreement approved by a California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of over a million dollars from another mob figure. In Israel, he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel, including Internet cafes, convenience stores, soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos. According to his lawyer, Abergil′s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal.|$|E

30|$|The {{key issue}} for the {{government}} will be to get the various related parties, and particularly those groups that will be negatively affected by TPP membership (including young people, traditional industries, SMEs and farmers) to appreciate the benefits that TPP membership would bring, and {{to find ways to}} minimize the negative impacts and compensate those affected. The extent to which Taiwan is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>build</b> consensus regarding the negotiation of TPP membership (or other FTAs) will thus depend on how well Taiwan is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put in place an “eco-system” in which no related party feels that its interests are being sacrificed.|$|R
