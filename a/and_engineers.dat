Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 million) of the world's industrial robots —though its share was historically even higher, representing one-half of all industrial robots worldwide in 2000.

5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists <b>and</b> <b>engineers</b> can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the {{conflict}} between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, there was a mass migration of Tamils trying to escape the hardships and perils of war. Initially, it was middle class professionals, such as doctors <b>and</b> <b>engineers,</b> who emigrated; they were followed by the poorer segments of the community. The fighting drove more than 800,000 Tamils from their homes to other places within Sri Lanka as internally displaced persons and also overseas, prompting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to identify them in 2004 as the largest asylum-seeking group.|$|E

Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley <b>and</b> <b>engineers</b> Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, <b>and</b> <b>engineers</b> to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E
