Others accuse those politicians of cynically misleading the public to achieve their own ends. For instance, {{in the months leading}} up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated that they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, Newsweek magazine published a story <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. Polls suggested that a majority of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was linked to the attacks of September 11, 2001. However, despite shifting public opinion, the Bush Administration believed that there was the possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E

S action. As expected, a significantly greater proportion of subjects (70 %) indicated support for the U. S. action, and these subjects did in fact have significantly lower integrative complexity levels than subjects who indicated opposition to the U. S. action. Relations between attitudes toward U.

5000|$|Ba'athist Iraq under <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> pursued ethnic {{cleansing}} or the liquidation of minorities, pursued expansionist wars against Iran and Kuwait, and gradually replaced pan-Arabism with an Iraqi nationalism that emphasized Iraq's {{connection to the}} glories of ancient Mesopotamian empires, including Babylonia.

5000|$|Notwithstanding their {{organizational}} ability, Workers World's role in ANSWER and ANSWER's role in {{the movement}} were (and are) controversial, both {{on the left and}} elsewhere. In a typical example of a critique from within the left, Michael Albert and Stephen R. Shalom writing on October 24, 2002 for Z, about a then-impending nationwide set of demonstrations (called by ANSWER), begin their discussion with a scathing critique of the views of Workers World, IAC, and (by implication) ANSWER. Describing IAC as an [...] "extremely energetic antiwar group" [...] and laying out its relationship to ANSWER, Clark, and Workers World (which they call [...] "WWP"), they declare, [...] "WWP holds many views that we find abhorrent. It considers North Korea 'socialist Korea'... a fantastic distortion of the reality {{of one of the most}} rigid dictatorships in the world. IAC expresses its solidarity with Slobodan Milosevic. ... To champion Milosevic is grotesque. The ANSWER website provides an IAC backgrounder on Afghanistan that refers to the dictatorial government that took power in that country in 1978 as 'socialist' and says of the Soviet invasion the next year: the 'USSR intervened militarily at the behest of the Afghani revolutionary government'... In none of IAC's considerable resources on the current Iraq crisis is there a single negative word <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> There is no mention that he is a ruthless dictator.

40|$|The {{present study}} used an {{informant}} method of psychiatric assessment to evaluate Saddam Hussein, and these results {{were compared to}} a posthumous assessment of Adolf Hitler. Eleven Iraqi adults who lived under Hussein’s influence for a median of 24 years completed the Coolidge Axis II Inventory, a measure of 14 personality dis-orders. The mean consensus among the 11 raters was r =. 57. It revealed that Hussein probably reached diagnostic threshold for the sadistic (T score M = 81. 0), paranoid (T score M = 79. 3), antisocial (T score M = 77. 4), and narcissistic (T score M = 74. 2) personality disorders. The correlation between the consensus profile for Hussein and a consensus profile of 5 Hitler experts was r =. 79, indicating a very strong similarity between the two profiles. It was concluded that Saddam Hussein had {{many of the same}} personality disorders or their features as Adolf Hitler, although sadistic features were stronger in Hussein than Hitler. It appeared that a “Big Four ” personality disor-ders constellation emerged for these two dictators, and they were sadistic, antisocial, paranoid, and narcissistic. It was also found that Hussein might have had some traits or features of paranoid schizophrenia. Implications for diplomacy and negotiations with persons with similar personality profiles are proffered. “He’s a dangerous, dangerous man with dangerous, dangerous weapons. ” — as quoted by U. S. President George W. Bush, <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> December, 2002.
