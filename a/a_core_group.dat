5|$|In {{another study}} done at Nosy Mangabe on {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemurs a fourth level or organization was defined: affiliates. Affiliates were individuals with more persistent social bonds and more frequent interactions, usually within <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group,</b> but sometimes also between core groups within a subgroup. Adult females typically had many affiliates, whereas adult males rarely interacted with conspecifics, living a more solitary existence.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the 2013 season, the coach met with Osvaldo Alonso, Clint Dempsey, and Evans since they were <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> of players. The group agreed on the aforementioned changes to the team. Starting striker Eddie Johnson was later traded while a new central defender, winger, midfielder, goalkeeper, and depth at the forward position were brought in. The team played 2014 with Dempsey and Obafemi Martins playing more through the middle as the Sounders won the US Open Cup and the Supporters Shield.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E

5|$|In the 1995 {{study by}} Chase et al. {{referred}} to above, {{which was the}} largest yet to use purely molecular data, the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids. However, because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group. They identified four major clades of monocots. They named these alismatids, aroids, stemonoids and dioscoreoids, in addition to Acorus, and <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> of Asparagales, Liliales and commelinoids. They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren, {{with the exception of}} stemonoids (based on Stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent).|$|E
5|$|Living in the Material World {{is notable}} for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, {{reflecting}} Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against {{his status as}} a superstar, as well as for what many commentators consider to be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All Things Must Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> of musicians comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors.|$|E

5|$|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ("Life Guards SS Adolf Hitler"; LSSAH) was {{an elite}} SS {{protection}} unit founded in 1933 as a palace guard to provide protection for Hitler's residences and offices.

The commander, Sepp Dietrich insisted that the men be in good physical condition, between the ages of 23 to 35, and have a confirmed ancestry record without Jewish lineage. The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration. By 1945, while the LSSAH fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> of 800 men stayed in Berlin and made up the Leibstandarte Guard Battalion (Wache Reichskanzlei), assigned to guard the Führer.|$|E

25|$|As a concept, open-endedness exists along a {{continuum}} {{dependent upon the}} duration of the group (Gitterman, 1989; Schopler and Galinsky, 1995a; Shulman, 2006).

25|$|Successful {{campaign}} {{strategy in}} PR-STV elections may {{differ significantly from}} other voting systems. In particular, individual candidates in STV have little incentive for negative campaign advertising, as reducing a particular opponent's ranking among voters does not necessarily elevate one's own; if negative campaigning is seen as distasteful by the voters, the practice may even prove harmful to the attacking candidate. Conversely, {{in order to avoid}} elimination in early counting rounds by having too few first preference votes, candidates have a significant incentive to convince voters to rank them explicitly first as their top preference, rather than merely higher. This incentive to attain top preferences, in turn, may lead to a strategy of candidates placing greater importance on <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> of supporters. Avoiding early elimination, however, is usually not enough to win election, as a candidate must still subsequently win enough votes on transfers to meet the quota; consequently, strategies that sacrifice wide secondary support in favor of primary support amidst <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> may ultimately fail unless the group is particularly large.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} support for an open source project varies highly. The {{available}} support for open source software is predominantly self-motivated discussions found on the Internet, sometimes moderated by <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>group</b> of contributors. The amount of documentation or guides for an open source project also varies highly. More popular or company-backed projects often have more detailed and maintained documentation. However, as open source projects are regularly changing, documentation can easily fall out of date.|$|E
