6000|$|... 'I find Trench's Notes on the Authorised Version of the New Testament very useful, chiefly {{as helping}} one {{to acquire a}} habit of {{accurate}} criticism for oneself, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> (D.V.) to translate any portion of the Scriptures, of course such books are very valuable.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'To be sure, I see it all,' said poor Nicholas, {{delighted with}} a {{thousand}} visionary ideas, that his good spirits and his inexperience were conjuring up before him.

60|$|Aberdeen {{was the end}} of the line, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> into it {{that night}} it seemed a near {{neighbor}} to Sitting Bull and the bison. And so, indeed, it was, for a buffalo bull had been hunted across its site less than a year before.|$|R

60|$|We {{came back}} to Gloucester to-day, and to-morrow we are off for Buxton. As we are so near Stratford and Warwick and all that, Jone said we'd better go there on our way, but I wouldn't agree to it.

60|$|We sallied forth together, and as {{we walked}} {{he told me the}} number of prisoners, the sort of crimes for which they were detained--ranging from man-slaughter to petty larceny--and finally, details of his own career.

60|$|Barrington Cowles {{happened}} to have taken a bedroom upon the same floor as mine, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{to know each other}} better we shared a small sitting-room, in which we took our meals.
