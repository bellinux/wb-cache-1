40|$|The {{stabilization}} of nanoparticles against their irreversible particle aggregation and oxidation reactions. {{is a requirement}} for further advancement in nanoparticle science and technology. For this reason the research aim on this topic focuses on the synthesis of various metal nanoparticles protected with monolayers containing different reactive head groups and functional tail groups. In this work cuprous bromide nanocrystals haave been synthetized with a diameter of about 20 nanometers {{according to a new}} sybthetic method adding dropwise ascorbic acid to a water solution of lithium bromide and cupric chloride under continuous stirring and nitrogen flux. Butane thiolate Cu protected nanoparticles have been synthetized according to three different syntesys methods. Their morphologies appear related to the physicochemical conditions during the synthesis and to the dispersing medium used to prepare the sample. Synthesis method II allows to obtain stable nanoparticles of 1 - 2 nm in size both isolated and forming clusters. Nanoparticle cluster formation was enhanced as water was used as dispersing medium probably due to the idrophobic nature of the butanethiolate layers coating the nanoparticle surface. Synthesis methods I and III lead to large unstable spherical nanoparticles with size ranging between 20 to 50 nm. These nanoparticles appeared in the TEM micrograph with the same morphology independently on the dispersing medium used in the sample preparation. The stability and dimensions of the copper nanoparticles appear inversely related. Using the same methods above described for the butanethiolate protected copper nanoparticles 4 -methylbenzenethiol protected copper nanoparticles have been prepared. Diffractometric and spectroscopic data reveal that decomposition processes didn’t occur in both the 4 -methylbenzenethiol copper protected nanoparticles precipitates from formic acid and from water in a period of time six month long. Se anticarcinogenic effects by multiple mechanisms have been extensively investigated and documented and Se is defined a genuine nutritional cancer-protecting element and a significant protective effect of Se against major forms of cancer. Furthermore phloroglucinol was found to possess cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress, thanks to reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are associated with cells and tissue damages and are the contributing factors for inflammation, aging, cancer, arteriosclerosis, hypertension and diabetes. The goal of our work has been to set up a new method to synthesize in mild conditions amorphous Se nanopaticles surface capped with phloroglucinol, which is used during synthesis as reducing agent to obtain stable Se nanoparticles in ethanol, performing the synergies offered by the specific anticarcinogenic properties of Se and the antioxiding ones of phloroalucinol. We have synthesized selenium nanoparticles protected by phenolic molecules chemically bonded to their surface. The phenol molecules coating the nanoparticles surfaces form low ordered arrays as {{can be seen from the}} wider shape of the absorptions in the FT-IR spectrum with respect to those appearing in that of crystalline phenol. On the other hand, metallic nanoparticles with unique optical properties, facile surface chemistry and appropriate size scale are generating much enthusiasm in nanomedicine. In fact Au nanoparticles has immense potential for both cancer diagnosis and therapy. Especially Au nanoparticles efficiently convert the strongly adsorbed light into localized heat, which can be exploited for the selective laser photothermal therapy of cancer. According to the about, metal nanoparticles-HA nanocrystals composites should have tremendous potential in novel methods for therapy of cancer. 11 mercaptoundecanoic surface protected Au 4 Ag 1 nanoparticles adsorbed on nanometric apathyte crystals we have successfully prepared like an <b>anticancer</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> deliver system utilizing biomimetic hydroxyapatyte nanocrystals as deliver agents. Furthermore natural chrysotile, formed by densely packed bundles of multiwalled hollow nanotubes, is a mineral very suitable for nanowires preparation when their inner nanometer-sized cavity is filled with a proper material. Bundles of chrysotile nanotubes can then behave as host systems, where their large interchannel separation is actually expected to prevent the interaction between individual guest metallic nanoparticles and act as a confining barrier. Chrysotile nanotubes have been filled with molten metals such as Hg, Pb, Sn, semimetals, Bi, Te, Se, and with semiconductor materials such as InSb, CdSe, GaAs, and InP using both high-pressure techniques and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. Under hydrothermal conditions chrysotile nanocrystals have been synthesized as a single phase and can be utilized as a very suitable for nanowires preparation filling their inner nanometer-sized cavity with metallic nanoparticles. In this research work we have synthesized and characterized Stoichiometric synthetic chrysotile nanotubes have been partially filled with bi and monometallic highly monodispersed nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 1, 7 to 5, 5 nm depending on the core composition (Au, Au 4 Ag 1, Au 1 Ag 4, Ag). In the case of 4 methylbenzenethiol protected silver nanoparticles, the filling was carried out by convection and capillarity effect at room temperature and pressure using a suitable organic solvent. We have obtained new interesting nanowires constituted of metallic nanoparticles filled in inorganic nanotubes with a inner cavity of 7 nm and an isolating wall with a thick ranging from 7 to 21 nm. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor the {{efficacy}} of an anticancer treatment in real time can have a critical effect on the outcome. Currently, clinical readouts of efficacy rely on indirect or anatomic measurements, which occur over prolonged time scales postchemotherapy or postimmunotherapy {{and may not be}} concordant with the actual effect. Here we describe the biology-inspired engineering of a simple 2 -in- 1 reporter nanoparticle that not only delivers a cytotoxic or an immunotherapy payload to the tumor but also reports back on the efficacy in real time. The reporter nanoparticles are engineered from a novel two-staged stimuli-responsive polymeric material with an optimal ratio of an enzyme-cleavable drug or immunotherapy (effector elements) and a drug function-activatable reporter element. The spatiotemporally constrained delivery of the effector and the reporter elements in a single nanoparticle produces maximum signal enhancement due to the availability of the reporter element in the same cell as the drug, thereby effectively capturing the temporal apoptosis process. Using chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant tumors in vivo, we show that the reporter nanoparticles can provide a real-time noninvasive readout of tumor response to chemotherapy. The reporter nanoparticle can also monitor the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in melanoma.

30|$|Although, the result, {{that the}} high-aspect ratio could {{increase}} the cellular uptake, has been proven by more and more studies, few reports indicated {{that it has been}} used in the drug delivery system.

30|$|Targeted drug {{delivery}} using nanoparticles is a promising strategy {{for treatment of}} tumor cells [1 - 13]. Since tumor cells generally over-express various kinds of receptors on the cell membrane, receptor-mediated delivery of bioactive agents is an ideal way to maximize antitumor activity and minimize the unwanted side effect of <b>anticancer</b> drugs. <b>Nanoparticles</b> are an ideal candidate for these purposes because the target ligand can easily be decorated on the large surface area of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles have the unique feature of a small size (around 100 -nm diameter), which enables nanoparticle virus-like behavior and passive targeting {{in the human body}} [18]. Various target ligands have been developed to decorate the surfaces of colloidal carriers and nanoparticles [5 - 10]. Among them, folic acid is often selected for tumor targeting of nanoparticulate anticancer drugs because most of tumor cells have numerous folate receptors on the cell surface [8]. Then, targeting to the folate receptor of tumor cells enables <b>nanoparticles</b> to concentrate <b>anticancer</b> drugs in tumor cells and to avoid healthy cells. Zwicke et al. introduced the folate receptor for active targeting of cancer cells using various kinds of nanomaterials [8]. Folic-acid-decorated nanomaterials can be used to various kinds of cancer therapies, such as cancer chemotherapy, cancer imaging, and/or imaging of circulating cancer cells in the human body [8, 18, 19].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) {{has been}} shown to have {{activity}} against a broad spectrum of cancers. In order to enhance its tissue-specific delivery and anticancer activity, we prepared HCPT-loaded nanoparticles made from poly(ethylene glycol) -poly(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PEG-PBLG), and then studied their release characteristics, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and <b>anticancer</b> effects. PEG-PBLG <b>nanoparticles</b> incorporating HCPT were prepared by a dialysis method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the shape and diameter of the nanoparticles. The HCPT release characteristics in vitro were evaluated by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection method for determining HCPT in rabbit plasma was established. The pharmacokinetic parameters of HCPT/PEG-PBLG nanoparticles were compared with those of HCPT. Results The HCPT-loaded nanoparticles had a core-shell spherical structure, with a core diameter of 200 nm and a shell thickness of 30 nm. Drug-loading capacity and drug encapsulation were 7. 5 and 56. 8 %, respectively. The HCPT release profile was biphasic, with an initial abrupt release, followed by sustained release. The terminal elimination half-lives (t 1 / 2 β) of HCPT and HCPT-loaded nanoparticles were 4. 5 and 10. 1 h, respectively. Peak concentrations (Cmax) of HCPT and HCPT-loaded nanoparticles were 2627. 8 and 1513. 5 μg/L, respectively. The apparent volumes of distribution of the HCPT and HCPT-loaded nanoparticles were 7. 3 and 20. 0 L, respectively. Compared with a blank control group, Lovo cell xenografts or Tca 8113 cell xenografts in HCPT or HCPT-loaded nanoparticle treated groups grew more slowly and the tumor doubling times were increased. The tumor inhibition effect in the HCPT-loaded nanosphere-treated group was significantly higher than that of the HCPT-treated group (p 0. 05). Conclusion Compared to the HCPT- and control-treated groups, the HCPT-loaded nanoparticle-treated group showed a more sustained release, a longer circulation time, increased delivery to tissue, and an enhanced <b>anticancer</b> effect.

Especially, oxidative stress in cancers has been also extensively investigated and applied in redox-sensitive drug delivery system [23 – 25]. For example, thioether groups in the polymer backbone of the nanoparticles can be changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, when it was exposed to ROS, and ROS-switchable nanoparticles can be applicable in disease with ROS-rich environment [25, 26].

Early detection {{and the availability}} of new treatments have improved the survival rates of patients presenting with local or regional breast cancer to as high as 99 % and 85 %, respectively. On the contrary, patients with metastatic disease have a dismal 5 -year survival rate of 17 %. 1 Thus, there is an urgent need for treatment strategies directed towards metastasis. Our lab has developed antibodies (Clone 6 and AM 6) capable of recognizing tumor cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key step in the generation of circulating tumor cells and metastasis. The goal of the current study was to determine whether we use these antibodies as targeting ligands for directing <b>anticancer</b> drug-loaded polymeric <b>nanoparticles</b> to metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells as a novel therapeutic option. Polymeric PLGA nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent, were functionalized with the antibodies using thiol-maleimide chemistry. We optimized the conjugation reaction in order to achieve maximal cell uptake of nanoparticles without compromising antibody binding. In vitro studies were carried out in an MDA-MB- 231 derivative cell line with enhanced lung metastatic potential as well as a melanoma metastatic cell line M 12. Clone 6 nanoparticles and AM 6 nanoparticles showed significant improvement in cellular uptake as well as retention. A competition experiment confirmed target-mediated uptake of nanoparticles. Cytotoxicity studies showed improved cell kill using Clone 6 nanoparticles and AM 6 nanoparticles. Based on these promising in vitro results, we are currently carrying out in vivo studies in mice. The development of a targeted drug delivery system for the treatment of metastatic triple negative breast cancer can significantly enhance the survival rate for patients who often times have a life-expectancy of less than one year. ...|$|R

In this study, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were first functionalized using hyperbranched poly citric acid (PCA) to improve their hydrophilicity and functionality. Then, paclitaxel (PTX), a potent anticancer agent, was conjugated to the carboxyl functional groups of poly citric acid via a cleavable ester bond to obtain a MWNT-g-PCA-PTX conjugate. Drug content of the conjugate was about 38 % (w/w). The particle size of MWNT-g-PCA and MWNT-g-PCA-PTX was approximately 125 and 200 nm, respectively. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed a curved shape for MWNT-g-PCA and MWNT-g-PCA-PTX, which was in contrast with the straight or linear conformation expected from carbon nanotubes. It seems that the high hydrophilicity of poly citric acid and high hydrophobicity of MWNTs led to conformational changes from a linear state to a curved state. Paclitaxel can be released from the MWNT-g-PCA-PTX conjugates faster at pH 6. 8 and 5. 0 than at pH 7. 4, which was suitable for the release of the drug in tumor tissues and tumor cells. In vitro cytotoxicity studies were evaluated in the A 549 and SKOV 3 cell lines. MWNT-g-PCA had an insignificant cytotoxic effect on both cell lines. MWNT-g-PCA-PTX had more of a cytotoxic effect than the free drug over a shorter incubation time (eg, 24 hours versus 48 hours), which suggests improved cell penetration of MWNT-g-PCA-PTX. Therefore, paclitaxel conjugated to MWNT-g-PCA is promising for cancer therapeutics.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether the anticancer effect of Endostar is increased by using a nanocarrier system. It is expected that the prolonged circulation of endostar will improve its <b>anticancer</b> activity. Endostar-loaded <b>nanoparticles</b> were prepared to improve controlled release of the drug in mice and rabbits, as well as its anticancer effects in mice with colon cancer. A protein release system could be exploited to act as a drug carrier. Nanoparticles were formulated from poly (ethylene glycol) modified poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) by a double emulsion technique. Physical and release characteristics of endostar-loaded nanoparticles in vitro were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), and micro bicinchoninic acid protein assay. The pharmacokinetic parameters of endostar nanoparticles in rabbit and mice plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blot was used to detect endostatin in different tissues. To study the effects of endostar-loaded nanoparticles in vivo, nude mice in which tumor cells HT- 29 were implanted, were subsequently treated with endostar or endostar-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles. Using TEM and PCS, endostar-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles were found to have a spherical core-shell structure with a diameter of 169. 56 ± 35. 03 nm. Drug-loading capacity was 8. 22 % ± 2. 35 % and drug encapsulation was 80. 17 % ± 7. 83 %. Compared with endostar, endostar-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles had a longer elimination half-life and lower peak concentration, caused slower growth of tumor cell xenografts, and prolonged tumor doubling times. The nanoparticles changed the pharmacokinetic characteristics of endostar in mice and rabbits, thereby reinforcing anticancer activity. In conclusion, PEG-PLGA nanoparticles are a feasible carrier for endostar. Endostar-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles seem to have a better anticancer effect than conventional endostar. We believe that PEG-PLGA nanoparticles are an effective carrier for protein medicines...|$|R

Breast cancer in females and lung cancer in males {{are the most common}} cancer types. Epidemiological research has provided increasing evidence that dietary habits, especially Mediterranean diet which has high consumption of olive oil and its products, may {{play an important role in}} lung and breast cancer. Due to their preventive effect against cancer, olive leaf extract rich in polyphenols was immobilizied on chitosan nanoparticles which are good drug carriers because of their biocompatible and biodegradable properties with the help of capability of passing through biological barriers. For this aim, olive leaf extract loaded chitosan nanaoparticles were synthesized by ionotropic gelation mechanism. Optimum conditions to synthesize nanoparticles were determined by investigation of the effect of chitosan and tripolyphosphate mass ratio, initial pH of chitosan solution, concentration of olive leaf extract and incubation time of olive leaf extract and tripolyphosphate with chitosan solution. Characterization of nanoparticles was performed by dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. To investigate the <b>anticancer</b> properties of <b>nanoparticles,</b> molecular biological studies were performed by in vitro cytotoxicity studies based on MTT assay, in vitro cell cycle analysis and apoptosis by flow cytometer and imaging of cells by optical microscopy. In results, olive leaf extract loaded chitosan nanaoparticles obtained approximately 91. 25 nm and showed more cytotoxicity than chitosan nanoparticles, chitosan and olive leaf extract for both lung and breast cancer cells. In contrast, there was no cytotoxicity for healthy cells. These effects were supported by cell cycle analysis. Also in optical imaging, lower number of cells and morfological differences on cancerous cells which supports the cytotoxicity results were observed. We can conclude that our results will open a new approach to use not only cytotoxic anticancer drug for cancerous cells but also biocompatible material for biomedical applications...|$|R

In this study, we aimed to determine whether the anticancer effect of Endostar is increased by using a nanocarrier system. It is expected that the prolonged circulation of endostar will improve its <b>anticancer</b> activity. Endostar-loaded <b>nanoparticles</b> were prepared to improve controlled release of the drug in mice and rabbits, as well as its anticancer effects in mice with colon cancer. A protein release system could be exploited to act as a drug carrier. Nanoparticles were formulated from poly (ethylene glycol) modified poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) by a double emulsion technique. Physical and release characteristics of endostar-loaded nanoparticles in vitro were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), and micro bicinchoninic acid protein assay. The pharmacokinetic parameters of endostar nanoparticles in rabbit and mice plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blot was used to detect endostatin in different tissues. To study the effects of endostar-loaded nanoparticles in vivo, nude mice in which tumor cells HT- 29 were implanted, were subsequently treated with endostar or endostar-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles. Using TEM and PCS, endostar-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles were found to have a spherical core-shell structure with a diameter of 169. 56 &plusmn; 35. 03 nm. Drug-loading capacity was 8. 22 % &plusmn; 2. 35 % and drug encapsulation was 80. 17 % &plusmn; 7. 83 %. Compared with endostar, endostar-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles had a longer elimination half-life and lower peak concentration, caused slower growth of tumor cell xenografts, and prolonged tumor doubling times. The nanoparticles changed the pharmacokinetic characteristics of endostar in mice and rabbits, thereby reinforcing anticancer activity. In conclusion, PEG-PLGA nanoparticles are a feasible carrier for endostar. Endostar-loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles seem to have a better anticancer effect than conventional endostar. We believe that PEG-PLGA nanoparticles are an effective carrier for protein medicines. Keywords: medical physics, biologic physics, nanoparticles&nbsp...|$|R
40|$|Specificity is a {{critical}} feature of a cancer treatment and efforts are devoted to develop powerful strategies improving this aspect. Nanothechnology offers a great opportunity in cancer treatment based on the concept that a drug formulated in nanoparticles can alter its pharmacokinetics improving the treatment ability to target and kill cells of diseased tissues/organs while affecting as few healthy cells as possible. Another advantage of nanoparticles relies on sustained release of the entrapped anti-cancer drug which results in a prolongation of drug plasma half-life and reduction of administration in the patients. Furthermore, {{it has been suggested}} that drug accumulation and slow release inside tumour cells can be useful to circumvent MDR. Nanotechnological approaches as been proposed also in adjuvant therapy for cancer such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) in an attempt to improve the specificity of the photoactive species (PS). On this basis, the final aim of this project is to design, formulate and test novel multifunctional nanoparticles combining conventional chemotherapy with PDT in the treatment of cancer. Nanoparticles will be prepared from two amphiphilic materials which have demonstrated a great potential in the nanodelivery of anticancer drugs after intravenous administration that is amphiphilic cyclodextrins and biodegradable amphiphilic copolymers of poly(ecaprolactone) / poly(ethyleneoxide). The first formulative approach we would like to attempt is to physically entrap both PS and <b>anticancer</b> drug in <b>nanoparticles</b> based on amphiphilic copolymers which were demonstrated to interact differently with tumor cells. In parallel, we will try to prepare nanoparticles for cancer therapy containing a physically entrapped conventional drug from newly synthesized light-sensitive smart materials. Amid PS, we will focus on the class of porphyrins whereas Docetaxel will be the conventional chemotherapeutics employed to obtain “the proof of concept”. Nanosystems will need to be engineered to avoid reticular endothelial system (RES) recognition and passively target solid tumors through EPR effect. Nanoparticles will be also surface-modified with specific “homing groups” able to recognize receptors overexpressed in cancer cells (especially folates) to realize an actively targeted system. Technologically optimized nanoparticles will be tested on in vitro-stabilized tumor cell lines derived from breast cancer, prostate cancer, neck and head cancer and lung cancer to evaluate their activity at molecular level. The mode of interaction of nanoparticles with cells will allow a full comprehension on the mechanisms underlying nanodelivered drug activity and will make use of confocal scanning microscopy and fluorescence-activatedcell sorting...|$|R
