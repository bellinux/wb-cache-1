5|$|The {{highest ranking}} {{casualty}} of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during {{this phase of the}} battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|E
25|$|Townshend {{returned}} to office as Master-General of the Ordnance in the North Ministry in October 1772. In {{the aftermath of}} his unpopular tour in Ireland, he found himself fighting a duel with Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont, an Irish Peer, on 2 February 1773, badly wounding the Earl with <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> groin. Townshend became colonel of the 2nd Dragoon Guards in July 1773.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the death of}} Miller and Stiles, every one {{of the rest of the}} gang was wounded, including Frank James and Pitts, both shot in their right legs. Jesse James was the last one to be shot, taking <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thigh as the gang escaped. The six surviving outlaws rode out of town on the Dundas Road toward Millersburg where four of them had spent the night before.|$|E

25|$|One Thai {{mercenary}} column withdrew. The CPT {{managed to}} surround the other detachment of 80 men. A Special Forces rescue team of 70 was infiltrated from the Mekong, with a 75mm pack howitzer and a 4.2 inch mortar. With indirect fire {{support from the}} howitzer and mortar, a medevac was tried on 12 June 1972. The Air America civilian copilot was killed by <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head, and the medevac aborted.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch and English {{army had}} access to a large {{quantity}} of artillery, which had landed via barges landed from the Rhine. On 11 August 1597 approaches were dug towards the city's walls as the siege commenced. William Louis of Nassau was wounded by <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thigh and Maurice not long after had a cannonball fly just over his head as it entered his tent while in repose. Once the batteries were placed, the city was intensively shelled which added to the misery of the garrison.|$|E
25|$|Ambulances took McCall and Irvin to Waterman Hospital in Eustis. McCall {{was treated}} for a {{concussion}} and facial injuries, and Irvin for his gunshot wounds. At the hospital Irvin met with NAACP lawyers and later told the press that McCall shot him and Shepherd without provocation, as did Yates. In the early 21st century, Gilbert King examined the unredacted FBI files from the case. He wrote in his book published in 2012 that the FBI had located <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil ten inches below the blood stain where Irvin had lain wounded, supporting Irvin's claim that Yates fired at him from near point blank range.|$|E

25|$|The {{standoff}} {{continued as}} locals kept the place surrounded {{until the next}} morning when, cautiously entering, the authorities found two dead bodies, both with numerous bullet wounds to the arms and legs. One {{of the men had}} <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> wound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forehead and the other had <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temple. The local police report speculated that, judging from the positions of the bodies, one bandit had probably shot his fatally wounded partner-in-crime to put him out of his misery, just before killing himself with his final <b>bullet.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following investigation by the Tupiza police, the bandits were identified as the men who robbed the Aramayo payroll transport, but the Bolivian authorities didn't know their real names, nor could they positively identify them.|$|R

25|$|As {{a platoon}} commander, de Gaulle was {{involved}} in fierce fighting from the outset. He received his baptism of fire 15 August and {{was among the first}} to be wounded, receiving <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knee at the Battle of Dinant. It is sometimes claimed that in hospital, he grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. However, there is no contemporary evidence that he understood the importance of artillery firepower in modern warfare; instead in his writing at the time he criticised the “overrapid” offensive, the inadequacy of French generals, and the “slowness of the English troops”.|$|E
25|$|Strohschneider {{was wounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tibia {{early in the}} war, on 28 August 1914. After hospitalization, he was posted to a Guards unit, the 42nd Infantry Regiment on the Russian Front. He went into bitter winter battle at the Chryszcata Heights in the Carpathian Mountains and {{suffered}} a knee wound on 9 February 1915. He returned from hospital after this injury to command a machine gun section. On 19 September 1915, he was wounded for the third time, and captured by the Russians. He escaped to friendly lines. After convalescense, he was then invalided from the army as unfit for further service.|$|E
25|$|On the day, {{there were}} three {{sections}} on patrol, a total of 24 men, spread out in a head-high cornfield around the compound. Budd spotted four Taliban approaching, {{at a distance of}} 50 metres. With hand signals, Budd led his section in a flanking manoeuvre round to the cornfield's outskirts to try to cut them off, but they were spotted and the Taliban opened fire on the troops. A further group of Taliban opened up fire from a wall further back. The British soldiers took heavy fire, kneeling or lying down trying to take cover. One soldier received <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shoulder, and another was shot in the nose.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the Civil War, pro-Confederacy factions in Missouri became {{organized}} as the Missouri State Guard, and Slack, with his previous military experience and political connections, was appointed by Governor of Missouri Claiborne F. Jackson as a brigadier general in command of the 5th Division of the MSG. His commission dated from July 4, 1861. In an August reorganization of the Guard, Slack assumed command of the 4th Division, which consisted of both cavalry and infantry. He saw action in the battles of Carthage and Springfield. He was wounded by <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left hip at the Battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10.|$|E
25|$|The crime {{itself was}} soon cleared up. Willi Günther had bragged about his {{participation}} in public. After his arrest on 26 June, he confessed to the crime without holding anything back. Hans Gerd Techow was arrested the following day, Ernst Werner Techow, who was visiting his uncle, three days later. Fischer and Kern, however, remained on the loose. After a daring flight, which kept Germany in suspense {{for more than two}} weeks, they were finally spotted at Saaleck Castle in Thuringia, whose owner was himself a secret member of the Organisation Consul. On 17 July, they were confronted by two police detectives. While waiting for reinforcements during the stand-off, one of the detectives fired at a window, unknowingly killing Kern by <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head. Fischer then took his own life.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle's unit gained {{recognition}} for repeatedly crawling out into no man's land {{to listen to}} the conversations of the enemy in their trenches, and the information he brought back was so valuable that on 18 January 1915 he received the Croix de Guerre. On 10 February he was promoted to captain, initially on probation. On 10 March 1915, de Gaulle received <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left hand, which initially seemed trivial but became infected. The wound incapacitated him for four months and later forced him to wear his wedding ring on the right hand. In August he commanded the 10th company before returning to duty as regimental adjutant. On 3 September 1915 his rank of captain became permanent. In late October, returning from leave, he returned to command of 10th company again.|$|E

Geisel was charged with making threatening statements against Obama during a bail-bonds training class on July 31. Geisel also threatened to put <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head of then-President Bush, although Geisel later claimed he was joking. He was found to be in possession of ammunition, body armor, a combat-style hatchet, tear gas, a loaded 9mm handgun and four loaded magazines. Geisel said he collected firearms, and was only using the gun for his bail-bonds course. Geisel remained in custody for a month.|$|E
500|$|The {{invasion}} commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, {{the flagship}} for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT {{was destroyed by}} shore fire, {{and he had to}} proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On {{the second day of the}} attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. [...] Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie [...] "Sands of Iwo Jima" [...] reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor.|$|E
