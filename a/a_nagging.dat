5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Hašek was {{hampered}} by <b>a</b> <b>nagging</b> groin injury. He missed forty games {{and failed to}} win a major NHL award {{for the first time in}} several years. Though he healed in time for the playoffs, the Sabres were eliminated in the first round in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers. In 2000–01—his final season with Buffalo—Hašek set a modern era record by collecting his sixth Vezina Trophy. He also won his second William M. Jennings Trophy. The Sabres played Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs again, where Hašek outplayed his 1998 Olympic back-up Roman Čechmánek. In the clinching sixth game, Hašek recorded a shutout against the Flyers. In the second round, the Sabres played a seven-game series against Mario Lemieux's Pittsburgh Penguins, which culminated with the Penguins winning the final game in overtime.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to <b>a</b> <b>nagging</b> mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E

5|$|Henderson had 468 more {{stolen bases}} {{in his career}} than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most {{prolific}} basestealer. In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League. In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he {{led the league in}} steals every season except 1987, when he missed part of the season due to <b>a</b> <b>nagging</b> hamstring injury, allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader. However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. (Tim Raines ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at 84%.) On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signalling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.|$|E

40|$|Human {{alveolar}} macrophages {{obtained by}} bronchoalveolar Iavage are usually poor accessory cells in in vitro lymphoprollferation assays. However, we recently described a subpopuIatlon of pulmonary mononuclear cells, obtained from minced and enzyme-digested lung, which were potent stimulators of aliogeneic T-lymphocyte prolIferation. These cells were enrIched In loosely adherent mononuclear cell (LAM) fractions, but further study of these accessory cells was {{hampered by the}} heterogeneous nature of LAM. It was observed that {{in the majority of}} lung tissue sections, most alveolar macrophages were autofluorescent, whereas most interstitial HLA-DR positive cells were not. Therefore autofluorescence was utIlized to fractionate LAM in an attempt to remove alveolar macrophages and selectively purify interstitial accessory cells. LAM were separated by flow cytometry using forward and side scatter to exclude lymphocytes, and red autofluorescence to obtain brightly autofluorescent (A pos) and relatively nonauto-fluorescent (<b>A</b> <b>nag)</b> mononuclear cells. Although both populations contained over 80 % HLA-DR positive cells, A pos cells were poor accessory cells, whereas <b>A</b> <b>nag</b> cells were extremely potent stlmulators of a mixed leukocyte reactIon at all stimulator ratios tested. When A pos cells were added to <b>A</b> <b>nag</b> cells, 1 -cell proliferation was markedly sup-pressed in the majority of experiments. Morphologically, A pos cells appeared similar to classical alveolar macrophages with 95 % of the cells beIng large and intensely nonspe-cific esterase positive. In contrast, the majority of <b>A</b> <b>nag</b> were smaller, B-cell antigen-negative, nonspecifIc esterase negative, and had a distinctive morphology on Wright-staIned smears. We conclude that fractionation of LAM based on autofluorescence is a powerful tool to isolate and characterize lung mononuclear cells that act eIther as stimulators or as suppressors of immune responses in the lung.
