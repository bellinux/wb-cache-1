Jean de Châtillon, who was a bishop, in 1144 gave the town of Saint-Malo the status of rights of asylum which encouraged all manner of thieves and rogues to move there. Their motto was [...] "Neither Breton, nor French, but from Saint-Malo am I!". Saint-Malo however, progressed and in 1308 the town was made into a free commune to encourage the commercial <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>craftsmen</b> as well as merchants and ship owners. This did not really work out and later in 1395 the town became a free port. This situation continued until 1688.|$|E
