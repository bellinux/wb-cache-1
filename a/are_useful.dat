5|$|Alcohols {{react with}} TiCl4 {{to give the}} {{corresponding}} alkoxides with the formula n (R = alkyl, n = 1, 2, 4). As indicated by their formula, these alkoxides can adopt complex structures ranging from monomers to tetramers. Such compounds <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> in materials science as well as organic synthesis. A well known derivative is titanium isopropoxide, which is a monomer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological {{categories such as}} root, stem, leaf, and trichome <b>are</b> <b>useful,</b> one has {{to keep in mind}} that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results. Furthermore, structures can be seen as processes, that is, process combinations.|$|E
5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E

5|$|Because {{species of}} aetosaurs {{typically}} have restricted fossil ranges and are {{abundant in the}} strata they are found in, they <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> in biochronology. Osteoderms {{are the most common}} remains associated with aetosaurs, so a single identifiable scute can accurately date the layer it is found in.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the Ca2+ ion, high {{coordination}} numbers are common, up to 24 in some intermetallic compounds such as CaZn13. Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as EDTA and polyphosphates, which <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water. In the absence of steric hindrance, smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed.|$|E
5|$|For {{all above}} {{mentioned}} X-ray diffraction methods, the scattering is elastic; the scattered X-rays {{have the same}} wavelength as the incoming X-ray. By contrast, inelastic X-ray scattering methods <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> in studying excitations of the sample, rather than the distribution of its atoms.|$|E

5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Am(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Am3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with americium and therefore <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides.|$|E
5|$|Glass fibers <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> thermal {{insulators}} {{because of}} their high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area makes them much more susceptible to chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of glass fiber make good thermal insulation, with a thermal conductivity {{of the order of}} 0.05 W/(m·K).|$|E
5|$|High {{redshift}} {{searches for}} supernovae usually involve {{the observation of}} supernova light curves. These <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> for standard or calibrated candles to generate Hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions. Supernova spectroscopy, used to study the physics and environments of supernovae, is more practical at low than at high redshift.|$|E
40|$|Purpose and methods: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} reformation of pre-graduate medical education on the students of years 2005 - 2007, we analyzed a questionnaire targeting those students after graduation. Results: General education has a low degree of usefulness for the students. Basic medical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> as a preparation for clinical medicine. Clinical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> in terms of knowledge and skill, but {{not in terms of}} attitude. Both general education and clinical education <b>were</b> somewhat <b>useful</b> for the older graduates. Among the new educational methods, only OSCE <b>was</b> <b>useful.</b> Conclusion: Reformation of pre-graduate medical education <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> especially in regard to clinical skill education...|$|R
60|$|A priori {{knowledge}} {{is not all}} of the logical kind we have been hitherto considering. Perhaps the most important example of non-logical a priori {{knowledge is}} knowledge as to ethical value. I am not speaking of judgements as to what <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> or as to what is virtuous, for such judgements do require empirical premisses; I am speaking of judgements as to the intrinsic desirability of things. If something <b>is</b> <b>useful,</b> it must <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> because it secures some end; the end must, if we have gone far enough, be valuable on its own account, and not merely because it <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> for some further end. Thus all judgements as to what <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> depend upon judgements as to what has value on its own account.|$|R

5|$|Integer {{powers of}} nonzero complex numbers {{are defined by}} {{repeated}} multiplication or division as above. If i is the imaginary unit and n is an integer, then i'n equals 1, i, −1, or −i, according to whether the integer n is congruent to 0, 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. Because of this, the powers of i <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> for expressing sequences of period 4.|$|E
5|$|Many dipterans serve {{roles that}} <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> to humans. Houseflies, blowflies and fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae) are {{scavengers}} and aid in decomposition. Robber flies (Asilidae), tachinids (Tachinidae) and dagger flies and balloon flies (Empididae) are predators and parasitoids of other insects, helping {{to control a}} variety of pests. Many dipterans such as bee flies (Bombyliidae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) are pollinators of crop plants.|$|E

5|$|The high {{temperature}} stability, low vapor pressure, {{good wear resistance}} and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> in self-cleaning electrical contacts. In particular, the discharge occurring during the switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide Re2O7 has poor stability (sublimes at ~360°C) and therefore is removed during the discharge.|$|E
