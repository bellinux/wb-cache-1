40|$|AbstractA {{new type}} of Fe-C-Si-B alloy was developed. The {{investigation}} on microstructure details and the mechanical properties were performed for different <b>austempering</b> combinations. The {{results indicated that the}} Fe-C-Si-B alloy comprises ferrite, pearlite and interdendritic eutectic borides in as-cast condition. The distribution of eutectic boride with a chemical formula of M 2 B (M represents Cr, Fe, Mn or Mo) and is much like that of carbide in high chromium white cast iron. Pure ausferrite structure that is consisted of bainitic ferrite and carbon-riched retained austenite can be obtained by <b>austempering</b> treatment to the Fe-C-Si-B alloy. No carbide would precipitate in the structure and there is not any morphology change of borides. The hardness of the Fe-C-Si-B alloy decreases with increasing of the <b>austempering</b> temperature, and decreases greatly in at the early stages (within 5 to 10 min) of <b>austempering</b> transformation. The transformation is almost finished after about 5 to 10 min when thehardness of the alloy does not change anymore. The Fe-C-Si-B alloy is a new kind of wear resistance material with bright application prospect...|$|R
40|$|Two {{low carbon}} {{carbide-free}} bainitic steels (with and without Cr addition) were designed, and each steel was treated by {{two kinds of}} heat treatment procedure (<b>austempering</b> and continuous cooling). The effects of Cr addition on bainitic transformation, microstructure, and properties of low carbon bainitic steels were investigated by dilatometry, metallography, X-ray diffraction, and a tensile test. The results show that Cr addition hinders the isothermal bainitic transformation, and this effect is more significant at higher transformation temperatures. In addition, Cr addition increases the tensile strength and elongation simultaneously for <b>austempering</b> treatment at a lower temperature. However, when the <b>austempering</b> temperature is higher, the strength increases and the elongation obviously decreases by Cr addition, resulting in the decrease in the product of tensile strength and elongation. Meanwhile, the <b>austempering</b> temperature should be lower in Cr-added steel than that in Cr-free steel {{in order to obtain}} better comprehensive properties. Moreover, for the continuous cooling treatment in the present study, the product of tensile strength and elongation significantly decreases with Cr addition due to more amounts of martensite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the changes on phase structures of niobium alloyed ductile iron after <b>austempering</b> process which started by austenitizing process at 900 ˚C and held at 350 ˚C for 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours in salt bath furnace. The phase structure were observed by light microscope, and then verified through X-Ray diffraction (XRD). The phase structure of as cast niobium alloyed ductile iron mainly consists of graphite nodules embedded in ferrite and pearlite phases with presence of niobium carbide. <b>Austempering</b> process {{resulted in the}} structure of graphite nodules embedded in ferrite platelets and bainitic structures. Increasing the <b>austempering</b> holding times had resulted in coarsening of the ferrite platelets structures and transformation from lower bainite to upper bainite structures...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{study was}} {{conducted}} on unalloyed ductile iron castings. The effect of <b>austempering</b> time was examined by varying <b>austempering</b> time {{in the range of}} 30 minutes to 90 minutes, while keeping austenitization temperature and <b>austempering</b> temperature constant. It was found that with the increase of <b>austempering</b> time, the tensile strength increased significantly. However, at 90 minutes the tensile strength decreased. The optimum temperature was found to be 60 minutes. The second variable was the effect of austenitization temperature on ductile iron. Based on the result of the first experiment, the <b>austempering</b> was carried out for 90 minutes. The <b>austempering</b> temperatures were kept at 270 ºC and 370 ºC. The austenitization temperature was varied from 850 ºC to 925 ºC. The study revealed that tensile strength increased at 900 ºC but it decreased at 925 ºC. The third major variable involving the effect of alloying additions on ductile iron, was studied by adding copper with three different values i. e. 0. 5 wt. %, 1. 0 wt. % and 1. 5 wt. %. The fourth melt was without the addition of copper. It was found that with the increase of copper the tensile strength continued to increase up to 1. 5 wt. %. The second alloying addition was nickel. One melt was made without nickel while the remaining three melts were made with the addition of 1. 0 wt. %, 2. 0 wt. % and 3. 0 % nickel. The tensile strength increased correspondingly with the increase in the addition of nickel to 3. 0 wt. %. The effect of a combination of copper and nickel on ductile iron was also examined. The effect of the last alloying element which was studied was lanthanum. Four melts were made for this study. The first melt was without the addition of lanthanum while the remaining three had 0. 006 wt. %, 0. 02 wt. % and 0. 03 wt. % lanthanum. The results indicated that the tensile strength increased with the increase of lanthanum content with and without <b>austempering.</b> Furthermore, the highest nodule count was obtained with 0. 03 wt. % lanthanum while the nodularity remained almost unchanged. Thus, it was observed that the addition of alloying elements results in an increase of tensile strength. The optimum <b>austempering</b> time was 90 minutes and the optimum austenitizing temperature was found to be 900 ºC...|$|R
50|$|<b>Austempering</b> is heat {{treatment}} that {{is applied to}} ferrous metals, most notably steel and ductile iron. In steel it produces a bainite microstructure whereas in cast irons it produces a structure of acicular ferrite and high carbon, stabilized austenite known as ausferrite. It is primarily used to improve mechanical properties or reduce / eliminate distortion. <b>Austempering</b> is defined by both {{the process and the}} resultant microstructure. Typical <b>austempering</b> process parameters applied to an unsuitable material will not result in the formation of bainite or ausferrite and thus the final product will not be called austempered. Both microstructures may also be produced via other methods. For example, they may be produced as-cast or air cooled with the proper alloy content. These materials are also not referred to as austempered.|$|R
