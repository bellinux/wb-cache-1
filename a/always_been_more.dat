Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.|$|E

Nowadays Sardinia is most known for its coasts (La Maddalena, Costa Smeralda), the north-western coast near Sassari (Alghero, Stintino, Castelsardo) and Cagliari, because these are easily reachable by ship and by plane.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of using only whole {{numbers in the}} definitions comes from practical considerations {{in the days when}} only whole cycles could be counted on paper records.

Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be – values for the upper end of alpha and lower end of beta include 12, 13, 14 and 15. If the threshold is taken as 14Hz, then the slowest beta wave has about the same duration as the longest spike (70ms), which makes this the most useful value.|$|E
25|$|The Office of Vespers is {{the only}} one which has {{remained}} popular (excepting, of course, the Holy Sacrifice, which is not consider here as an Office) among Roman Catholics up to the present day. Matins and Lauds, on account of the hour at which they are celebrated, have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> or less inaccessible to the faithful; likewise the little hours, except, perhaps, Terce, which serves as an introduction to the Mass. Vespers, on the contrary, occupies a privileged place {{towards the end of the}} day. On Sundays it is the Office most likely to bring the faithful together in church for the second time and thus becomingly completes the Divine Service for that day. It is quite conformable to tradition, moreover, to invest this Office with a particular solemnity. The Vesper psalms, as well as the hymns and antiphons, are well calculated to edify the faithful. Lastly, the ancient custom of having a lection or reading from the Old, or New Testament, or from the homilies of the Fathers, might well in certain cases and to a certain extent be re-adopted, or serve as the subject matter for the sermon which is sometimes delivered at this service.|$|E

500|$|The ao dai has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> {{common in}} the South than in the North. The communists, who gained power in the North in 1954 and in the South in the 1975, had {{conflicted}} feelings about the ao dai.

500|$|As {{purebred}} dogs, beagles have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> {{popular in}} the United States and Canada than in their native country England. The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased. In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the Westminster Kennel Club's show and by 1939 a beagle – Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman – had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year. [...] On 12 February 2008, a beagle, K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno), won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show {{for the first time}} in the competition's history. In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years. From 1953 to 1959 the beagle was ranked No. 1 on the list of the American Kennel Club's registered breeds; in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered. In the UK they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively. In the United States the beagle ranked 4th most popular breed in 2012 and 2013, behind the Labrador Retriever (#1), German Shepherd (#2) and Golden Retriever (#3) breeds.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the Record Plant and Young Vic sessions, recording with Johns went well as he was primarily concerned about creating a good sound, whereas Lambert had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> preoccupied about the group's image. Townshend recalled, [...] "we were just getting astounded at the sounds Glyn was producing". Townshend used the early synthesizers and modified keyboard sounds in several modes: as a drone effect on several songs, notably [...] "Baba O'Riley" [...] and [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", {{as well as on}} [...] "Bargain", [...] "Going Mobile" [...] and [...] "The Song Is Over". The synthesizer was used {{as an integral part of}} the sound, as opposed to providing gloss as was the case on other artists' albums up to this point. [...] Moon's drumming had a distinctly different style from earlier albums, being more formal and less reliant on long drum fills – partly due to the synthesizer backing, but also due to the no-nonsense production techniques of Johns, who insisted on a good recording performance that only used flamboyancy when truly necessary. Johns was instrumental in convincing the Who that they should simply put a single studio album out, believing the songs to be excellent. The group gave him free rein to assemble a single album of whatever songs he wanted in any order. Despite Johns' key contributions, he only received an associate producer credit on the finished album, though he maintained he acted mainly in an engineering capacity and based most of the arrangements on Townshend's original demos.|$|E

Rashad's acting had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> straight-faced to counter Cosby's humor, typically playing straight woman to Cosby's comedic antics. In preparation for the second season, Cosby decided to provide Rashad with more comedic material upon learning that the actress is [...] "capable of handling comedy on her own–without Cliff." [...] Jets Robert E. Johnson observed that Rashad portrays her character using [...] "soft, sophisticated humor". The sixth season episode [...] "Off to See the Wretched", in which Clair scolds Vanessa for traveling to Baltimore to see a rock concert against her parents' orders, features Rashad's most [...] "uncontrolled" [...] performance as the character. Speaking fondly of his co-star, Cosby said [...] "There's nobody whom I can be more thankful about than Phylicia." [...] In {{the aftermath of a}} highly publicized article originally published in TV Guide before the series premiered that labeled Cosby [...] "one of the most arrogant celebrities", Rashad took over the majority of the show's promotional appearances herself. Rashad also defended Cosby against the accusations, calling him [...] "one of the most intelligent people I have ever known. In addition to being a few years younger than Clair was originally intended to be, Rashad is only 10 years older than actress Sabrina LeBeauf, who portrays eldest child Sondra. Meanwhile, actress Ethel Ayler, who portrays Clair's mother Carrie, is only 14 years her senior. Originally, actress Clarice Taylor auditioned for the role of Carrie, deliberately making herself over in attempt to look young enough to play Rashad's mother before Cosby ultimately cast her as his own character's.|$|E
