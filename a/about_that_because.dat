25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E

Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's eulogy John Richardson depicted it as devout: [...] "To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one conversion. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood".|$|E

I'm pleased that the Old Gods are being resurrected, {{for want of a better}} word. Old symbols. I feel very pleased that I am a part of that process and that I have had influence. At this stage in the game, so to speak, it's not false modesty to say that I am content with my influence." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{plan to go}} {{to college}} thought, and I try to do {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> action, <b>because</b> I cannot simply command myself not to be afraid anymore (by means of rational decision). This is a direct relation between thought and action.|$|R

2500|$|In October 2002, the Bogdanovs {{released}} an email containing apparently supportive statements by Laurent Freidel, then {{a visiting professor}} at the Perimeter Institute. [...] Soon after, Freidel denied writing any such remarks, telling the press that he had forwarded a message containing that text to a friend. The Bogdanovs then attributed the quoted passages to Freidel, who said, [...] "I'm very upset <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> I have received e-mail from {{people in the community}} asking me why I've defended the Bogdanov brothers. When your name is used without your consent, it's a violation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling has said, [...] "I've taken horrible liberties with {{folklore}} and mythology, but I'm quite unashamed <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> British {{folklore and}} British mythology {{is a totally}} bastard mythology. You know, we've been invaded by people, we've appropriated their gods, we've taken their mythical creatures, and we've soldered them all together to make, what I would say, {{is one of the}} richest folklores in the world, because it's so varied. So I feel no compunction about borrowing from that freely, but adding a few things of my own." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on the Israelis and the Palestinians.... I have concerns <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> Hamas is a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will sit down with the Iranians without any preconditions, I just think that that puts us in a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E

In {{the first round of}} assets, I'd {{look at it and say}} that doesn't look like JellyCar, and they'd ask what it was {{supposed}} to look like. I'd not really thought <b>about</b> <b>that</b> stuff, <b>because</b> it had always been this really personal thing. But it was really exciting, and it's really cool to be a part of that." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, {{the writing}} team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being {{considered}} {{to direct the}} film. Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for [...] "chemistry". The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers, the directors of Captain America: Civil War. By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and Jon Watts also in consideration, while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite. On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man, and that Watts would direct the film. The Russos [...] "were pretty vocal about who [...] wanted for the part", pushing to cast an actor close {{to the age of}} Peter Parker in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. Watts was able to read the Civil War script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film. He was able to [...] "see what they were doing with it" [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like [...] "so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said, [...] "I was really excited <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> the other movies have shown what I described as the Penthouse level of the Marvel world, what it’s like to be Thor, Iron Man, you know, a billionaire playboy and all of that stuff. But what’s great about Spider-Man is that he’s a regular kid and so by showing his story you also get to show what the ground level is like in a world where the Avengers exist".|$|E

500|$|Van Morrison {{regarded}} Street Choir poorly, {{as he told}} biographer Ritchie Yorke in 1973: [...] "Somewhere {{along the}} line I lost control of that album. I'd rather not think <b>about</b> <b>that</b> album <b>because</b> it doesn't mean much {{in terms of where}} I was at... the album didn't sell very well and I'm glad." [...] Morrison first lost control of the album before its release, when it was retitled from Virgo's Fool to His Band and the Street Choir: ...|$|R
2500|$|... "However, {{there is}} also a balance between look and technology," [...] adds Tippett. [...] "The body count of the wolves escalates and because we're adding a great deal more hair to get the right texture, that fur really ups the {{rendering}} time. We've gone from four wolves to eight to twelve, to sixteen in Part 2. So {{we have to be very}} careful <b>about</b> <b>that</b> balance, <b>because</b> it takes hundreds of hours to render each wolf." ...|$|R

You mustn't mind losing the money, if they can't pay it,--and it's like enough they can't. The note's in that box, mind! I allays meant to be good to you, Gritty," [...] said Mr. Tulliver, turning to his sister; [...] "but you know you aggravated me when you would have Moss." ...|$|R

Still, you'll keep the old hands until you can pension them; and there's Bob, my old pony--I shouldn't like him sold." ...|$|E
50|$|The first {{competition}} for the monument was opened in 1912, but the outbreak of World War I postponed the raising of the monument.

60|$|Now she had got a start, and {{she went}} on and {{told me all about}} the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she {{reckoned}} Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> I wanted him and me to be together.|$|E
60|$|Danny Meadow Mouse limped around {{through the}} dear Old Briar-patch, {{where he had}} lived with Peter Rabbit ever since he had squirmed out of the claws of Hooty the Owl and dropped there, right {{at the feet of}} Peter Rabbit. Danny limped because he was still lame and sore from Hooty's terrible claws, but he didn't let himself think much <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> he was so thankful to be alive at all. So he limped around in the Old Briar-patch, picking up seed which had fallen on the snow, and {{sometimes}} pulling down a few of the red berries which cling all winter to the wild rose bushes. The seeds in these were very nice indeed, and Danny always felt especially good after a meal of them.|$|E
5000|$|John Deacon's bass {{line was}} {{inspired}} by the song [...] "Good Times" [...] by the disco group Chic. In an interview with NME, Chic co-founder Bernard Edwards stated, [...] "...that Queen record came <b>about</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> Queen bass player... spent some time hanging out with us at our studio".|$|R
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song, <b>because</b> the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|R
5000|$|Self-schemas {{vary from}} person to person because each {{individual}} has very different social and cultural life experiences. A few examples of self-schemas are: exciting or dull; quiet or loud; healthy or sickly; athletic or nonathletic; lazy or active; and geek or jock. If a person has a schema for [...] "geek or jock," [...] for example, he might think of himself as a bit of a computer geek and would possess a lot of information <b>about</b> <b>that</b> trait. <b>Because</b> of this, he would probably interpret many situations based on relevance to his being a computer geek.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{assure you}} she is, my lord,' {{returned}} Mrs Nickleby. 'When {{she was at}} school in Devonshire, she was universally allowed to be beyond all exception the very cleverest girl there, {{and there were a}} great many very clever ones too, and that's the truth--twenty-five young ladies, fifty guineas a year without the et-ceteras, both the Miss Dowdles the most accomplished, elegant, fascinating creatures--Oh dear me!' said Mrs Nickleby, 'I never shall forget what pleasure she used to give me and her poor dear papa, when she was at that school, never--such a delightful letter every half-year, telling us that she was the first pupil in the whole establishment, and had made more progress than anybody else! I can scarcely bear to think of it even now. The girls wrote all the letters themselves,' added Mrs Nickleby, 'and the writing-master touched them up afterwards with a magnifying glass and a silver pen; at least I think they wrote them, though Kate was never quite certain <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> she didn't know the handwriting of hers again; but anyway, I know it was a circular which they all copied, and of course it was a very gratifying thing--very gratifying.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next town}} is Mount Pleasant; {{that is where}} the Williamsport road passes the railway. If we keep south we shall strike the railway, and that will take us to Mount Pleasant. After that the road goes on to Florence on the Tennessee River. The only place that I know of on the road is Lawrenceburg. That is about forty miles from here, and I have heard that the Yankees are on the line from there right and left. I believe our troops are at Florence; but I am not sure <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> both parties are {{constantly}} shifting their position, and I hear very little, as you may suppose, of what is being done. Anyhow, I think we cannot do better than go on until we strike the railway, keep along by that till we get within a short distance of Mount Pleasant, and then cross it. After that we can decide whether we will travel by the road or keep on through the woods. But we cannot find our way through the woods at night; we should lose ourselves before we had gone twenty yards." ...|$|E

You are to read that writing or to get it read and to print {{it so that the}} world may read it also. She said that 'Hubert' wishes you to do so. I am sure the name was Hubert, though she also spoke of him with some other title which I do not understand. That's all I can remember, except something about a city, yes, a City of Gold and a last great battle in which Hubert fell, covered with glory and conquering. I understood that she wanted to talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it isn't in the writing, but you interrupted and of course she's gone. Yes, the price is £50 and not a farthing less, but you can pay it when you like for I know you're as honest as most, and whether you pay it or not, you must have that chest and what's in it and no one else." ...|$|E
