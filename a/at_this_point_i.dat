That nation has a magnificent temple, which is called Uppsala, located not far from the city of Sigtuna. In this temple, built entirely of gold, the people worship the statues of three gods.|$|E
500|$|Another {{influence}} from Old English sources is {{the appearance of}} named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade [...] "Sting" [...] we see Bilbo's acceptance {{of the kinds of}} cultural and linguistic practices found in Beowulf, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself. This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon's hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring Beowulf and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, [...] "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> fancy the author of Beowulf would say much the same." ...|$|E
500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E

500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heigl {{responded by}} saying that Rogen had [...] "handled that so beautifully," [...] and that she felt nothing but [...] "love and respect" [...] for him. [...] "It was so long ago <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> just wish him so much goodness, and I felt that from him, too," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|After his retirement, {{he started}} an {{automobile}} and street rod restoration business. In 2007, Hofmann said, [...] "I sold the business {{last year and}} am effectively retired <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> bought a motorhome and took a trip {{all over the country}} with my wife, Susie, who is Johnny West's sister and a former worker on the NHRA Safety Safari team.

2500|$|Music critics, despite giving {{favorable}} reviews, noted Spears' apparent lack {{of input}} on Femme Fatale. Singer-songwriter Ryan Tedder defended her, stating that [...] " [...] Sinatra didn't write a song, Garth Brooks barely wrote anything, George Strait has had I think 51 No. 1's and {{he has yet to}} write a song. Rascal Flatts are one of the biggest country acts in the world, and all of their hits are written by other people." [...] Spears responded to further criticism of her performing abilities, [...] "I don’t really have anything to prove <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> just do it for fun and see what happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{fans have}} heatedly debated his sexual orientation, Shawn Pyfrom has denied that Andrew is totally homosexual, {{implying}} he is bisexual. When asked whether Andrew was specifically gay or bisexual, Pyfrom stated [...] "I really don’t even know <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> mean, {{he did make}} that statement [...] I think he’s a little more gay than he is straight, though." [...] In [...] "My Husband, the Pig", he refers to Austin as a [...] "dog" [...] and himself as a [...] "dog-lover". Whatever Andrew is, {{he is one of}} a few LGBT teens on television secure with his sexuality. Marc Cherry has commented, [...] "Andrew Van de Kamp is perhaps the most empowered gay teen in the history of television. He's gay and he doesn't care." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 29, 2013 DiFranco {{issued an}} apology, announcing {{that she was}} {{cancelling}} the retreat, stating that [...] "i am not unaware of the mechanism of white privilege {{or the fact that}} i need to listen more than talk when it comes to issues of race. if nottoway is simply not an acceptable place for me to go and try to do my work in the eyes of many, then let me just concede before more divisive words are spilled. ... i think many positive and life-affirming connections would have been made at this conference, in its all of its complexity of design. [...] {{i do not wish to}} reinvent the righteous retreat at this point to eliminate the stay at the Nottoway Plantation. <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> wish only to cancel." [...] The singer's statements were called [...] "remarkably unapologetic" [...] on Jezebel, and [...] "a variety of excuses and justifications" [...] by Ebony,. Additionally, a piece at The Guardian said the announcement made [...] "much of the idea that this was all a mistake, with no indication of remorse." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 29, 2000, Blizzard {{launched}} {{the second game}} of the Diablo series, Diablo II. In 2001, Uelmen, who composed the Diablo II Soundtrack, and cinematic soundtrack composers Jason Hayes, Glenn Stafford and Andrea Pessino won the International Game Developers Association award for Excellence in Audio for their work on Diablo II. Continuing {{his work in the}} Diablo series, on June 29, 2001, Blizzard launched what would be believed to be the last game of the series, the expansion pack [...] In an interview with Gamasutra, Uelmen was asked about his time at Blizzard between 2001 and 2005. When asked whether he had worked on the earlier version of Diablo III prior to the shutdown of Blizzard North, he responded, [...] "I guess <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> can say, yes, more or less. Blizzard has always had a number of projects, though, {{that may or may not}} see the light of day. Some of those have been talked about, but there definitely was more than one thing going on development-wise at the time." ...|$|E

5000|$|Powell anthropomorphises {{the error}} as the robot {{twiddling}} its [...] "fingers" [...] whenever it becomes overwhelmed by its job. This {{is another example}} of Asimov's writing of robopsychology - personified by Susan Calvin - as running parallel to human psychology. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in <b>I,</b> Robot, the reader has already seen hysteria and religious mania.|$|R
60|$|Well, it was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that <b>I</b> made an error--a {{very serious}} error {{it must be}} admitted.

60|$|Fortunately {{the tank}} was deep <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> and <b>I</b> {{suffered}} no injury from the fall, but as I was {{rising to the}} surface my mind filled with the horrors of my position as I thought of the terrible doom which awaited me the moment {{the eyes of the}} reptiles fell upon the creature that had disturbed their slumber.|$|R
