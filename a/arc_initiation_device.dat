40|$|Corrugated {{stainless}} steel tubing (CSST) {{has been used}} for more than 20 years as a replacement for conventional black iron gas piping. CSST has a thinner tubing wall and is susceptible to damage from lightning activity when discharges enter a structure, potentially resulting in perforation of the CSST wall and fire ignition. Grounding has been promoted by CSST manufacturers as a solution to this problem. We use modeling and simulation of voltage potentials and arc currents to evaluate the effects of grounding on the voltage potential across CSST, which can result in <b>arc</b> <b>initiation,</b> and charge through the arc, which can result in melting and perforation of the CSST wall. Our results show multiple scenarios where a 10 kA 10 × 350 s current waveform with 1 Ω grounding of the CSST still results in voltages greater than the <b>arc</b> <b>initiation</b> threshold of 25 kV and charge through the arc greater than 1. 2 C, the perforation threshold we measured. For the case where lightning enters the structure through an outdoor light fixture or chimney, the presence of a grounding wire increases the charge through the arc from 0. 13 C to 2. 22 C. These results indicate that good grounding of CSST will not necessarily prevent <b>arc</b> <b>initiation</b> nor perforation of the CSST wall by lightning. Good grounding may in fact exacerbate the problem of lightning damage to CSST depending on where lightning enters the building and the electrical parameters of the path to ground...|$|R

Previous studies into the <b>arc</b> <b>initiation</b> process {{have shown that the}} most probable arcing sites tend to occur at the triple junction involving the conductor, dielectric and plasma. More recently our own experiments have led us to believe that water vapor is the main causal factor behind the <b>arc</b> <b>initiation</b> process. Assuming the main component of the expelled plasma cloud by weight is water, the fastest process available is dissociative recombination (H 2 O(+) + e(-) (goes to) H* + OH*). A model that agrees with the observed dependency of arc current pulse width on the square root of capacitance is presented. A 400 MHz digital storage scope and current probe was used to detect arcs at the triple junction of a solar array. Simultaneous measurements of the arc trigger pulse, the gate pulse, the arc current and the arc voltage were then obtained. Finally, a large number of measurements of individual arc spectra were obtained in very short time intervals, ranging from 10 to 30 microseconds, using a 1 / 4 a spectrometer coupled with a gated intensified CCD. The spectrometer was systematically tuned to obtain optical arc spectra over the entire wavelength range of 260 to 680 nanometers.

40|$|Electrical {{arc flash}} hazard {{mitigation}} techniques {{focus on the}} reduction of hazard levels in an electrical power system. Analysis of arc incident energies pre- and post-mitigation to reduce hazard levels shows that risk control measures can lead to significant reductions in potential harm and damage should an arc flash occur. However, mitigation methods alone do not necessarily prevent <b>arc</b> <b>initiation.</b> This paper reports {{an investigation into the}} <b>initiation</b> of electrical <b>arcs</b> {{within the context of a}} study into new approaches to reduce the hazard posed by arc flash. In addition to the local physical arrangement of the busbars, onset of the arc is influenced by specific weaknesses or defects of the insulation system. However, the influence of these local factors diminishes once the arc is formed. Thereafter, arc current and the power dissipated in the arc depend both on the ability of the surrounding network to sustain the electrical discharge and on transient interactions between the impedance of the feeder network and the impedance of the arc itself. To study <b>arc</b> <b>initiation</b> with the aim of identifying factors that could reduce the likelihood of arc onset, measurements of short-term arc characteristics under various initial conditions are presented. Measurements primarily concern the time-domain transient voltage and current waveforms in an experimental configuration designed to allow variation of parameters that may influence <b>arc</b> <b>initiation.</b> These waveforms are captured on a nanosecond timescale so that the temporal development of arc power and impedance can be analysed as a function of different initiation mechanisms.

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{initiation}} of the Aleutian Subduction Zone, forming {{the boundary between}} the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, remains elusive. A continuous belt of arc volcanism extended from mainland Alaska to the Siberian margin with the youngest volcanism along the Beringian margin ranging from 54 - 50 Ma (Davies et al., 1989, CanJEarthSci 26). Magnetic anomalies indicate that plate motion changed from a northerly to a westerly direction at ~ 56 - 53 Ma (chron 25 - 24). Thereafter volcanism shifted to the Aleutian Arc, presumably trapping a fragment of the Kula plate that formed the basement of the Bering Sea. Interestingly the oldest rocks from the forearcs of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) and the Tonga subduction systems yield ages of 50 - 52 Ma (e. g. Reagan et al. 2013, EPSL 380; Meffre et al., 2013, G 3 _ 13), suggesting subduction initiation as a consequence of a Pacific-wide tectonic reorganization. Did the Aleutian Arc also form during this plate-wide event? The oldest Aleutian ages come from the submarine Murray Canyon in the central Aleutian Arc (46 Ma; Jicha et al., 2006, Geology 34) and from Medny, the smaller Komandorsky Island, in the westernmost Aleutians (47 Ma). The earliest volcanism on Medny (47 - 21 Ma) is tholeiitic with clear subduction-related incompatible element signatures, e. g. relative enrichments in mobile elements such as U, Sr and Pb and depletions in Nb and Ta. Isotopic compositions for Sr-Nd-Pb indicate contributions from subducted sediment and ocean crust, as well as Komandorsky mantle wedge. In the IBM and Tonga Arc systems, boninites have been found among the earliest lavas. In contrast, no boninites have been found in the Aleutians thus far, which could suggest that the oldest lavas have not been found and that subduction may also have initiated earlier, possibly also between 52 - 50 Ma.

30|$|Volcanic arc retreat {{sometimes}} {{results from}} a shallowing of slab dip, but in this case, {{and especially in the}} Mariana Arc, the present-day slab dip is almost vertical. Assuming that it has been continually vertical, which is unlikely, the margin’s front has retreated by at least 150  km through consumption of the material constituting the lower section of the margin following a mechanism depicted in Lallemand et al. (1992) or Lallemand (1998). This appraisal is extremely conservative, and a more realistic estimate would consider the margin's retreat to be at least 200 km because the slab dip was probably shallower in the past and because the oldest record of arc activity recovered in the fore-arc is younger than the presumed <b>arc</b> <b>initiation</b> at ∼ 52 Ma (see section 1.5; Ishizuka et al. 2011 a).

The Eo-Oligo-Lower Miocene paleo-arc is located a very short distance from the trench, varying from a few kilometers in the Mariana fore-arc to 90 km in northern Japan where the volcanic arc retreated by ∼ 210 km during the last 23 Ma.

The rapid southward shallowing of the trench floor along the southern Philippine Trench, the type of faulting affecting {{both sides of the}} trench, the lack of significant interplate seismicity, and the concentration of the seismicity beneath the Miangas-Talaud Ridge are interpreted as a slowing down of the subduction along this branch of the Philippine Trench compared {{with the rest of the}} subduction zone. The Sangihe deformation front has been recognized up to 7 øN but seems active only south of 6 øN...|$|R
40|$|In the {{protozoan}} parasite Entamoeba histolytica (which causes amoebiasis in humans), the rRNA genes (rDNA) in {{the nucleus}} are carried on an extrachromosomal circular plasmid. For strain HM- 1 :IMSS, {{the size of}} the rDNA plasmid is 24. 5 kb, and 200 copies per genome are present. Each circle contains two rRNA transcription units as inverted repeats separated by upstream and downstream spacers. We have studied the replication of this molecule by neutral/neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by electron microscopy. All restriction fragments analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gave signals corresponding to simple Y’s and bubbles. This showed that replication initiated in this plasmid at multiple, dispersed locations spread throughout the plasmid. On the basis of the intensity of the bubble <b>arcs,</b> <b>initiations</b> from the rRNA transcrip-tion units seemed to occur more frequently than those from intergenic spacers. Multiple, dispersed initiation sites were also seen in the rDNA plasmid of strain HK- 9 when it was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Electron microscopic visualization of replicating plasmid molecules in strain HM- 1 :IMSS showed multiple replication bubbles in the same molecule. The location of bubbles on the rDNA circle was mapped by digesting with PvuI or BsaHI, which linearize the molecule, and with SacII, which cuts the circle twice. The distance of the bubbles {{from one end of the}} molecule was measured by electron microscopy. The data corroborated those from two-dimensional gels and showed that replication bubbles were distributed through...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{essentially}} {{presents the}} experimental {{investigation of the}} fundamental phenomena of electric fuse element disintegration and its causation and influence on the subsequent fragmentation of the fuse elements when subjected to excessive fault currents. The basis of the study involved experimental observation of disintegration of fuse elements and {{the analysis of the}} dynamic responses of current-carrying conductors, which precipitate disintegration. The experimental techniques employed utilised commercially available video cameras to capture images of element disruptions during disintegration of fuse elements subjected to low short-circuit and high overload currents. Specialist experimental image capturing techniques and hardware implementations were developed to enable investigation of element disintegration caused by high short-circuit fault currents. Disintegration phenomena of fuse elements for all fault cases were compared within different time domains, which included specialist techniques to investigate disintegration of elements in sand and against glass substrates. Disintegration phenomena of elements in unconfined media such as air and water also constituted the studies. The studies diverged, finally, into experimental observations of the temporal development of <b>arc</b> <b>initiation</b> and extinction phenomena of fault current limiting of HBC fuses using spectroscopic analysis of the arc light radiation. The range of studies covered have led to new understandings of fundamental current limiting behaviour of HBC and open type fuses which contribute, in a small way, to the knowledge base of the subject and hopefully will be an aid to improved designs and development of new types of electric fuse...|$|R
