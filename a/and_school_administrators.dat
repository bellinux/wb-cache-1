5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{education}} at New Harmony involves several teachers who were already well-established in their fields before they moved to New Harmony, largely {{through the efforts of}} William Maclure. These Pestalozzian educators included Marie Duclos Fretageot and Joseph Neef. By the time Maclure arrived in New Harmony he had already established the first Pestalozzian school in America. Fretageot and Neef had been Pestalozzian educators <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> at Maclure’s schools in Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Discipline in {{educational}} institutions {{from high school}} and up (including vocational schools) are the responsibility of military officers stationed at the individual schools (as opposed to elementary and junior high school where teachers <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> were responsible for discipline). In addition to the normal subjects, students are also required to attend a military education class covering issues such as civil defense, military drills, national defense, and basic firearms. In the past, high (and vocational) school students were expected to take on civil defense duties in the event of national emergency. Boys and girls were trained to use firearms and hurl grenades.|$|E

25|$|May and Edwin W. Thompson, a {{mathematics}} {{teacher from}} Paw Paw, Michigan, were married on March 2, 1872. The couple met {{while she was}} teaching in Plainwell, Michigan. In 1873 the Thompsons moved to Franklin, Indiana, where they continued their careers as educators <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>administrators,</b> but they resigned the following year to assume teaching positions at Indianapolis High School, later known as Shortridge High School. The Thompsons moved to Indianapolis in 1874 and lived in a neighborhood known as College Corner. They became members of the College Corner Club, joined the Indianapolis Woman Suffrage Society, which was formed in April 1873, and were members of a local Unitarian church. After contracting tuberculosis, Thompson went to a sanitarium in Asheville, North Carolina, to try and regain his health. May joined him at Asheville, where he died on August 19, 1875. May returned to Indianapolis after his death to resume teaching.|$|E

2500|$|The {{report said}} that {{to the extent that}} {{district}} Board members, its Superintendent (who learned of TheftTrack at a meeting of his Cabinet in 2008), and its principals were aware of TheftTrack's capabilities, they [...] "did not appreciate the potential of that ability to raise serious privacy concerns, and they should have sought more information … or advice" [...] from the district lawyer. [...] The report also said that school Board members <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> who knew that tracking was in place failed to ask the right questions regarding privacy issues, district lawyers didn't probe the legal considerations of handing out computers, and administrators didn't talk about the ramifications. [...] It noted that Harriton High School Principal Kline, for example, learned about TheftTrack monitoring in September 2008, and said he asked DiMedio whether the district should advise students and parents about it. [...] But he never revisited the subject after DiMedio opined that the district should not because doing so would undermine TheftTrack's effectiveness. [...] The report faulted district administrators and staffers for failing to disclose and mismanaging the surveillance system, and for failing to establish strict policies to protect [...] "unsuspecting" [...] students' privacy.|$|E
2500|$|Bradford {{joined the}} faculty of Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law {{in the fall of}} 2002 after serving in the Army Reserve. In 2005 Bradford accused Professor Florence Roisman of {{opposing}} his tenure because of some of his conservative views. The official reason given was that Prof. Bradford was [...] "uncollegial." [...] The feud became a national one when Fox News and FrontPage magazine.com, among others, continually reported on the controversy. [...] Bradford claimed that his support of the Iraq War and his refusal to sign a letter in defense of Ward Churchill were contributing factors. [...] "The presumption was that I've got to sign this thing because I'm an Indian, but I can't do that," [...] he said. Roisman has denied most of Bradford's claims <b>and</b> <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> pointed out that Bradford never actually applied for tenure and as such no vote to approve or deny tenure to Bradford was held. Instead there was simply a non-binding straw poll to determine his colleagues' opinions as to whether he would receive tenure were he to apply. It was soon discovered many of the postings in support of Bradford on Indy Law Net were in fact written by Bradford himself under alternate accounts (all of the messages came from the same IP address). Bradford later admitted to using fake names to post “cheap shots, schoolyard bickering.” In October 2005, Bradford stated that Judge David J. Dreyer of Marion Superior Court had issued a temporary restraining order barring professors from speaking ill of or taking any actions against Bradford. However, Court records and sources both indicate that Bradford never filed for any sort of injunction and that no restraining order was ever issued.|$|E
