The story of Artemisia formed an iconography for Catherine and reinforced her right to serve as regent. The later female regents Marie de' Medici (1610–20) and Anne of Austria (1643–60) revived this iconography in their own service.|$|E

5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

It {{is the home}} of Stowe School, an {{independent}} school and is owned by the Stowe House Preservation Trust who have to date (March 2013) spent more than £25m on the restoration of the house.

Barney was also impressed with newcomer Parker: [...] "She's an agile actress who can deliver a sense of soft-spoken warmth but also a steely fierceness that comes with an underlying message: 'Underestimate me <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> peril.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Fuseli's other Macbeth Woodmason {{painting}} Macbeth and the Armed Head {{depicts a}} later {{scene in which}} Macbeth is shown MacDuff and warned {{to be wary of}} him. Fuseli evidently intended the two paintings to be juxtaposed. He said, [...] "when Macbeth meets with the witches on the heath, it is terrible, because he did not expect the supernatural visitation; but when he goes to the cave to ascertain his fate, it is no longer a subject of terror." [...] Fuseli chose to make MacDuff a near-likeness of Macbeth himself, and considered the painting one of his most poetic in that sense, asking, [...] "'What would be a greater object of terror to you if, some night on going home, you were to find yourself sitting <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> table [...] [...] [...] would not this make a powerful impression on your mind?" ...|$|E

She commended Padukone's looks, although she criticized aspects of her stagecraft skills. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the film 2.5 stars, saying, [...] "Chennai Express evokes a few laughs but otherwise it decides to shift tracks from droll comedy to dreadful drama." [...] Khalid Mohamed of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2.5 stars and wrote, [...] "board Chennai Express <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> risk". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 2/5 rating and said the film was a [...] "big, fat" [...] bore. He commented that Chennai Express was a [...] "bloated vanity project", and felt that the lead actor could have performed better.

500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
