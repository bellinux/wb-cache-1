50|$|<b>Amperozide</b> is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic of the diphenylbutylpiperazine class {{which acts}} as an antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor. It does not block dopamine receptors as with most antipsychotic drugs, but does inhibit dopamine release, and alters the firing pattern of dopaminergic neurons. It was investigated {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia in humans, but never adopted clinically. Its main use is instead in veterinary medicine, primarily in intensively farmed pigs, for decreasing aggression and stress and thereby increasing feeding and productivity.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to reduce piglet stress and improve performance following moving and mixing at weaning by use of the anti-aggressive drug <b>amperozide</b> {{and the practice of}} co-mingling piglets during lactation. Thirty-six piglets weaned at 29 days of age were allocated to a 2 Ã— 2 factorial arrangement of treatments as follows: (1) injection of 1 ml <b>amperozide</b> or placebo (0. 9 % saline) at the time of weaning, and (2) co-mingling or no comingling of piglets from day 10 of lactation to weaning. At weaning all piglets were injected with pliytohaemagglutinin or saline, their change in skin-fold thickness was measured 24 h later and behaviour was recorded every 5 min for the first 120 min after weaning. At 4 and 24 h after weaning the depth and extent of injuries were recorded. Daily live-weight gain, apparent voluntary food intake and food conversion ratio were not improved (P > 0. 05) by administration of <b>amperozide</b> or co-mingling of piglets during lactation. Cell-mediated immunity, as evidenced by a 0. 17 proportional decrease (P <; 0. 001) in skin-fold thickness following the injection of phytohaemagglutinin, was decreased in piglets not given <b>amperozide</b> at weaning. Injection of <b>amperozide</b> caused a 0. 26 proportional increase (P < 0. 001) in the amount of time piglets spent lying and caused piglets to display no interest in the feeder (P < 0. 001) in the first 2 h after weaning. Consequently piglets not given <b>amperozide</b> were more active, spent more time at the feeder and participated in more aggressive encounters (P < 0. 01). A significant interaction occurred between co-mingling and <b>amperozide</b> for mean injury score at both 4 (P < 0. 01) and 24 h (P < 0. 05) after weaning. When measured 4 h after weaning, co-mingling of piglets during suckling reduced mean injury score regardless of whether piglets were given <b>amperozide</b> or not at weaning. When piglets were not allowed to co-mingle during lactation, <b>amperozide</b> reduced mean injury score proportionately by around 0 - 44 (P < 0. 01) compared with piglets administered with saline. Despite the administration of <b>amperozide</b> and the practice of comingling causing a reduction in stress and an improvement in welfare in {{this experiment}}, there was no beneficial effect on performance in the first 2 weeks after weaning...|$|E
40|$|The {{receptor}} pharmacology of <b>amperozide</b> {{was investigated}} with in vitro radioligand binding technique. <b>Amperozide</b> possessed a high affinity to the 5 -HT 2 receptors (Ki = 16. 5 +/- 2. 1 nM) and a moderate affinity to alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors of rat cerebral cortical membranes (Ki = 172 +/- 14 nM). The affinity of <b>amperozide</b> for striatal and limbic dopamine D 2 receptors {{was low and}} not significantly different (Ki +/- S. E. M. = 540 +/- 59 nM vs 403 +/- 42 nM; p less than 0. 11, n = 4). The affinity for striatal and limbic 5 -HT 2 receptors was measured as well and found to be {{very close to the}} affinity to the cerebral cortical 5 -HT 2 receptor. The drug affinity for D 2 and 5 -HT 2 receptors seems thus not to be influenced by the location of the receptor moiety. The affinity for several other rat brain receptors such as 5 -HT 1 A, alpha 2 -adrenergic, dopamine D 1, muscarinic M 1 and M 2, opiate sigma and beta 2 -adrenergic was low. The pseudo-Hill coefficient of the <b>amperozide</b> competition binding curve was consistently higher than one indicating antagonistic and complex interactions with the 5 -HT 2 receptor or with alpha 1 -adrenergic and dopamine D 2 receptors. The antagonistic properties of <b>amperozide</b> were investigated by its ability to antagonize the serotonin-induced formation of inositol- 1 -phosphate in human blood platelets. <b>Amperozide</b> inhibited this 5 -HT 2 receptor-mediated intracellular response with similar potency as ketanserin. These results suggest that <b>amperozide</b> is a selective 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of <b>amperozide,</b> a 5 -HT 2 A {{receptor}} antagonist, which is used as an antipsychotic, with the effects paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) which is used as an antidepressant and for the treatment of social anxiety, on social behavior in tethered rats. Paroxetine was administered via an intraperitoneal injection (0. 0, 0. 1, 1. 0, and 10. 0 mg/kg). <b>Amperozide</b> was administered via an intraperitoneal injection (0. 0, 1. 0, 3. 0, and 5. 0 mg/kg). All tethered rats were not injected and injected rats were freely moving throughout the tethered paradigm once a week for four weeks. The 0. 1 mg/kg dose but neither the 1. 0 nor the 10. 0 mg/kg dose of paroxetine significantly increased time spent in contact. The 10. 0 mg/kg dose but neither the 1. 0 nor the 0. 1 mg/kg dose of paroxetine significantly decreased the number of contacts. The administration of each doses of <b>amperozide</b> (1. 0, 3. 0, and 5. 0 mg/kg) resulted in increased time spent in contact.

40|$|A {{majority}} of schizophrenic patients respond to classical neuroleptic drugs which {{are believed to}} act largely via blockade of doparnine (DA) D 2 receptors in limbic structures. However, a significant proportion {{do not respond to}} conventional D 2 receptor blocking drugs or show a rather incomplete therapeutic effect, particularly on negative and cognitive symptoms. Moreover, the concomitant blockade of D 2 receptors in the basal ganglia has been associated with appearance of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). In comparison with classical neuroleptics atypical antipsychotic drugs such as for example clozapine and risperidone have been found to posses improved efficacy against negative symptomatology and caese a reduced incidence of EPS in clinically effective doses. Despite considerable research efforts, the neurobiological basis for this advantageous pharmacological profile remains to be fully understood. The present work was undertaken in an attempt to gain further insights into the mechanisms of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs. Methodologically, microdialysis of extracellular DA and serotonin (5 -HT) was carried out in freely moving rats. Moreover, neuronal activity of 5 -HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) was registered by means of single cell recording in vivo. Behavioral techniques were also used, including conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and catalepsy ratings, preclinical tests with documented predictive value as regards antipsychotic effect and EPS liability, respectively. Systemic administration of clozapine or risperidone as well as <b>amperozide</b> markedly enhanced DA efflux. in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an effect that was not mimicked by the D 2 / 3 or 5 -HT 2 A/C receptor antagonists raclopride or ritanserin, respectively. In similarity with the [alpha] 2 A/D adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan both risperidone and <b>amperozide</b> increased cortical 5 -HT efflux and, by means of local, intracortical drug administration, risperidone was shown to antagonize the effect on 5 -HT output induced by [alpha] 2 A/D adrenoceptor stimulation. Furthermore, systemic administration of risperidone increased 5 -HT efflux. in the DRN and caused a corresponding attenuation of serotonergic cell firing in this nucleus. Administration of idazoxan alone was found to preferentially enhance DA output in the mPFC and, significantly, to specifically and largely potentiate the only minimal increase in cortical DA efflux induced by raclopride. In parallel behavioral experiments idazoxan caused a dramatic augmentation of the suppression of CAR induced by raclopride, without any increase in catalepsy scores. These results indicate that the facilitation of cortical DA efflux per se may represent a critical component in the mode of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs when compared with that of classical D 2 receptor antagonists, an effect that can be effectively achieved by combined [alpha] 2 A/D and D 2 / 3 receptor blockade alone. The enhanced cortical DA output may be important both for the superior general efficacy of e. g. clozapine and for the advantageous effect on negative as well as cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. The facilitatory action of risperidone and <b>amperozide</b> on cortical 5 -HT efflux, an effect that also appears largely related to blockade of cortical [alpha] 2 A/D adrenoceptors, may be of further significance in this context, particularly as regards affective symptoms. Consequently, blockade of [alpha] 2 A/D adrenoceptors may represent both a rational and effective component of the pharmacological profile of an atypical antipsychotic drug...|$|E

Antagonists were toxic to both C. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti larvae, with LC 50 values ranging from 41 to 208 Î¼M 72 h post-exposure. Orthologous DOP 2 receptors identified from the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, the sand fly, Phlebotomus papatasi and the tsetse fly, Glossina morsitans, had high sequence similarity to CqDOP 2 and AaDOP 2. DAR antagonists represent a putative new insecticide class with activity against C. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti, {{the two most important}} mosquito vectors of NTDs. There has been limited change in the sequence and pharmacological properties of the DOP 2 DARs of these species since divergence of the tribes Culicini and Aedini. We identified antagonists selective for mosquito versus human DARs and observed a correlation between DAR pharmacology and the in vivo larval toxicity of antagonists. These data demonstrate that sequence similarity can be predictive of target potential. On this basis, we propose expanded insecticide discovery around orthologous DOP 2 targets from additional dipteran vectors. Â© 2015 Nuss et al...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{risperidone}} on brain 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) neuronal functions were investigated and {{compared with other}} antipsychotic drugs and selective receptor antagonists by use of single cell recording and microdialysis in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Administration of risperidone (25 â€“ 400 [*]Î¼g[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. v.) dose-dependently decreased 5 -HT cell firing in the DRN, similar to the antipsychotic drug clozapine (0. 25 â€“ 4. 0 [*]mg[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. v.), the putative antipsychotic drug <b>amperozide</b> (0. 5 â€“ 8. 0 [*]mg[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. v.) and the selective Î± 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (50 â€“ 400 [*]Î¼g[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. v.). The selective Î± 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (10 â€“ 80 [*]Î¼g[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. v.), in contrast, increased the firing rate of 5 -HT neurones in the DRN, whereas the D 2 and 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonists raclopride (25 â€“ 200 [*]Î¼g[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. v.) and MDL[*] 100, 907 (50 â€“ 400 [*]Î¼g[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. v.), respectively, were without effect. Thus, the Î± 1 -adrenoceptor antagonistic action of the antipsychotic drugs might, at least partly, cause the decrease in DRN 5 -HT cell firing. Pretreatment with the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY[*] 100, 635 (5. 0 [*]Î¼g[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. v.), a drug previously shown to antagonize effectively the inhibition of 5 -HT cells induced by risperidone, failed to prevent the prazosin-induced decrease in 5 -HT cell firing. This finding argues against the notion that Î± 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism is the sole mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of risperidone on the DRN cells. The inhibitory effect of risperidone on 5 -HT cell firing in the DRN was significantly attenuated in rats pretreated with the 5 -HT depletor PCPA (p-chlorophenylalanine; 300 [*]mg[*]kgâˆ’ 1, i. p., dayâˆ’ 1 for 3 consecutive days) in comparison with drug naive animals. Administration of risperidone (2. 0 [*]mg[*]kgâˆ’ 1, s. c.) significantly enhanced 5 -HT output in the DRN. Consequently, the reduction in 5 -HT cell firing by risperidone appears {{to be related to}} increased availability of 5 -HT in the somatodendritic region of the neurones leading to an enhanced 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor activation and, in turn, to inhibition of firing, and is probably only to a minor extent caused by its Î± 1 -adrenoceptor antagonistic action...|$|E
