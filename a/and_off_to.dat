5|$|The Cotswold Olimpick Games is {{an annual}} public celebration of games and sports now {{held on the}} Friday after Spring Bank Holiday near Chipping Campden, in the Cotswolds of England. The Games {{probably}} began in 1622, and have continued on <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the present day. They were started by a local lawyer, Robert Dover, {{with the approval of}} King James. Dover's motivation in organising the Games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the realm, but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together; the Games were attended by all classes of society, including royalty on one occasion.|$|E

25|$|This is {{critically}} important for decoupling high-speed logic circuits from the power supply. The decoupling capacitor supplies transient current to the chip. Without decouplers, the IC demands current faster than the connection to the power supply can supply it, as parts of the circuit rapidly switch on <b>and</b> <b>off.</b> <b>To</b> counter this potential problem, circuits frequently use multiple bypass capacitors—small (100 nF or less) capacitors rated for high frequencies, a large electrolytic capacitor rated for lower frequencies and occasionally, an intermediate value capacitor.|$|E
25|$|According to Early Modern records, benandanti were {{believed}} to have been born with a caul on their head, which gave them the ability to take part in nocturnal visionary traditions that occurred on specific Thursdays during the year. During these visions, it was believed that their spirits rode upon various animals into the sky <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> places in the countryside. Here they would take part in various games and other activities with other benandanti, and battle malevolent witches who threatened both their crops and their communities using sticks of sorghum. When not taking part in these visionary journeys, benandanti were also believed to have magical powers {{that could be used for}} healing.|$|E

[...] Throughout the Aspen Parkland ecoregion are trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides [...] ) bluffs (small islands or shelter belts) within the prairie region. [...] Deer and other large ungulates are a hazard to traffic resulting in potential animal or human deaths, especially in the autumn mating months or when deer are searching for feeding grounds in the spring. The defense mechanism of deer {{in the face of a}} threat is to freeze. There are over 3,500 deer - auto collisions per year in Saskatchewan. A number of measures have been implemented to increase awareness such as fencing, feeding programs, automobile whistles. Deer mirrors along the edges of highways were installed for reducing deer-vehicle collisions. The Wildlife Warning System is triggered by highway vehicles, setting off lights, sounds and or odours ahead of the approaching vehicle to frighten away animals. Some systems that detect vehicles, where others detect large animals and sets off a warning system to drivers of vehicles alerting them that an animal is on or near the highway ahead of time. [...] The junction with Highway 27 occurs at km 468.0 providing access west to the village of Prud'homme <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the east is Muskiki Lake. Cudworth is located at the Highway 777 intersection, bearing east on highway 777 provides access to Middle Lake.

2500|$|Genetics is {{the study}} of genes—what they are, what they do, and how they work. [...] Genes inside the nucleus of a cell are strung {{together}} {{in such a way that}} the sequence carries information: that information determines how living organisms inherit various features (phenotypic traits). For example, offspring produced by sexual reproduction usually look similar to each of their parents because they have inherited some of each of their parents' genes. Genetics identifies which features are inherited, and explains how these features pass from generation to generation. In addition to inheritance, genetics studies how genes are turned on <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> control what substances are made in a cell—gene expression; and how a cell divides—mitosis or meiosis.|$|E
