40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} discourses influential in former elite female artistic gymnasts' engagement with pain <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine participants' engagement with pain <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> discourses <b>and</b> interrogate the ways in which certain discourses became dominant. Despite extensive sociological research providing exposure to the ways in which athletes experience pain <b>and</b> <b>injury,</b> there is little research into gymnasts' experiences. Therefore, this research not only contributes to the sociological literature on pain <b>and</b> <b>injury,</b> but also provides a complimentary addition to the efforts towards injury prevention from the medical, epidemiological and psychological perspectives. A poststructural, Foucauldian theoretical framework underpins this study, which makes overt use of Foucault's work on discourses, techniques of power and technologies of the self. Data were generated through semi-structured interviews with seven former elite female artistic gymnasts, who were asked to reflect on their experiences with pain <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> By analysing participants’ talk through poststructural discourse analysis, three main discourses were evident. Firstly, participants' persistence through pain <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> was due to the desire to compete. Secondly, participants were able to differentiate between "good pain" and "bad pain". Thirdly, participants had a higher tolerance for pain than for injury. Participants engaged with these discourses in multiple and sometimes conflicting ways. Ultimately however, these discourses were normalised through a combination of disciplinary techniques and technologies of the self. Therefore, this research raises serious questions about the ways in which gymnasts may develop an uncritical acceptance of the 'truths' surrounding pain <b>and</b> <b>injury...</b>|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Athletes who {{participate}} in sport experience the risk of pain <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> In today’s sports culture, playing with pain <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> has been normalized, which can leave athletes with severe chronic <b>injury,</b> incessant pain, <b>and</b> potential irreversible damage. Certified athletic trainers (ATCs) uphold a professional responsibility to manage <b>injuries</b> <b>and</b> care {{for the health of}} athletes under their attention. According to Nixon (1992), ATCs are members of a social network found in sport, called a “sportsnet. ” Nixon has blamed sportsnet members, including ATCs, for the normalization of injury in sport - a charge that contradicts ATCs’ standards of practice and creates ethical concern within the profession. Although previous research has evaluated how athletic training students, Canadian sports medicine clinicians, and doctors and physiotherapists from the United Kingdom affect and are affected by the culture of risk, pain, <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> in sport, little research has focused upon ATCs working within intercollegiate sports in the United States. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the current perceptions of pain, risk, <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> held by ATCs and to discover how those perceptions affect ATCs’ decisions regarding injuries. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 80 Board of Certification certified athletic trainers with at least five years of working experience in a NCAA Division I athletic department. METHOD: Participants took an anonymous open-ended questionnaire on Qualtrics, an online survey software. DATA ANALYSIS: Data was highlighted and sorted based upon common themes that addressed perceptions and influence of the culture of risk, pain, <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> in sport on ATCs. RESULTS: Athletic trainers believed that athletes should expect playing with pain <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> Over half (52. 46 %) of athletic trainers reported experiencing sportsnet pressure from coaches when managing athlete pain <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> When making return-to-play decisions, time of the sports season was the biggest situational factor that affected an athletic trainer’s decision. Despite expecting pain <b>and</b> <b>injury,</b> athletic trainers expressed the importance of preventing additional harm and maintaining patient health and safety. CONCLUSION: The results of this study contribute to a further understanding of the culture of risk, pain, <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> in sport, the profession of athletic training, and the nature of NCAA Division I collegiate athletic training environments...|$|R
