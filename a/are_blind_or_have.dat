The children who <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>had</b> low vision also had weaker hip extensors, but after LBW correction, only the blind children's hip extensors were weaker than those of the children with normal vision.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the prevalence of eye injuries and the factors influencing it among locomotive drivers and Sentul workshop workers of Keretapi Tanah Melayu in 1994. The sample was selected using convenient sampling technique. A total of 200 locomotive drivers and loo workshop workers were studied and the prevalence of eye injuries was 20. 0 %. The prevalence of eye injuries was significantly associated with mean age, types of job and length of services (p 0. 05). It was also found that brake block dust was the main causal agent among locomotive drivers while the causal agent for workshop workers was dust (p< 0. 05). The study also concluded that the mean annual sick leave among the workshop workers was higher than the locomotive drivers (p< 0. 05). Most of the eye injuries involved the left eye (56. 7 %) and the majority of these injuries were diagnosed as foreign bodies in the cornea (88. 3 %).

Good control of blood glucose was obtained with intraperitoneal (i. p.) insulin and the blood pressure was controlled in 87 % of patients without medication, which probably favored the stabilization of visual acuity in 60 % of 15 patients evaluated after two years. The follow-up of patients was longer in those who began CAPD with a higher residual creatinine clearance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Australia is a {{developed}} country. However, Aboriginal Australians have {{rates of}} blindness comparable to Third World countries. There have been well-funded eye health programs for 15 years in Central Australia. This paper examines {{if there has}} been an improvement in visual disability of one traditional group of Aboriginal Australians. METHODS: Results from an eye health survey of the Anangu Pitjantjatjara of South Australia in 1990 are presented. These data are compared with results for 'blindness' and 'poor vision' from a national survey undertaken in 1976. The two surveys were comparable in design, both were cross-sectional population-based prevalence surveys. Prevalence rates were adjusted for the size of the source population. RESULTS: Young rural Aboriginal Australians have good visual acuity. Low vision and blindness (WHO definitions) occur in 19. 6 % and 10. 4 % of 60 + year olds, respectively. Women were {{more likely than men to}} <b>be</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>have</b> low vision (<b>OR</b> = 1. 93; 1. 06 - 3. 58). There was a decline in 'poor vision' between surveys (OR = 2. 86; 1. 86 - 4. 75) but not in 'blindness'. CONCLUSION: Although there has been a reduction in the prevalence of visual disability in rural Aboriginal Australians, improvements in the provision of eye care for the elderly need to occur...|$|R
