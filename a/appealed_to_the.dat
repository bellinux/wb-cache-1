40|$|This paper {{takes two}} kinds of public service {{advertising}} (PSA), helping others and recruiting soldiers, to do case comparisons between China and West.

For PSA of recruiting soldiers, China <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> value of collectivism, whereas West <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> value of individualism.
