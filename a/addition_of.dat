These give two different generalizations of <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> ordinal numbers is not commutative. <b>Addition</b> <b>of</b> cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to}} the disjoint union operation.|$|E

5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E

40|$|High-Cr {{ferritic}} model steels containing various <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> the refractory elements Nb and/or W {{were studied}} {{with respect to}} oxidation behaviour (hot) tensile properties, creep behaviour and high-temperature electrical conductivity of the surface oxide scales. Whereas W <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> around 2 wt. % had hardly any effect on the oxidation rates at 800 and 900 degrees C, Nb <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> 1 % led to a substantially enhanced growth rate of the protective surface oxide scale. It was found that this adverse effect can be alleviated by suitable Si additions. This {{is related to the}} incorporation of Si and Nb into Laves phase precipitates which also contribute to increased creep and hot tensile strength. The dispersion of Laves phase precipitates was greatly refined by combined <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> Nb and W. The high-temperature electrical conductivity of the surface oxide scales was {{similar to that of the}} Nb/W-free alloys. Thus the combined <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> Nb, W and Si resulted in an alloy with oxidation resistance, ASR contribution and thermal expansion comparable to the commercial alloy Crofer 22 APU, but with creep strength far greater than that of Crofer 22 APU.
