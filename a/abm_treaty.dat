25|$|The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty {{began in}} November 1969 in Helsinki. The interim {{agreement}} signed in Moscow in May 1972 froze existing levels of deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and regulated {{the growth of}} submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).

25|$|Gromyko {{played a}} direct {{role in the}} Cuban Missile Crisis {{in his role as}} the Soviet Foreign Minister. Gromyko helped {{negotiate}} arms limitations treaties, such as the <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty,</b> the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, SALT I and SALT II, among others. Under Leonid Brezhnev's leadership Gromyko helped build the policy of détente between the US and the USSR. He supported Mikhail Gorbachev's candidacy for General Secretary in 1985. Gromyko lost his office as foreign minister when Gorbachev became General Secretary, and was instead appointed to the largely ceremonial office of head of state. Gromyko retired from political life in 1988, and died the following year in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 serious {{efforts to}} explore the ABM problem started. By this point the US and USSR had agreed in the <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty</b> to deploy up to 100 ABMs at only two sites. MIRVs had so seriously upset the balance between ABM and ICBM that both parties agreed to limit ABM {{deployment}} largely {{as a way of}} avoiding a massive buildup of new ICBMs. The only good news for the UK in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing; their attacks {{had to be able to}} credibly defeat a 100-interceptor ABM defense around Moscow. Thus started project KH.793, a one-year project to identify potential solutions.|$|E
25|$|With President Jimmy Carter's {{decision}} to base the MX {{in a series}} of less-hardened horizontal silos in 1977, LoADS development was accelerated. The system as a whole was renamed Sentry, with the missile becoming the Baseline Terminal Defense System, or BTDS. Work on MX and Sentry was further accelerated by incoming President Ronald Reagan in 1981. However, after another review of the MX program, Reagan chose a different MX deployment concept and cancelled Sentry, stating that it would violate the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty.</b> As the questionable security of the MX once again became an issue, Reagan briefly entertained an even shorter-range system known as Swarmjet, before the entire MX program was severely curtailed with the ending of the Cold War.|$|E
50|$|Viers {{was born}} in 1978 to Brenda and Carson Viers. Thad Viers grew up in Socastee, South Carolina, off of Highway 814 in Ammons mobile home park. Thad is short for Thaddeus (of the Twelve apostles). Thad has a younger brother also named {{after one of the}} Twelve apostles named Bartholomew (Bart for short). In high school, he started a teenage Republican club before {{becoming}} an office intern for the late U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond. In 1995, Thad graduated from Socastee High School and then matriculated to The Citadel (military college) to pursue a Marine Corps commission, where he was awarded a three-year academic scholarship. He was injured and discharged. In 1999, he went to work at the Heritage Foundation where he served with Jack Spencer, now a senior fellow. After the completion of the <b>ABM</b> Missile <b>Treaty</b> Project, Thad returned to South Carolina to become the District Field Representative for former U.S. Congressman Henry Brown. He was also a Business Development Consultant. He graduated from University of South Carolina School of Law in 2007.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of military arms harnessing nuclear energy for mass destruction has inspired continual {{efforts to control}} them. Since 1945, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Israel, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and South Africa acquired control over these powerful weapons, though Pretoria dismantled its small cache in 1989 and Russia inherited the Soviet arsenal in 1996. Throughout this period, Washington sought to limit its nuclear forces in tandem with those of Moscow, prevent new states from fielding them, discourage their military use, and even permit their eventual abolition. Scholars disagree about what explains the United States’ distinct approach to nuclear arms control. The history of U. S. nuclear policy treats intellectual theories and cultural attitudes alongside technical advances and strategic implications. The central debate is one of structure versus agency: whether the weapons’ sheer power, or historical actors’ attitudes toward that power, drove nuclear arms control. Among those who emphasize political responsibility, there are two further disagreements: (1) the relative influence of domestic protest, culture, and politics; and (2) whether U. S. nuclear arms control aimed first at securing the peace by regulating global nuclear forces or at bolstering American influence in the world. The intensity of nuclear arms control efforts tended to rise or fall with the likelihood of nuclear war. Harry Truman’s faith in the country’s monopoly on nuclear weapons caused him to sabotage early initiatives, while Dwight Eisenhower’s belief in nuclear deterrence led in a similar direction. Fears of a U. S. -Soviet thermonuclear exchange mounted in the late 1950 s, stoked by atmospheric nuclear testing and widespread radioactive fallout, which stirred protest movements and diplomatic initiatives. The {{spread of nuclear weapons}} to new states motivated U. S. presidents (John Kennedy in the vanguard) to mount a concerted campaign against “proliferation,” climaxing with the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Richard Nixon was exceptional. His reasons for signing the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) and Anti-Ballistic Missile <b>Treaty</b> (<b>ABM)</b> with Moscow in 1972 were strategic: to buttress the country’s geopolitical position as U. S. armed forces withdrew from Southeast Asia. The rise of protest movements and Soviet economic difficulties after Ronald Reagan entered the Oval Office brought about two more landmark U. S. -Soviet accords—the 1987 Intermediate Ballistic Missile Treaty (INF) and the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) —the first occasions on which the superpowers eliminated nuclear weapons through treaty. The country’s attention swung to proliferation after the Soviet collapse in December 1991, as failed states, regional disputes, and non-state actors grew more prominent. Although controversies over Iraq, North Korea, and Iran’s nuclear programs have since erupted, Washington and Moscow continued to reduce their arsenals and refine their nuclear doctrines even as President Barack Obama proclaimed his support for a nuclear-free world...|$|R
40|$|The {{award of}} the Nobel Peace Prize for 1995 to Joseph Rotblat and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs (COSWA) was {{a tribute to}} a type of natural {{scientist}} who engages in political action and seeks to have a political effect, either over and above his professional work or {{as a result of}} his view of an appropriate political ethos. In recent years, natural scientists have also been discovered by the discipline of International Relations, especially as transnational actors. The activities of the scientists who came together in the late 1950 s within the framework of the Pugwash Conferences belong to this category. These scholars functioned as icebreakers during the Cold War and also during the Vietnam War, and the honor of the Nobel prize has come very late. In addition to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize there is another reason why this is an appropriate moment to examine the Pugwash Conferences and the work they have done: Pugwash celebrates its 40 th anniversary in 1997. This study therefore also seeks to answer the question of what lessons for Pugwash 2 ̆ 7 s future work can be drawn from the history of the organization. Sources which have not hitherto been systematically evaluated make clear the historical significance of the Pugwash Conferences as a communication forum, but they also reveal their limitations. In order for these natural scientists to be able to bring their responsibility as experts, to which they frequently appealed, effectively into play in the political process, there was a need for smaller-scale, more effective forms of communication and cooperation. The idea of setting up a U. S. -Soviet Study Group on Arms Control and Disarmament was first put forward at the Pugwash conference in Moscow in 1960. The leading figures on the Soviet side changed with the passing of time, and on the American side the Harvard biochemist Paul Doty was the leading figure from 1962 to the end of the project in 1975 - hence the name Doty group. The history of this group, like that of the Pugwash movement as a whole as a communication forum, is the political success story of a network of specialists who had recognized expertise and competence in the domain of arms control and an authoritative claim to policyrelevant knowledge within this domain - an "epistemic community". These two groups made a major contribution to two achievements of historic significance. The USSR adopted the U. S. scientists 2 ̆ 7 approach to arms control, an approach which had hitherto been quite alien to the Soviets, and on the question of anti-ballistic missile systems (ABM) the Americans were able to bring about a radical change in the Moscow leadership 2 ̆ 7 s position. Pugwash and the Joint Study Group did much to lay the intellectual, conceptual, and political foundations for the policy of cooperative regulation of armaments between the USA and the USSR. This policy was codified in the 1972 SALT I and <b>ABM</b> <b>treaties.</b> In the arms control community of this period the issues at stake were not in the first instance scholarly or scientific methods and goals in a narrow sense. In the transnational discussions between American and Soviet scientists it was more a matter of "trans-scientific debates". Although controversies of this sort are in most cases conducted with the help of natural-scientific and technical arguments, they are strongly ideologically-politically (and sometimes emotionally) charged. In the arguments put forward, which were often scenario-dependent, there were two main issues at stake (apart from debates over figures and calculations) : (1) Are the relevant military technologies feasible, and if so are they desirable (techno-cultural dimension) ? (2) How do we, as Americans and Soviets, want to live with the other side (foreign policy dimension) ? This knowledge and its premises are not objective, but socially, politically, and institutionally constructed. A historical study is not an end in itself. The objective in this case is to offer contemporary, natural scientist-dominated epistemic communities some proposals derived from the Pugwash experience that may be helpful in their work, which is as important today as it has ever been. In spite of the new circumstances and the difficulty of translating earlier successes into the present-day context, the case study makes it possible to identify three main conditions that made the success of Pugwash 2 ̆ 7 s strategy possible. - The subject matter: a field of action that was seen as important, or as becoming important, was introduced into the debate at the right moment. - The organizational factor: lasting communication and cooperation networks were set up. - The strategic factor: a communication and cooperation strategy was designed (the identification of common interests). These three conditions of Pugwash 2 ̆ 7 s historical successes are then applied to certain fields of policy that are currently of great importance: the East-West agenda and the establishment of a dialogue with states whose nuclear policies are problematic. The current situation in the East-West relationship is in its essentials comparable with the beginning of the 1960 s. Now, as then, the problems facing us require new, more efficient forms of cooperation which offer more than the simple discussion forum furnished by Pugwash. It is not to be expected that the Pugwash Conferences will transform themselves from a primarily scientific-political into a technically-oriented organization. In view of the existing spectrum of East- West scholarly contacts, which is in the process of expanding considerably and takes numerous different forms, there will continue to be a need for an informal umbrella organization that can act as a forum for communication. A rejuvenated Pugwash which was part of a network linking these groups and projects and which was not alarmed by the fact that many arms control questions are becoming more technical would be suited to this role. One particular and important policy question springs to mind here which is ignored by most transnational actors from the relevant societal environment and has in recent years been mentioned only in passing by the Pugwash Conferences: missile defense, the field in which Pugwash achieved its greatest arms control success in the 1960 s. The achievementsof that era are currently being placed in grave danger by the policies of the Clinton Administration and the U. S. Congress. In the spirit of Pugwash 2 ̆ 7 s historical agenda, this issue should therefore be made a matter of immediate, high-priority and longterm concern and a network of established experts working in the field should be established. Over and above this, the scientific-politically oriented Pugwash Conferences remain important in the East-West relationship. The organization 2 ̆ 7 s most valuable contribution in the coming years is likely to be the provision of support for the democratization process in the CIS during the present difficult and uncertain transition phase. There is more need for scholarly internationalism than ever before. On the basis of Pugwash 2 ̆ 7 s history and past successes and its emphasis on long-term contacts and quiet diplomacy, it is of all existing transnational societal actors the one best suited to initiating new structures of scholarly cooperation. One of the major challenges confronting us at present is the need to conduct quiet scientific-political diplomacy with nuclear problem states like China, India, Pakistan, Libya, and Iran, and to do this over a long period of time, systematically and with a concentration on the most important questions. In some of these cases the room for maneuver and chances of success are better than in others. Libya is a particularly difficult case because the country 2 ̆ 7 s scientific-political structures are completely centered on Colonel Qaddafi. Even so, a systematic attempt should be undertaken, at the first available opportunity and on a long-term basis, to involve Libyan scientists and scientific-political officials in international Pugwash conferences. Even Qaddafi will not be around for ever. The question of whether to include or exclude Iran is currently being heatedly discussed, especially between Bonn and Washington. What is the "correct" policy toward Iran, a country that clearly harbors ambitions to construct its own technical infrastructure for nuclear weapons and missiles? Although there are differences between Iranian foreign policy and the entirely negative Libyan behavior, the Pugwash Conferences will need to pay more attention than hitherto to specific cultural and religious- political factors as they attempt to establish scientific-political cooperation with these two Islamic countries. There is no need to spell out the importance and urgency of the need to cooperate systematically and more intensively with scientists and the corresponding institutions in India, Pakistan, and China. It should be no problem to find topics of conversation which interest both sides and extend beyond proliferation [...] for example, conversion. In the case of China, though, the problem is that in view of fundamental foreign policy, social, value, and norm-related differences it is difficult to identify common political interests and to build up cooperation in these areas. The parallels with the state of U. S. -Soviet relations at the beginning of the 1960 s are striking. The lowest common denominator between the Clinton Administration 2 ̆ 7 s strategy of "comprehensive engagement" and the school of opinion in Beijing that inclines towards cooperation would be the aspiration to reserve differences and seek common ground. Among the state bodies in Beijing, the Foreign Ministry would probably be the best addressee of attempts to raise the level of cooperation - Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is, like party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, reckoned by observers to belong to the "cooperative" school. "To avoid a new cold war, the two sides must step back from the brink and realize their larger national interests ( [...] .). The burden of stabilizing the (U. S. - Chinese, B. W. K.) relationship falls with both sides. Without stability there can be no cooperation" (David Shambaugh). Against this background Pugwash, with its capacity to focus on the long term and its well-founded global reputation, could make an important contribution to avoiding such a new cold war, without falling into the "stability trap" that is more likely to have a negative effect on the human rights situation. On the basis of this agenda or one close to it, an agenda which builds on the organization 2 ̆ 7 s past achievements, Pugwash could provide to many other epistemic communities dominated by natural scientists a fine example of how to approach present and future security challenges with a good prospect of success...|$|R
25|$|After World War II, {{the balance}} of power between the Eastern and Western blocs and the fear of global {{destruction}} prevented the further military use of atomic bombs. This fear was even a central part of Cold War strategy, referred to as the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. So important was this balance to international political stability that a treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (or <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty),</b> was signed by the U.S. and the USSR in 1972 to curtail the development of defenses against nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles that carry them. This doctrine resulted in a large {{increase in the number of}} nuclear weapons, as each side sought to ensure it possessed the firepower to destroy the opposition in all possible scenarios.|$|E
25|$|LoADS {{proposed}} placing one interceptor {{in one of}} the decoy shelters, thus every set of 23 shelters {{would have}} one MX, one LoADS and 21 decoys. At first glance it might appear that only one additional enemy warhead would be needed, using up the LoADS interceptor. However, only the defender knew where the MX was, and LoADS would only fire at the single warhead seen approaching that shelter. That meant that the MX would almost definitely survive a single warhead attack. In order to be sure the MX was hit, the Soviets would have to attack every shelter with two warheads, assuming one would be lost to the LoADS. For a typical 23-site MPS, 46 warheads would be needed, so if LoADS remained within the 100-interceptor limit of the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty,</b> 4,600 warheads would be needed to attack just one-half of the 200-strong MX fleet, leaving 100 missiles and 1,000 warheads in the US counterattack. An attack against the entire fleet would require them to break the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks limits on the number of offensive warheads.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there was}} a concern {{in regards to the}} <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty,</b> {{involving}} its use of radars. In order to ensure ABM systems would be suitable for point defense only, the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> limited the number and placement of radar systems. LoADS had a radar with each missile, but these were very short-range and could not be considered part of a wide-area system, although observers suggested the Soviets would claim otherwise. More importantly, the 1974 amendment to the treaty required those radars to be in the vicinity of Grand Forks, which would not help MPS, which was located well over [...] to the southwest. The Army thus developed LoADS strictly as a technology demonstration program, with the option of rapid construction in case the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> ended. Costs of a deployed system was estimated to be $8.63 billion in 1980 ( [...] billion in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Unilateral {{elements}} were {{evident in the}} first months of Bush's presidency. Conservative Charles Krauthammer, coiner of the term [...] "Bush Doctrine," [...] deployed [...] "unilateralism," [...] in February 2001 to refer to the president's increased unilateralism in foreign policy, specifically regarding the president's decision to withdraw from the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Reagan went on {{to state}} that [...] "we {{do not wish to}} embark on any course of action that could endanger the current <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> so long as it is {{observed}} by the Soviet Union... we do not wish to build even the minimal ABM system allowed us by the treaty." [...] In February 1983, Sentry was officially cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of an attack on the USSR, even a single Resolution could have ensured the {{destruction}} of {{a significant portion of the}} Soviet command and control structure. Given all sixteen missiles launching successfully, an ABM system would be presented with 551 credible-looking targets to deal with. Given that the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> limited the USSR to 100 ABM interceptors, a [...] "hit" [...] was virtually guaranteed.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Krauthammer {{first used}} the phrase in June 2001 to {{describe}} the Bush Administration's [...] "...unilaterally withdrawing from the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> and rejecting the Kyoto protocol." [...] After the 9/11 attack, the phrase described the policy that the United States {{had the right to}} secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 war in Afghanistan. The Bush Doctrine became strongly associated with the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 May 1972, President Nixon and Soviet general {{secretary}} Leonid Brezhnev signed the <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty,</b> which limited each nation to one site to protect strategic forces and one site {{to protect the}} [...] "National Command Authority." [...] With work about 85 percent complete at Grand Forks, the United States chose to finish construction at the North Dakota site. On 21 August 1972, the Army Corps of Engineers turned over the PAR to the Safeguard Systems Command (SAFSCOM) Site Activation Team. The transfer of the MSR occurred on 3 January 1973. Work on the four remote launch sites fell behind schedule, with the last completed on 5 November 1972. Testing of the PAR commenced {{during the summer of}} 1973.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{hedge against}} the {{possibility}} of the Soviets [...] "breaking out" [...] of the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty,</b> the Army was given the go-ahead to continue development of ABM technologies, focusing on the Safeguard-like concept of defending the missile fields. The Army responded with two concepts, updates to the original Safeguard using a new radar and upgraded Sprint II missile, and a new concept for a high-altitude interceptor that would use hit-to-kill instead of a nuclear warhead. Work on the former, known as Site Defence of Minuteman, went as far as building a radar at the Army's testing site on Meck Island in the Kwajalein Atoll, but work on this program ended in 1974 when it was clear the treaty was going to be followed by both countries.|$|E
2500|$|As the UK {{had decided}} to produce its own warheads and bus, this option would require {{considerable}} development effort {{in order to produce}} a new MIRV bus of their own. Although in theory the UK might {{be able to use the}} US-designed bus, these options were being explored in the midst of the <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty,</b> and it was not clear whether the treaty might forbid this technology being transferred. Some related options were explored, including [...] "Option M" [...] which used a simple [...] "de-MIRVed" [...] bus, [...] "Hybrid" [...] (or [...] "Stag") which put the newer Poseidon warheads on the existing Polaris A3T missiles, and [...] "Mini Poseidon", a similar adaptation with a smaller six-Poseidon-warhead payload on the A3T.|$|E
2500|$|One way {{to improve}} the {{survival}} of the ICBM force would be to actively defend it with an ABM system. However, the 1972 <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> greatly limited the number and geographical deployment of any ABM, with the aim of preventing whole-country protection and thus ensuring MAD. LoADS addressed these limitations by being deployed along with the radars and engagement computers needed to make a successful attack at only very short ranges, [...] or less. The entire system was packed into a cylinder that looked like an MX and would be shuffled between the silos. As the LoADS could be in any of the silos at a particular missile site, the enemy would have to expend two warheads on every silo to ensure a hit, as one would be assumed lost to LoADS. This would not stop a successful counterforce attack, but it would make it significantly more expensive {{in terms of the number}} of warheads used, potentially requiring more warheads than the Soviets had.|$|E
2500|$|Through the 1970s {{a number}} of {{alternative}} concepts to defend the silos had been proposed. Richard Garwin outlined a series of alternatives to large-scale ABM systems like Safeguard. Among these ideas were a [...] "bed of nails" [...] consisting of vertical steel spikes surrounding the silo that would destroy the warhead before it hit the ground and triggered, jamming systems to interrupt radar fuses, the dust defense where small nuclear warheads would be set off while the warheads approached and throw huge amounts of dust into the air that would abrade the warheads, and a non-nuclear {{version of the same}} concept, the [...] "curtain of steel pellets". The last of these was picked up by Bernard Feld and Kosta Tsipis in a major article in Scientific American in 1979. They proposed replacing the shotgun-like projectiles with swarms of small unguided rockets that would fire at a range of about [...] As they were unguided, they suggested {{that they would not be}} considered interceptor missiles under the <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty,</b> but also suggested that a renegotiation might be required.|$|E
2500|$|One {{accomplishment}} Gromyko took particular {{pride in}} was {{the signing of}} the Partial Test Ban Treaty on 5 August 1963.

Other achievements he considered his greatest were {{the signing of the}} Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 1 July 1968, the <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty</b> and SALT I, followed by the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War in 1973. In retrospect Gromyko said, [...] "If we collect the deliberative nature of the documents, including hundreds of Coded Telegrams, information from the embassies, the analysis of the situation around these problems, there are perhaps as high as the mountain of Mont Blanc. Those papers show the difficulties in overcoming congestions to the path to an agreement, requires the present art of diplomacy."
