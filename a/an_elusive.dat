5|$|Weisel's {{account is}} {{ballasted}} with the freight of fiction: scenic organization, characterization through dialogue, periodic climaxes, elimination of superfluous or repetitive episodes, and especially {{an ability to}} arouse the empathy of his readers, which is <b>an</b> <b>elusive</b> ideal of the writer bound by fidelity to fact.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every nation}} has {{associated}} blood drinking {{with some kind}} of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture <b>an</b> <b>elusive</b> one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E

5|$|Malaria {{vaccines}} {{have been}} <b>an</b> <b>elusive</b> goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating {{the potential for}} a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{tales of}} vetalas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, {{are found in}} old Sanskrit folklore. Although most vetala legends have been {{compiled}} in the Baital Pachisi, a prominent story in the Kathasaritsagara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture <b>an</b> <b>elusive</b> one. The vetala is described as an undead creature who, like the bat associated with modern-day vampirism, hangs upside down on trees found on cremation grounds and cemeteries. Pishacha, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Tightrope (1984) had Eastwood {{starring}} opposite Geneviève Bujold in {{a provocative}} thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about <b>an</b> <b>elusive</b> Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, 2000, he {{defeated}} Jan Piet Bergman to win {{the vacant}} IBF Light Welterweight title. Bergman went down twice in the first round, but recovered in the second round, knocking Judah down. Judah knocked out Bergman in the fourth round {{to win the}} title. On June 20, 2000, Judah made his first title defense against Junior Witter in Glasgow, Scotland. It was an awkward fight for Judah, as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches. Witter frequently switched between fighting right-handed and left-handed, making him <b>an</b> <b>elusive</b> opponent. Judah's consistent body punching slowed Witter down, and in the fifth round, Judah caught Witter with a straight left hand that hurt Witter and sent his mouthpiece skittering across the ring. Judah defeated Witter by unanimous decision.|$|E
5|$|Under Cockcroft's direction, AERE {{took part}} in {{frontier}} fusion research in the post-war years, including the ZETA program. Sir George Paget Thomson began research in nuclear fusion at Imperial College London in 1946. This was subsequently transferred to the Associated Electrical Industries Laboratory at Aldermaston, under Allibone's direction. Research independently began at Oxford University under Peter Thonemann. In 1951, Cockcroft arranged for the Oxford group {{to be transferred to}} Harwell. Cockcroft approved the construction of ZETA (Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly) by the Thonemann's Harwell group, and the smaller Sceptre by Allibone's AEI group. James L. Tuck's group at the Los Alamos Laboratory was also researching fusion, and Cockcroft struck an agreement with the Americans that they would release their results together, which was done in 1958. Despite Cockcroft's perennial optimism that a breakthrough was imminent, fusion power remained <b>an</b> <b>elusive</b> goal.|$|E

25|$|Cooper twice fought Muhammad Ali (then {{known as}} Cassius Clay), firstly in a non-title fight in 1963 at Wembley Stadium, Wembley Park. Ali's mobility, fast reflexes, and unorthodox {{defensive}} tactic of pulling back from punches made him <b>a</b> frustratingly <b>elusive</b> opponent.|$|R

The show premiered on NBC April 16, 1935, {{and though it}} took three seasons to become an irrevocable hit, it became the country's top-rated radio series.

The grasslands of the Nullarbor are suitable for some sheep grazing and are also damaged by rabbits.|$|E

Georgia Tech then milked the clock which set up Bynum's game-winner. Georgia Tech advanced to their first ever National Championship appearance. Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton was denied yet another chance at <b>an</b> <b>elusive</b> national title.|$|E
