5|$|Alexander was <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> for his {{nepotism}} {{that was}} partially {{due to his}} advanced age and belief that his family would have little time to profit from his reign. This was in contrast to his predecessor Innocent XI, who was known for being austere and had not caused any scandals through nepotism.|$|E
50|$|Wine expert Oz Clarke, <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> the {{dependency}} on careful vinification {{for the quality}} of Torrontés but <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that the size of the harvest yield can also play a substantial role. While the aroma of Torrontés is often associated with Muscat, Clarke notes that many examples can be very similar to Gewürztraminer with subtle spice notes mixed with the floral bouquet of the wine. Clarke <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> that the wine tends not to age very well and is often consumed within a year of its vintage date.|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} phylogenetic {{hypothesis that}} has gained substantial traction places Brancasaurus in the clade Leptocleididae, {{along with other}} leptocleidids including Leptocleidus itself, Vectocleidus, Umoonasaurus, Nichollssaura, and also possibly Hastanectes. This result has been recovered by the phylogenies of Benson et al., who have <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> a number of morphological traits which ally Brancasaurus with the more general Leptocleidia.|$|E
5|$|As <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> below, {{the most}} common isotopic {{molybdenum}} application involves molybdenum-99, which is a fission product. It is a parent radioisotope to the short-lived gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But he <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E

5|$|Federer is <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> for {{his cool}} {{demeanour}} and emotional {{control on the}} court. In contrast to his early career, most of his professional game has been characterised by lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors, which gives him an advantage over less controlled opponents.|$|E

5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} <b>also</b> <b>noted,</b> however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|Green Hill Zone {{is remembered}} as a classic within both the Sonic the Hedgehog series and video games in general. The level and its music have also {{received}} positive opinions from critics. It {{has gone on to}} make reappearances in other games, such as Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, and critics have <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> a Green Hill-like aesthetic in levels of other games.|$|E

After the {{replay of}} the Scottish Cup Final against Celtic in 1963 he stuffed the match ball up his shirt and later gave it to a new member of the team.

5|$|However, {{the game}} was noted to have some flaws. The game was criticized for its uneven {{difficulty}}. Reviewers have <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> some difficulty in getting the game to recognize the correct Celestial Brush patterns, as well as excessive amounts of dialog, particularly at the introduction, which was also hampered by the computer-generated voices used instead of voice acting.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the government was}} restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E

This galaxy may be associated with gamma-ray source 3EG J1621+8203, which has high-energy gamma-ray emission. It is <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> for its one-sided radio jet—one of the brightest known—discovered in 1977.|$|E
