25|$|After {{a disappointing}} season in 1991–92, Galis {{was forced to}} leave Aris.

25|$|By this time, Maeser {{had to be}} {{replaced}} as president by the Board of Trustees. He had been called to oversee the entire LDS education program, {{and was unable to}} do both jobs. The Board's initial choice was the twenty-seven-year-old James E. Talmage, but before they could extend the invitation, he was hired by LDS College in Salt Lake City. They instead chose a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, Benjamin Cluff, Jr.. Cluff's methods as president have been described as nearly opposite those of Maeser. Maeser was insular and conservative in his teaching methods. He kept his teachings well within the LDS world, and adhered to classical education standards. Cluff was more open to new ideas and methods. He also believed that the world outside Mormonism had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> the school.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Liverpool won the FA Cup {{again but}} Barnes missed the final with an Achilles tendon injury, which he later cited in his {{autobiography}} as dulling his acceleration, affecting his ability to push off from a still position, while not affecting his pace at full. He played just 12 league games in the 1991–92, scoring once, as Liverpool finished sixth in the league – their lowest finish in two decades {{and the first time}} since 1981 that they had failed to finish champions or runners-up. Barnes and several other senior players had frosty relationships with Souness during this period as the manager tried to impose new methods quickly, and many senior pros resented his hard discipline approach as well as the increased pressure in training. Barnes also once had to make a public apology to Souness after he gave an interview criticising the tactics employed by the manager before an important match. Young teammate Robbie Fowler also said {{in his autobiography}} that Souness felt at the time Barnes was past his best, but in Fowler's (and others') opinion he still had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> and was {{still one of the most}} talented players at the club.|$|E

The advantage of DWT over other traditional transformations is that it performs multi resolution analysis of signals with localization both in time and frequency.

Recent multimedia applications for handheld and portable devices place a limit on the available wireless bandwidth. Wavelet based techniques such as JPEG 2000 for image compression has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> than conventional methods in terms of compression ratio.

Similarly, though the challenge tapers off dramatically toward the end, its combat is welcoming, gratifying, and hypnotic." [...] Joystiq praised everything the same console version had <b>to</b> <b>offer.</b> Edge gave said console version six out of ten and felt that said console version did not reinvent anything, and had several issues, writing that [...] "Reckonings appeal soon wanes" [...] and that it [...] "never quite balances accessibility with the depth expected from an RPG either."

Despite lauding an [...] "engaging, artless audacity" [...] to Bates's music, Johnson wrote: Yet I confess I found much of Alternative Energy overblown, slick and superficial, centered on surface sonic glitz and [...] "hip" [...] populist riffing with little musical substance at its core. Bates' music is concentrated on pulsing rhythms and shifting beats almost {{to the exclusion of}} everything else. Ultimately, that doesn’t have <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> over the long term, much less enough to sustain a 25-minute symphony for large orchestra. Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle was more positive, however, describing the symphony as [...] "fantastic" [...] and opining, [...] "Bates ... writes music that is simultaneously old-fashioned in its outlook and bracingly new in its demeanor, and it satisfies the same urge for accessible novelty that people find in the other arts." ...|$|R
