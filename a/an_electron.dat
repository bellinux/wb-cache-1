5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of <b>an</b> <b>electron.</b> This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. <b>An</b> <b>electron</b> can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital.

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>electron</b> generates an {{electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives {{an electric}} motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> donor and one as <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E
5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period.

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>electrons</b> can exhibit non-particle (wave-like) effects such as diffraction, a full {{analysis}} of electron paths {{can be obtained}} by solving Maxwell's equation—however in many situations, the particle interpretation may provide a sufficient approximation with great reduction in complexity.|$|R
5|$|For <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> to {{transition}} between two different states, e.g. grounded state to first excited level (ionization), it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching {{the difference in}} the potential energy of those levels, according to Niels Bohr model, what can be precisely calculated by the Schrödinger equation.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—exhibit {{a degree of}} wave-like behavior. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, explored {{whether or not the}} movement of <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. Schrödinger's equation, published in 1926, describes <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding <b>an</b> <b>electron</b> at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle. For example, it can be refracted like a wave, and has mass like a particle.|$|E
