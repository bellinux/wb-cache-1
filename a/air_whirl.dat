50|$|The {{grinding}} stock is fed to the mill via an inlet box and is pre-crushed by the tools {{on top of}} the rotor. The precrushing tools also carry the product into the milling zone {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the {{grinding stock}} is fluidised in the air stream between rotor and stator caused by rotation and the U-shaped grinding tools. The special design of these tools creates massive <b>air</b> <b>whirls</b> in the grinding zone (this is where the name of the mill comes from). These <b>air</b> <b>whirls</b> cause the main grinding effect. The particles collide with each other in these whirlwinds. The final particle size can be adjusted by changing the clearance between rotor and stator, air flow and rotor speed.|$|R
60|$|He {{had already}} spent {{several months in}} this {{condition}} when the Prince of the <b>Air</b> <b>whirled</b> her away, to the grief and despair of every man on the island. But sad though everybody was, the Prince of the Golden Isle was perfectly inconsolable, and he passed both days and nights in bemoaning his loss.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{goes the}} smoke!" [...] exclaimed the Pathfinder, as a current of <b>air</b> <b>whirled</b> a little column of the vapor from the land, {{allowing}} it to rise spirally above {{the bed of the}} river. [...] "A good flint, a small bit of steel, and plenty of dry leaves makes a quick fire. I hope Eau-douce will have the wit to bethink him of the damp wood now when it may serve us all a good turn." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{struck a}} light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, {{caught by the}} <b>air,</b> <b>whirled</b> up the chimney. Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and {{smoulder}} into ashes. He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots {{that would not be}} removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. How those stains were dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were bloody.|$|R
6000|$|She quickened her feet, and met {{him where}} [...] They had predesigned: And they clasped, and mounted, and cleft the <b>air</b> Upon <b>whirling</b> wheels; till {{the will to}} bind Her life with his made the moments there [...] Efface the years behind.|$|R
60|$|I stood my {{ground and}} stared {{him in the}} face, till I could see nothing but wind-blown yellow, and strange, brutal eyes. Then he {{advanced}} a little nearer. Whereupon I also raised my hand with a gesture like his own, and demanded loudly where I was, what was this place, and who was he. His very ears pricked forward, he listened so intently. He came nearer yet, then stayed, tossed {{his head into the}} <b>air,</b> <b>whirled</b> the long leather thong he carried above his head, and, signing to me to follow, set off with so swift and easy a stride as would soon have carried him out of sight, had he not turned and perceived how slowly I could follow him.|$|R
60|$|As I {{took hold}} of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly {{truncated}} at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of <b>air</b> <b>whirled</b> round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.|$|R
60|$|Then suddenly, {{with a sort}} of fury, he {{made three}} vast strides and leapt towards them. He leapt badly; he made a series of somersaults in the <b>air,</b> <b>whirled</b> right over them, and {{vanished}} with an enormous splash amidst the cactus bladders. What the Selenites made of this amazing, and to my mind undignified irruption from another planet, I have no means of guessing. I seem to remember the sight of their backs as they ran in all directions, but I am not sure. All these last incidents before oblivion came are vague and faint in my mind. I know I made a step to follow Cavor, and tripped and fell headlong among the rocks. I was, I am certain, suddenly and vehemently ill. I seem to remember, a violent struggle and being gripped by metallic clasps....|$|R

60|$|Henry waited no longer, but, {{raising his}} musket, {{fired at the}} leader of the wolves. With a snarl the beast sprang into the <b>air</b> and <b>whirled</b> over and over in his death agonies. The {{struggle}} carried him further away from where Henry stood, and without loss of time the youth reloaded his weapon, so that he might be prepared for another attack.|$|R

And {{sometimes}} to those streams of upper <b>air</b> Which <b>whirl</b> {{the earth in}} its diurnal round, [...] 490 She would ascend, and win the spirits there To let her join their chorus.

50|$|The {{product to}} be {{processed}} is fed to the mill centrally via an inlet box {{at the top and}} is pre-crushed by primary beater tools when reaching the top of the rotor. The beaters also accelerate the product, moving it into the milling zone proper, {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the grinding stock fluidised in the air flow is comminuted by the grinding tools (rotor, stator). The stator is formed by a cover enclosing the rotor. The inside of this cover is provided with toothed grooves running vertical, i.e. crosswise to the sense of rotation of the rotor. The outside of the rotor is covered by numerous U-shaped sections which form a deep cassette-type structure. This geometry creates extreme <b>air</b> <b>whirls</b> in the rotor's grinding zone which induce intense secondary comminution processes due to the particles crashing into each other and due to friction and shearing forces. The final particle size can be adjusted over a wide range by changing the grinding rotor clearance, air flow and rotor speed.|$|R
60|$|The winding pass, {{which for}} some {{singular}} reason he now pursued in solitude, instead {{of returning to}} the busy camp for aid and assistance, conducted the knight to a small green valley, covered with sweet herbs, and entirely surrounded by hanging woods. In the centre rose {{the ruins of a}} Doric fane: three or four columns, grey and majestic. All was still and silent, save that in the clear blue sky an eagle flew, high in the <b>air,</b> but <b>whirling</b> round the temple.|$|R
60|$|Here he {{made another}} bow and threw his pointed cap {{high into the}} <b>air,</b> where it <b>whirled</b> {{over and over and}} finally fell {{straight}} upon his head again. There was a shout of applause at this feat, and Tot laughed loudly and clapped his hands.|$|R
6000|$|They {{left the}} Prince's {{platform}} {{and came to}} the next, where three gaily dressed Clowns were bounding into the <b>air</b> and <b>whirling</b> around before they came down again. Every time they jumped they cried: [...] "All right, Mr. Johnson!" [...] in their shrill voices, and often one of them would fall on his head or back instead of landing on his feet. When this happened they were not hurt, for the platform was soft and yielding; so they sprang up at once and tried it over again, laughing at their own mishaps.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will give}} me {{pleasure}} to so favor you," [...] replied the eagle, politely; so Policeman Bluejay led the way and the eagle followed with such mighty strokes of its wings that the <b>air</b> was sent <b>whirling</b> in little eddies behind him, as the water is churned by a steamer's paddles.|$|R
60|$|What grave? what grave? Your noble father lieth in no grave, I saw his dust strewn on the <b>air,</b> his ashes <b>Whirled</b> {{through the}} windy streets like common straws To plague a beggar's eyesight, and his head, That gentle head, {{set on the}} prison spike, For the vile rabble in their {{insolence}} To shoot their tongues at.|$|R
60|$|Breckenridge's {{response}} was unpremeditated, but the half-broken horse, provoked by his sudden movement, rose with fore hoofs in the <b>air,</b> and then <b>whirled</b> round in a circle. Its rider laughed exultantly, swaying lithely, {{with the big}} hat still in one hand that disdained the bridle; but his face grew grave when there was quietness again, and he turned towards the girl.|$|R
5000|$|Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News rated it {{two out of}} five {{stars and}} commented, [...] "To borrow from A Chorus Line, Shaolin rates as follows - Martial arts: 10. Magic: 3 [...] [...] [...] Some kung-fu moves will make your head spin. When these {{performers}} launch into the <b>air</b> and <b>whirl</b> nearly horizontal to the ground, it's no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon special effect. Unfortunately, cheesy sets and choppy staging choices undermine the highs. Lights and piped-in music don't seamlessly fade and bridge scenes. They slam off, like someone hitting the brakes to avoid a car crash. If you love martial arts and think Kill Bill is high art, you might not mind." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then came}} a shock as paralyzing as it was appalling. The hut seemed to be lifted into the <b>air</b> and <b>whirled</b> around. Then came a crash, and the {{structure}} fell over {{on the ice and}} snow of the river, or lake, below. The boys tumbled in a heap, with Jack Wumble on top of them. Before they could get up, all felt themselves moving swiftly along in a wind that was blowing little short of a tornado. All was pitch black around them and to get up, or to do anything, was totally out of the question. Sam started to ask Dick a question, when something hit him on the head, and he fell back unconscious.|$|R
50|$|A {{fire whirl}} {{consists}} of a core of ash, and an invisible rotating pocket of <b>air.</b> A fire <b>whirl</b> can reach up to 2,000 F, hot enough to potentially reignite ashes sucked up from the ground. Often, fire whirls are created when a wildfire or firestorm creates its own wind, which can turn into a vortex of fire.This causes the tall and skinny appearance of a fire whirl's core.|$|R
6000|$|So, flush'd with wine, and clad in raiment white [...] Above their mail, {{the young}} men follow'd him, Their guide a fading camp-fire in the night, [...] And the sea's moaning in the {{distance}} dim.

60|$|During {{three days}} and three nights the {{hurricane}} raged, and the snow was blown up in the <b>air</b> and <b>whirled</b> about like the foam of the roaring sea; but our wanderers did not feel its effects much, for they had chosen a very sheltered spot {{at the foot of}} a large pine, which grew in a hollow, where a cliff on one side and a bluff of wood on the other rendered the blast powerless. Its fierce howling could be heard, however, if not felt; and as the brother and sister lay at the bottom of their hole in the snow, with their toes to the comfortable fire, they chatted much more cheerily than might have been expected in the midst of such a scene, and gazed upward from time to time with comparative indifference at the dark clouds and snow-drifts that were rushing madly overhead.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Unmanned Aero Vehicle is {{developing}} very fast lately for its outstanding features like vertically taking-off and landing, stopping and suspending in the <b>air,</b> and <b>whirling,</b> etc. In this thesis, Dishing Unmanned Aero Vehicle （Dishing UAV ） was introduced, whose design of single-rotor plus three group control vane flake composite structures and the unique culverts {{enable it to}} enhance a higher propeller prompting efficiency, {{as well as the}} easier flying posture controlling and safer flying security. By Systematically analyzing the air-powered features of all Dishing UAV components, The Simulation model of dynamics and flight was established on which controller was designed using H 2 ／H ∞ theory to solve the problems of parameter non determinacy and interference restriction. After testing the Simulation model, conclusion was made that the controller {{plays an important role in}} restricting outside interference and improving the manipulating security of the UAV as well as the function of flight-controlling system.

5000|$|Architects {{may also}} select {{the form of}} a {{building}} to meet environmental goals. For example, Foster and Partners' 30 St Mary Axe, London, known as [...] "The Gherkin" [...] for its cucumber-like shape, is a solid of revolution designed using parametric modelling. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise <b>whirling</b> <b>air</b> currents at its base. Despite the building's apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are quadrilaterals, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was only}} for an instant that Zee Zee sat still; then {{he was in the}} <b>air,</b> darting, diving, <b>whirling,</b> going through all sorts of antics as he caught tiny insects too small for Peter to see. Peter began to wonder how he kept still long enough to sleep at night. And his voice was quite as busy as his wings. [...] "Zee, zee, zee, zee!" [...] he would cry. But this was only one of many notes. At times he would sing a {{beautiful}} little song and then again it would seem {{as if he were trying}} to imitate other members of the Warbler family.|$|R
60|$|There {{was every}} {{indication}} of a dust-storm, though the sun still shone brilliantly. The hot wind had become wild and rampant. It was whipping up the sandy coating of the plain in every direction. High in the <b>air</b> were seen <b>whirling</b> spires and cones of sand--a curious effect against the deep-blue sky. Below, puffs of sand were breaking out of the plain in every direction, as though the plain were alive with invisible horsemen. These sandy cloudlets were instantly dissipated by the wind; it was the larger clouds that were lifted whole into the air, and the larger clouds of sand were {{becoming more and more}} the rule.|$|R
60|$|It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that the light of the lamp, though bestowing the doubtful privilege of a clearer view of Mr. Repetto's face, held certain disadvantages. Scarcely had the staff of Cosy Moments reached the faint yellow pool of light, in the centre of which Mr. Repetto reclined, than, with a suddenness which caused them to leap into the air, there sounded from the darkness down the road the crack-crack-crack of a revolver. Instantly from the opposite direction came other shots. Three bullets flicked grooves in the roadway almost at Billy's feet. The Kid gave a sudden howl. Psmith's hat, suddenly imbued with life, sprang into the <b>air</b> and vanished, <b>whirling</b> into the night.|$|R
50|$|Architects use {{mathematics}} {{for several}} reasons, {{leaving aside the}} necessary use of mathematics in the engineering of buildings. Firstly, they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building. Secondly, they use mathematics to design forms that are considered beautiful or harmonious. From {{the time of the}} Pythagoreans with their religious philosophy of number, architects in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, the Islamic world and the Italian Renaissance have chosen the proportions of the built environment - buildings and their designed surroundings - according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles. Thirdly, they may use mathematical objects such as tessellations to decorate buildings. Fourthly, they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise <b>whirling</b> <b>air</b> currents at the base of tall buildings.|$|R

6000|$|The wind {{commenced}} at south-west, on this occasion, and it blew fresh {{for several}} hours, sending us ahead on our course, {{at the rate}} of eleven knots. As the sea got up, and sail was reduced, our speed was a little diminished perhaps; but we must have made more than a hundred miles in the first ten hours. The day was bright, cloudless, genial, and even bland; there being nothing unpleasant in the feeling of the swift currents of the <b>air,</b> that <b>whirled</b> past us. At sunset I did not quite like the appearance of the horizon; and we let the ship wade through it, under her three top-sails, single-reefed, her fore-course, and fore-top-mast staysail. This was short canvass, for a vessel that had the wind nearly over her taffrail. At nine o'clock, second reefs were taken in, and at ten, the mizen-top-sail was furled. I then turned in, deeming the ship quite snug, leaving orders with the mates to reduce the sail, did they find the ship straining, or the spars in danger, and to call me should anything serious occur. I was not called until daylight, when Talcott laid his hand on my shoulder, and said, [...] "You had better turn out, Captain Wallingford; we have a peeler, and I want a little advice." ...|$|R
60|$|Across {{the brown}} of the hard, pebbly desert {{there had been}} visible for some time a single long, thin, yellow streak, {{extending}} north and south {{as far as they}} could see. It was a band of sand not more than a few hundred yards across, and rising at the highest to eight or ten feet. But the prisoners were astonished to observe that the Arabs pointed at this with an air of the utmost concern, and they halted when they came to the edge of it like men upon the brink of an unfordable river. It was very light, dusty sand, and every wandering breath of wind sent it dancing into the <b>air</b> like a <b>whirl</b> of midges. The Emir Abderrahman tried to force his camel into it, but the creature, after a step or two, stood still and shivered with terror.|$|R
40|$|Internal fire whirls in a {{vertical}} square channel were studied experimentally in {{a vertical}} square channel of size 2 m by 2 m and height 15 m. Onsetting of fire whirl at different ventilation {{conditions at the}} shaft bottom was studied.

Predicted results were applied to justify the experimental observations. The bottom vent size was identified {{to be important in}} onsetting internal fire <b>whirls.</b> <b>Air</b> temperature and velocity profiles at center measured and predicted were compared. From the experimental observations and associated numerical experiments, it is further verified that the single corner gap is the key factor in generating a stable fire whirl in a vertical channel.

50|$|The spin of the Earth starts {{slowing down}} dramatically. It is {{estimated}} Earth would stop spinning {{in as little}} as 5 years. The first effect is the isolation between the Global Positioning System satellites and ground-based atomic clocks. Then stock markets crash because of uncertainty about humanity's future. As times goes on the oceanic bulge of water at the equator moves northward and southward. The water floods Russia, Canada, Antarctica and northern Europe. The atmosphere, once shaking solar heat out over the world and shifting <b>air,</b> stops and <b>whirls</b> to the poles. The air starts to thin at the equator and people have to migrate to more northerly and southerly cities in order to keep up with denser air. There is a higher risk of solar radiation as the magnetosphere weakens because of the slowing inner core. As the Earth slows, the crust, mantle and the molten core slows down at a different speeds, causing massive friction. This creates tremendous earthquakes where there have never been earthquakes before.|$|R
