5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E

This is why in Fallout before you leave the Vault we really wanted that sense of isolationism. That sense: You are the only personality here on the Wasteland who is called a normal person <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feel like special in that way.|$|E

2500|$|Some holiday airings of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy had Charlie McCarthy {{trying to}} recite the poem from memory, {{resulting}} in such lines as: [...] "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care/In hopes that the laundryman soon would be there". (A few times the line went: [...] "In hopes that the room could stand some fresh air"), [...] "He flies through {{the air with the}} greatest of ease/The jolly old elf in the red BVD's", and [...] "Now, Dasher, Now, Dancer, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know/Dasher and Dancer paid $220 to show!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a lecture}} on {{autobiography}} and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked to him by audiences, all of which annoy him or bother him in some way. These are: (1) Who are your influences? (2) What time of day do you work, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> write on? (3) I read an interview with an author who says that, {{at a certain point}} in writing a novel, the characters [...] "take over" [...] and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too? (4) Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular [...] "This one always raises my blood pressure" [...] and quoted Nabokov in response.|$|E

2500|$|After Ott {{become the}} {{ambassador}} to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had a breakfast with him everyday {{where the two}} discussed in detail German-Japanese relations, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin. Ott trusted Sorge {{so much that he}} sent him out as a German courier to carry secret messages to the German consulates in Canton, Hong Kong, and Manila. Sorge himself noted about his influence in the German Embassy: [...] "They would come to me and say, 'we have found out such and such a thing, have you heard about it <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think?'". Of all of Sorge's various relationships with women, the most durable and lastingly was with a Japanese woman Hanako Ishii who tried to curb Sorge's heavy drinking and his habit of recklessly riding his motorcycle around the Japanese countryside in a manner that everyone viewed as almost suicidal.|$|E
2500|$|The apparitions of Our Lady of Good Help were {{reported}} by Adele Brise in 1859. In December 2010, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay, Wisconsin approved the apparition as worthy of belief, as the first Marian apparition approved in the United States at the local level. In Robinsonville (now called Champion) WI, a young Belgian immigrant woman named Adele Brise was walking through a wooded area when she saw a beautiful woman standing between a maple and a hemlock tree. She saw the lady again {{on her way to}} Mass, and walked past her again. After Mass she told her priest about the apparition, and he told her to ask the Lady [...] "In God's name, who are you <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want of me?" [...] When Adele walked past the spot again, the Lady was there, and Adele asked what she was told by the priest. The Lady replied, [...] "I am the Queen of Heaven who prays for the conversion of sinners." [...] She gave Adele the mission to teach the children of the area their Catechism, which Adele did faithfully. Soon after, Adele's father built a small chapel between the trees, and later two more churches were built on the spot before the present brick church, built in 1942. The apparitions, attributed to Our Lady of Good Help, were approved on December 8, 2010, by Bishop David L. Ricken of the Diocese of Green Bay.|$|E
