5|$|Although {{the club}} entered the Intertoto Cup in 2005–06, a defeat by Spanish club Deportivo de La Coruña {{meant that they}} did not qualify for further European {{competition}} that season. Given played in all of the club's league matches as they finished in seventh position and he signed a new five-year contract with the club in the summer. His performances for Newcastle led to Given being named in the Premier League's Team of the Season. Given played in all of the club's FA Cup games <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the quarter-finals, and captained the team for three games during Alan Shearer's absence.|$|E

5|$|As runners-up to League champions Manchester United in the 1996 FA Cup Final, Liverpool {{were able}} {{to compete in the}} 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. This proved the club's most {{successful}} campaign since their return to European competition, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the semi-finals, where they were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate by Paris Saint–Germain. In the next two seasons, Liverpool played in the UEFA Cup but were eliminated at an early stage of the competition, by Strasbourg and Celta de Vigo, respectively. A seventh-place finish in the 1998–99 FA Premier League meant the club did not qualify for Europe in 1999–2000.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{had some}} success after being reformed, winning the 1902 Scottish Cup and their first league {{championship}} a year later. After this, however, the club endured a long barren spell. The club lost its placing in the league, and were relegated {{for the first time}} in 1931, although they were promoted back to the top division two years later. The notorious Scottish Cup drought began <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> three cup finals, two in consecutive years, but lost each of them.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was lost}} to the Rangers early in the 1928–29 season when he {{suffered}} a broken ankle during a December game against the Maroons. A couple days after his injury, {{he had to be}} rescued when a fire threatened the Montreal hospital he was convalescing at. Johnson missed virtually the entire regular season with the injury, but returned in time for the 1929 playoffs, and was credited with improving the Rangers' play <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the final against the Boston Bruins.|$|E

The drop was almost a total success, with the majority of the raiding force landing {{on the edge of the}} drop zone; however, half of the 'Nelson' detachment landed two miles short of the DZ. Once the other detachments had gathered their equipment and orientated themselves, they moved off to undertake their arranged tasks.|$|E
5|$|The club {{were unable}} to match this success in the two seasons that followed, and {{finished}} in 11th and 12th places respectively. The 1949–50 season brought another disappointing league campaign. The season started well, as the club was unbeaten in their first 19 matches and was top of the league {{at the turn of}} the year. Their form declined thereafter, and they finished eighth. This did not hinder their progress in the FA Cup, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> their second final (their first at Wembley), against Arsenal. They {{were unable to}} win their first FA Cup; two goals from Arsenal striker Reg Lewis meant Liverpool lost 2–0.|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Continent.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the changes}} to the design and its growing costs, {{construction}} of three DDLs {{was approved by the}} Liberal Party McMahon Government in August 1972. At this time, the total project cost was estimated at A$355 million; this figure included all costs associated with building three ships and operating them for ten years. The ships themselves were expected to cost approximately $210 million. All three ships were to be built at Williamstown Dockyard, with construction of the first ship beginning in 1975, followed by the other ships at two-yearly intervals. The initial DDL was to be commissioned in 1980, and the third in 1984. Further DDLs may also have been ordered over time to replace the Navy's destroyers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the end of their service lives.|$|E
5|$|In the 1925–26 season Johnson {{reached the}} 20 goal mark {{for the first}} time, despite playing in a side {{struggling}} {{at the bottom of}} the division. Though the team endured a difficult league season, some of their wins were high scoring, including a record 6–1 Manchester derby win in which Johnson made a goalscoring appearance. The FA Cup proved a fruitful competition for the club that season, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the final, scoring 31 goals in six matches. Johnson played in every cup match, scoring his first competitive hat-trick in the quarter-final, against Clapton Orient. However, Johnson's appearance at Wembley was not a happy one, his Manchester City team losing the final 1–0 to Bolton Wanderers. To compound the disappointment, City lost their final league game and were relegated to the Second Division. Three weeks after the end of the season Johnson made his debut for England, scoring in a 5–3 win against Belgium. Johnson played 5 times for England and scored five goals.|$|E
5|$|Mills made 49 {{appearances}} and scored five goals for Leicester in 1990–91, missing only one match all season. Leicester avoided relegation to the Third Division by only two points, finishing one place above relegated West Bromwich Albion in 22nd place. Mills went one better in 1991–92 by appearing in all 62 Leicester fixtures that season, scoring seven goals, {{and was named}} the club's Player of the Year for the second time. This season saw an improvement in fortunes for Leicester, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Northern Area final of the Full Members' Cup, {{in which they were}} beaten 3–1 on aggregate by Nottingham Forest, and the Second Division play-offs with a fourth-place finish the league. After beating Cambridge United 6–1 on aggregate in the semi-final Leicester lost 1–0 to Blackburn Rovers at Wembley Stadium in the final.|$|E

5|$|Part of the 16th Division also {{attacked}} the 3rd Brigade in No.1 Section from Lone Pine southwards. They advanced in two waves through {{a field of}} wheat, but only three men survived the Australian fire to reach the 10th Battalion's trench, and were then shot on the parapet. Turkish wounded and survivors could be seen moving back to a gully, but in the growing light they were {{in full view of}} an 11th Battalion machine-gun, which caused devastation amongst their ranks. The Australians continued firing at targets until around noon, but it was obvious the assault by the 16th Division had failed here. In the extreme south of the ANZAC beachhead the 9th Battalion trench was attacked by the independent 77th Infantry Regiment. However, here as elsewhere, the attacking Turks were whittled down by the Australian fire, the last of them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the belt of barbed wire in front of the Australian trenches.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine government, {{bolstered by}} socialist {{additions}} in the legislature, introduced several bills in May 1914 {{which would have}} put the battleships up for sale, but the bills were all defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British {{were going to be}} given the ships as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Argentina, and the latter charged the United States with ensuring that the ships fell into Argentina's possession only. International armament companies attempted to influence Argentina into selling them to one of the smaller Balkan countries, from which they would find their way into the war.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens' home rink, the Montreal Arena, was {{destroyed}} by fire in January 1918. The team moved into the Jubilee Arena, which subsequently burned down in 1919. After spending seven seasons in the Mount Royal Arena, the Canadiens moved into the Montreal Forum in 1926, sharing it with the rival Montreal Maroons until 1938. After 72 years in the Forum, they moved to the Bell Centre in 1996. The club struggled during the Great Depression, nearly relocating to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1935 and contemplated suspending operations in 1939. Their fortunes rebounded following World War II <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Stanley Cup finals each year from 1951 to 1960, winning six championships, including a record five consecutive titles from 1956 to 1960.|$|E

5|$|The club had a {{slow start}} to the 1967–68 season but soon picked up, {{particularly}} so with a 7–0 victory over Chelsea, though for the second successive season they ended up in fourth spot. Success instead came from the cup competitions, as they first knocked out Luton Town, Bury, Sunderland, Stoke City and Derby County {{en route to the}} final against Arsenal at Wembley; Leeds won the game 1–0 in a dour defensive manner but striker Jimmy Greenhoff later said it was the most memorable of the club's trophies due to it being the first such success. The second soon followed, despite a disappointment of exiting the FA Cup at the semi-final stage with defeat by Everton, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by beating CA Spora (Luxembourg), FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland), and Dundee (Scotland). They beat Ferencvárosi (Hungary) 1–0 at Elland Road and held them to a 0–0 draw at Népstadion to win the club's first European trophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} now became {{how to provide}} this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six twelve-battalion infantry divisions with supporting arms. They {{would need to be}} organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Continent. Because the Army was now geared to a specific purpose, it could be reorganised to fit this role, and any elements which did not support it could be discarded. These reforms anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Armythe Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militiashould be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations. The Volunteers and Yeomanry would form the basis for the Territorial Force, whilst the Militia would be used as a reserve for the all-Regular Expeditionary Force, fully liable for service overseas.|$|E
5|$|This final Confederate assault {{through the}} Wheatfield {{continued}} past Houck's Ridge into the Valley of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat {{in the summer}} heat and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade followed to the left along the Wheatfield Road. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the northern shoulder of Little Round Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig.

Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield.|$|E
