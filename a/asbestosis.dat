25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of <b>asbestosis</b> typically manifest after a significant amount of time has passed following asbestos exposure, often several decades under current conditions in the US. The primary symptom of <b>asbestosis</b> is generally the slow onset of shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Clinically advanced cases of <b>asbestosis</b> may lead to respiratory failure. When a physician listens with a stethoscope to the lungs of a person with <b>asbestosis,</b> they may hear inspiratory crackles.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} associated with chronic exposure to asbestos are <b>asbestosis</b> and mesothelioma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Asbestosis</b> is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} and scarring disease affecting the tissue of the lungs. People {{with the condition}} may experience severe shortness of breath and are at an increased risk for certain cancers, including lung cancer and, less commonly, mesothelioma. <b>Asbestosis</b> specifically refers to fibrosis within the lung tissue from asbestos, and not scarring around {{the outside of the}} lungs.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} English textile worker Nellie Kershaw in 1924 from {{pulmonary}} <b>asbestosis</b> {{was the first}} case to be described in medical literature, and the first published account of disease attributed to occupational asbestos exposure. However, her former employers (Turner Brothers Asbestos) denied that <b>asbestosis</b> even existed because the medical condition was not officially recognised at the time. As a result, they accepted no liability for her injuries and paid no compensation, either to Kershaw during her final illness or to her bereaved family after she had died. Even so, {{the findings of the}} inquest into her death were highly influential insofar as they led to a parliamentary enquiry by the British Government. The enquiry formally acknowledged the existence of <b>asbestosis,</b> recognised that it was hazardous to health and concluded that it was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust. Having established the existence of <b>asbestosis</b> on a medical and judicial basis, the report resulted in the first Asbestos Industry Regulations being published in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932.|$|E
25|$|<b>Asbestosis</b> resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis. The differential diagnosis includes {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not <b>asbestosis.</b> Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of Cooke's paper, {{parliament}} commissioned an inquiry into the effects of asbestos dust by Dr E. R. A. Merewether, Medical Inspector of Factories, and , a factory inspector and pioneer of dust monitoring and control. Their subsequent report, Occurrence of Pulmonary Fibrosis & Other Pulmonary Affections in Asbestos Workers, was presented to parliament on 24 March 1930. It concluded {{that the development of}} <b>asbestosis</b> was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust, and included the first health study of asbestos workers, which found that 66% of those employed for 20 years or more suffered from <b>asbestosis.</b> The report led to the publication of the first Asbestos Industry Regulations in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932. These regulated ventilation and made <b>asbestosis</b> an excusable work-related disease. The term mesothelioma was first used in medical literature in 1931; its association with asbestos was first noted sometime in the 1940s. Similar legislation followed in the U.S. about ten years later.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} <b>asbestosis</b> is the {{inhalation}} of microscopic asbestos mineral fibers {{suspended in the}} air. In the 1930s, E. R. A. Merewether found that greater exposure resulted in greater risk.|$|E
25|$|There {{is no cure}} {{available}} for <b>asbestosis.</b> Oxygen therapy at home is often necessary to relieve the shortness of breath and correct underlying low blood oxygen levels. Supportive treatment of symptoms includes respiratory physiotherapy to remove secretions from the lungs by postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration. Nebulized medications may be prescribed in order to loosen secretions or treat underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Immunization against pneumococcal pneumonia and annual influenza vaccination is administered due to increased sensitivity to the diseases. Those with <b>asbestosis</b> {{are at increased risk}} for certain cancers. If the person smokes, quitting the habit reduces further damage. Periodic pulmonary function tests, chest x-rays, and clinical evaluations, including cancer screening/evaluations, are given to detect additional hazards.|$|E

25|$|In Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v.

25|$|Though its use has {{now been}} banned in many countries, the {{extensive}} use of asbestos in industrial and domestic environments {{in the past has}} left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities. <b>Asbestosis</b> is a chronic inflammatory medical condition affecting the tissue of the lungs. It occurs after long-term, heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials in structures. Sufferers have severe dyspnea (shortness of breath) and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of lung cancer. As clear explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature, care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. According to the , these may defined as; <b>asbestosis,</b> lung cancer, and Peritoneal Mesothelioma (generally a very rare form of cancer, when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos).|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} occupational hazards associated with mining, including exposure to rockdust {{which can lead}} to diseases such as silicosis, <b>asbestosis,</b> and pneumoconiosis. Gases in the mine can lead to asphyxiation and could also be ignited. Mining equipment can generate considerable noise, putting workers at risk for hearing loss. Cave-ins, rock falls, and exposure to excess heat are also known hazards.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the more}} {{high-profile}} accusations, it was alleged that Lloyd's withheld its knowledge of <b>asbestosis</b> and pollution claims until it could recruit more investors {{to take on}} these liabilities, which were unknown to investors prior to investment. Meanwhile, enforcement officials in eleven US states charged Lloyd's {{and some of its}} associates with various offences such as fraud and selling unregistered securities.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged {{inhalation}} {{of asbestos}} fibers can cause serious and fatal illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and <b>asbestosis</b> (a type of pneumoconiosis). Concern of asbestos-related illness {{in modern times}} began with the 20th century and escalated during the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1980s and 1990s, asbestos trade and use were heavily restricted, phased out, or banned outright in {{an increasing number of}} countries.|$|E
25|$|It {{is caused}} by the {{breathing}} in and retention of asbestos fibers. It usually occurs after high intensity and/or long-term exposure to asbestos (particularly in those individuals working on the production or end-use of products containing asbestos) and is therefore regarded as an occupational lung disease. People with extensive occupational exposure to the mining, manufacturing, handling, or removal of asbestos are at risk of developing <b>asbestosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Australia, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used in construction and other industries between 1946 and 1980. From the 1970s there was increasing concern {{about the dangers of}} asbestos, and its use was phased out. Mining ceased in 1983. The use of asbestos was phased out in 1989 and banned entirely in December 2003. The dangers of asbestos are now well known in Australia and there is help and support for sufferers from <b>asbestosis</b> or mesothelioma.|$|E
25|$|The {{main reason}} for this change in {{trajectory}} was demographic: in particular, World War Two 'baby boomers' on sickness benefits had begun to draw their State Pension instead. Other specific reasons were: men suffering from industrial diseases, such as <b>asbestosis</b> and silicosis, caused by working in mines, shipyards and other hazardous environments, were dying prematurely; eligibility criteria had become stricter since 1995; and the economy had improved and was creating more jobs.|$|E
25|$|All {{types of}} {{asbestos}} fibers {{are known to}} cause serious health hazards in humans. Amosite and crocidolite are considered the most hazardous asbestos fiber types; however, chrysotile asbestos has also produced tumors in animals and is a recognized cause of <b>asbestosis</b> and malignant mesothelioma in humans, and mesothelioma has been observed in people who were occupationally exposed to chrysotile, {{family members of the}} occupationally exposed, and residents who lived close to asbestos factories and mines.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 100,000 {{people in}} the United States have died, or are terminally ill, from {{asbestos}} exposure related to ship building. In the Hampton Roads area, a shipbuilding center, mesothelioma occurrence is seven times the national rate. Thousands of tons of asbestos were used in World War II ships to insulate piping, boilers, steam engines, and steam turbines. There were approximately 4.3 million shipyard workers in the United States during WWII; for every 1,000 workers about 14 died of mesothelioma and an unknown number died from <b>asbestosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{an annual}} {{operating}} cost of $5.2 million, the federal government's total investment in Steamtown was $176 million, by 2008. Visitor attendance had peaked during its opening year, 1995, at 212,000 and {{had declined to}} 61,178 in 2006. Many of the locomotives and passenger cars were in need of asbestos removal. Asbestos {{has been linked to}} various diseases including <b>asbestosis,</b> peritoneal mesothelioma and other fatal lung conditions. The federal government pledged $1.5 million for its removal, to be disbursed in 2011, and more money for restoration of the equipment, providing the money is matched by non-federal funds.|$|E
25|$|For most of Lloyd's history, rich {{individuals}} {{known as}} Names backed policies written at Lloyd's {{with all of}} their personal wealth and took on unlimited liability. Since 1994, Lloyd's has allowed corporate members into the market, with limited liability. The <b>asbestosis</b> losses in the early 1990s devastated the finances of many Names: upwards of 1,500 out of 34,000 Names (4.4 per cent) were declared bankrupt. This scared away other potential Names. In 2011 individual Names provide only 11 per cent of capacity at Lloyd's, with UK-listed and other corporate members providing 30 per cent and the remainder via the international insurance industry. No new Names with unlimited liability are admitted, {{and the importance of}} individual Names will continue to decline as they slowly withdraw, convert (generally into limited liability partnerships), or die. In 2014, Names with unlimited liability provided just 2 per cent of the overall capacity in Lloyd's.|$|E

2500|$|The {{characteristic}} pulmonary function {{finding in}} <b>asbestosis</b> is a restrictive ventilatory defect. This manifests as {{a reduction in}} lung volumes, particularly the vital capacity (VC) and total lung capacity (TLC). The TLC may be reduced through alveolar wall thickening; however, {{this is not always}} the case. [...] Large airway function, as reflected by FEV1/FVC, is generally well preserved. [...] In severe cases, the drastic reduction in lung function due to the stiffening of the lungs and reduced TLC may induce right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). In addition to a restrictive defect, <b>asbestosis</b> may produce reduction in diffusion capacity and a low amount of oxygen in the blood of the arteries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{abnormal}} {{chest x-ray}} and its interpretation remain {{the most important}} factors in establishing the presence of pulmonary fibrosis. The findings usually appear as small, irregular parenchymal opacities, primarily in the lung bases. Using the ILO Classification system, [...] "s", [...] "t", and/or [...] "u" [...] opacities predominate. CT or high-resolution CT (HRCT) are more sensitive than plain radiography at detecting pulmonary fibrosis (as well as any underlying pleural changes). More than 50% of people affected with <b>asbestosis</b> develop plaques in the parietal pleura, the space between the chest wall and lungs. Once apparent, the radiographic findings in <b>asbestosis</b> may slowly progress or remain static, {{even in the absence of}} further asbestos exposure. Rapid progression suggests an alternative diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|He did mount a {{campaign}} against asbestos hazards in the mid-1960s. [...] Numerous studies had documented the health hazards of long-term exposure to asbestos beginning in the 1930s. After becoming legislative director for OCAW, Mazzocchi began a worker education campaign {{on the dangers of}} asbestos in the workplace. Workers with <b>asbestosis,</b> lung cancer, and peritoneal mesothelioma played a prominent role in the occupational health and safety conferences he organized as part of his OSHA campaign.|$|E
2500|$|When asbestos-containing {{material}} is damaged or disintegrates, microscopic fibers are dispersed into the air. Inhalation of asbestos fibers over long exposure times {{is associated with}} increased incidence of lung cancer, in particular the specific form mesothelioma. The risk of lung cancer from inhaling asbestos fibers is significantly greater to smokers, however there is no confirmed connection to damage caused by <b>asbestosis</b> [...] The symptoms of the disease do not usually appear until about 20 to 30 {{years after the first}} exposure to asbestos.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Asbestosis</b> is the {{scarring}} of {{lung tissue}} (beginning around terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts and extending into the alveolar walls) {{resulting from the}} inhalation of asbestos fibers. There {{are two types of}} fibers: amphibole (thin and straight) and serpentine (curly). All forms of asbestos fibers are responsible for human disease as they are able to penetrate deeply into the lungs. [...] When such fibers reach the alveoli (air sacs) in the lung, where oxygen is transferred into the blood, the foreign bodies (asbestos fibers) cause the activation of the lungs' local immune system and provoke an inflammatory reaction dominated by lung macrophages that respond to chemotactic factors activated by the fibers. This inflammatory reaction can be described as chronic rather than acute, with a slow ongoing progression of the immune system attempting to eliminate the foreign fibers. Macrophages phagocytose (ingest) the fibers and stimulate fibroblasts to deposit connective tissue. Due to the asbestos fibers' natural resistance to digestion, some macrophages are killed and others release inflammatory chemical signals, attracting further lung macrophages and fibrolastic cells that synthesize fibrous scar tissue, which eventually becomes diffuse and can progress in heavily exposed individuals. This tissue can be seen microscopically soon after exposure in animal models. [...] Some asbestos fibers become layered by an iron-containing proteinaceous material (ferruginous body) in cases of heavy exposure where about 10% of the fibers become coated. [...] Most inhaled asbestos fibers remain uncoated. [...] About 20% of the inhaled fibers are transported by cytoskeletal components of the alveolar epithelium to the interstitial compartment of the lung where they interact with macrophages and mesenchymal cells. The cytokines, transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, appear to play major roles in the development of [...] scarring inasmuch as the process can be blocked in animal models by preventing the expression of the growth factors. The result is fibrosis in the interstitial space, thus <b>asbestosis.</b> This fibrotic scarring causes alveolar walls to thicken, which reduces elasticity and gas diffusion, reducing oxygen transfer to the blood as well as the removal of carbon dioxide. [...] This can result in shortness of breath, a common symptom exhibited by individuals with <b>asbestosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The first {{lawsuits}} against asbestos manufacturers occurred in 1929. [...] Since then, many lawsuits {{have been filed}} against [...] asbestos manufacturers and employers, for neglecting to implement safety measures after the link between asbestos, <b>asbestosis</b> and mesothelioma became known (some reports seem to place this as early as 1898 in modern times). [...] The liability resulting from {{the sheer number of}} lawsuits and people affected has reached billions of dollars. [...] The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.|$|E
2500|$|In England in 1924, doctors {{reported}} {{the first case}} of <b>asbestosis,</b> a chronic illness caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers. [...] By the 1950s, evidence linking asbestos to cancer was mounting. [...] Richard Doll, an epidemiologist at Turner and Newall, reported (in spite of company pressure) that people exposed to asbestos for 20 or more years had a 10 times higher risk of developing lung cancer than the general population. Also, a formerly rare and almost always fatal cancer, mesothelioma, was reported in epidemic proportions near asbestos mines in South Africa. In the 1960s, the British Journal of Industrial Medicine indicated that simply living near an asbestos factory, or in an asbestos-insulated building, increased mesothelioma risk.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{alleged that}} in the early 1980s some Lloyd's {{officials}} began a recruitment programme to enroll new Names to help capitalise Lloyd's prior to the expected onslaught of APH claims. This allegation became known as [...] "recruit to dilute": in other words, recruit more Names to dilute losses. When the huge extent of <b>asbestosis</b> losses came to light in the early 1990s, {{for the first time in}} Lloyd's history large numbers of members refused or were unable to pay the claims, many alleging that they were the victims of fraud, misrepresentation, and negligence. The opaque system of accounting at Lloyd's made it difficult, if not impossible, for many Names to understand the extent of the liability that they personally and their syndicates subscribed to.|$|E
2500|$|Stakeholders {{concerned}} {{by the lack of}} a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" [...] disease), thalidomide, genetically modified food, nuclear energy, reproductive technologies, biotechnology, and <b>asbestosis.</b> Dr. Andrew Maynard, chief science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, concludes that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. As a result, some academics have called for stricter application of the precautionary principle, with delayed marketing approval, enhanced labelling and additional safety data development requirements in relation to certain forms of nanotechnology.|$|E
