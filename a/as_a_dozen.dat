5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{indication}} of a naming error, Engelmann's binomial was {{used to describe the}} plant until 1893, when F.A. Haage Jr. changed Terscheck's Echinocactus reichenbachii to Echinocereus reichenbachii, which Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose later adopted. This broke with the long-standing botanical tradition to use the earliest known name, but because Terscheck's description was lacking and possibly referred to as many <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> species, his binomial was supplanted by Haage's.|$|E

5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press and as many <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> colour blocks for a single image.

5|$|Warhop {{was born}} in Hinton, West Virginia. He spent his early life working as a coal miner for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Warhop played for local semi-professional teams {{sponsored}} by the railway company. He drew the attention of several minor league teams, and in 1906, Warhop signed with the Class-D Freeport Pretzels of the Wisconsin–Illinois League in 1906 to start his professional career. His debut campaign included a no-hitter on Independence Day against the La Crosse Pinks. From 1906 to 1908, Warhop had an 82–20 win–lost record and 330 strikeouts, with a career high 30 wins in 1907. After pitching to a 29–7 record for the Williamsport Millionaires in 1909, people throughout both the National and American League started to take notice of his ability. As many <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> teams were interested in Warhop, and he signed a $1,000 contract ($ in today's dollars) with the Detroit Tigers. However, they soon sold Warhop to the Highlanders without appearing in a single game with the Tigers.|$|E

The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about as thick <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> human hairs) needles that are used to inject the very sensitive lips. Nonetheless, topical anesthesias are often used for lip augmentation procedures.|$|E

500|$|It was Máel Coluim III, not {{his father}} Donnchad, who did more {{to create the}} dynasty that ruled Scotland for the {{following}} two centuries. Part of the resource was {{the large number of}} children he had, perhaps as many <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen,</b> through marriage to the widow or daughter of Thorfinn Sigurdsson and afterwards to the Anglo-Hungarian princess Margaret, granddaughter of Edmund Ironside. However, despite having a royal Anglo-Saxon wife, Máel Coluim spent much of his reign conducting slave raids against the English, adding to the woes of that people {{in the aftermath of the}} Norman Conquest of England and the Harrying of the North. Marianus Scotus narrates that [...] "the Gaels and French devastated the English; and [...] were dispersed and died of hunger; and were compelled to eat human flesh".|$|E

The destroyers departed Singapore at 16:30 with Moran in charge of the two ships and headed north. Initial intelligence reports assessed the Japanese strength defending the convoy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> destroyers, but this was revised downward to a pair of destroyers at 22:55, based on inaccurate reporting by surviving RAF aircrew. The 1st Escort Unit was prepared for a surface attack based on an incorrect intelligence report that two British light cruisers were at sea and Hashimoto oriented his ships' patrol sectors to the north.|$|E

The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that distinguishes this series from other adaptations. The Daily Telegraph's Stephen Pile criticised the script for [...] "veering between Hammer horror and larky humour" [...] and for being [...] "cheesy". He also criticised Hyde's gravity-defying hijinks and mistook Michelle Ryan for a model. In the same newspaper, James Walton called {{the first episode}} a combination of [...] "a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches". David Cornelius of DVDTalk was full of compliments for the series, summing up its review with the statement [...] "six episodes, 300 minutes, not a single one of them wasted.

500|$|The first pueblos {{appeared}} at Mesa Verde sometime after 650; by 850 {{more than half}} of Mesa Verdeans lived in them. As local populations grew, Puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting, foraging, and gardening, which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn. This shift from semi-nomadism to a [...] "sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral Pueblo society forever". Within a generation the average number of households in these settlements grew from one to three to fifteen to twenty, with average populations of two hundred people. Population density increased dramatically, with as many <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> families occupying roughly the same space that had formerly housed two. This brought increased security against raids and encouraged greater cooperation amongst residents. It also facilitated trade and intermarriage between clans, and by the late 8th century, as Mesa Verde's population was being augmented by settlers from the south, four distinct cultural groups occupied the same villages.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Myles {{took the}} project to Beacon Communications, an {{independent}} film company established that year by Tom Rosenberg, a former real estate developer, and Armyan Bernstein, a former television journalist turned screenwriter and producer. Clement and La Frenais traveled to Los Angeles to discuss the project with Alan Parker, {{and gave him a}} copy of the novel. Upon reading the novel, Parker was intrigued by its dialogue and humor, stating, [...] "The book was all dialogue with very little description, but by the use of this wonderful language, and almost nothing but language, in a few lines [...] was able to make his characters as vivid and strong <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> pages of purple Joycian prose." [...] He signed on to direct the project after concluding work on his previous film Come See the Paradise (1990). After Beacon agreed to finance the film, 20th Century Fox acquired the North American distribution rights, and Parker was given creative control. The film was an international co-production between companies in the United Kingdom and the United States. Randall-Cutler's The First Film Company and Parker's Dirty Hands Productions, both based in England, were enlisted as production companies. Parker and the producers later attended the 1990 Cannes Film Festival to secure worldwide pre-sales.|$|E
