5|$|According to Beesley, {{many have}} written that {{interest}} in the Deseret alphabet died with Brigham Young. This, however, isn't true; the alphabet was already regarded as a failure during Young's time. Only 500 copies of the full Book of Mormon translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> Young realized that the venture was too expensive <b>and</b> <b>even</b> the most devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{physical}} load of training of members who belong to the Judo and Basketball teams, urinary proteins before and after routine training were measured by the turbidity method (modified meulemans method) of members. The following results were obtained. 1) In members of the Basketball club, significant increase in actual urinary protein concentration was observed between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on the first day, between morning and noon, between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on the second day, between morning and noon, between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> {{on the third day}} and between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on the fourth day. Significant increase in urinary protein-concentration corrected to a urine density of 1. 024 was observed between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on the first day, between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on the second day, between morning and noon, between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on the third day, and between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on the fourth day.

Significant increase in the excretion per minute of urinary protein was observed between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> of the first day, between morning and noon on the second day, and between morning and noon on the fourth day. 3) The existence of Pre (α 1) AG, (α 1) AT, (α 1) X, I(α) I, Zn(α 2), (β 2) AC, Myogl, C(3) act., Tf, (β 2) III, IgA, (β 2) I, Alb, and IgG of serum subfractions were recognized by immunodiffusion in an antigencontained gel layer. In particular, excretion of myoglobin was recognized. The experiments on optical density of the turbidity method of each fraction were discussed. 4) The main subjective symptoms (from questionnaires) which increased with physical loads were "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired" and "Wanting to lie down" in group I in the basketball club, and "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired", "Feel unsteady standing", "Becoming drowsy", "Wanting to lie down" in group I, "Feeling stiff in the shoulders", "Feeling thirsty" and "Tremor in limbs" in group III in the Judo club. 5) The preliminary care of fatigued members was discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{physical}} load of training of members who belong to the judo and basketball teams, urinary proteins before and after training were measured by the turbidity method (improved iwata's method) of members.

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began {{to be regarded as}} increasingly unsafe, especially by night. One reason may be the prevalent superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear of spirits and ghosts, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Yōmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary <b>and</b> <b>even</b> violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.|$|E
