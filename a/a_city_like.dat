[...] Among the reasons the article gave for poor attendance at the Vermont site were: past failed management, an isolated location and the lack of signs on Interstate 91, which the state opposed. In addition to these problems, the roof of the largest storage shed on the site collapsed under heavy snow the previous winter, damaging several pieces of equipment.

500|$|During {{his brief}} second term as mayor in 1912, Armstrong and council {{approved}} {{a plan to}} construct 110 miles of electric railway lines in the city, considered legislation permitting band concerts on Sundays, oversaw {{the opening of the}} Royal Alexandra Hospital, advocated for the availability of housing accommodations for all Edmontonians {{in the face of an}} influx of new settlers, and welcomed a visit from Governor General of Canada Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn to the city, planning a grand celebration. It was also in 1912 that the Hudson's Bay Company put its Edmonton land holdings on the market, the first bridge across the North Saskatchewan River in the city's east end opened, and that Armstrong commissioned a master plan for the newly amalgamated city, from an American firm based out of Minneapolis named Morell and Nichols. Among the suggestions in the report was the recommendation for a civic square to be built, which was opened 53 years later as Sir Winston Churchill Square. In his final week as mayor, the retiring Armstrong delivered the city's annual report at an annual meeting, thanked the people of Edmonton for entrusting him as mayor, and advised his successor to be fiscally responsible; stating, [...] "If a reckless administration gets in next year, Edmonton will become <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>like</b> I was in recently, where they could not borrow enough money to clean their streets." [...] In the election held later that week, he would be succeeded by former mayor from 1901–04, William Short, whom he supported and campaigned for. Armstrong was later honoured with an informal gathering in the city council chamber where he was presented with a gift of silverware; with the city fire chief proclaiming that [...] "Mayor Armstrong is bound to become a historical character".|$|E

2500|$|Josephus Flavius {{writes in}} Antiquities of the Jews about a city called Emmaus {{in the context}} of the Maccabean Revolt, which {{corresponds}} well with the large city later called Emmaus Nicopolis, located at over 170 Roman stadia from Jerusalem, while in The Jewish War he brings up another Emmaus, just 60 Roman stadia from Jerusalem, where Vespasian settled 800 Roman legionnaires after the First Jewish Revolt. The ancient Latin manuscripts use [...] "Amassa", while the medieval Greek manuscripts use [...] "Ammaous". The newly created Roman [...] "colonia" [...] soon made the old name disappear: even the Jewish works of the 3rd-5th centuries, the Mishnah, the Babylonian and the Jerusalem Talmud, talk about [...] "Qeloniya", an Aramaic distortion of [...] "colonia". This name survived into modern times in Arabic as [...] "Qalunya". This was indeed always a village, not <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>like</b> Emmaus Nicopolis, and thus fits the description by Luke (κωμη [...] "village") much better than the latter. The difference in distance to Jerusalem between Luke's and Josephus' Emmaus, 60 vs. 30 stadia, is still much smaller than the one to Nicopolis, which lays full 176 stadia down the Roman road from Jerusalem. Thiede recalculated the actual distance between Jerusalem's western city gate at the time, and his excavation site at Motza which unearthed the Jewish village that predated the Roman veterans colony, and came up with a figure of 46 stadia. That would put it squarely in the middle between Luke's and Josephus' stated distances, which Thiede considers a good approximation for the time. [...] Thiede's excavation produced Jewish artifacts of the time preceding the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, giving substance to his claim to have found Luke's Emmaus, which had necessarily to be settled by Jews. With no other Emmaus in the vicinity of Jerusalem, Motza was thus the only credible candidate.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, stating that it is, [...] "a breathless, {{exciting}} story, heartbreaking and exhilarating." [...] Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern refers to Slumdog Millionaire as, [...] "the film world's first globalised masterpiece." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post argues that, [...] "this modern-day 'rags-to-rajah' fable won the audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year, and it's {{easy to see}} why. With its timely setting of a swiftly globalising India and, more specifically, the country's {{own version of the}} 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' TV show, combined with timeless melodrama and a hardworking orphan who withstands all manner of setbacks, 'Slumdog Millionaire' plays like Charles Dickens for the 21stcentury." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as [...] "a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra-modern way" [...] and [...] "a story of star-crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced, shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn't think anyone would have the nerve to attempt any more." [...] Anthony Lane of the New Yorker stated, [...] "There is a mismatch here. Boyle and his team, headed by the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, clearly believe that <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>like</b> Mumbai, with its shifting skyline and a population of more than fifteen million, is as ripe for storytelling as Dickens's London [...] At the same time, the story they chose is sheer fantasy, not in its glancing details but in its emotional momentum. How else could Boyle get away with assembling his cast for a Bollywood dance number, at a railroad station, over the closing credits? You can either chide the film, at this point, for relinquishing any claim to realism or you can go with the flow—surely the wiser choice." [...] Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent was also full of praise, saying the film [...] "successfully mixes hard-hitting drama with uplifting action and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire show is an ideal device to revolve events around". Several other reviewers have described Slumdog Millionaire as a Bollywood-style [...] "masala" [...] movie, due to the way the film combines [...] "familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala" [...] and culminates in [...] "the romantic leads finding each other." ...|$|E
