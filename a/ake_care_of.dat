40|$|Taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds is part {{of nurses}} {{everyday}} work. The way a bed looks influences the patients physical and mental state. <b>Care</b> <b>of</b> the bed involves its arrangement, exchanging used bed-linen and especially disinfection, which prevents the transfer of nosocomial infections. The objectives of the thesis was to survey the way nurses take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds, identify obstacles associated with the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds, and propose a basis for creating a standard <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds. 3 research questions were set. Research question 1 : How does the length of patients stay on the bed depend on the frequency of its disinfection in practice? Research question 2 : Do nurses consider the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds {{from the point of}} view of the work schedule or the patients comfort? Research question 3 : What are the most frequent obstacles in the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds? The research was conducted by means of a structured observation, followed by a follow-up recording in the record sheet. An anonymous questioning was conducted to obtain results. 8 nurses present in the department took part in the observation and questioning in the course of research investigation. The research set consisted of nurses in the subsequent <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the CTM Hospital a. s. in Humpolec. The investigation results let us set hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : The overall disinfection of the bed is done after the patient is discharged from the hospital. Hypothesis 2 : Nurses take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds according to work schedule. Hypothesis 3 : An obstacle in the arrangement of the bed is the lack of clean bed-linen. The investigation results may be provided to the management of the department in which the investigation was conducted. They may result in an improvement <b>of</b> the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds. A proposal of the nursing standard <b>of</b> the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds was drawn up as the result of this investigation. This proposal may serve for unifying the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds in individual departments. Setting principles and the overall procedure in the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> beds...|$|R

2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> {{the things in}} the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything, {{there would be no}} {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. On the other hand, if he takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> only some things, why does he take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is able to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the things in the cosmos.|$|R
