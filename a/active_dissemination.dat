50|$|Though {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} mental healthcare to reduce overall healthcare costs, demonstrate efficacy, and reduce employee absenteeism while improving employee functioning, the availability of comprehensive mental health services is in decline. Petrasek and Rapin (2002) cite the three main reasons for this decline as (1) stigma and privacy concerns, (2) the difficulty of quantifying medical savings and (3) physician incentive to medicate without specialist referral. Evers et al. (2009) have suggested that improvements could be made by promoting more <b>active</b> <b>dissemination</b> of mental health economic analysis, building partnerships through policy-makers and researchers, and employing greater use of knowledge brokers.|$|E

Scientific research, discovery and education became intertwined with the moral good and were elevated to lofty goals within Western societies.

30|$|One {{reason for}} the {{convergence}} towards social investment ideas is the increased cross-national policy learning and the <b>active</b> policy <b>dissemination</b> by international organizations such as OECD, World Bank, IMF and the UN. Studies show that policy epistemic communities and policy networks are important conduits of policy learning and policy transfer, {{and there has been}} significant transnational movement of social policy ideas as policy makers and other actors become more globally mobile, and communication technology improve (Haas, 1992; Hulme, 2006; Sabatier & Jenkins-Smith, 1993). In recent years, international organizations have begun to play increasingly active role within social policy epistemic communities. For example, as a “purveyor of ideas,” international organizations such as the OECD and UNESCO have come to play a meditative role not only in policy innovation, translation and dissemination, but also, in setting international policy norms by identifying problems and providing a range of “best practice” solutions (Mahon & McBride, 2008; Peng, in press, b; Jenson, 2010). In particular, through policy documents and data sets such as Babies and Bosses and Starting Strong series and the OECD family database, OECD has effectively established family policy agenda and benchmarks for member countries to harmonize their social policies. The intensification of global social policy discourses on ECEC and social investment ideas are therefore an outcome of the global policy harmonization effect of international organizations and international NGOs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the history of}} the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS), including a regional analysis of memberships and an overview of the ISSS main activities. The ISSS was founded in 1924 by, mainly, European agro-pedologists who were interested in establishing standardised methods of soil analysis and soil classification. In total, 16 international congresses were organized by the ISSS in the past 75 years and eight of these congresses were held in Europe. Commissions, Subcommissions, Working Groups and Standing Committees have been established, which deal with virtually all aspects of soil research and management. Number of members increased from around 550 after WWII to over 7000 in 1998. Almost 60 % of the members are from North America and Western Europe. Large differences were found in the number of soil scientists and ISSS/International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) members in relation to the total population and agricultural land area. One of the important contributions of the ISSS has been the Soil Map of the World, which was prepared in the 1960 s and 1970 s. The ISSS has also been <b>active</b> in <b>dissemination</b> and publication of scientific results through periodicals and cooperating journals.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the role of}} independent fiscal institutions, or fiscal councils, in helping to improve fiscal performance. This article provides some guidance on the scope for improving fiscal performance through fiscal councils based on the available literature and the range of fiscal institutions in the OECD countries. The effectiveness of fiscal councils hinges on several factors, including having full autonomy within the scope of their mandates, <b>active</b> and unfettered <b>dissemination</b> of their analysis, and their credibility. Experience and empirical evidence suggest that delegating macroeconomic forecasting to an independent fiscal council can indeed reduce forecasting bias. There is some empirical evidence that independent fiscal institutions can buttress a government’s capacity to comply with a numerical rule. Good fiscal institutions are a necessary condition for achieving disciplined fiscal performance. Experience demonstrates, however, that their existence is not sufficient. Without strong and sustained political commitment to a medium-term fiscal goal and, where relevant, to the mandate of a fiscal council, durable improvements in fiscal performance will remain elusive.

Minstrel follows the component model for push systems introduced in [25]. This thesis presents the design and implementation of the Minstrel broadcasting infrastructure. The broadcasting infrastructure is responsible for <b>active</b> and timely <b>dissemination</b> of information to (a possibly large number of) customers. This distribution process must be efficient, scalable, and should rely on open protocols. To meet the goal of efficiency Minstrel uses a hybrid approach: The Minstrel Active Distribution Protocol (MADP) sends a small sample of the available information to the subscribers (push). If a recipient is interested in the information, s/he uses the Minstrel Receiver Request Protocol (MRRP) to request the actual information (pull). This hybrid approach guarantees that customers are informed about the availability of new information quickly and efficiently via MADP, while netword bandwith is conserved because information which is not explicitly requested via MRRP will not be disseminated. MADP and MRRP are open protocols that use XML messages on top of HTTP. They do not rely on special multicas...|$|R

30|$|The initial {{analysis}} of these findings indicates the instrument can reasonably predict the likelihood of successful propagation, particularly {{given the fact that}} there are often many deviations from what is proposed and what is enacted in practice. For five of the 31 proposals, almost no evidence of the project could be found. For the projects categorized as unlikely to propagate, there is no evidence to indicate that any materials have been adopted by others beyond the development team. There is some evidence that projects that were categorized as likely to successfully propagate have been adopted by others outside of the development team. These projects demonstrated that the PIs used a combination of passive and <b>active</b> <b>dissemination</b> strategies, engaged others in the development phase, and have provided several forms of support to help others adopt their innovation. Furthermore, evidence was found that products from many of these projects had been adopted by others and that the PIs had secured additional sources of funding to help propagate their innovations. The detailed results of this analysis will be presented in more detail in a forthcoming manuscript (Stanford et al. Expected 2016).|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the social consultants and journalist's representations of Nigerian prostitute women in Oslo {{before and after}} the ban. The declarations are based on the two groups' perceptions of them. The findings are based on analysis of qualitative interviews with four social consultants and various newspaper articles using discourse analysis as a theoretical framework. The informants are social consultants at welfare centers such as Nadheim and Pro Center, while the journalists are associated with media institutions through the tabloid newspapers Dagbladet and VG (Verdens Gang). The thesis is based on the two groups' institutional ways of describing Nigerian women and examines whether the representations are influenced by the discourses that are valid within the institutions where each of the two groups work, and this create similarities and differences between the two groups' presentations of the women. The discourses of the presentations are created through the two groups' prior knowledge, which in turn constructs their declarations of them as well as their construction of their understanding of Nigerian Women in prostitution. Both institutions (welfare centers and media institutions) are working with <b>active</b> and public <b>dissemination</b> to various actors in the community, and the general population is therefore active recipients of the knowledge and discourses that are expressed. The two groups create institutional affiliation to the community through the use of discourses on the Nigerian prostitute women.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Multiresistant Gram-negative {{bacteria}} producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are {{an emerging}} problem in human and veterinary medicine. This {{study focused on}} comparative molecular characterization of beta-lactamase and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from central Hesse in Germany. Isolates originated from humans, companion animals (dogs and cats) and horses. RESULTS:In this study 153 (83. 6 %) of the human isolates (n= 183) and 163 (91. 6 %) of the animal isolates (n= 178) were confirmed as ESBL producers by PCR and subsequent sequencing of the PCR amplicons. Predominant ESBL subtypes in human and animal samples were CTX-M- 15 (49. 3 %) and CTX-M- 1 (25. 8 %) respectively. Subtype blaCTX-M- 2 was found almost exclusively in equine and was absent from human isolates. The carbapenemase OXA- 48 was detected in 19 ertapenem-resistant companion animal isolates in this study. The Plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene aac(´ 6) -Ib-cr was the most frequently detected antibiotic- resistance gene present in 27. 9 % of the human and 36. 9 % of the animal ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. Combinations of two or up to six different resistance genes (penicillinases, ESBLs and PMQR) were detected in 70 % of all isolates investigated. The most frequent species {{in this study was}} Escherichia coli (74 %), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (17. 5 %), and Enterobacter cloacae (4. 2 %). Investigation of Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups revealed underrepresentation of group B 2 within the animal isolates. CONCLUSIONS:Isolates from human, companion animals and horses shared several characteristics regarding presence of ESBL, PMQR and combination of different resistance genes. The results indicate <b>active</b> transmission and <b>dissemination</b> of multi-resistant Enterobacteriaceae among human and animal populations...|$|R
