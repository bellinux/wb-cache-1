At the 2000 Gay Games VI in Sydney, netball and volleyball were the two sports with {{the highest rates of}} transgender athletes participating. There were eight teams of indigenous players, with seven identifying as transgender. They came from places like Palm Island in northern Queensland, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Teams with transgender players were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in several divisions including men's, mixed and transgender; they were not allowed to compete against the cisgender women's teams.|$|E

5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} {{and possibly a}} hetaera, Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her marital status remains disputed. Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia {{would have to have}} been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tournament}} is {{restricted}} to casino employees, {{most of the big}} name poker professionals and previous bracelet winners are not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b> Therefore, even though the Casino Employee Championship is a World Series of Poker bracelet event, it has typically received relatively little coverage. Despite this perception, the Casino Employee Championship event does involve numerous recognized names in the poker world. The 2009 tournament included two time bracelet winner Pat Poels, WSOP vice president Ty Stewart, Bellagio Tournament Director/Former WSOP Director Jack McClelland, and Woman Poker Hall of Famer Marsha Waggoner.|$|E

Vick was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in all team practices and meetings {{as well as the}} Eagles' last two preseason games.

5|$|During the 1996 season, the Orange Bowl was {{a member}} of the Bowl Alliance, a {{precursor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series. The Bowl Alliance was formed prior to the 1995 college football season in an effort to match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams at the conclusion of the regular season while also ensuring other high-ranking teams were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in high-profile bowl games. The Alliance included the Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and Big East Conference. As agreed, the champions of each conference would play in one of three Bowl Alliance games: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. The Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences, which had a separate agreement with the Rose Bowl, were not included in the Bowl Alliance until 1998, when the Alliance became the Bowl Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Lowell {{was elected}} the poet {{of the class}} of 1838 and, as was tradition, was asked to recite an {{original}} poem on Class Day, the day before Commencement on July 17, 1838. He was suspended, however, and not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b> Instead, his poem was printed and made available thanks to subscriptions paid by his classmates. He had composed the poem in Concord, where he had been exiled by the Harvard faculty to the care of the Rev. Barzallai Frost because of his neglect of his studies. During his stay in Concord, he became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson and got to know the other Transcendentalists. His Class Day poem satirized the social movements of the day; abolitionists, Thomas Carlyle, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists were treated.|$|E

5|$|Nels Nelsen (3 June 1894 – 3 June 1943), born Nils Johan Nilsen and {{sometimes}} referred to as Nels Nelson, was a Norwegian-born Canadian ski jumper and later ski jumping organizer. He was among the world's best ski jumpers during the 1920s, and held the world record of 73 meters from 1925 to 1930. Born in Salangen, he moved with his family to Revelstoke, British Columbia, in 1912. Credited with bringing the sport of ski jumping to Canada, he made his debut on the nearby Big Hill in 1915. He competed throughout Canada and the United States, and became Canadian champion five times. Despite holding the world record at the time, he was not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the 1928 Winter Olympics because the officials did not find it suitable for him to have to work his way to Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{unsuccessful}} bids {{came from}} Seattle Public Schools, who had proposed renovating the building into {{an elementary school}} in 2014, the first downtown school in 65 years. Initially, the district applied to the GSA in July 2014 through the United States Department of Education to acquire the property, but were rejected by the latter over the tentative nature of the application; the school board later voted in November 2014 against submitting a second application over the $50 million cost and 3-year deadline for renovations. The district was, however, <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the January 2015 auction and submitted an opening bid of $1 million; Seattle Public Schools was the first bidder {{to drop out of}} the auction when the price passed the district's final bid of $5.8 million.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Olympic Games {{were the}} first held in the Modern era and the most {{important}} international multi-sport event Greece had ever hosted. The rules of the Games generally excluded women from competition. Influenced by both his times—in the Victorian era women were considered to be inferior to men—and his admiration for the ancient Olympic Games, when only men were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the events, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the visionary of the modern Olympic Games, was not in favour of women's participation in the Olympic Games or in sports generally. He believed that a woman's greatest achievement would be to encourage her sons to be distinguished in sports and to applaud a man's effort.|$|E

5|$|The UEFA Champions League is a {{seasonal}} association football competition established in 1955. The UEFA Champions League {{is open to}} the league champions of all UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) member associations (except Liechtenstein, which has no league competition), {{as well as to the}} clubs finishing from second to fourth position in the strongest leagues. Prior to the 1992–93 season, the tournament was named the European Cup. Originally, only the champions of their respective national league and the defending champion of the competition were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b> However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well. The defending champion of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition.|$|E
5|$|The dignitaries and canons {{constituted}} the chapter {{and had the}} primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rule book of St Benedict was read before {{the business of the}} day was discussed.|$|E
5|$|The {{main purpose}} for kulintang {{music in the}} {{community}} is to function as social entertainment at a nonprofessional, folk level. This music is unique {{in that it is}} considered a public music in the sense everyone is <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b> Not only do the players play, but audience members are also expected to participate. These performances are important in that they bring people in the community and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation is voluntary. Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect from the community and nothing more.|$|E

5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b> Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of Ian Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Hassett came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten seven as Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. It was the tourists’ last first-class match for the tour and when it became obvious that they would not lose, Bradman let Hassett bowl four overs for twelve runs without taking a wicket. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hassett missed both of the matches; Australia won both by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Bath City F.C. is {{the major}} {{football}} team. Bath City gained promotion to the Conference Premier from the Conference South in 2010. Bath City F.C. play their games at Twerton Park. Until 2009 Team Bath F.C. operated as an affiliate to the University Athletics programme. In 2002, Team Bath became the first university team to enter the FA Cup in 120years, and advanced through four qualifying rounds to the first round proper. The university's team was established in 1999 while the city team has existed since before 1908 (when it entered the Western League). However, in 2009, the Football Conference ruled that Team Bath would not be eligible to gain promotion to a National division, nor were they <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in Football Association cup competitions. This ruling led to {{the decision by the}} club to fold {{at the end of the}} 2008–09 Conference South competition. In their final season, Team Bath F.C. finished 11th in the league.|$|E
