5|$|House mice {{use both}} <b>audible</b> and {{ultrasonic}} {{calls in a}} variety of contexts. <b>Audible</b> vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with <b>audible</b> warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first <b>audible</b> warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit widely on the {{acoustics}} {{spectrum and}} the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not <b>audible</b> from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the <b>audible</b> sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.|$|E
5000|$|Negative <b>audibles</b> {{like the}} [...] "big sigh" [...] {{are the first}} step toward poor {{customer}} service.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with USA Today in 2005, Johnson indicated he would know the opposing team's private signals or <b>audibles</b> prior to the game {{in order to have}} a competitive advantage. He claims that he never knew the source of the confidential information. Every now and then I'd get a sheet, one hour before the game, with a list of <b>audibles</b> for our opponent. I don't know how, but they just showed up." [...] Ted Johnson (November 2005) ...|$|R
5000|$|On October 28, 2011, Yelawolf {{released}} the album's second single [...] "Let's Roll" [...] featuring Kid Rock. The song {{was produced by}} The <b>Audibles</b> and Mr. Pyro.|$|R
5|$|The audio {{playback}} of the fourth-generation iPad has {{a frequency}} response of 20Hz to 20,000Hz. Without third-party software it {{can play the}} following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, <b>Audible</b> formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+), ALAC, AIFF, and WAV.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} several recipes, each listing preparation times, {{ingredients and}} courses. In addition, What's Cooking? {{can be used}} as a shopping list to remind players what items to purchase, and it can act as a timer to count down from a specified time and make an <b>audible</b> sound when it is done.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 11 {{companies}} were ever granted licenses by the BBC to manufacture the model, {{a maximum of}} 3 at any given time. The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, {{if for no other}} reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts, and many of these companies would have a chequered corporate history. <b>Audible</b> differences could result from the mounting screws, grille fabric, or the origin of the wool.|$|E
50|$|<b>Audible's</b> offices {{feature a}} {{contemporary}} open office layout that fosters collaboration and cooperation, an entrance that displays audiobook titles and plays clips of recorded books, an original Amazon door table signed by Jeff Bezos, custom-built furniture in <b>Audible's</b> corporate colors, conference rooms named after notable {{people and places}} in Newark's history that can be reserved using a touch pad interface located outside each conference room door, an open staircase that wraps around the Walters-Storyk-designed recording studios used to produce audiobooks, and their own combination cafeteria, lounge, and auditorium space with kitchen.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Sasha Sirota {{worked with}} Yelawolf as co {{producer}} {{on the album}} Radioactive with The <b>Audibles</b> and Will Power and played bass, drums and guitar for this release.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2012, ACX {{launched}} [...] "DIY workflow". DIY {{allows users}} {{who own the}} audio rights to already completed audiobooks to upload them individually through ACX and have them distributed through <b>Audible's</b> sales channels.|$|R
5|$|As of 2010, all of Potter's 23 small format {{books were}} still in print and {{available}} in a 400-page omnibus edition, and in complete sets in presentation boxes. Timmy Tiptoes is available in paperback, board book, a Kindle edition, an <b>Audible</b> Audio edition, and an audiocassette format. First editions and reprints were available through antiquarian booksellers.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on CD-ROM and floppy disk. A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of <b>audible</b> dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog to fit the game onto six diskettes.|$|E
5|$|ECTunes is {{developing}} a system that utilizes directional sound equipment to emit noise when {{and where it is}} needed. According to the company, its technology sends <b>audible</b> signals only in the direction of travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E
50|$|Other {{options and}} {{features}} include automatic or manual-pass catch mode, <b>audibles,</b> reverse angle replay, onside kicks, four weather conditions (fair, windy, rain, and snow), three different quarter lengths (5, 10, and 15 minutes), and a hurry-up offense.|$|R
50|$|<b>Audible's</b> content {{can only}} be played on {{selected}} mobile devices. Its software does enable users to burn {{a limited number of}} CDs for unrestricted playback, resulting in CDs that can be copied or converted to unrestricted digital audio formats.|$|R
50|$|On 3rd-and-1, coach Mike Holmgren {{called for}} a quarterback sneak. However, Rubley, the only {{remaining}} quarterback for the Packers, <b>audibled</b> and called a roll-out. He passed the ball and it was quickly intercepted, giving Minnesota the ball and eventually, the win.|$|R
5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move {{from place to}} place, usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than <b>audible</b> sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|E
5|$|Pilots had {{to verify}} that they were tuned to the correct range station {{frequency}} by comparing its Morse code identifier against the one published on their navigation charts. They would also verify they were flying towards or away from the station, by determining if the signal level (i.e. the <b>audible</b> tone volume) was getting stronger or weaker, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Port Royal, {{based on}} , {{contains}} the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to {{remove some of}} the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film. Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows, though the crossbows still fire with an <b>audible</b> musket shot sound effect.|$|E

25|$|Before the season, the Bears {{replaced}} Martz with Mike Tice, hired Cutler's {{former coach}} Jeremy Bates from the Broncos, and acquired his former teammate, wide receiver Brandon Marshall from the Miami Dolphins. Unlike Martz, Tice allowed Cutler to call <b>audibles</b> {{at the line}} of scrimmage.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Katz also founded Newark Venture Partners (NVP), {{a venture}} fund focused on {{creating}} a high tech innovation hub in Newark. The fund {{is housed in}} <b>Audible’s</b> headquarters and provides capital, company-building services and residence to innovative tech startups. The fund’s inaugural accelerator class launched September, 2016.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after {{independent}} {{release in}} June 1987, the JAMs were {{ordered by the}} Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from ABBA. In response, The JAMs disposed of many copies of 1987 in unorthodox, publicised ways. They also released {{a version of the}} album titled 1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits), stripped of all unauthorised samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little <b>audible</b> content that it was formally classed as a 12-inch single.|$|E
5|$|Since many tornadoes are <b>audible</b> {{only when}} very near, sound {{is not to}} be thought of as a {{reliable}} warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.|$|E
5|$|The DVD {{includes}} stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 {{sound and}} presents the video {{in its original}} 1.33:1 aspect ratio. An error in the sound mix on this DVD left much of Peter Frampton's guitar playing scarcely <b>audible.</b> Pegg claimed that as a result, although the picture quality is superior on the DVD release, the original VHS or 1999 DVD remain a superior choice for audio.|$|E
5000|$|We Are Legion (We Are Bob) is {{a science}} fiction novel by Dennis E. Taylor. It is the first novel in the Bobiverse series. It is {{available}} in both paperback and audiobook formats. The book was a winner of <b>Audible's</b> [...] "Best of 2016 - Science Fiction".|$|R
50|$|Players {{were also}} able to adjust penalties, set weather type, enter user records, perform substitutions, set <b>audibles,</b> toggle injuries, and change game length, as well as {{difficulty}} level. Authentic playbooks (with plays like the Wishbone), a USA Today/CNN Coaches Poll, and the Sears National Championship Trophy were also available.|$|R
50|$|Sasha Sirota {{released}} his solo album Strength By Numbers in 2015, which {{was produced by}} Sirota in collaboration with The <b>Audibles</b> and Poo Bear. Sirota performed vocals, guitar, drums, bass for this project. This same year, he played bass guitar on Justin Bieber's No Pressure from the album Purpose.|$|R
5|$|The audio {{playback}} of the third-generation iPad has {{a frequency}} response of 20Hz to 20,000Hz. Without third-party software it {{can play the}} following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, <b>Audible</b> formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+), ALAC, AIFF, and WAV. A preliminary tear-down of the third-generation iPad by IHS iSuppli showed the likely costs for a 16GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model at $358.30, 32GB at $375.10, and 64GB at $408.70 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{speakers}} {{for modern}} sirens can be {{integral to the}} lightbar, {{or they may be}} hidden in or flush to the grill to reduce noise inside the ambulance that may interfere with patient care and radio communications. Ambulances can additionally be fitted with airhorn <b>audible</b> warnings to augment the effectiveness of the siren system.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the moment when they just got <b>audible</b> in a stationary background noise. These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E
5000|$|A veteran {{voice over}} talent in radio and {{television}} commercials, Bagby produced his first ACX title, [...] "Organizational Culture and Leadership" [...] for <b>Audible’s</b> ACX system in 2011. He has also produced a number of titles for Radio Archives, a distributor of old time radio programs and pulp fiction reprints.|$|R
50|$|While {{a backup}} for the Patriots in 2003, Huard saw {{time in two}} more games while also seeing time on the team's scout team during practice. For the AFC Championship against the Indianapolis Colts, Huard mimicked the line calls and <b>audibles</b> of Peyton Manning for the Patriots' defense during practice.|$|R
5000|$|There were 400 plays {{from which}} to choose, and a new passing mode allowed players to select from five {{receivers}} on every play. Other new features and options included the following: four-player mode, three different game lengths, substitutions, injuries, <b>audibles,</b> fake snaps, spins, hurdles, dives, blocked kicks, interceptions, and laterals ...|$|R
