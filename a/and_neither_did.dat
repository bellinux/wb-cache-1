5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E

The British fleet was {{defeated}} by de Grasse's fleet in the Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5, and forced to fall back to New York.

5|$|In spring 1881, Marcus found Behan in {{bed with}} the wife of a friend and kicked him out, {{although}} she still used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as his wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, a commonly used opiate and painkiller. There are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> John Clum in his memoirs. But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E

5|$|Brown's 1810 {{monograph}} did {{not include}} an infrageneric classification of Dryandra, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> his Prodromus, published later that year. In 1830, however, he introduced the first taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra, placing D.floribunda in section Dryandra verae along with most other species, because its follicles contain a single seed separator. Dryandra verae was renamed Eudryandra by Carl Meissner in 1845. Eleven years later Meissner published a new arrangement, retaining D.floribunda in D.sect. Eudryandra, and further placing it in the unranked subgroup § Ilicinae, because of the similarity of its leaves to those of Ilex (holly). In 1870, George Bentham published a revised arrangement in his Flora Australiensis. Bentham retained section Eudryandra, but abandoned almost all of Meissner's unranked groups, including § Ilicinae. D.floribunda was instead placed in D.ser. Floribundae along with four other species with small, mostly terminal flowers, left exposed by their having unusually short floral leaves.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

25|$|The {{captured}} British {{ships were}} brought to Cádiz, which was an unusual spectacle since the capture of such a great enemy convoy by any navy was an uncommon event; de Córdova's fleet did this on two occasions.

500|$|Campbell died {{suddenly}} in July 1971, but [...] {{there was enough}} material in Analogs inventory to allow the remaining staff to put together issues {{for the rest of}} the year. [...] Condé Nast had given the magazine very little attention, since it was both profitable and cheap to produce, but they were proud that it was the leading science-fiction magazine. [...] They asked Kay Tarrant, who had been Campbell's assistant, to help them find a replacement: she contacted regular contributors to ask for suggestions. [...] Several well-known writers turned down the job; Poul Anderson did not want to leave California, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> Jerry Pournelle, who also felt the salary was too small. [...] Before he died, Campbell had talked to Harry Harrison about taking over as editor, but Harrison did not want to live in New York. Lester del Rey and Clifford D. Simak were also rumored to have been offered the job, though Simak denied it; Frederik Pohl was interested, but suspected his desire to change the direction of the magazine lessened his chances with Condé Nast. [...] The Condé Nast vice president in charge of selecting the new editor decided to read both fiction and nonfiction writing samples from the applicants, since Analogs title included both [...] "science fiction" [...] and [...] "science fact". He chose Ben Bova, afterwards telling Bova that his stories and articles [...] "were the only ones I could understand". [...] January 1972 was the first issue to credit Bova on the masthead.|$|E
