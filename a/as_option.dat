25|$|Though his {{paternal}} {{uncle was}} until 1909 the legitimist claimant {{to the throne}} of Spain, succeeded by prince Xavier’s own cousin, prince Xavier – a Frenchman at heart – himself did not reveal any particular interest in Spanish issues, even though he maintained close links with his cousin, in the 1920s resident in Paris. This changed when Jaime III died unexpectedly in 1931 and was succeeded in his Carlist claim by Alfonso Carlos I. Resident in Vienna, octogenarian and childless, Alfonso Carlos was doubly related to the Bourbon-Parmas; the two families remained on close terms. His ascendance to the Carlist claim was from the onset plagued by the succession problem, as it was already evident that the Carlist dynasty would extinguish. As measure to address the issue, in the early 1930s Alfonso Carlos pondered upon reconciliation with the Alfonsine branch. It {{is not clear whether}} he commenced talks {{with other members of the}} family about a strictly Carlist succession in parallel, <b>as</b> <b>option</b> B, or whether he embarked on this course having abandoned the plans of dynastic agreement in 1934-1935.|$|E
500|$|Although he only {{guided the}} team to fourth place in the {{previous}} campaign, Jesualdo Ferreira remained {{in charge of the}} team, with overwhelming support from inside the club, especially from former Director of Football Gaspar Ramos and former President Manuel Dámasio, who said he was [...] "the best solution to lead Benfica". In the transfer season, Maniche and Robert Enke left the club as their contracts expired; the former joined Porto, the latter, Barcelona. Marco Caneira and Edgaras Jankauskas also left, as Benfica did not get their loan deals renewed; with Jankauskas immediately moving to Porto. Benfica replaced Jankauskas with Nuno Gomes on a free transfer after the collapse of Fiorentina. Gomes scored 76 goals in his first spell at Benfica; expectations were high, with crowds gathering to see him in training sessions. He joined a depleted attack, which only had the new signing from Porto Miklós Fehér <b>as</b> <b>option,</b> as both Mantorras and Tomo Šokota were injured. The back four was also strengthened, with Benfica bringing back Hélder after six seasons abroad and adding Ricardo Rocha, a young defender from Braga.|$|E
