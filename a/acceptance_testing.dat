5|$|During the {{production}} run, the Navy {{decided to move}} the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut to a much larger facility in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant {{since the end of}} World War II; this badly disrupted {{the production}} of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed too short to handle jets. The aircraft had to be disassembled and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with a runway long enough for <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Nvidia {{launched}} the GTX Titan, a consumer graphics card {{that uses the}} same GPU die as the K20X GPUs in Titan. Titan underwent <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> in early 2013 but only completed 92% of the tests, short of the required 95%. The problem was discovered to be excess gold in the female edge connectors of the motherboards' PCIe slots causing cracks in the motherboards' solder. The cost of repair was borne by Cray and between 12 and 16 cabinets were repaired each week. Throughout the repairs users were given access to the available CPUs. On March 11, they gained access to 8,972 GPUs. ORNL announced on April 8 that the repairs were complete and acceptance test completion was announced on June 11, 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In Executable Acceptance Test Driven Development, <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> {{represent}} {{the requirements of}} a software system. As requirements change over time, the <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> have to be updated and maintained. This process can be time-consuming and risky as <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> lack the regression safety net that production code has. Refactoring of <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> is used to keep the fixtures and the <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> definitions consistent...|$|R
50|$|The {{customer}} specifies scenarios to test when a user {{story has}} been correctly implemented. A story can have one or many <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests,</b> {{whatever it takes to}} ensure the functionality works. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> are black-box system <b>tests.</b> Each <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> represents some expected result from the system. Customers are responsible for verifying the correctness of the <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> and reviewing test scores to decide which failed tests are of highest priority. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> are also used as regression tests prior to a production release. A user story is not considered complete until it has passed its <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests.</b> This means that new <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> must be created for each iteration or the development team will report zero progress.|$|R
40|$|Functionally {{generated}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> {{are examined}} using structural coverage metrics.

We refer to Pullum ([2001]) for a more detailed description about the various types of adjudicators and their operations (pages 269 - 324). For example, specific adjudicators covered by Pullum ([2001]) are exact majority, consensus, formal consensus, formal majority, median, mean, weighted, and dynamic voters; <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> can be based on satisfaction of requirements, accounting <b>tests,</b> computer run-time <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> and reasonableness <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that {{executable}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> driven development (EATDD) allows tighter integration between the software requirements and the implementation.

In addition, we argue for multi-modal executable <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> {{and how it can}} help improve the requirements specification.

25|$|Much {{like the}} Charomskiy ACh-30, the M-40 was a {{development}} of the experimental AN-1RTK turbo-supercharged diesel engine that had begun development in the early 1930s. It dropped its predecessor's supercharger, but added another two E-88 turbochargers and two intercoolers. It failed its State <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> in May 1940, but production began regardless at the Kirov factory in Leningrad which built 58 engines {{in the first half}} of 1941. Production ceased in the Fall after a total of 120 engines were finished.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposed}} replacement {{train is}} being {{designed by the}} Stratford upon Avon-based rolling stock manufacturer Vivarail, which plans to market {{a new class of}} DMU called the D-Train. These units will be built out of upcycled London Underground D78 Stock, which had previously been in service on the District line. Conversion of the old Underground stock to heavy rail use will involve re-using the aluminium bodyshells, traction motors and bogies from the D78 units and fitting them out with new diesel engines and interiors. The D-Train units are undergoing <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> in 2015 and Vivarail plans to pitch them to train operating companies (TOCs), especially those bidding for the Northern franchise, which was awarded in December 2015. However, the new operator, Arriva Rail North, has announced it will instead replace the Pacers with brand new Class 195 CAF Civitys. In October 2017, West Midlands Trains announced that it had ordered 3 D-Train units for the West Midlands franchise that it will take over in December 2017.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, AUTOSAR <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Tests</b> were {{introduced}} to minimize test effort and <b>test</b> costs. <b>Acceptance</b> Test Specifications are system test specifications with interfaces to the application and the bus.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> for requirements, <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests</b> {{can be used}} on a project as a whole.

40|$|Abstract. We {{conducted}} a survey on Executable Acceptance Test Driven Development (or: Story Test Driven Development).

Therefore, it becomes important for teams to easily be able to distinguish between tasks that were never tackled before and tasks that were already completed but whose tests are now failing again. We then describe our FitClipse tool that extends Fit by maintaining a history of <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> results. Based on the history, FitClipse is able to generate reports that show when an <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> is suddenly failing again.
