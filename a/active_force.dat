5|$|By early November 1776, the {{majority}} of the regiment's officers and enlisted men had joined Washington's Main Army while it was engaged in the battle for New York City during the New York and New Jersey campaign. They were initially stationed at Fort Washington on Manhattan Island and nearby Fort Lee {{on the opposite side of}} the Hudson River. On November 16, most of the regiment was captured or killed during the Battle of Fort Washington. The riflemen were defending the northern end of the American position from a much larger force of several thousand Hessian troops. After heavy fighting that lasted most of the day and during which the Hessians suffered many casualties, the riflemen were eventually driven from the outer works into the fort where they and the rest of the outnumbered American garrison surrendered to the combined British and German attack force. Lieutenant Colonel Rawlings was commanding the regiment during the battle because Colonel Stephenson had died of illness in August or September and had not been replaced. About 140 of the regiment's officers and enlisted men—one-third of the unit's total complement of about 420 men—were not present at the battle, however, because they were still completing organization and recruiting. A few enlisted men of the regiment who escaped from their captors within the short chaotic period following the battle augmented this remaining <b>active</b> <b>force,</b> which continued to serve with the Main Army. On December 1, the first day of the army's next regular reporting period following the fall of Fort Washington, Washington provisionally grouped these remnants of the diminished regiment into two composite rifle companies commanded by the unit's highest ranking officers still free—Capts. Alexander Lawson Smith and Gabriel Long. Smith's company comprised all the remaining Marylanders in the regiment, whereas the Virginians of the unit were placed under Long's command.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of an ideal polymer chain in a crowded, viscoelastic medium and {{in the presence of}} <b>active</b> <b>forces.</b> The motion of the centre of mass and of individual monomers is calculated. On time scales that are comparable to the persistence time of the <b>active</b> <b>forces,</b> monomers can move superdiffusively while on larger time scales subdiffusive behaviour occurs. The difference between this subdiffusion and that in absence of <b>active</b> <b>forces</b> is quantified. We show that the polymer swells in response to active processes and determine how this swelling depends on the viscoelastic properties of the environment. Our results are compared to recent experiments on the motion of chromosomal loci in bacteria. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} reduced {{dynamics}} of a bead in a Rouse chain which is submerged in a bath containing a driving agent that renders it out-of-equilibrium. We first review the generalized Langevin equation {{of the middle}} bead in an equilibrated bath. Thereafter, we introduce two driving forces. Firstly, we add a constant force that {{is applied to the}} first bead of the chain. We investigate how the generalized Langevin equation changes due to this perturbation for which the system evolves towards a new equilibrium state after some time. Secondly, we consider the case of stochastic <b>active</b> <b>forces</b> which will drive the system to a nonequilibrium state. Including these <b>active</b> <b>forces</b> results in a frenetic contribution to the second fluctuation-dissipation relation, in accord with a recent extension of the fluctuation-dissipation relation to nonequilibrium. The form of the frenetic term is analysed for the specific case of Gaussian, exponentially correlated <b>active</b> <b>forces.</b> We also discuss the resulting rich dynamics of the middle bead in which various regimes of normal diffusion, subdiffusion and superdiffusion can be present...|$|R
