Only one case of cephalic tetanus from penetrating orbital wound has been reported in literature 20 years ago.

30|$|There is {{significant}} {{interest in the}} role of exosomes in viral diseases and as a potential biomarker in these disorders. Many viruses enter cells through the endosomal compartment and coopt proteins involved in endosome/exosome formation and shuttling, using them for viral particle egress [23]. Indeed, herpesviruses, flaviviruses, bunyaviruses, and lentiviruses incorporate viral messages into exosome cargo [23]. It has been suggested that these released exosomes may dysregulate the immune response [67, 68]. Since the observation that HTLV- 1 Tax could be found in exosomes produced by HTLV- 1 infected cell lines in vitro [47], it became important to characterize exosomes ex vivo from patients with HTLV- 1 associated <b>neurologic</b> disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is diagnostic and shows diffusely abnormal, mildly swollen cerebral white matter and subcortical cysts. MLC exhibits an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Two genes have been associated with MLC. The first and most important gene is MLC 1, The other gene involved is HEPACAM. Case Presentation: We studied a Mexican patient with a compatible diagnosis of MLC. The patient exhibited the c. 353 C > T, p. Thr 118 Met mutation, and both parents were carriers for the same mutation. To the best of our knowledge, no other cases of MLC have been reported in Mexican patient.

40|$|Introduction: Superficial siderosis of {{the central}} nervous system is <b>a</b> <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder</b> mainly {{characterized}} by cerebellar involvement, myelopathy, neurosensory hearing loss, and possibly progressive cognitive impairment. Root avulsion due to traumatic plexus injury has been recognized as an extremely rare cause of hemosiderin deposition oil leptomeninges and subpial layers of brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Case Report: A 49 -year-old mail presented with progressively evolving ataxia and spastic paraparesis. CSF oligoclonal bands were indicative of an underlying inflammatory process and raised the possibility of a demyelinating disorder. However, spinal cord and brain MRI revealed hemosiderin deposition along the entire neuraxis. A rigorous electrophysiologic study confirmed a functional impairment in many different levels of the nervous system. Conclusion: The demonstration of CSF oligoclonal bands in the reported patient implies that inflammation might be involved in the pathogenesis of superficial siderosis.

The condition {{is characterized by}} the dorsomesial extension of the neck and head such that the head rests on the back with the beak directed upwards. The spasms vary in duration from 1 to 5 s to longer than 1 min followed by the resumption of normal posture. The spasms appear to be spontaneous but can be induced by sudden loud noises and eating and drinking. When expressed in poults at hatching the condition is usually lethal due to starvation and dehydration. Typically, TT is expressed during the first 7 days posthatching but can be as late as 18 wk of age. Breeding tests indicate that TT is the expression of a sex-linked recessive gene with incomplete penetrance, 86 %. Microscopic examination of the otoconia in the inner ears and histologic examination of the cerebellum and brainstem of TT turkeys have not revealed any abnormality.
