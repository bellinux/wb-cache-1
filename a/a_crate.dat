The playing field was damaged both by the explosion and by the rowdy fans {{to the point where the}} White Sox were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen and locks her in <b>a</b> <b>crate</b> telling {{her that if she}} is not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working and she would die. He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of wooden crate designs. By {{far the most}} common are 'closed', 'open' and 'framed'. <b>A</b> Closed <b>Crate</b> {{is one that is}} completely or nearly completely enclosed with material such as plywood or lumber boards. When lumber is used, gaps are often left between the boards to allow for expansion. An Open Crate is one that (typically) uses lumber for sheathing. The sheathing is typically gapped by at various distances. There is no strict definition of <b>an</b> open <b>crate</b> as compared to <b>a</b> closed <b>crate.</b> Typically when the gap between boards is greater than the distance required for expansion, the crate would be considered <b>an</b> open <b>crate.</b> The gap between boards would typically not be greater than the width of the sheathing boards. When the gap is larger, the boards are often considered 'cleats' rather than sheathing thus rendering the crate unsheathed. An unsheathed <b>crate</b> is <b>a</b> frame <b>crate.</b> <b>A</b> Frame <b>Crate</b> is one that only contains a skeletal structure and no material is added for surface or pilferage protection. Typically <b>an</b> open <b>crate</b> will be constructed of 12 pieces of lumber, each along an outer edge of the content and more lumber placed diagonally to avoid distortion from torque.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> FASTBUS <b>crate</b> {{is quite}} <b>a</b> bit taller than {{other types of}} {{electronics}} crates. The power supply for <b>a</b> FASTBUS <b>crate</b> is typically mounted below the crate, rather than being integral for the crate itself, taking up even more vertical rack space.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> {{gestation}} <b>crate,</b> {{also known}} as a sow stall, is a metal enclosure used in intensive pig farming, in which a female breeding pig (sow) may be kept during pregnancy and for most of her adult life. <b>A</b> standard <b>crate</b> measures 6.6ft x 2.0ft (2m x 60cm).|$|R

Black then interviews Law {{and his crew}} individually, each time being given a contradicting {{story of how the}} woman came to be on board the ship. However, they all agree that after she boarded, crew were discovered daily, dead of exposure on the ship's bow; Law had the woman chained up in the belief she was responsible.|$|E

5|$|Unique to this {{adaptation}} of the story, Marceau finds additional clues such as <b>a</b> <b>crate</b> full of living accommodations in the security vault of the baggage compartment {{and a picture of}} Michel's family, despite the fact that Poirot's nephew radios that the man has none. After explaining the second solution, Poirot reveals that Michel is not who he appears, but is in fact Robert Perkinson, Cassetti's criminal partner. Perkinson confirms this to the shock of the other passengers and reveals that Cassetti kept Daisy Armstrong at his house, but Cassetti gunned down Perkinson's daughter, Teresa, whom he mistook for Daisy.|$|E
5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in <b>a</b> <b>crate</b> to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|Hillcourt {{worked at}} a BSA camp at Bear Mountain in Harriman State Park, New York, in 1926 where he became an {{instructor}} in American Indian dance. He then worked for the BSA Supply Division where he broke his leg when <b>a</b> <b>crate</b> fell on him. He met James West while working at the national office. West solicited Hillcourt's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18-page memo detailing issues {{with the lack of}} patrol structure and leadership. He recommended that the BSA write a handbook for patrol leaders, and that it needed to be written by someone who had been both a patrol leader and a Scoutmaster. West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first Handbook for Patrol Leaders which was published in 1929.|$|E

5|$|The feud between Ric Flair and Kenny Dykstra (originally just Kenny) {{stemmed from}} Flair's feud with the Spirit Squad, which Dykstra {{was a part}} of. On the October 23 edition of Raw, Dykstra was angered by his teammates' recent losing streak against Flair, and he proved himself by {{defeating}} Flair that night in a singles match. Two weeks after defeating the Spirit Squad for the World Tag Team Championship, Flair and Roddy Piper lost their title to Rated-RKO. The legitimate reason behind their title loss was that Piper {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and had to immediately leave the show. Flair, however, continued to feud with the Spirit Squad, defeating them all at Survivor Series with his team of WWE legends. On the November 27 edition of Raw, Flair teamed up with DX to take on the Spirit Squad in a 3-on-5 handicap match. Flair and DX won, and DX packed them all in <b>a</b> <b>crate</b> (excluding Dykstra) and kayfabe sent them to Ohio Valley Wrestling. It was announced that Flair would face Dykstra at New Year's Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 15 April, he flew {{his final}} sortie with 65 Squadron flying support for 266 Squadron and 402 Squadron. On {{the way back}} in the afternoon he claimed one Bf 109 destroyed. This, his fifth victory, made him an official fighter ace. However, according to other accounts, only two Bf 109s were involved in the brief air battle. Finucane's and 65's likely opponents in the battle was Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Jagdgeschwader 26 and future General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighter Forces). Galland had taken off with his wingman and <b>a</b> <b>crate</b> containing lobster loaded into the fuselage of his Bf 109 to deliver to Jagdfliegerführer 2 Theo Osterkamp for his birthday at Luftflotte 2 headquarters. En route, Galland took a detour over the English coast and attacked several flights of Spitfires, claiming two 266 squadrons shot down. Galland's landing-gear fell down during the battle, possibly leading Finucane to claim it as destroyed. Both German pilots returned to France, their machines undamaged. Finucane was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 25 April.|$|E

5|$|Batman {{returns to}} the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants.

Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Jokerwho is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing.
