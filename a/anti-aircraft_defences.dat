5|$|Plans were {{formulated}} on 6 September {{to transport}} the British 1st Airborne Division to Taranto from their base in North Africa. They would {{take advantage of the}} Italian surrender to capture the port and establish <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences.</b> What was left of the Italian fleet still using the harbour was expected to have left beforehand. The Allies believed that the division would face only minimal opposition and would be able to overcome any resistance with the limited naval support available, as Taranto was outside the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Sicily.|$|E
5|$|The attacks at Maldegem and Ursel {{began at}} 08:30. Both I and II./JG 1 became {{involved}} in intense dogfights. III./JG 1 had lost only one aircraft over the target (and not to enemy fire). I./JG lost a further Fw 190 to friendly anti-aircraft fire as it {{made its way to}} Ursel. III./JG 1 lost at least two further Fw 190s to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Casualties could have been heavier, had the British <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> of Maldegem airfield not been removed in December.|$|E
5|$|The first {{unit of the}} Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) to arrive, the 2/3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, disembarked on 11 April, having {{returned}} to Australia from the Middle East just four weeks before. The US 101st Coast Artillery (Anti-Aircraft) Battalion followed on 5 May, and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph B. Fraser, took charge of Port Moresby's <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences.</b> Morris's command became New Guinea Force on 15 April. By the end of June the ground forces in New Guinea consisted of 1,098 AIF, 12,273 Militia and 2,208 American troops.|$|E

5|$|As the Dorniers passed Sheerness, the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> {{opened fire}} {{to protect the}} naval yard at Chatham, Kent. Along the south bank of the Thames Estuary 15 gun {{positions}} fired six 4.5in of 3.7in heavy shells. The German bombers opened up a little, to spread out. The cloud over the target ruined the German bomb run, and some bombers began the return trip with their loads still on board. While crossing the coast over Deal, Kent, three attacked the Royal Marines barracks there. They continued back across the Channel, having made no contact with enemy fighters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War Two the British Government created the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, and {{appointed}} Kenneth Clark as its Chairman. Despite the public hostility between Clarke and himself, Nevinson was disappointed not to be offered a commission by WAAC. He submitted three paintings to WAAC in December 1940 which were also rejected. He worked as a stretcher-bearer in London throughout the Blitz, during which his own studio and the family home in Hampstead were hit by bombs. WAAC eventually purchased two pictures from him, <b>Anti-aircraft</b> <b>Defences</b> and a depiction of a fire-bomb attack, The Fire of London, December 29th – An Historic Record.|$|E
5|$|German {{ground forces}} {{crossed the border}} at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels, {{announced}} the declaration of war at 06:00. Yugoslav <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid {{from the direction of}} Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based Fliegerführer Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|The Lancasters' {{flight to}} Yagodnik {{initially}} went well. After departing their bases, the 39 aircraft flew {{north to the}} Shetlands before turning east. During {{the early stages of}} the flight one of the No. 9 Squadron Lancasters was forced to dump its Tallboy into the North Sea after it became decoupled from its mounting; the bomber subsequently returned to base. The remaining aircraft passed over neutral Sweden where the aircrew, most of whom had only conducted night flying over countries observing blackouts, were pleased to see towns lit up. After crossing the Gulf of Bothnia the Lancasters continued over Finland towards the USSR. Several aircraft were fired on by Swedish, Finnish and Soviet <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences,</b> but only one suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|After {{their arrival}} in the United Kingdom, the {{battalion}} was transported by rail {{to the south of}} England where it set up a camp at Lopcombe Corner, on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire. Amidst the backdrop of the Battle of Britain, the battalion's personnel used their integral Vickers machine-guns and Bren guns to provide self-defence against air attack and to bolster the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> of local areas. They also undertook training exercises and formed a mobile striking force tasked with rapidly responding {{in the event of an}} invasion. In September, the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 9th Division. On 14 October the battalion moved to Meeanee Barracks in Colchester, Essex, where it took over responsibility for a defence sector from a British officer training battalion. The 2/9th remained in Colchester until 10 November when orders came for the 18th Brigade to hand over to the 25th Brigade, and the 2/9th was relieved by the 2/31st Battalion. With the threat of invasion passing as winter came, the decision was made to redeploy the Australians to North Africa where they might be actively employed in combat operations. Following this, preparations for embarkation began as orders were received for the battalion to entrain for Glasgow where, on 15 November 1940, it boarded HMT Strathaird.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Britain's coastal defences {{depended}} on extensive barriers constructed along the shores, combined {{with large numbers}} of small defensive artillery positions supported by air cover. Several of the Device Forts were brought back into service in this way. Pendennis, St Catherine's, St Mawes and Walmer were equipped with naval gun batteries, Calshot and Hurst were rearmed with naval guns and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences,</b> and Sandsfoot was used as an anti-aircraft battery. Southsea continued in service, and was involved in Operation Grasp, which seized the French fleet in 1940. Others were used as support facilities; Yarmouth was requisitioned for military use; Portland was used for accommodation, offices and as an ordnance store, and West Cowes used as a naval headquarters for part of the D-Day landings. Camber was used as an early warning and decoy site to distract raids from nearby Rye. Early in the war a German bomber destroyed much of the captain's quarters at Deal, forcing William Birdwood to move to Hampton Court Palace. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was appointed as the captain of Walmer Castle during the war, but declined {{to use it as a}} residence, noting that it was too expensive for him to maintain, and that it lay within the range of German artillery.|$|E

5|$|In September 1967, Melbourne {{travelled}} to the United States {{to collect}} new aircraft: 14 Trackers and 10 Skyhawks. To operate the new aircraft, the carrier received a major refit on {{her return to}} Sydney, which began in December 1967. In May 1967, it was proposed that while Melbourne was out of service, A-4 Skyhawk pilots and maintenance personnel could be attached to a United States Marine Corps Skyhawk squadron in South Vietnam. Australian aircraft {{were not to be}} provided, as the A-4G Skyhawks used by the RAN were optimised for air defence, not the fighter-bomber role performed by the Marines, and would have suffered heavy losses from North Vietnam's heavy <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences.</b> This deployment did not occur; the Skyhawk pilot training program was experiencing delays because US squadrons were being shipped training equipment and replacement parts in priority to the RAN, and sending qualified pilots overseas would have caused further holdups with the program, while also disrupting Melbournes post-refit reactivation. Melbourne re-entered service {{at the conclusion of the}} refit on 14 February 1969. She performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May, then sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, to participate in SEATO Exercise Sea Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{also raised}} many {{anti-aircraft}} and coastal defence units during the war. The pre-war coastal defences were greatly expanded from 1939, and many new batteries were built near major ports in Australia and New Guinea {{in response to}} the threat of Japanese attack. Australia had a limited capacity to produce anti-aircraft guns, and the bulk of equipment had to come from Britain. As such the development of such defences was initially hampered by a lack of available equipment. The coastal defence system reached its peak size during 1944. The Army had few anti-aircraft guns at the outbreak of war, and a high priority was given to expanding the air defences around major cities and important industrial and military facilities. By 1942 anti-aircraft batteries were in place around all the major cities as well as the key towns in northern Australia. The expansion of the artillery in general, and coastal defence and anti-aircraft units in particular, meant that by June 1942 some 80,000 of the 406,000 members of the Army were artillerymen. VDC units gradually took over responsibility for manning the fixed coastal and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> as the threat of attack against the Australian mainland receded.|$|E
5|$|The force {{tasked with}} assaulting the fort and {{capturing}} the three bridges was formed from {{elements of the}} 7th Air Division and the 22nd Airlanding Division, and was named Sturmabteilung Koch (Assault Detachment Koch) after {{the leader of the}} force, Hauptmann Walter Koch. The force, which had been assembled in November 1939, was primarily composed of parachutists from the 1st Parachute Regiment and engineers from the 7th Air Division, as well as a small group of Luftwaffe pilots. Although the force was composed primarily of parachutists, it was decided that the first landings by the force should be by glider. Adolf Hitler, who had taken a personal interest in the arrangements for the assault force, had ordered that gliders be used after being told by his personal pilot, Hanna Reitsch, that gliders in flight were nearly silent; it was believed that, since Belgian <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> used sound-location arrays and not radar, {{it would be possible to}} tow gliders near to the Dutch border and then release them, achieving a surprise attack as the Belgian defenders would not be able to detect them. Fifty DFS 230 transport gliders were supplied for use by the assault force, and then a period of intensive training began. A detailed study of the fort, the bridges and the local area was made, and a replica of the area was constructed for the airborne troops to train in. Joint exercises between the parachutists and the glider pilots were carried out in the early spring of 1940, and a number of refinements made to the equipment and tactics to be used, such as barbed wire being added to the nose-skids of the gliders to reduce their landing run, and the airborne troops trained with flamethrowers and specialized explosives, the latter of which were so secret that they were only used on fortifications in Germany and not on fortifications in Czechoslovakia similar to Fort Eben Emael. Secrecy was also maintained in a number of other ways. When exercises were completed gliders and equipment would be broken down and taken away in furniture vans, the sub-units of the force were frequently renamed and moved from one location to another, unit badges and insignia were removed, and the airborne troops were not permitted to leave their barracks or to take leave.|$|E

25|$|Finland {{began to}} {{actively}} seek {{a way out}} of the war after the disastrous German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad in February 1943. Edwin Linkomies formed a new cabinet with peace as the top priority. Negotiations were conducted intermittently in 1943–44 between Finland and its representative, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, on one side, and the Western Allies and the Soviet Union on the other, but no agreement was reached. Stalin decided to force Finland to surrender; a bombing campaign on Helsinki followed. The air campaign in February 1944 included three major air attacks involving a total of over 6,000 sorties. Finnish <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> managed to repel the raids as only five percent of the dropped bombs hit their planned targets. Helsinki's air defense included the strategic placing of searchlights and fires as decoys outside the city to lure the Soviet bombers to drop their payloads in what were actually unpopulated areas. Major air attacks also hit Oulu and Kotka, but because of radio intelligence and effective <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences,</b> the number of casualties was small.|$|E

In addition, the 10th Light Horse Regiment established coast watching positions, and an exercise practising the full activation of Volunteer Defence Force-manned coastal and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> on the night of 11/12 March was successful.|$|E
25|$|Before {{operations}} against the Egyptian positions could begin, the IDF sought to disable the {{early warning radar}} and ELINT facilities on Green Island, a heavily fortified island located near the southern extremity of the Canal. Deemed a possible threat to Israeli aircraft operating in the region, the island was attacked by Israeli special forces on July 19 as part of Operation Bulmus 6, destroying its <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>defences</b> and early-warning radar. Israeli Air Force 115 Squadron A-4 Skyhawks struck the island before the attack commenced, while a pair of 124 Squadron Bell 205s participated in the extraction of Israeli troops after their departure.|$|E
25|$|The British {{were well}} aware of Gibraltar's {{strategic}} value and its vulnerability to attack from the Spanish mainland.
