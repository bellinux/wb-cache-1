25|$|The EL {{introduced}} {{only minor}} running {{changes to the}} Falcon's base model straight-six engine, {{when compared to the}} radical overhaul presented by the EF. The coil-pack ignition system introduced in the EF was rolled back to the distributor-style ignition from the ED Falcon due to reliability problems. A divided <b>air</b> <b>induction</b> pipe which led to the throttle was replaced with a single, wider pipe. Engine output remained unchanged at 157kilowatts (211hp) and 357newton metres (263ft·lbf). In October 1997, the V8 engine fitted to the XR8 sports model was upgraded from 170kilowatts (228hp) to 185 (248hp). Torque figures were also upped from 398newton metres (294ft·lbf) to 402 (296ft·lbf).|$|E
25|$|The engine line-up {{remained}} {{almost identical}} to the 1970 model year, with most models featuring the 250 CID I-6 as standard. Broughams, Squires and GTs continued to have the 302-2V as standard, while the Cobra was downgraded to a 351-4V as its standard engine. All engines, other than the 429s, saw a slight drop in compression, which also resulted in a drop in power ratings. High insurance rates for muscle cars, and increasing concerns for emission controls were likely the reason for Ford's changes to its engines. Other manufactures were following suit, including Torino's main competitor Chevrolet's Chevelle, which featured lower compression on all of its 1971 engines, while SS models had the 350 CID 2-barrel as its standard engine. Ram <b>Air</b> <b>induction</b> remained an option on the 351-4V, 429 CJ, and the 429 SCJ.|$|E
25|$|The Torino GT was {{relatively}} unchanged from 1968, {{and continued to}} come standard with a 302-2V engine. The grille received minor updates, including revised divider bars and the GT emblem moved to the lower left corner of the grille. The 'C' stripe was revised, and now ran in straight lines, rather than following the body line like in 1968. All 1969 Torino GT's came equipped a non-functional fibreglass hood scoop that had turn signal indicators {{at the rear of}} the scoop (this was optional on non-Ram Air Cobras). This scoop became functional if the 428-4V with Ram <b>Air</b> <b>induction</b> was specified. The hood scoop could also be deleted from the GT for a credit. Although the Torino GT could be optioned to include all of the Cobra's performance features, the GT was a more upscale vehicle and had the more deluxe Torino trim.|$|E

2500|$|With radically {{different}} styling {{from the first}} generation, the Toronado had metamorphosed from a [...] "GT"-style car into something more traditional in the luxury car field. It was now more similar to the Cadillac Eldorado than the Buick Riviera, with styling taking several cues from the 1967–70 Eldorado. The new look attracted many new buyers, as sales increased dramatically. Front disc brakes became standard. The front end utilized a novel <b>air</b> <b>induction</b> system, splitting the airflow from below the headlights, in a [...] "bottom breather" [...] fashion.

The 402 cid big-block engine continued to be optional as the SS 396 but was only available in one horsepower rating, 300 gross (260 net) horsepower, and was not available with cowl induction. The base LS5 454 V8 produced 365 gross and 285 net horsepower, but cowl induction was available that produced more power because of the <b>air</b> <b>induction</b> and louder exhaust system. The LS6 454 option, which was originally announced as a regular production option on the Chevelle SS for 1971, was dropped early in the model year and no official records indicate that any 1971 Chevelles were assembled with the LS6 engine.|$|E
2500|$|The engine line-up {{received}} major changes, {{and only}} the 250 CID I-6, 302-2V and the 351W-2V were carried over from 1969.

The [...] "Detroit Locker" [...] rear differential was included when the 4.30:1 axle was ordered while the [...] "Traction-Lock" [...] limited-slip differential was included with the 3.91:1 axle.
