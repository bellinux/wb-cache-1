5|$|In 1981, Bantam Books {{published}} a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style {{reminiscent of the}} film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were {{cut out of the}} film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk— both disillusioned war veterans— deepening their relationship that was only hinted <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world that these characters exist in, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.|$|E
5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E

25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along.

Yenny Wahid, a religious activist and daughter of former president and noted pluralist Abdurrahman Wahid, said that ? had [...] "succeeded in conveying the ideas of pluralism in Indonesia", and that critics should not look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> fragments.

500|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to locate and destroy four specific demons. Each demon is vulnerable to a particular object which must be collected by the player: a hammer, a Bible, a crucifix and an hourglass. Once the four items have been collected, the player must track down a specific demon and cast the correct item <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> order to destroy it. Once all four demons have been destroyed, the game will end. In order to defend against other enemies such as vampires and monsters, the player can arm themselves with [...] "antibodies", which can then be thrown at enemies. Antibodies can be found in houses around the village, and will slowly deplete once used by the player. Other collectible items include extra lives and boots, the latter of which enables the player character to run at a faster speed.|$|E
500|$|Three {{times while}} serving with No.3 Squadron, Barr was himself shot down. The first {{occasion}} was on 11January 1942 when, having destroyed a Bf109 and a Fiat G.50, {{he was preparing}} to touch down in the desert {{to pick up a}} fellow pilot who had crash landed. He had his undercarriage halfway down when he was [...] "jumped" [...] by two other Bf109s. He immediately engaged both and shot one down before more German fighters arrived and he was hit and forced to land behind enemy lines. As one of the German planes came in low to strafe the downed Kittyhawk, Barr ran straight <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to throw the pilot off his aim, and was injured by fragments of rock sent airborne by impact from cannon shells. A tribe of friendly Senussi Arabs found him, dressed his wounds, and helped him return to Allied lines. For this exploit, and his earlier successes, Barr was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), the full citation being published in the London Gazette on 20February 1942: ...|$|E

500|$|Taking place 0.3mya, {{the second}} {{eruption}} {{was the most}} extensive. It was probably between [...] and [...] in volume and extended past the reaches of the caldera, down the adjacent foothills. Beyond the caldera, the eruptive products are poor in phenocrysts (unlike those of the first eruption). They are instead rich in lithic material, which makes {{up as much as}} 10percent of the rock in parts (50percent {{at the base of the}} caldera). As the first of the ash was deposited, it accumulated in layers that formed quickly and resisted erosion, but only partially melded together. However, except for these basal layers and thin zones where the ash was devitrified (loses the properties of a glass and becomes brittle), the entire sheet is melded together. Inside Calabozos, the ash resisted welding and contains more phenocrysts. Instead, erosion ate away <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> the form of acid leaching, and broke down much of its pumice content. Still, the rock layer here contains five to 30percent phenocrysts, and has high levels of devitrification and lithic content.|$|E
500|$|Minor criticisms varied amongst critics. Broady {{noted that}} the semi-3D setup is [...] "sometimes hard to navigate" [...] and {{elaborated}} that [...] "you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly." [...] Additionally, he criticized the trial-and-error aspect of the gameplay as [...] "just plain cheap" [...] and stated that [...] "in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout." [...] The IGN staff said that the level design [...] "isn't as varied as it could be" [...] and added that the [...] "jungle, snow and water" [...] environments are recycled from the previous game and reused multiple times in Cortex Strikes Back. They also described the boss levels as [...] "insultingly easy". Cooke observed that, like its predecessor, the game did not add anything to the genre and summarized that [...] "the first Crash was dauntingly similar to the 16-bit platform games of yester-yore, only with better graphics, and Crash 2 doesn't deviate much from this formula." [...] He also described the [...] "bizarre" [...] lenticular 3D cover art of the game as [...] "unnecessary and evil" [...] and [...] "a device of unprecedented agony", claiming to have contracted a massive headache after [...] "looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> [...] car for about 15 seconds".|$|E

She concluded, [...] "for all its awfulness" [...] the song is the [...] "image shifter Mars needs". Idolator's Emily Tan commented [...] "the libidinous lyrics are disguised with epic guitars and Phil Collins-esque heavy drum combinations...strong enough to soundtrack a scene in a drama series". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine similarly felt that the [...] "drums and keyboards are nicely overwhelming, but the overall concept floats {{too far away to}} make a dent on the listener". Day Hyman of Spin thought that the lyrics on the album [...] "desperately needed kick in the pants" [...] mainly noticed on [...] "Gorilla". He also drew comparisons on the [...] "Prince-channeling" [...] vibe. On the critical side, Amy Dawson of Metro described it as a [...] "Phil Collins-esque low point" [...] in the album, [...] "in which the button-eyed singer makes plans to go <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the same way as said giant ape, all over a Phil Collins-esque synth/percussion combo backing… {{but by the time the}} jungle noises kick in, you think he surely must be in on the joke." ...|$|E

500|$|Not all Capitol hauntings {{are related}} to people who worked there. The [...] "Demon Cat" [...] is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make {{appearances}} just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration. It was first seen {{in the early part}} of the 19th century, and a night watchman shot <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1862. It has also been seen by other night watchmen and members of the Capitol Police. It appeared before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the October 1929 stock market crash, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cat has not only been seen in the halls, but has repeatedly appeared in Washington's Tomb. The Tomb (two levels below the crypt beneath the Capitol Rotunda) was an original feature of the Capitol, planned as a resting place for George Washington and members of his family. The Washington family politely declined the offer. The Tomb stands empty, although from 1865 to 2009 (when it was moved to the United States Capitol Visitor Center) the Lincoln catafalque was stored there. The specters of at least two soldiers are also said to haunt the Capitol. A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I doughboy momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears. A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb. According to several stories, the soldier appears, moves around the Lincoln catafalque, and then passes out the door into the hallway before disappearing.|$|E
