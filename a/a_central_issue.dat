5|$|The British {{agreed to}} depart from their forts around the Great Lakes, and the United States-Canada {{boundary}} had to be re-adjusted. Numerous pre-Revolutionary debts were liquidated, and the British opened their West Indies colonies to American trade. Most importantly, the treaty delayed war with Great Britain and instead brought a decade of prosperous trade. The treaty angered the French and became <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in many political debates. Relations with France deteriorated after the treaty was signed, leaving succeeding president John Adams {{with the prospect of}} war.|$|E

25|$|Among {{followers}} of Judaism, Jesus {{is viewed as}} having been the most influential, and consequently the most damaging, of all false messiahs. However, since the traditional Jewish belief is that the messiah has not yet come and the Messianic Age is not yet present, the total rejection of Jesus as either messiah or deity has never been <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> for Judaism.|$|E

25|$|The Earth's {{carrying}} capacity is <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in ecological economics. Early economists such as Thomas Malthus {{pointed out the}} finite {{carrying capacity}} of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study Limits to Growth. Diminishing returns suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as erosion, an impending water crisis, and soil salinity (from irrigation) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that industrial agriculture, which exacerbates these problems, is not sustainable agriculture, and are generally inclined favorably to organic farming, which also reduces the output of carbon.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, the United States {{intervened in}} the Cuban insurrection and {{launched}} the Spanish–American War to force Spain out.

The terms of cession for the Philippines involved a payment of the sum of $20 million by the United States to Spain. The treaty was highly contentious and denounced by William Jennings Bryan, who tried to make it <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in the 1900 election.

25|$|During the 2007 provincial election, education, and {{specifically}} {{the funding of}} religious schools, was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue.</b> GPO policy calls {{for an end to}} the publicly funded Catholic school system, a merger that it claimed would save millions of dollars in duplicate administrative costs. Other items include giving local school boards a say in funding allocation, ending standardized testing of students, and encouraging programmes such as physical education, environmental education, and a mandatory course in world religions. At the post-secondary level, the GPO proposes a tuition cap of $3 000 per year for university studies and $700 per year for college and increased funding for apprenticeship programmes.|$|E

Gleizes' organizational efforts were directed towards the establishment of a European-wide movement of Cubist and abstract art {{in the form of a}} large traveling exhibition; the Exposition de la Section d’Or. The idea was to bring together a collection of works that revealed the complete process of transformation and renewal that had taken place. It was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was seen as passé for emerging artists and other established artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Picabia, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.|$|E
25|$|In March 1966, Duncan {{announced}} his candidacy for the Democratic nomination, which was quickly endorsed by Neuberger. In his speech announcing his candidacy, Duncan reiterated his {{strong support for}} President Lyndon B. Johnson's escalation of the Vietnam War with its goal of stopping Communist expansion in Asia. Duncan's strong announcement exposed a rift among Oregon Democrats, including Oregon's senior Senator Wayne Morse, a leading anti-war voice, and Duncan's House colleague, Edith Green. Green had urged Duncan to run, but Duncan's hawkish statement troubled her. Soon after Duncan {{announced his}} candidacy, Howard Morgan, {{a former member of}} the Federal Power Commission, announced he was running as an anti-war option to Duncan. Morgan had the support of Morse and Green (though Green's endorsement did not come until the final week of the campaign), and Duncan had the endorsement of most of the party organization and the major newspapers in the state. When the results were announced, Duncan won by a nearly 2-1 margin in one of the first elections in which the Vietnam War was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

25|$|The most {{innovative}} period of Cubism was before 1914. After World War I, {{with the support}} given by the dealer Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism returned as <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable {{by the emergence of}} geometric abstraction and Surrealism in Paris. Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, Léger, Gleizes, and Metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s {{in the work of the}} American Stuart Davis and the Englishman Ben Nicholson. In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. Léonce Rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler’s exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918 Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to claim that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d’Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s it {{had become}} clear to the local {{authorities}} that Malmö's interest for football and other sports was becoming too big for Malmö IP to accommodate. Malmö FF in particular had high average attendances year on year, and matches were often sold out. Apart from the issue of growing popularity, the large crowds raised security issues that became apparent in the Scanian derby game between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF in 1951—amid considerable commotion in the stands some people were pushed against poles and fences, but nobody was seriously injured. Plans for a new stadium were first drawn up in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö IP to be too small for major events, but council members differed on where to build the new stadium. The matter was dropped until 1954, when Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup, with matches {{to take place in}} Malmö. The new ground's location was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in the discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, to the city's south-east, while others called for a stadium in central Malmö, near the city's main park, Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954. Malmö Stadion was built on the southern side of Pildammsparken, opposite from the northern site occupied by Malmö IP. Malmö FF and IFK Malmö both moved to Malmö Stadion on its completion in 1958.|$|E

500|$|During the First World War {{there is}} {{evidence}} that some workhouses were used as makeshift hospitals for wounded servicemen. Numbers using the Poor Law system increased during the interwar years and between 1921 and 1938 despite the extension of unemployment insurance to virtually all workers except the self-employed. Many of these workers were provided with outdoor relief. One aspect of the Poor Law that continued to cause resentment was that the burden of poor relief was not shared equally by rich and poor areas but, rather, fell most heavily on those areas in which poverty was at its worst. This was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in the Poplar Rates Rebellion led by George Lansbury and others in 1921.
