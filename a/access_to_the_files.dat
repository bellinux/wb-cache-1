5|$|At a diner in Washington, D.C., a man {{tries to}} access files on a laptop computer, but is {{repeatedly}} denied. Meanwhile, several drug dealers receive anonymous phone calls about {{the whereabouts of}} their competitors; they are told that {{they are at the}} same diner. Two U.S. Marshals receive a similar phone call about an escaped prisoner. The drug dealers arrive in pairs as the man attempts to gain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files.</b> Just as he does, the two Marshals appear and order everyone onto the floor, causing a shootout.|$|E
25|$|Few {{figures in}} 20th century Ireland were as {{controversial}} as Noël Browne. To his supporters {{he was a}} dynamic liberal who stood up to conservative and reactionary Catholicism. To his opponents he was an unstable, temperamental and difficult individual who {{was the author of}} most of his own misfortune. Browne further alienated the middle ground in 1986 with the publishing of his autobiography Against the Tide. Historians like Dr. Ruth Barrington, who had written extensively about Irish health policy and had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> from the 1940s and 1950s, questioned the book's reliability.|$|E
25|$|The officially {{recognized}} miracle cures in Lourdes {{are among}} the least controversial in the Catholic world, because Lourdes {{from the very beginning}} was subject to intense medical investigation from skeptical doctors around the world. All medical doctors with the appropriate specialization {{in the area of the}} cure have unlimited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> and documents of the Lourdes Medical Bureau (Bureau Medical), which also contains all approved and disapproved miracles. Most officially recognized cures in Lourdes were openly discussed and reported on in the media at the time. Nevertheless, there were a few instances where medically ascertained incomprehension turned out not to be miracles, because the illness reappeared in later years. In the vast number of cases however, the judgment of the medical and ecclesiastical authorities was upheld as beyond medical explanation in later critical investigations.|$|E

2500|$|The former Indian {{counter-terrorism}} chief, Bahukutumbi Raman, {{pointed out}} that Mitrokhin did not bring either the original documents or photocopies. He brought handwritten/typed notes {{of the contents of}} the documents. He also observed that [...] "one finds it very difficult to believe" [...] that Mitrokhin could have had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> and copied them, which should have been impossible if standard intelligence agency safety rules were followed. Regarding the MI5 and MI6, Raman commented that [...] "their interest seems to have been only in the publication of a book on the misdeeds of the KGB", {{going so far as to}} suggest that [...] "The Mitrokhin notes and the two books based on it written by Andrew are part of the MI6's psywar against Russia".|$|E
2500|$|On October 14, 2004, {{two weeks}} after Texas National Guard {{officials}} signed an oath swearing they had turned over all records, the Texas National Guard released 31 additional pages of documents found by two retired Army lawyers who went through Guard files under an agreement between the Texas National Guard and The Associated Press, which sued to gain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files.</b> A Guard spokesman defended the continuing discoveries, saying Guard officials did not find all of Bush’s records because they were disorganized and in poor shape. [...] "These boxes are full of dirt and rat [...] and dead bugs. They have never [...] been sitting in an uncontrolled climate," [...] said Lt. Col. John Stanford. [...] "It’s a tough task to go through archives that were not {{set up in a}} way that you could easily go through them." ...|$|E

50|$|Many systems store a {{cryptographic}} hash of the password. If an attacker gets <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> of hashed passwords guessing {{can be done}} off-line, rapidly testing candidate passwords against the true password's hash value. In {{the example of a}} web-server, an online attacker can guess only at {{the rate at which the}} server will respond, while an off-line attacker (who gains <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file)</b> can guess at a rate limited only by the hardware that is brought to bear.|$|R
5000|$|It {{becomes more}} {{difficult}} <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> correct permission if the server is in turn the client of another service and wants <b>to</b> pass along <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b>|$|R

50|$|With a {{clustered}} file system, each node mounts the file system in parallel and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> goes {{directly from the}} node to the file system.|$|E
50|$|Starting in December 2014, {{files in}} Google Drive {{can also be}} sent from Gmail as {{attachments}} rather than links, thus providing recipients <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> {{even if they are}} later deleted from the sender's Drive.|$|E
50|$|Digify copy {{protects the}} owner's {{information}} by preventing copying, printing and download. It tracks what happens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> {{and who has}} seen it. It is also possible <b>to</b> revoke <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> or have it self-destruct.|$|R
50|$|The resolvconf program {{addresses}} this problem. It acts as {{an intermediary}} between programs that supply name server information (e.g., DHCP clients) and programs that use name server information (e.g., resolvers). When resolvconf is properly installed, <b>the</b> resolv.conf <b>file</b> {{is replaced by a}} symbolic link <b>to</b> /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf and <b>the</b> resolver instead uses the dynamically generated linked file. In a system without resolvconf, <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is normally maintained manually or by a collection of scripts. The scripts may cause problems, because there is no program <b>to</b> control <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> Resolvconf controls <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> allowing many programs to use it at the same time.|$|R
50|$|TOCED {{will also}} allow {{read-only}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> OS2200 Master <b>File</b> Directory (MFD) {{and the system}} print queues. It also allows <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> TIP <b>file</b> directories.|$|R
5000|$|Client(s) {{that access}} and use the data. Lustre {{presents}} all clients with a unified namespace {{for all of the}} files and data in the filesystem, using standard POSIX semantics, and allows concurrent and coherent read and write <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> in the filesystem.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, since content {{accessed}} {{through the}} Contentverse interface is not {{located on the}} computer or device itself, any viral or criminal intrusion would not have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> themselves. If an invasive force hacks through the server, while files are stored there, they are encrypted in layers.|$|E
50|$|A {{clustered}} NAS is a NAS that {{is using}} a distributed file system running simultaneously on multiple servers. The key difference between a clustered and traditional NAS {{is the ability to}} distribute (e.g. stripe) data and metadata across the cluster nodes or storage devices. Clustered NAS, like a traditional one, still provides unified <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> from any of the cluster nodes, unrelated to the actual location of the data.|$|E
50|$|The inode number indexes a {{table of}} inodes in a known {{location}} on the device. From the inode number, <b>the</b> kernel's <b>file</b> system driver can access the inode contents, including the location of <b>the</b> <b>file</b> - thus allowing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b>|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{this attack}} is to use an {{affected}} application <b>to</b> gain unauthorized <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system. This attack exploits a lack of security (the software is acting exactly as it is supposed to) as opposed to exploiting a bug in the code.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a single root view is that processes may be run on any available node and access needed files with no special precautions. If the cluster implements process migration a single root view enables direct <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> from <b>the</b> node where the process is currently running.|$|R

On April 15, the Ministry rejected the application. After the second refusal, the researcher sued the Ministry to the Court of Appeal on June 17. On September 30, 2008, the court ordered that the Ministry of Justice offers Taşcă the files he asked for.|$|E

5000|$|Windows {{inherits}} the semantics of share-access controls {{from the}} MS-DOS system, where sharing {{was introduced in}} MS-DOS 3.3.

50|$|Between 1991 and 2011, around 2.75 million individuals, mostly GDR citizens, {{requested}} {{to see their}} own files.

It was decided that the media could obtain files {{as long as they were}} depersonalized and not regarding an individual under the age of 18 or a former Stasi member. This ruling not only gave the media <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>files,</b> but also gave schools access.|$|E
