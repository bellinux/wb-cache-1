5|$|Details on {{reversing}} warfarin {{are provided}} in clinical practice guidelines from the <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Chest Physicians. For people with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0, a small dose (about 1000 mcg = one milligram) of oral vitamin K is sufficient. When warfarin is being given and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.|$|E

5|$|From 1960, {{apparently}} {{in response to}} the book burning, the New York publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux began republishing his major works. Reichian physicians organized study groups.

According to Sharaf, contributors to the Journal of Orgonomy who worked in academia often used pseudonyms. The Orgone Biophysical Research Laboratory was founded in 1978 by James DeMeo and the Institute for Orgonomic Science in 1982 by Morton Herskowitz.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, the <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used.

5|$|Two {{international}} {{emergency medicine}} conferences were {{launched in the}} 1980s, the International Conference on Emergency Medicine (ICEM) and the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine Conference (WADEM).

5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conduit for}} the {{transfer}} of knowledge is the International Conference on Emergency Medicine, a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency physicians by the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM). In 2012, the conference took place in Dublin, Ireland. The organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations: the <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Emergency Physicians, the British Association for Emergency Medicine, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, and the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. The conference rotated between the founding members until 2010, when it was held in Singapore. Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s, when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other nations' emergency medicine organizations; the conference will rotate to them as well. For instance, in 2014 the conference will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it {{will be held in}} Cape Town, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Charles DeWitt Watts (September 21, 1917 – July 12, 2004) was an African American {{surgeon and}} activist for the poor. Watts {{was the first}} surgeon of African American ancestry in North Carolina. Earning his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College, {{he was the first}} African American board {{certified}} surgeon to serve in North Carolina. After surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1949, he moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1950 and established a clinic to provide access to medical services for the poor. Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of African American medical students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic for the poor.|$|E

5|$|Sadler and {{his wife}} moved into an Art Nouveau-style house—the first steel-frame {{residence}} in Chicago—on Diversey Parkway in 1912. The couple operated their medical practice in the building. He {{was a member of}} the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of medical associations including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Pathological Society, and the <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Surgeons. Sadler was also a member of the faculty of McCormick Theological Seminary, and taught pastoral psychology. He argued that pastors should be educated in basic psychiatry so they could recognize symptoms of mental illness in congregants. His students later recalled him as an engaging and humorous public speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} open to all {{women between the ages}} of 17 and 35, in good health, who had {{graduated}} from an accredited high school. Successful applicants were eligible for a government subsidy, paying for tuition, books, uniforms, and a stipend. In exchange, they were required to pledge to actively serve in essential civilian or federal government services for the duration of World War II. All state nursing schools were eligible to participate in the program. However, they needed to be accredited by the accrediting agency in their state, and connected with a hospital that had been approved by the <b>American</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Surgeons.|$|E
