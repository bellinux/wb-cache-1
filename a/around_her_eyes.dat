500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Change" [...] was {{directed}} by Fatima Robinson. Pictures from {{the set of the}} shoot were revealed in November 2007, and the video made its premiere on 16 November 2007 on Channel 4. The concept focusses on the Sugababes represented as the four seasons of the year, in which they are semi-nude. It opens with a scene of Buchanan, who depicts the season of spring. She is featured with blue decoration in her hair and pink flowers <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> It then cuts to Berrabah, who is shown with long eyelashes and large red and yellow blooms in her hair, to represent summer.|$|E
500|$|Barbara {{is shown}} {{wearing a red}} dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, {{indicating}} her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{the bridge of her}} nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been [...] "comely and of erect bearing". However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the [...] imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Madonna and her dancers {{go from the}} hallway to a bar where the singer forcefully makes Kortajarena drink a beverage, dry humps a dancer and {{continues}} dancing. The guest appearances start with Cyrus pointing her middle finger towards the camera wearing glitter <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> followed by Wang, Diplo and Rocco in the bar, Beyoncé posing like Madonna's music video for [...] "Vogue" [...] (1990), Perry moving around to the song, and David dancing while Madonna and the others cheer him; all of them mouth the song name while they appear onscreen. As the chorus ends, a dancer brings a video screen behind them where Minaj appears rapping her part, interspersed by shots of West cheering. Madonna and her dancers continue moving through the room with falling confetti and reach a dance pole. She climbs {{through a set of}} dimly lit stairs and reaches the rooftop where the party is taking place. The song nears to an end and Madonna is shown surrounded by her dancers and some partygoers while she lies down; interspersed scenes show her twerking and dancing alone in a room wearing a cap with Hebrew word [...] "" [...] ("Shalom") written on it. The video ends with a far away shot of the Standard Hotel's brightly lit rooftop where the party continues.|$|E
50|$|Gyngell had {{operations}} in 2011 to remove skin cancer {{from the area}} <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and has previously had moles removed from her arms.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} her--a little helplessly. After all, {{though she was}} tall for her years, {{she was only a}} child. Her dress was of an awkward length, her long {{straight}} fringe and plaited hair the coiffure of the schoolroom. The most surprising thing of all in connection with her was that she showed no signs of the tragedy which had so recently been played out <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> had lost their nameless fear; there was even colour in her cheeks.|$|R
60|$|She clasped <b>her</b> hands tighter <b>around</b> his arm. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> sought his anxiously.|$|R
2500|$|Biographer Barbara Leaming {{wrote that}} Hayworth aged prematurely {{because of her}} {{addiction}} to alcohol and {{also because of the}} many stresses in her life. [...] "Despite the artfully applied make-up and shoulder-length red hair, there was no concealing the ravages of drink and stress," [...] she wrote of Hayworth's arrival in New York in May 1956 in order to begin work on [...] Fire Down Below, her first film in three years. [...] "Deep lines had crept <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouth, and she appeared worn, exhausted—older than her thirty-eight years." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{edition of}} May 1, 2008 of Impact!, Anderson {{appeared}} as her signature Cheerleader Melissa gimmick and defeated Daizee Haze in a singles match that {{was billed as}} a [...] "try-out" [...] for both women. However, she reappeared as Saeed later that night. At May 26, 2009 Impact! taping, Anderson wrestled as [...] "Future Legend" [...] Melissa Anderson in a dark match where she was defeated by Awesome Kong. Her television return occurred on the edition of July 16, 2009 of Impact! as she wrestled under the revised name of [...] "Future Legend" [...] Alissa Flash, losing to the debuting Sarita and attacking her afterward. Flash's losing streak continued {{in the first round}} of the Knockouts Tag Team Championship tournament where she and Daffney lost to Sarita and Taylor Wilde. As Flash, Anderson had a new outfit which included a streaks of make up <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in tribute to Sherri Martel.|$|E
60|$|Victoria {{turned to}} him seriously--and yet the creases were still <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Rachel Kynaston {{was still}} {{standing}} up looking <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> Suddenly <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> fell upon a quaintly built cottage, perched upon {{the edge of the}} cliff about a mile away.|$|R
60|$|The {{swing door}} {{leading from the}} room into the café was pushed open, and a woman entered. She {{stood for a moment}} looking <b>around</b> until <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> fell upon Jocelyn Thew. Crawshay {{suddenly}} gripped the detective's arm.|$|R
6000|$|The {{little girl}} brightened at this suggestion. [...] "I don't see the Ork anywhere," [...] she remarked, looking <b>around.</b> Then <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> lighted upon {{something}} and she exclaimed: [...] "Oh, Cap'n Bill! Isn't that a house, {{over there to}} the left?" ...|$|R
60|$|Absorbed in the {{presentation}} of his subject (which chanced to be himself), Mr. Crewe did not observe that her lips were parted, {{and that there were}} little creases <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Parker {{started up}} and stared <b>around,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> still misty with slumber. [...] "I slept {{the whole night}} through," [...] she finally remarked, as if in answer to a question, and her voice {{expressed}} profound astonishment.|$|E
60|$|It was a proud moment. Euphemia glanced <b>around,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> full {{of happy}} tears, {{and then she}} took my arm and we went down stairs--at least we tried {{to go down in}} that fashion, but soon found it {{necessary}} to go one at a time. We wandered over the whole extent of our mansion and found that our carpenter had done his work better than the woman whom we had engaged to scrub and clean the house. Something akin to despair must have seized upon her, for Euphemia declared that the floors looked dirtier than on the occasion of her first visit, when we rented the boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tiens! Papa Déroulède!" [...] she says, {{pointing}} an attenuated {{little finger}} across at him, and turning eagerly to those <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> dilating in wishful recollection {{of a happy}} afternoon spent in Papa Déroulède's house, with fine white bread to eat in plenty, and great jars of foaming milk.|$|R
60|$|He {{told her}} what more he had to say, but it was with his arms <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and his <b>eyes</b> close to hers.|$|R
60|$|Looking {{from one}} to the other of the objects <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> Anne's <b>eyes</b> rested on the {{partition}} wall which divided the room from the room next to it. The wall was not broken by a door of communication, it had nothing placed against it but a wash-hand-stand and two chairs.|$|R
60|$|She was one {{of those}} {{handsome}} women who will always be handsome, because the beauty is not in an air or a tint, but in the very structure of the head and features. But though she was not yet middle-aged and her auburn hair was of a Titianesque fullness in form and colour, there was a look in her mouth and <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> which suggested that some sorrows wasted her, as winds waste at last the edges of a Greek temple. For indeed the little domestic difficulty of which she was now speaking so decisively was rather comic than tragic. Father Brown gathered, from the course of the conversation, that Cray, the other gourmet, had to leave before the usual lunch-time; but that Putnam, his host, not to be done out of a final feast with an old crony, had arranged for a special dejeuner to be set out and consumed {{in the course of the}} morning, while Audrey and other graver persons were at morning service. She was going there under the escort of a relative and old friend of hers, Dr Oliver Oman, who, though a scientific man of a somewhat bitter type, was enthusiastic for music, and would go even to church to get it. There was nothing in all this that could conceivably concern the tragedy in Miss Watson's face; and by a half conscious instinct, Father Brown turned again to the seeming lunatic grubbing about in the grass.|$|E
50|$|Mariska Veres, {{lead singer}} for the Dutch rock group Shocking Blue, wore kohl <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Freda: Conker's talking duck, friend, {{companion}} and dot-catching helper. The feathers <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{look like a}} mask.|$|E
5000|$|... 1997 - {{a coyote}} {{attacked}} a two-year-old boy in Tucson, Arizona's Wildlife Ridge Park, {{but did not}} damage his skin. The next day in that same park, a four-year-old boy was bitten and scratched and a twenty-two-month-old toddler was bitten <b>around</b> <b>her</b> right <b>eye</b> and required seven stitches for serious puncture injuries.|$|R
50|$|As {{noted by}} John Timmerman, Steinbeck {{demonstrates}} the devil allegory through repeated snake-like imagery {{used to describe}} Cathy. In one instance in the novel, Samuel Hamilton observes that “when Cathy swallowed, <b>her</b> tongue flicked <b>around</b> <b>her</b> lips…the <b>eyes</b> were flat and the mouth with its small up-curve at the corners was carven”, giving a serpentine air to Cathy’s demeanor.|$|R
50|$|Agunpakhi is set {{in rural}} Rarh, now in West Bengal, of early twentieth century. It chronicles a rural family's ups and downs. The story is told by a country {{housewife}} in first person narrative. The story begins a score years before the Partition of India. She makes a powerful observation of herself and people <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> Through <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> we see {{the way of life}} of the then Rarh region.|$|R
50|$|It {{is small}} and light green all over with a red {{forehead}} and facial markings. The male has blue around his eyes while the female has golden yellow <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the strange}} tattoos <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> a girl lives alone in the Sultan's gardens until the young prince dares to speak to her. When he visits, she tells him the stories that are inked on her skin.|$|E
50|$|Holly McKenzie was a British {{girl who}} had {{tremendous}} power, but only when she was asleep. To avoid waking, she took sleeping pills and wore headphones that played Barry Manilow. She had the outlines of two faces painted <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
50|$|At first, Misogi {{was only}} known as Satori's {{right-hand}} woman, {{but it is}} then revealed later to be her twin sister. Misogi's appearance is almost identical to Satori's, except {{that she has a}} short, darker green hair, with a scar <b>around</b> <b>her</b> right <b>eye.</b> Unlike <b>her</b> sister, Misogi is a shy person. It was also revealed that Satori has stolen her name and identity, causing her family and everyone to believe that she is Misogi, instead of Satori.|$|R
50|$|Death: Death {{appears as}} a level-headed young Goth woman. She wears a silver ankh (representing the afterlife), which serves as her sigil. She has a marking similar to an <b>Eye</b> of Horus <b>around</b> <b>her</b> right <b>eye.</b> She prefers to dress and act casually, and is on better terms with Dream {{than any of the}} other Endless. Her speech is {{presented}} in regular letters in a regular balloon. She spends one day out of every century as a mortal, living and dying on Earth.|$|R
60|$|It was HER voice. He wheeled his horse. She was {{standing}} behind the grille in the old wall as {{he had seen her}} standing on the day he had ridden to his rendezvous with Susy. A Spanish manta was thrown over her head and shoulders, as if she had dressed hastily, and had run out to intercept him while he was still in the stable. Her beautiful face was pale in its black-hooded recess, and there were faint circles <b>around</b> <b>her</b> lovely <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Emma also {{appeared}} in the music video for Deadmau5's 2008/2009 hit single [...] "I Remember". She appears in a club with red makeup <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The single reached No. 14 in the UK Singles Chart on 17 May 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Stars are Boomkat's trademark, as [...] "stars" [...] are {{mentioned}} in the album title and also seen on the cover. When Manning is performing with her band, she wears stars <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to separate [...] "the actress Taryn from the singer Taryn." ...|$|E
50|$|Due to her {{preoccupation with}} reading, Sanmao's grades {{suffered}} in middle school, particularly in mathematics. After a distressing incident when a teacher drew black circles <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and humiliated {{her in front}} of her classmates, Sanmao stopped attending school. Her father taught her English and classical literature at home and hired tutors to teach her piano and painting.|$|E
50|$|Physically, Death is also {{opposite}} {{to the traditional}} western culture personification of death (see Grim Reaper). In The Sandman, Death instead appears as an attractive, pale young goth woman dressed in casual clothes — often a black top and jeans. She also wears a silver ankh on a chain <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, and has a marking similar to the <b>eye</b> of Horus <b>around</b> <b>her</b> right <b>eye.</b> She is pleasant, down-to-earth, perky, {{and has been a}} nurturing figure for both incarnations of Dream. This irony has helped make Death {{one of the most popular}} characters from Sandman. Death was named the fifteenth greatest comic book character by Empire Magazine.|$|R
50|$|The arrest {{report states}} Sorenson's wife, Jeannie Shawntell “Shawnee” Sorenson, {{was crying and}} left the house through a bedroom window after an {{argument}} and was observed walking down the road near Milo when someone called 911. Deputies reported Shawnee had redness <b>around</b> <b>her</b> left <b>eye</b> and stated she had been struck by Mr. Sorenson who is right-handed. During the arrest, Sorenson was aggressive with officers, banging his head against a squad car cage according to court records. Sorenson was charged with one count of domestic abuse and two counts of interference with official acts.|$|R
50|$|Pharah, {{real name}} Fareeha Amari, is an Egyptian {{security}} officer. She wears the Raptora Mark VI, a jetpack-equipped combat suit, and wields a Rocket Launcher as her primary weapon. She has a Wedjat (Eye of Horus) tattoo <b>around</b> <b>her</b> right <b>eye.</b> <b>Her</b> abilities are Concussion Blast, a rocket with powerful knockback but no damage, and Jump Jets, a quick jetpack-assisted vertical ascension comparable to a rocket jump. Her passive ability {{allows her to}} hover in the air, which is paired well with her Jump Jets ability. Pharah's ultimate ability is Rocket Barrage, a continuous stream of small air-to-ground projectiles, while she is frozen still in place.|$|R
