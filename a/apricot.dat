40|$|Dried <b>apricots</b> {{are one of}} Tajikistan’s major export products. The country {{wants to}} expand its {{production}} in the southern region. However, the producers don’t have the expertise needed to produce dried <b>apricots</b> that meet the quality requirements of the European Union and other potential export markets. Local producers in southern Tajikistan would benefit from improvements in methods of applying sulfur and drying the <b>apricots.</b> This {{would allow them to}} gain a share of global markets. Methods that were studied include sulfur treatment prior to drying and approaches for rapidly drying the <b>apricots</b> while preventing contamination. Because the project has just started, efforts are focused on developing the methods to determine the quality of <b>apricots.</b> Preliminary tests were conducted on dried <b>apricots</b> purchased from local stores or on fresh <b>apricots</b> dried by project personnel. These will serve as standards against which Tajikistan dried <b>apricots</b> will be compared. Quality factors evaluated included color, microbial content, sulfur content, water activity, percent soluble solids, and moisture content. This paper reports results of preliminary quality tests conducted on dried <b>apricots</b> purchased from stores in West Lafayette and Lafayette, Indiana. To prepare for future studies, thin layer drying tests were conducted on fresh <b>apricots</b> purchased from local stores and <b>apricots</b> grown in Michigan which were obtained from a contact in the Lafayette Farmer’s Market. These <b>apricots</b> were treated and dried in a thin layer dryer at three different temperatures to better understand factors that affect drying rate. Quality parameters of these dried <b>apricots</b> were also determined...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>apricots</b> today is very poor {{due to the}} {{distribution}} system. The longer the distribution time, the worse is the quality. This is because <b>apricots</b> are harvested too early and kept at low temperature. In this paper, after giving an overview on current research into the post-harvest quality of <b>apricots,</b> we will report {{on the influence of}} 1 -MCP in the control of ripening of <b>apricots</b> of var. ‘S.

40|$|Abstract: The present {{experimental}} {{work is to}} study drier {{in the form of}} solar air heater that dries <b>Apricots</b> (Prunus armeniaca). A small dish type solar air heater, connected to a drying chamber was developed in May, 2012 to evaluate its performance for drying <b>apricots.</b> The efficiency of this solar air heater was evaluated in May, 2012 at three air flow rates. Results showed that flow rates significantly (P< 0. 000) affected the 1 efficiency of the solar air heater. Efficiency improved from 20 % at the natural flow rate of 0. 01 kg. sec to 42. 6 % 1 at a high convective flow rate of 0. 21 kg. sec. Furthermore <b>apricots</b> were dehydrated at a temperature of 50 °C and less than 15 % relative humidity. <b>Apricots</b> were dried to a moisture content of less than 8 %. It was experiential that <b>apricots</b> took 13 hours of lost moisture from 85 % to 8 %. It was concluded that solar air heaters must be operated at high flow rates to get maximum efficiency to get valuable drying of <b>apricots...</b>|$|R
5|$|Families {{living in}} the area harvest the grapes {{in the spring and}} summer to produce a variety of {{products}} ranging from raisins, jams and a molasses known as dibs.

5|$|The main {{agricultural}} {{staple foods}} during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including glutinous rice), wheat, beans, and barley. Other food items included sorghum, taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), peach, <b>apricot,</b> and myrica. Chicken, duck, goose, beef, pork, rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, crane, and {{various types of}} fish were commonly consumed meats.|$|E
5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, <b>apricot</b> fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apricots</b> have a {{chilling}} requirement of 300 to 900 chilling units. They are hardy in USDA zones 5 through 8. Some {{of the more}} popular US cultivars of <b>apricots</b> include 'Blenheim', 'Wenatchee Moorpark', 'Tilton', and 'Perfection'.|$|R

5|$|In {{nineteenth century}} England, the breed flourished under the {{patronage}} of Queen Victoria. Her many Pugs, which she bred herself, included Olga, Pedro, Minka, Fatima and Venus. Her involvement with dogs in general helped {{to establish the}} Kennel Club, which was formed in 1873. Queen Victoria favoured <b>apricot</b> and fawn colours. Queen Victoria's passion for Pugs was passed on to many {{other members of the}} Royal family, including her grandson King George V and his son King Edward VIII. Many responded to the breed's image of anti-functionalism and diminutive size during this period.|$|E

Upon their release, the perfume and the commercial were positively received by critics with Rise's various scents and its feminist inspiration being particularly hailed. Rise features top notes of Italian bergamot orange, golden <b>apricot</b> and a basil sorbet middle notes of gold symphony orchid freesia blossom and jasminum sambac and base notes of autumn woods accord, cashmere musk and a vetiver extract.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to many desserts, ranging from those made {{regularly}} and those that are commonly reserved for the holidays. Most Palestinian sweets are pastries filled with either sweetened cheeses, dates or various nuts such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios. Beverages could also depend on holidays such as during Ramadan, where carob, tamarind and <b>apricot</b> juices are consumed at sunset. Coffee is consumed throughout the day and liquor is not very prevalent among the population, however, some alcoholic beverages such as arak or beer are consumed by Christians and less conservative Muslims.|$|E
50|$|In a 100-gram amount, raw <b>apricots</b> supply 48 Calories and are {{composed}} of 11% carbohydrates, 1% protein, less than 1% fat and 86% water (table). Raw <b>apricots</b> are a moderate source of vitamin A and vitamin C (12% of the Daily Value each).|$|R
50|$|Apriums {{resemble}} <b>apricots</b> on the outside. The {{flesh is}} usually dense and notable for its sweet taste {{due to a}} high content of fructose and other sugars. Apriums are usually only available early in the fruit season, like <b>apricots</b> and unlike pluots, which include some very late-ripening varieties. Aprium trees grow quickly and are smaller compared to other common home-grown <b>apricots.</b> The fruit is gold, with red coloration. Semi-mature fruit is hard and does not ripen if picked before completely mature.|$|R
50|$|Dried <b>apricots</b> are {{a type of}} {{traditional}} dried fruit. When treated with sulfur dioxide (E220), the color is vivid orange. Organic fruit not treated with sulfur dioxide is darker in color and has a coarser texture. The world's largest producer of dried <b>apricots</b> is Turkey.|$|R
5|$|The colour of the L.volemus {{mushroom}} {{varies from}} <b>apricot</b> to tawny, and the cap may {{be up to}} 11cm (in) wide. The pale golden yellow gills {{on the underside of}} the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the large amount of latex ("milk") that it exudes when the gills are damaged, leading to the common names weeping milk cap and voluminous-latex milky. It also has a distinctive fishy smell, which does not affect the taste. The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several sterols related to ergosterol, some of which are unique to this species. The mushroom also contains a natural rubber that has been chemically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Lactifluus volemus represents several species or subspecies, rather than a single taxon.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, <b>apricot,</b> red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925 {{tensions}} between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli's Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini {{to set up a}} financial support network for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt's initial momentum began to recede in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, inside and outside of Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family's extensive <b>apricot</b> orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from the realities of the revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection.|$|E

5|$|Plant spirals {{can be seen}} in phyllotaxis, the {{arrangement}} of leaves on a stem, and in {{the arrangement}} (parastichy) of other parts as in composite flower heads and seed heads like the sunflower or fruit structures like the pineapple and snake fruit, {{as well as in the}} pattern of scales in pine cones, where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together. Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from Fibonacci ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In hazel the ratio is 1/3; in <b>apricot</b> it is 2/5; in pear it is 3/8; in almond it is 5/13. In disc phyllotaxis as in the sunflower and daisy, the florets are arranged in Fermat's spiral with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the golden angle, 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.|$|E
