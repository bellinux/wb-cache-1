They {{include the}} goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark.

5|$|The Chytridiomycota <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> chytrids. These fungi are {{distributed}} worldwide. Chytrids and their close relatives Neocallimastigomycota and Blastocladiomycota (below) {{are the only}} fungi with active motility, producing zoospores {{that are capable of}} active movement through aqueous phases with a single flagellum, leading early taxonomists to classify them as protists. Molecular phylogenies, inferred from rRNA sequences in ribosomes, suggest that the Chytrids are a basal group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major clades with suggestive evidence for paraphyly or possibly polyphyly.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island is a {{distinct}} terrestrial ecoregion known as the Lord Howe Island subtropical forests. It {{is part of the}} Australasia ecozone and shares many biotic affinities with Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. Almost half of the island's native plants are endemic and many of the island's unique plants grow on or around the mountain summits where the height has allowed the development of a true cloud forest and many different microhabitats from sealevel to the summits. One of the best known is Howea, an endemic genus of palms (Arecaceae) that <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> kentia palms and make handsome houseplants. Annual exports provide a revenue of over A$2million, providing the only major industry on the island apart from tourism.|$|E

In the British Isles, it <b>is</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> western stork's-bill.|$|R
50|$|Benzenediols or dihydroxybenzenes are organic {{chemical}} compounds {{in which two}} hydroxyl groups are substituted onto a benzene ring. These aromatic compounds are classed as phenols. There are three isomers of benzenediol: 1,2-benzenediol (the ortho isomer) <b>is</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> catechol, 1,3-benzenediol (the meta isomer) <b>is</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> resorcinol, and 1,4-benzenediol (the para isomer) <b>is</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> hydroquinone.|$|R

5|$|Hampden is an all-seated bowl stadium, {{although}} {{the ground is}} split into four geographic sections, officially known as the North, East, South and West Stands. Due to {{the dominance of the}} Old Firm within Scottish football and their regular qualification for cup matches played at Hampden, the East and West stands <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Celtic and Rangers ends. The East Stand has 12,800 seats on a single tier of 53 rows. The two end stands are up to 140metres away from the pitch, due to Hampden retaining its bowl shape after it was redeveloped. This distance is almost as great as if Hampden included an athletics track, {{although the}} distance between the pitch and the two side stands is more comparable to a normal football stadium.|$|E
5|$|Although the 'kātĕpo' was {{reported}} to the Linnean Society as early as 1855, the spider was formally described as Latrodectus katipo by L. Powell in 1870. Spiders of the genus Latrodectus have a worldwide distribution and include all of the commonly known widow spiders: the North American black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans), the brown widow (Latrodectus geometricus), and the European black widow (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus). The katipo's closest relative is the Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) Latrodectus katipo and L. atritus (black katipo) were previously thought to be two separate species, but {{research has shown that}} they are a single species, L. katipo, with colour variation that is clinal over latitude and correlated with mean annual temperature. The katipo is so closely related to the redback that it was at one stage thought to be a subspecies, with the proposed name Latrodectus hasseltii katipo. Further research has shown that the katipo is distinct from the redback, having slight structural differences and striking differences in habitat preference, and it remains its own species. The katipo's family Theridiidae has a large number of species both in New Zealand and worldwide and <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders or comb-footed spiders.|$|E

25|$|The Causinae are a {{monotypic}} subfamily of venomous vipers {{found only}} in sub-Saharan Africa. It was created for the genus Causus, a group considered {{to be among the}} most primitive members of the family Viperidae based on head scalation, oviparity, venom apparatus, and because they have round pupils. However, this is contradicted by recent molecular studies. Six species are currently recognized. They <b>are</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> night adders.|$|E
25|$|Compartmentalisation of {{the shore}} occurs {{where there are}} major {{obstacles}} or objects, especially headlands on deeply embayed coasts.

Littoral cells {{can be defined as}} sediment within a coast that is circulated e.g. rip currents. Littoral cells usually develop on coast which are not impeded by headlands and where longshore currents are allowed to develop.|$|E
