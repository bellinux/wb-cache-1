50|$|Constructed by Ferus Smit in Leer, Germany {{with the}} yard number 392, {{the ship was}} {{completed}} in March 2010. Flevoborg is registered in the Netherlands with its home port at Delfzijl and operated by Wagenborg. On 21 June 2017, Flevoborg lost power while transiting the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The vessel was taking a load of corn from Montreal and was off Sainte-Croix, Quebec when it ran <b>aground.</b> The <b>vessel</b> was re-floated by changing the levels {{of water in the}} ballast and the rising tide. The engine did not restart and tugboats arrived to tow Flevoborg to Quebec City, arriving on 22 June to undergo inspection and repairs. While <b>aground,</b> the <b>vessel</b> had been out of the main channel and no oil leaked.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> in {{the surf}} at Shipwreck Beach {{on the north shore}} of Lanai, Hawaii is ex-YOGN 42, [...] a {{concrete}} gasoline barge built for the US Navy in 1942 and placed in service in 1943. The wreck is often misidentified as a Liberty ship.|$|R
50|$|Shipwreck Beach on {{the north}} shore of the island is so named because of the remains of a wrecked <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> a short {{distance}} offshore. This is popularly referred to as a WW II Liberty Ship, although it is YOGN 42, one of concrete barges built during the war.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the spill, Exxon Valdez was {{employed}} to transport crude oil from the Alyeska consortium's pipeline terminal in Valdez, Alaska, to the lower 48 states of the United States. At the time it ran <b>aground,</b> the <b>vessel</b> was carrying about 201,000 m³ (53.1 million gallons) of oil. After the spill, the vessel was towed to San Diego, arriving on June 10, 1989, and repairs were started on June 30, 1989. Approximately 1,600 tons of steel were removed and replaced that July, totaling US$30 million of repairs to the tanker. Its single-hull design remained unaltered.|$|R
50|$|On May 24, 1695, {{returning}} from Boston with more prizes, Baptiste ran into an English war ship. Baptiste ran his <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> and fought. Cannon fire raged throughout the day, the English ship was crippling Bonne. Having lost the ship Bonne, Baptiste went ashore {{and walked to}} Villebon at Fort Nashwaak on the Saint John River.|$|R
5000|$|Hebrides {{collided}} with pontoons {{and then ran}} aground at Lochmaddy on 25 September 2016, after apparently suffering engine difficulties. It was reported that the vessel became stuck in forward gear and remained in gear after running <b>aground.</b> The <b>vessel</b> later managed to dock and disembark the passengers and vehicles aboard. Calmac reported that the hull was intact and that divers were en route to inspect the damage. Following inspection, Hebrides was moved to Greenock for drydocking and repairs. Meanwhile Clansman was transferred to Uig {{to take over the}} route, with Isle of Lewis providing an additional sailing from Lochmaddy to Uig to clear the backlog of traffic. [...] Hebrides returned to service on 17 October 2016.|$|R
5000|$|As the Union boats {{approached}} Point Isabel, the Southerners [...] "...set fire {{to a large}} schooner." [...] They {{brought out}} the 100-ton schooner Star and a fishing scow. At Point Isabel, they captured the 100-ton, British sloop Victoria of Jamaica but ran that <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> while attempting {{to get out to}} sea and so burned her. After the landing parties had returned to the ship, Brooklyn returned to Galveston.|$|R
50|$|A meek clerk {{from her}} dad's office, Pete Graham, is persuaded by Jerry {{to steer the}} family's boat. He accidentally runs the <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> and ends up falsely {{suspected}} of knocking J.C. unconscious and kidnapping the Darlingtons for ransom. Jerry amuses herself at first by not supporting Pete's story, but when real crooks get involved, Pete is able {{to clear his name}} and persuade Virginia he's sincere about his attraction to her.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} morning, the British {{learned of}} the Americans' escape and set out after the fleeing Continental vessels. On October 13, the British fleet caught up to the struggling American ships near Split Rock Mountain. [...] With no hope of fighting off the powerful British navy, Arnold ordered his men to run their five <b>vessels</b> <b>aground</b> in Ferris Bay, Panton, Vermont. The depleted Continental army escaped on land back to Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence; however, they no longer controlled the Lake Champlain waterway.|$|R
2500|$|In May 1804, Galgo and [...] cooperated in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to cutout the pram Ville d'Anvers from Ostend. then on 23 June, Galgo and Inspector observed 26 schuyts coming from Ostend and going towards Flushing. They proceeded {{to keep up}} a running fire on these vessels for about two hours, while enduring fire from shore batteries. Eventually, the two British vessels hauled off, fearful of running aground on the Stroom sand, having succeeded in driving only one Dutch <b>vessel</b> <b>aground,</b> but having sustained no casualties themselves.|$|R
50|$|Her first wartime {{service was}} in May 1740 when she {{anchored}} {{in the mouth of}} the St Johns River to protect the disembarkation of British troops assigned to the Siege of St. Augustine. In 1742 she came under the command of Captain Joseph Hamar, with orders to patrol between Georgia and the Bahamas. In June she briefly engaged Spanish vessels near St. Augustine, Florida, driving several enemy <b>vessels</b> <b>aground</b> before being forced to retreat towards St. Simons Island. The engagement cost Flamborough seventeen of her crew.|$|R
50|$|The {{officers}} {{along with}} Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) {{come upon a}} Chinese immigrant smuggling ring after running an ocean-going <b>vessel</b> <b>aground.</b> The captain of the boat escapes. In the subsequent investigation, Murtaugh finds Hong (Eddy Ko) and his family hiding from US Immigration officers to avoid deportation. Murtaugh offers them shelter in his home, and their families, along with Riggs and Cole, quickly bond. Hong reveals {{he is looking for}} his uncle, a skilled engraver, who had paid for their passage to the United States.|$|R

60|$|At Topsail Inlet {{he ran his}} own <b>vessel</b> <b>aground,</b> {{as though}} by accident. Hands, the captain {{of one of the}} consorts, pretending to come to his assistance, also {{grounded}} his sloop. Nothing now remained but for those who were able to get away in the other craft, which was all that was now left of the little fleet. This did Blackbeard with some forty of his favorites. The rest of the pirates were left on the sand spit to await the return of their companions--which never happened.|$|R
25|$|Most {{of his men}} had {{believed}} that Lafitte had a valid privateering commission, although there was confusion on which country had issued it. Two weeks after setting sail, they captured a Spanish ship, which they sent to Galveston, hoping the Longs would smuggle the goods to New Orleans. Lafitte's men buried some of the cargo {{on the island and}} ran the captured <b>vessel</b> <b>aground,</b> but an American patrol spotted the ship and after investigating, discovered the buried cargo. Several of Lafitte's men were arrested and convicted of piracy.|$|R
50|$|On 5 September 2001, {{the ship}} {{suffered}} {{a fire in}} its engine room and suffered a loss of power about 40 km from Cape Town, South Africa. This normally {{would not have been}} a severe problem; however, the ship was in a major storm at the time and began drifting toward land. The ship drifted for 3 hours until it was in shallow enough water to drop anchor, but the 10 metre high seas and 50 knot winds overpowered the anchors and drove the <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> near the Slangkop lighthouse.|$|R
5000|$|The L50-boats {{could carry}} both {{vehicles}} and personnel and was {{designed specifically for}} landing of coastal rangers under fire. During the crossing the personnel was protected behind the vessel's steel hull and a massive ramp at the bow. The vessel was built with a flat bottom so it could run well into shallow beaches without run <b>aground.</b> When the <b>vessel</b> had run as close to land as possible, the ramp went rapidly down and the personnel stormed ashore, if necessary by use of [...] "Fire and Movement". The initially goal was normally to establish a beachhead {{in order to ensure}} the landing of the main force.|$|R
60|$|September 1st.--To-day {{we leave}} the Rock Ferry Hotel, where we have spent nearly four weeks. It is a {{comfortable}} place, {{and we have had}} a good table and have been kindly treated. We occupied a large parlor, extending through the whole breadth of the house, with a bow-window, looking towards Liverpool, and adown the intervening river, and to Birkenhead, on the hither side. The river would be a pleasanter object, if it were blue and transparent, instead of such a mud-puddly hue; also, if it were always full to its brine; whereas it generally presents a margin, and sometimes a very broad one, of glistening mud, with here and there a small <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> on it.|$|R
500|$|Whilst at Charles Town, Teach {{learned that}} Woodes Rogers had left England with several men-of-war, with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates. [...] Teach's {{flotilla}} sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. [...] There they intended to careen their ships to scrape their hulls, but Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her main-mast and severely damaging many of her timbers. [...] Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her. [...] A sloop commanded by Israel Hands of Adventure also ran <b>aground,</b> and both <b>vessels</b> appeared to be damaged beyond repair, leaving only Revenge and the captured Spanish sloop.|$|R
2500|$|On Friday, May 3, 1912, {{shortly before}} noon, Vosburg, under Captain Erickson, while towing Nehalem went ashore {{on the north}} spit {{at the mouth of}} the Nehalem River. [...] An initial news story {{reported}} that Vosburg “appears to be doomed to be smashed in two in a short time” and further that it appeared that “there is no hope of saving the lives of her captain or crew.” [...] Later reports showed the situation to be serious but not to the extent initially reported. [...] The tug had struck bottom at about 11:00a.m., and several huge combers broke over the <b>vessel,</b> <b>aground</b> on the south spit, soon thereafter, but after that the sea became calmer. [...] Vosburg cut loose the Nahelem, which drifted into calmer waters.|$|R
2500|$|While the Vizcaya {{was under}} fire, the Cristóbal Colón had drawn ahead. Within {{a little more}} than an hour, five of the six ships of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron had been {{destroyed}} or forced <b>aground.</b> Only one <b>vessel,</b> the speedy new armored cruiser Cristóbal Colón, still survived, steaming as fast as she could for the west and freedom. Though modern in every respect and possibly the fastest ship in either fleet, Cristóbal Colón had one serious problem: She had been only recently purchased from Italy, and her main [...] armament was not yet installed because of a contractual issue with the British firm of Armstrong. She therefore sailed with empty main turrets, albeit retaining her ten [...] secondary battery. This day, speed was her primary defense.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the night}} attack, Admiral Tōgō sent his subordinate, Vice Admiral Dewa Shigetō, with four cruisers on a {{reconnaissance}} mission at 08:00 {{to look into}} the Port Arthur anchorage and to assess the damage. By 09:00 Admiral Dewa was close enough to make out the Russian fleet through the morning mist. He observed 12 battleships and cruisers, three or four of which seemed to be badly listing or to be <b>aground.</b> The smaller <b>vessels</b> outside the harbor entrance were in apparent disarray. Dewa approached to about [...] of the harbor, but as no notice was taken of the Japanese ships, he was convinced that the night attack had successfully paralyzed the Russian fleet, and sped off to report to Admiral Tōgō.|$|R
60|$|The {{commander}} {{of one of}} the other ships was so much frightened by what had occurred in so short a space of time that he ran his <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> and wrecked her, her men jumping out into the water and making for the land. As for the other ship, the pirates boldly attacked her and captured her, and as she was a very fine vessel, Morgan left his own small vessel, in which he had been commanding his fleet, and took possession of her. Thus, in a very short time, the whole state of affairs was changed. The Spaniards had no ships at all, and Morgan was in command of a very fine vessel, in which he led his triumphant fleet.|$|R

50|$|On June 10, 1940, Birchall was {{responsible}} for the capture of an Italian merchant ship, the Capo Nola, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, hours after Canada declared war on Italy. Birchall had been tasked with locating any Italian vessels still in Canadian waters as the outbreak of war became imminent. On June 10, he found the Capo Nola. Birchall had been informed of the declaration of war by radio so made a low pass over the freighter, as if making an attack. This panicked the captain into running his <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> against a sandbank. Birchall then touched down nearby and waited until Royal Canadian Navy vessels reached the scene. The Capo Nola's crew were the first Italian prisoners taken by the Allies during the war.|$|R

50|$|The {{club has}} 1,300 members across all {{categories}} of membership. Visitors from over thirty countries have sampled {{the course to}} date, and the club has ambitious plans for its future development. The Academy Award winning film Ryan's Daughter starring Robert Mitchum and Sarah Miles had its beach scenes filmed beside the first few holes. A tower stands behind the third green overlooking the harbour and this {{dates back to the}} 1190s. A Spanish Armada ship is reputed to have run aground west of the 17th. The beach behind the 16th green and off the right of the 17th hole was where many ships ran <b>aground,</b> including one <b>vessel</b> from the Spanish Armada in 1588. The nearby Banna Strand is celebrated in song as the landing point of Sir Roger Casement in 1916.|$|R
50|$|On 14 February 1808, Raposa was {{cruising}} some {{fifty miles}} west of Cartagena, Colombia, when she sighted four vessels {{that turned out to}} be a schooner and three sloops. Raposa chased them to an island where they anchored and formed a line abreast. As Raposa sailed towards them she hit a sandbank. Seeing that she was <b>aground,</b> the enemy <b>vessels</b> came towards her in the late afternoon, and at dusk took up position in line abreast ahead of her. During the night Raposas crew endeavoured to lighten her, but were unable to free her. At five in the morning Violet surrendered, but not before he and the crew were able to set fire to her and take to her boats. The enemy ships then took all 55 men prisoner.|$|R

50|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Intertropical Convergence Zone organized into {{a tropical storm}} {{to the east of}} the Philippines on November 13. Freda moved west-northwestward, attaining typhoon status the next day. As it paralleled the northeast coast of Luzon, it rapidly intensified to a 135 mph (217 km/h) typhoon, and made landfall on the 16th with slightly weaker winds of 120, the weakening due to land interaction. Freda rapidly weakened as it crossed the island, and turned to the north. After passing close to Taiwan on the 18th, it accelerated to the north and became extratropical on the 20th. Freda brought torrential rains to the city of Manila, driving two <b>vessels</b> <b>aground.</b> Crop damage was heavy on {{the southern part of the}} island, while 7,600 were left homeless from the flooding. Freda caused 58 fatalities as it passed through the Philippines.|$|R
60|$|Our boatmen {{pushed out}} at 3 in the morning, {{and brought up}} at 5, in a narrow muddy creek {{on the island of}} Sidhee. The waters retired along {{channels}} scooped several fathoms deep in black mud, leaving our <b>vessel</b> <b>aground</b> six or seven feet below the top of the bank, and soon afterwards there was no water to be seen; {{as far as the eye}} could reach, all was a glistening oozy mud, except the bleak level surfaces of the islands, on which neither shrub nor tree grew. Soon after 2 p.m. a white line was seen on the low black horizon, which was the tide-wave, advancing at the rate of five miles an hour, with a hollow roar; it bore back the mud that was gradually slipping along the gentle slope, and we were afloat an hour after: at night we grounded again, opposite the mouth of the Fenny.|$|R
25|$|These vessels {{would carry}} cargoes {{to and from}} neutral ports often located in Nassau and Cuba, where neutral {{merchant}} ships in turn carried these cargoes, usually coming from or destined to England or other points abroad. Inbound ships usually brought badly needed supplies and mail to the Confederacy while outbound ships often exported cotton, tobacco and other goods for trade and revenue while also carrying important mail and correspondence to suppliers and other interested parties in Europe, most often in England. Most of the guns and other ordnance of the Confederacy were imported from England via blockade runners. Some blockade runners made many successful runs while many others were either captured or destroyed. There were an estimated 2,500–2,800 attempts to run the blockade with at least an 80% success rate. However, {{by the end of}} the Civil War the Union Navy had captured more than 1,100 blockade runners and had destroyed or run <b>aground</b> another 355 <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
