5|$|As a result, Bach Xuan Nguyen, {{who led the}} investigation, {{ordered the}} posthumous humiliation of Duyệt. This {{resulted}} in the desecration of his tomb, the execution of sixteen relatives, and the <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> his colleagues. Minh Mạng's attitude led Duyet's adopted son Khoi {{to break out of}} prison and start a revolt against the emperor on 10 May 1833.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1967 Bukovsky, Vadim Delaunay, Yevgeny Kushev and Victor Khaustov held another {{demonstration}} on Pushkin Square. They were protesting {{against the}} recent <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> Alexander Ginzburg, Yuri Galanskov, Alexei Dobrovolsky and Vera Lashkova (finally prosecuted in January 1968 in the Trial of the Four) and asserting {{their own right}} to protest: on 16 September 1966 a new law, Article 190.3, had been introduced which classified any public gatherings or demonstrations as a crime.|$|E
5|$|After the Anschluss, the Austrian SS was {{folded into}} SS-Oberabschnitt Donau. The third {{regiment}} of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (Der Führer) {{and the fourth}} Totenkopf regiment (Ostmark) were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter. On Heydrich's orders, mass <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> potential enemies of the Reich began immediately after the Anschluss. Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the Anschluss. Before {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union, Mauthausen was the harshest of the camps in the Greater German Reich.|$|E

The <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> Marco Antonio Cortez Rodríguez (alias Escorpión 37) and of Josué González Rodríguez (alias Escorpión 43) allowed {{the authorities to}} understand the structure of Los Escorpiones. There are several music videos on YouTube that exalt the power of Los Escorpiones through narcocorridos, a Mexican drug ballad that tells stories of drug lords and their exploits.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{established}} a Palestinian police force, named the Preventive Security Service (PSS), that became active on 13 May. It was mainly composed of PLA soldiers and foreign Palestinian volunteers. Arafat assigned Mohammed Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub {{to head the}} PSS. Amnesty International accused Arafat and the PNA leadership for failing to adequately investigate abuses by the PSS (including torture and unlawful killings) of political opponents and dissidents {{as well as the}} <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> human rights activists.|$|E
5|$|Bezen Perrot enacted {{operations}} in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It {{took part in}} the <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> Jews, Service du travail obligatoire evaders and resistance fighters. Their knowledge of the Breton language proved to be a prized possession, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms drops and infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it to encode their communications. In March, their civilian clothing was replaced with the uniforms of Waffen-SS, lacking any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the most important}} questions concerning the temporary <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> seagoing ships through solutions given in the existing international conventions. Special attention {{is given to the}} changes contained in the International Convention on <b>Arrest</b> <b>of</b> Ships of 1999 that came into force on 14 September, 2011, compared to the previous Convention of 1952. The basic approach to the principle <b>of</b> temporary <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> ships remained unchanged according to the Convention of 1999 compared to the 1952 Convention. Still, temporary <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> ships can only be effected for maritime claims. Having in mind that the 1999 Convention increases the number of maritime claims in relation to the Convention of 1952, and in a way that certain maritime claims that were previously considered claims for purely business relationship, for which creditors {{had not been able to}} enjoy the protection relating to <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> the ship, are deemed to be maritime claims. Changes were also made to the right of re-arrest and multiple <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> the ship. Convention of 1999 does not greatly alter the existing international regulations as established by the previous Convention, but attempts to additionally specify certain solutions contained in both the Conventions, in terms of their improvement and modernization...|$|R

5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now in disarray. Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, {{who was convicted of}} membership of an illegal organisation, and Colm Murphy who was convicted of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in Toronto, Ontario: the Club Baths, the Romans II Health and Recreation Spa, the Richmond Street Health Emporium, and The Barracks. The Richmond Health Emporium was {{so badly}} damaged in the raid {{that it never}} reopened. Nicknamed Operation Soap, the raid {{resulted}} in the <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both {{the gay and lesbian}} community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, Aruban police {{detained}} Nick John and Abraham Jones, former {{security guards}} {{from the nearby}} Allegro Hotel (which was then closed for renovation) on suspicion of murder and kidnapping. Authorities have never officially disclosed the reason for their arrests, but according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe {{may have been a}} factor in the <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> John and Jones. Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and {{at least one of them}} had a prior incident with law enforcement. John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.|$|E

5|$|The DDoS {{attacks were}} at first {{carried out with}} the Gigaloader and JMeter {{application}}s. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP or UDP packets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead {{to a number of}} <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses. Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Ramírez Treviño's boss {{triggered}} a war within the Gulf Cartel, {{resulting in the}} deaths and <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> several high-ranking drug traffickers from 2011 to 2013. When the Gulf Cartel's top leaders Mario Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez were arrested in early September 2012, Ramírez Treviño decided to step up for the job and become the undisputed leader of the cartel. In efforts to keep the Gulf Cartel under a single command structure, he ordered the assassination of high-ranking drug trafficker El Metro 4 on 15 January 2013 in Reynosa. His death, however, sparked a turf war.|$|E
5|$|The police {{presence}} {{did not appear}} to help: between 2002 and 2006, <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> juveniles on Metro increased from 156 to 295, and warnings increased 40 percent. Nearly half the arrests occurred at just five stations: Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue—four of them on the Green Line. Metro created a special unit to focus on juvenile crime on Metro, and established liaisons at all D.C. public schools to feed intelligence and information about pending problems to Metro's police division.|$|E

5|$|The secret {{protocol}} {{contained in}} the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union had relegated Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence. During the course of late 1939 and early 1940, the Soviet Union issued a series of ultimatums to the Baltic governments that {{eventually led to the}} illegal annexation of the states. (At about the same time, the Soviet Union was exerting similar pressure on Finland.) About 30,000 Soviet troops entered the Baltic states during June 1940, followed by <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> their leaders and citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{contributed to}} {{the deterioration of the}} Polish–Lithuanian relations and further discouraged the Lithuanians from joining Piłsudski's proposed Międzymorze federation. The Sejny Uprising doomed the Polish plan to overthrow the Lithuanian government in a coup d'état. After the uprising, the Lithuanian police and intelligence intensified their investigation of Polish sympathizers and soon uncovered the planned coup. They made mass <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> Polish activists from August 27 to the end of September 1919. During the investigations, lists of PMO supporters were found; law enforcement completely suppressed the organisation in Lithuania, arresting members.|$|E
5|$|By May 2015, {{the games}} were under a {{particularly}} dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games, with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. <b>Arrests</b> <b>of</b> over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on May 29 and December 3. By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.|$|E

5|$|In June 1841, {{with the}} help of {{influential}} supporters (among them was Domingo Róxas), Pule again {{sent a letter to the}} Real Audiencia requesting for the cofradía to be recognized. This letter was forwarded to the office of Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri. The Governor-General himself personally reviewed the petition and was disturbed by the cofradías rule which excluded Spaniards and mestizos from joining without Pule's permission. This made De Oraá believe that it was a seditious organization where religion was used as a blind for potential insurgence against Spanish authorities. De Oraá then recommended Pule's dismissal from San Juan de Dios Hospital and had the cofradía outlawed in July 1841, ordering its disbandment and the <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> its members. Pule immediately went into hiding to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May, {{a second}} {{operation}} {{was conducted by}} the same units, {{this time in the}} northern Armenian town of Voskepar. Under the same pretext as the previous operation, the joint forces entered Armenia with tanks and other armored vehicles, claiming that militia units were staging attacks from that area into Azerbaijan. The operation was conducted in a similar manner but with deadlier results. In addition to the arbitrary <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> twenty men in towns surrounding Voskepar, a bus carrying thirty Armenian policemen was attacked by elements of the 23rd Division, killing eleven of the officers and arresting the rest. The OMON units also took part in razing and looting the outlying villages around Voskepar. Residents were similarly forced to leave their homes and thus ceded them after signing a form which stated that they were leaving their homes at their own volition.|$|E
5|$|The crowd roared in {{approval}} and Arab audiences were electrified. The assassination attempt backfired, quickly playing into Nasser's hands. Upon returning to Cairo, he ordered {{one of the}} largest political crackdowns in the modern history of Egypt, with the <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> thousands of dissenters, mostly members of the Brotherhood, but also communists, and the dismissal of 140 officers loyal to Naguib. Eight Brotherhood leaders were sentenced to death, although the sentence of its chief ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was commuted to a 15-year imprisonment. Naguib was removed from the presidency and put under house arrest, but was never tried or sentenced, and no one in the army rose to defend him. With his rivals neutralized, Nasser became the undisputed leader of Egypt.|$|E

The <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> La Voisin was {{followed}} by the <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> her daughter Marguerite Monvoisin, Guibourg, Lesage, Bertrand, Romain and the rest of her network of associates. La Voisin was imprisoned at Vincennes, where she was subjected to questioning. On 27 December 1679, Louis XIV issued an order that the whole network should be exterminated by all methods regardless of the rank, gender or age.|$|R
