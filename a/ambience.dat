Longitudinal surveys have the potential to disclose some of the complex parameters that link the human apprehension of the city with comfort parameters. A strategically designed ‘promenade architecturale’ should constitute an essential basis to observe, measure, and analyse <b>ambiences</b> in a multisensorial manner to meaningfully speculate on the possible extent of new <b>ambiences.</b> The graphical synthesis of dynamic qualitative and quantitative in situ measurements enable conclusions that are connected to the reality of the tangible built environments...|$|R

The aim of our work, within AMBIOFLUX's interdisciplinary research project, is to evaluate, so as to characterize, the impact of sound <b>ambiences</b> (soundscape) onto an urban pedestrian pathway using and extending the spatial semantic we developed {{in the context of the}} GearScape project (a customization of the OrbisGIS project). In this paper, we will first present the spatial formalism and the soundmark and soundscape concepts we use. The remainder of this paper is dedicated to the evaluation's methodology of the pedestrian pathway's acoustic fingerprint using the spatial formalism already described. First results obtained will be presented...|$|R

5|$|According to Jerusalem {{architectural}} historian David Kroyanker, {{the heyday}} of the Downtown Triangle lasted from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Many stores and restaurants were opened by German Jewish immigrants who sought to recreate a European <b>ambience</b> in the city center. Their upscale boutiques, coffeehouses, delicatessens, and exclusive restaurants were frequented by senior Mandate officials and wealthy, English-speaking tourists. Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under one roof, the Europeans introduced boutiques that featured only one item, such as gloves or ties. Some shops offered unique extras, such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor, and a bookstore with a second-floor library.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station <b>ambience,</b> and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E

5|$|Survival horror is a subgenre {{of video}} games {{inspired}} by horror fiction {{that focuses on}} survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary <b>ambience.</b> Although combat {{can be part of}} the gameplay, the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition, health, speed and vision, or through various obstructions of the player's interaction with the game mechanics. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game. Games make use of strong horror themes, like dark maze-like environments and unexpected attacks from enemies.|$|E

5|$|Composer Tyler Bates began scoring Watchmen in November 2007. He {{planned to}} visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view {{assembly}} cuts of scenes to begin rough composing. Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as Manhunter, Blade Runner, and To Live and Die in L.A. for inspiration. Bates switched between a Yamaha CS-80 or an MOTM for moments that he felt should have more <b>ambience</b> or synthesizers. Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building {{to have a more}} traditional superhero feel, so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm. A 64-strong choir and the 87-piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were hired for the more orchestral themes.|$|E

5|$|The {{wide variety}} of musical performances, {{whether or not they}} are artificially amplified (6, 7, 9, 10), all provide {{entertainment}} irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists (6), choral (2) or orchestral groups (5, 8), or ensemble (3). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (5, 8). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the <b>ambience</b> and the chance to participate (7, 9). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately (10).|$|E

To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French toast and Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches); set meals combine any type of toast with soft-boiled eggs and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik.|$|E
