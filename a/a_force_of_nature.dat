5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the natural}} imagery used to {{describe}} Fortune, scholar Michael Lloyd characterises it as an element itself, which causes natural occasional upheaval. This implies that fortune is <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> that is greater than mankind, and cannot be manipulated. The 'game of chance' that Fortune puts into play {{can be related to}} that of politics, expressing the fact that the characters must play their luck in both fortune and politics to identify a victor. The play culminates, however, in Antony's realization that he is merely a card, not a player in this game.|$|E

50|$|The work {{is typical}} for Jünger's Aestheticism that {{responds}} to destruction with placidity. It displays {{the determination to}} conserve values {{even in the face}} of annihilation, perhaps all the more so because the victory of the mindless masses follows brutalization as <b>a</b> virtual <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|R
500|$|Fagerbakke {{has been}} {{compared}} to Patrick's character, which he concurs with. Kenny said that [...] "Bill [...] is a big guy. The world is almost too small for him. He's <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> like Patrick." [...] Writer Jay Lender said, describing Fagerbakke in the recording studio, [...] "Bill Fagerbakke is the most thoughtful performer I've ever seen in the booth—he was always asking questions and really {{trying to get into the}} mindset, such as it is, of Patrick." [...] Writer Kent Osborne said of Fagerbakke, [...] "He is this big guy, and he plays Patrick so well. He's just this big guy, and he lumbers around." [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "I'm clumsy. I'm goofy. I make mistakes all the time" [...] and agreed that [...] "I guess I'm a lot of Patrick." ...|$|E
500|$|The 808's sounds do not {{resemble}} real percussion, {{and have}} been described as [...] "clicky and hypnotic", [...] "robotic", [...] "toy-like", [...] "spacey" [...] and [...] "futuristic". Fact described them as a combination of [...] "synth tones and white noise... more akin to bursts coming from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop [...] a proper rhythm section." [...] The machine is noted for its powerful bass drum sound, built from a combination of a bridged T-network sine oscillator, a low-pass filter, and a voltage-controlled amplifier. The bass drum decay control allows the user to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over long periods, possibly not by design. The New Yorker wrote: [...] "Less a product of engineering than <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> this bass-rolling subsonic boom has come to be what people mean when they refer to 'an 808'." ...|$|E
500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the philosophy of The Satanic Bible. It details how Christianity has taught that God is good and Satan is evil, and presents an alternate view. It describes that the concept of Satan, used synonymously with [...] "God", is different for each LaVeyan Satanist, but that to all it represents a good and steadying force in his or her life. Believers have been called [...] "atheistic Satanists" [...] because of this lack of belief in external gods, but others identify as antitheistic. Satan is seen to LaVeyan Satanists not as [...] "an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a barbed tail, and horns", but as <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> that has only been described as evil by other religions. Satan is viewed as a metaphor or a symbol, not as a being to be worshipped.|$|E

500|$|Marvel later {{released}} an comic book adaptation of The Stand, {{which began in}} September 2008 and ran for thirty issues. Writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa described Flagg as [...] "The man of nightmares. Or, put another way, our nightmares given human (more or less) form. The {{dark side of the}} American Dream...King's 'Walkin' Dude' may not be the Devil, himself, as Mother Abagail says, but he comes pretty damn close..." [...] Initially, artist Mike Perkins said he felt [...] "Flagg needed to be designed less as a man—more as <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> His hair will obscure his features, his face will be almost always in heavy shadow. This is the creature lurking under your bed, in your wardrobe, in your nightmares. Slightly familiar but wholly terrifying". Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa later commented on the original idea of hiding Flagg's face: [...] "...the further into the book and the adaptation you go, the less feasible that becomes. Stephen spends so much time [...] describing 's features and smiles, you need to show those things".|$|E
500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, {{he was a member of}} our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E
500|$|Thelema draws its {{principal}} gods and goddesses from Ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity in the cosmology of Thelema is the goddess Nuit. She {{is the night}} sky arched over the Earth symbolized {{in the form of}} a naked woman. She is conceived as the Great Mother, the ultimate source of all things. [...] The second principal deity of Thelema is the god Hadit, conceived as the infinitely small point, complement and consort of Nuit. [...] Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time. He is also described in Liber AL vel Legis as [...] "the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star". [...] The third deity in the cosmology of Thelema is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of Horus. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a hawk who carries a wand. He is associated with the Sun and the active energies of Thelemic magick. [...] Other deities within the cosmology of Thelema are Hoor-paar-kraat (or Harpocrates), god of silence and inner strength, the brother of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Babalon, the goddess of all pleasure, known as the Virgin Whore, and Therion, the beast that Babalon rides, who represents the wild animal within man, <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E

500|$|Los Angeles Times theater critic Charles McNulty criticized Lauper's [...] "novice mistakes" [...] with a {{score that}} [...] "never {{establishes}} a compositional through line" [...] and saying that while [...] "Fierstein's heart is {{in the right place}} ... the show's earnestness sinks it", adding that [...] "if [...] weren't such a cheesy commercial mess, it might actually be fun". Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News wrote that while the [...] "script has issues like a pair of shoes" [...] that don't quite fit, [...] "Mitchell's production moves lickety-split" [...] and [...] "Porter ... is <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as Lola." [...] But, he added, Lauper's [...] "multicolored, surprising and fun" [...] score outshines the fancy footwear and proves to be the [...] "real star of this show". Writing for The Guardian, David Cote noted that the decision to use American actors for an adaptation that maintained the Northampton setting resulted in a disconcerting inconsistency in terms of accents. [...] The Wall Street Journal gave the show a negative review, calling it [...] "an imitation heart-warming British working-class musical with a gay angle and a maudlin ending. ... Kinky Boots is its own spoiler alert, the kind of musical in which you recite the dialogue a half-beat ahead of the actors. ... sounds like ... "Cyndi: The Deservedly Forgotten Late-'80s B-Sides." [...] A review in The Bergen Record said that the show [...] "sorely lacks is a dramatic commitment to what it's doing. Which is why a show that seems to make few false steps is so relentlessly tedious," [...] calling it [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "synthetic". Talkin' Broadway also gave the show a negative review. The Village Voice, AM New York, and NBC turned in lukewarm reviews.|$|E
2500|$|Some IF works {{dispense}} with second-person narrative entirely, opting for a first-person perspective ('I') or even placing the {{player in the}} position of an observer, rather than a direct participant. [...] In some 'experimental' IF, the concept of self-identification is eliminated entirely, and the player instead takes the role of an inanimate object, <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> or an abstract concept; experimental IF usually pushes the limits of the concept and challenges many assumptions about the medium.|$|E
2500|$|Many contemporaries felt he bore a {{striking}} resemblance to Ludwig van Beethoven. [...] Ignaz Moscheles, who had known Beethoven intimately, wrote, [...] "Rubinstein's features and short, irrepressible hair remind me of Beethoven." [...] Liszt referred to Rubinstein as [...] "Van II." [...] This resemblance was also felt to be in Rubinstein's keyboard playing. Under his hands, it was said, the piano erupted volcanically.

50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{influence}} of Confucianist Xun Zi, who was his and Li Si's teacher, Han Fei wrote a commentary on the Tao Te Ching, which he interpreted as a political text. For this reason, the Han Feizi is sometimes included {{as part of the}} syncretism Huang-Lao tradition, seeing the Tao as a natural law that everyone and everything was forced to follow. Parallel to this, he believed that an ideal ruler made laws, like <b>an</b> inevitable <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> that the people could not resist.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Results of {{experimental}} investigation of plasma vacuum bubbles in water using {{the degree of}} its heating are presented.

2500|$|Ondine is also {{a moving}} love story. [...] As Dorothy Knowles remarks, [...] "Ondine is <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> but also love incarnate, and Hans's tragedy {{is that he is}} as unequal to such a love as he is to the revelations of nature which Ondine brings." [...] Laurent LeSage explains, [...] "No {{elemental}} spirit, she is a glimpse of a better and purer world ...

2500|$|Adams {{experienced}} a musical epiphany after reading John Cage's book Silence (1973), which he claimed [...] "dropped into [...] psyche like a time bomb." [...] Cage posed fundamental {{questions about what}} music was, and regarded all types of sounds as viable sources of music. This perspective offered to Adams a liberating alternative to the rule-based techniques of serialism. At this point Adams began to experiment with electronic music, and his experiences {{are reflected in the}} writing of Phrygian Gates (1977–78), in which the constant shifting between modules in Lydian mode and Phrygian mode refers to activating electronic gates rather than architectural ones. Adams explained that working with synthesizers caused a [...] "diatonic conversion," [...] a reversion to the belief that tonality was <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Sergeant Hartman (renamed {{from the}} book's Gerheim) has an {{expanded}} {{role in the}} film.

[...] The film omits [...] "Hartman's" [...] disclosure to other troops that he thinks Pyle might be mentally unstable, a [...] "Section 8". In contrast, Hartman praises Pyle, saying that he is [...] "born again hard". Jenkins says that the character of Hartman could not have been portrayed as having a warmer social relationship with the troops, as that would have upset the balance of the film, which depends on the spectacle of ordinary soldiers coming to grips with Hartman as <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> embodying a killer culture.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the approach}} Thomas Edison used {{when dealing with}} his claim to have discovered <b>a</b> new <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> etheric <b>force,</b> to the approach he used to create successful inventions. It argues that he failed in this adventure into scientific theory making because an erroneous view of science led him to abandon techniques that made him America's most successful inventor. From this I develop an argument for viewing experimental science as an artefact creation process, like inventing, in which two of the artefacts created are theories and demonstration experiments that support the theories...|$|R
2500|$|The second quatrain {{describes}} the young man's {{relationship with the}} poet. We can see here {{that there may be}} a moral or internal struggle for the narrator because the young man does not have loyalty towards only one person. The speaker is torn between hating the clouds and hating the young man who will [...] "permit" [...] the damage they (the clouds) cause and hurt the speaker's feelings. Guilt is transferred, not to another human being, but to <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> to blame for the young man's misdeeds for being promiscuous or disloyal to the speaker. The speaker is using the sun as a metaphor emphasizes its guilt and problem of the [...] "friend". Phrases and words like, [...] "basest clouds", [...] "ugly rack", [...] "stealing", and [...] "disgrace" [...] in the second quatrain show the readers how the poet is feeling towards the young man's promiscuity. It also shows that a serious moral lapse has occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{worked for}} 10 {{years on a}} prose poem, [...] "Gaudete", which he hoped to have made into a film. It {{tells the story of}} the vicar of an English village who is carried off by {{elemental}} spirits, and replaced in the village by his enantiodromic double, a changeling, fashioned from a log, who nevertheless has the same memories as the original vicar. The double is <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> who organises the women of the village into a [...] "love coven" [...] in order that he may father a new messiah. When the male members of the community discover what is going on, they murder him. The epilogue consists of a series of lyrics spoken by the restored priest in praise of a nature goddess, inspired by Robert Graves's White Goddess. It was printed in 1977. Hughes was very interested in the relationship between his poetry and the book arts, and many of his books were produced by notable presses and in collaborative editions with artists, for instance with Leonard Baskin.|$|E
2500|$|Soon afterward, {{along with}} the stories about Hammett, another series of news reports start {{to appear in the}} press which hint at various sex scandals {{regarding}} Ferrier's wife, Dagmar. They paint a picture of her as wanton and cavorting at clubs with a South American gigolo. These stories appear in The X-Ray News, which is sued for libel by Mrs Ferrier. The prosecution provides their first witness – the Bishop of Northumbria – who swears that Mrs Ferrier was at his palace recovering on doctor's orders on the dates mentioned by the newspaper. The second witness is a lady called Thelma Anderson who states that she was approached by a man who said he worked for The X-Ray News and employed her to impersonate Mrs Ferrier. She was then photographed in various compromising situations. Mrs Ferrier wins her libel case easily and in doing so makes the public assume the rumours about Hammett were also fabricated. Poirot reveals to an astonished Ferrier that the idea to use Thelma Anderson was his and that Dagmar was in on the plan. The idea came from Dumas's book, The Queen's Necklace, but the real inspiration was [...] "The Augean Stables" [...] when Hercules uses <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> – in his case a river – to clean the stables out. Poirot used sex as the force of nature, first blackening Mrs Ferrier's name and then clearing her in a public fashion, resulting in a wave of sympathy which also reflected well on her father and destroyed The X-Ray News.|$|E

50|$|The pervading {{theme of}} this work is the subtle paganism Synge {{observed}} in the people of rural Ireland. Following his dismissal of Christianity, Synge found that the predominantly Roman Catholic Ireland still retained many of the folktales and superstitions were born {{out of the old}} Celtic paganism. This play is an examination of that idea as he has a set of deeply religious characters find themselves at odds with <b>an</b> unbeatable <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> (this being the sea). While the family is clearly Catholic, they still find themselves wary of the supernatural characteristics of natural elements, an idea very present in Celtic paganism.|$|R
