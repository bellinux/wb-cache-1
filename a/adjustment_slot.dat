In order to simultaneously reduce delay and increase capacity in metropolis airportwith multi-parallel runways, based on the classic Point-Merge route structure, a novel Multiple-Points-Merge (M-PM) route system is firstly proposed. It consists of multi-layers on the sequencing legs for dierent categories of aircraftwith H,Mand L, and a M-PM system for Beijing Capital international airport is built with lazy “ 8 ” topology. After that,a multiple-objectives function is discussed for this aircraft scheduling problem, operational constraints are analyzed indetail, a modelling strategy with sliding time window and simulated annealing algorithm is proposed for solving thisreal-time scheduling and sequencing landing problem. According {{to the relationship between}} aircraft entry time andthe position of sliding time window, all arrival aircraft are firstly classified into 4 dierent status: planned, ongoing,active, and completed, and then in the sliding time window the aircraft with active or ongoing status are optimized withre-sequence and conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) process. Conflict detection (CD) is based on pairwise formto detect separation infringement between aircraft. There are two types of conflict, catching up conflict and convergingconflict. Conflict resolution (CR) solve the detected horizontal conflict with speed <b>adjustment,</b> <b>slot</b> time control, andturning time control technique. In a future work, this novel M-PM system will be evaluated with real operational data...|$|E
40|$|A {{time slot}} co-synchronization {{algorithm}} for modifying the local time slot reference is proposed, the algorithm {{is using the}} time slot deviations of neighbor nodes to calculate the <b>slot</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Then a <b>slot</b> deviation computing method under the condition of signal propagation delay is presented and the convergence of this algorithm is proved. Finally, the simulation results of the algorithm for different scenarios are given. Experiments show that this algorithm has fast convergence rate and less computation burden due to the parallel co-computed by each node. Hence, it is very suitable to run on Ad Hoc terminal nodes...|$|R

Numerous time <b>slot</b> <b>adjustments,</b> and the massive cast and setting overhaul for season two could not overcome the marginal ratings and the critical panning Baby Talk received. In fact, results of the 1991 Electronic Media Critics' Poll voted Baby Talk the Worst Series on Television. The series was cancelled {{in the spring of}} 1992.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} unorthodox design, first {{flying on}} 28 October 1949, was (unusually for a combat aircraft) fitted with three engines, General Electric J47s in this case: {{one at the}} extreme tail with an intake {{at the base of}} the tailfin, and two underneath the forward fuselage in pods. The innovative, variable incidence wings, swept at 35° and with 6° anhedral, were equipped with leading edge slats and full-width flaps. Spoilers gave most of the roll control and undersized ailerons provided feel for the pilot. The combination of variable incidence <b>adjustment</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps allowed for a shorter takeoff run. Four 954 lb (4.24 kN) thrust Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO) bottles with a 14-second burn duration could be fitted to the rear fuselage to improve takeoff performance. Spectacular launches were a feature of later test flights.|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes several dynamic {{bandwidth}} allocation {{strategies for}} QoS routing on TDMA-based mobile ad hoc networks. Comprehensively, these strategies are called a distributed slots reservation protocol (DSRP). In DSRP, QoS routing only depends on one-hop neighboring information of each mobile host (MH). In addition, slot inhibited policies (SIPs) and slot decision policies (SDPs) are proposed to determine which slots are valid to use and which slots in the valid slots can be used actually, respectively. In SDPs, three heuristic policies, 3 BDP, LCFP, and MRFP, are proposed to increase the success rate of a QoS route and alleviate the slot shortage problems. Moreover, a <b>slot</b> <b>adjustment</b> protocol (SAP) is proposed for a conflicting MH to coordinate the slot usage of its neighbors during the route reservation phase {{in order to accommodate}} more routes in the network. The <b>slot</b> <b>adjustment</b> algorithm (SAA) invoked in SAP is a branch-and-bound algorithm, which is an optimum algorithm {{in terms of the number}} of slots to be adjusted, on the premise that not to break down any existing route. QoS route maintenance and improvement are also provided. By the simulation results, the proposed protocol cannot only increase the success rate in search of a route with bandwidth requirement guaranteed but also raise the throughput and efficiency of the network...|$|R

Time-slot {{synchronization}} is {{very important}} for a TDMA-based Ad Hoc Network. In this paper, we propose a decentralized algorithm to synchronize the local time slot reference. The differences between the time slots of neighboring nodes with consideration of signal propagation delay are used to compute the <b>slot</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The methods on how to choose parameters are also discussed.

40|$|A {{spectrum}} slot is {{the frequency}} range allocated {{to a single}} channel within a flexible grid, and its width needs to be an integer multiple of the so-called slot width granularity. The slot width of the spectrum slots {{to be used for}} an optical path in flexgrid optical networks can be adjusted in time to align with time-varying client traffic demand for both bandwidth and energy efficiency purposes. However, frequent <b>adjustment</b> of the <b>slot</b> width of optical paths places substantial signaling load on the control plane.

5000|$|Best of Luck Nikki episodes {{are similar}} to the Good Luck Charlie episodes for the first two seasons and are {{uploaded}} fully on YouTube, but not fully shown on TV. The episodes on TV are aired just for 20 to 25 minutes whereas the episodes on YouTube are of 30 to 35 minutes duration. Because of this time <b>slot</b> <b>adjustment</b> problems Best of Luck Nikki Season 3 and 4 episodes are already edited and made, avoiding certain parts which are then clubbed up to form a new episode, that is the reason why Best of Luck Nikki has more episodes, unlike Good Luck Charlie, which has just 97 episodes, 1 movie and 4 seasons. For example, episode 86 of Best of Luck Nikki has parts from three different episodes of Good Luck Charlie, namely, [...] "Study Buddy" [...] (when PJ reads a book to Charlie), [...] "Doppel Date" [...] (when Teddy decides to date a new guy post-Spencer) and [...] "Teddy's Choice" [...] (where Bob accidentally buys Gabe a girl's shirt).|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this Master of Science Thesis project are the design, develop-ment {{and implementation of}} an innovative wireless electronic controller for digital slot car applications. A slot vehicle is an electrical powered model that is guided by a groove or slot in the track on which it runs. The slot controller designed allows an accurate con-trol of the change lane, brake and throttle actions in slot vehicles and it resolves the pre-sent problems of commercial slot car controllers. This project focuses on the complete development of the electronic hardware interface dedicated to control digital slot vehicles. The development was performed using an electronic platform that combines a low cost and high performance microcontroller, which is equipped with conditioning electronics necessary to achieve the <b>adjustment</b> of <b>slot</b> vehicles parameters. The control interface, conditioning electronics and the neces-sary electronics for wireless communication are topics to considerer. The development of the system software is also broached in this project, which is re-sponsible for providing different driving modes possibilities for users depending on the performance required by the characteristics of each slot racing circuit. For this devel-opment, the main slot car controllers on the market have been analysed and the most common components in the multifunction control units of the circuits to perform a de-sign that implements a microcontroller, which gives intelligence and enables to have an advanced control in digital slot car systems. The complexity of the project carried out is clear because it involves starting from scratch in research {{and the use of}} a large number of knowledge of different subjects and the real demonstration of proper operation. It is noteworthy that despite develop a good theoretical basis of the problem to be solved, its proper functioning in practise presents additional difficulties with respect to the theoretical model developed. The results have been satisfactory to achieve the proposed tasks from the beginning. The slot controller has a colour screen that provides an intuitive interface with the placement of the push buttons. The wireless communication allows more independence and different driving modes give to the controller new features never seen in previous slot car systems. The best reward is the development of a Master’s Thesis project that has interest to the people. Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería IndustrialUniversidad Politécnica de Cartagen...|$|R
