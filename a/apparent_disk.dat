40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{long-term}} observation campaign of the extragalactic wind-accreting black-hole X-ray binary LMC X- 1, using the Proportional Counter Array on the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The observations show that LMC X- 1 's accretion disk exhibits an anomalous temperature-luminosity relation. We use deep archival RXTE observations to show that large movements across the temperature-luminosity space occupied by the system can take place on time scales as short as half an hour. These changes cannot be adequately explained by perturbations that propagate from the outer disk on a viscous timescale. We propose instead that the <b>apparent</b> <b>disk</b> variations reflect rapid fluctuations within the Compton up-scattering coronal material, which occults the inner parts of the disk. The expected relationship between the observed disk luminosity and <b>apparent</b> <b>disk</b> temperature derived from the variable occultation model is quantitatively shown to be in good agreement with the observations. Two other observations support this picture: an inverse correlation between the flux in the power-law spectral component and the fitted inner disk temperature, and a near-constant total photon flux, suggesting that the inner disk is not ejected when a lower temperature is observed.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of disk-like mass distributions around newly formed stars have provided evidence for rapid rotation on scales similar {{to less than}} 0. 1 pc with specific angular momenta much higher than typical stellar values. A likely mechanism for the extraction of angular momentum from these regions is magnetic braking by means of Alfven waves that propagate into the lower-density ambient medium. However, because of the relatively high particle densities and the correspondingly low implied ionization fractions in these <b>apparent</b> <b>disks,</b> their constituent ions and neutrals need not be well coupled {{to each other and}} could develop large relative drift velocities. For this reason, previous treatments of magnetic braking that assumed perfect coupling between ions and neutrals have to be modified in this case. In particular, one has to take into account both the azimuthal drift that develops because only the ions are directly coupled to the magnetic field and the radial drift (or ambipolar diffusion) which leads to a redistribution (and leakage) of the magnetic flux.

The source was covered but not detected in a Chandra observation on 2000 April 3, a Swift observation on 2005 September 10, and a second XMM-Newton observation on 2014 January 19, implying a large variability (> 260) of the X-ray flux. The optical spectrum of the candidate host galaxy, taken 11 years after the XMM-Newton detection, shows no sign of nuclear activity.

Indeed, a typical signature of MOND is an <b>apparent</b> <b>disk</b> of "phantom" dark matter, which is uniquely correlated with the visible disk-density distribution. Due to this phantom dark disk, Newtonian models with a spherical halo have different signatures from MOND models close to the Galactic plane. The models can thus be differentiated by measuring dynamically (within Newtonian dynamics) the disk surface density at the solar radius, the radial mass gradient within the disk, or the velocity ellipsoid tilt angle above the Galactic plane. Using the most realistic possible baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we predict that, if MOND applies, the local surface density measured by a Newtonist will be approximately 78 Msun/pc 2 within 1. 1 kpc of the Galactic plane, the dynamically measured disk scale-length will be enhanced by a factor of 1. 25 with respect to the visible disk scale-length, and the local vertical tilt of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpc above the plane will be approximately 6 degrees.

We derive these quantities from the outlines of the asteroid in 307 images of its resolved <b>apparent</b> <b>disk</b> obtained with adaptive optics (AO) at Keck II and VLT, and combine these with recent mass determinations to estimate a bulk density. Results. Our best triaxial ellipsoid diameters for Lutetia, based on our AO images alone, are a × b × c = 132 × 101 × 93 km, with uncertainties of 4 × 3 × 13 km including estimated systematics, with a rotational pole within 5 ◦ of ECJ 2000 [λ β] = [45 ◦ − 7 ◦], or EQJ 2000 [RA Dec] = [44 ◦ + 9 ◦]. The AO model fit itself has internal precisions of 1 × 1 × 8 km, but it is evident both from this model derived from limited viewing aspects and the radius vector model given in a companion paper, that Lutetia significantly departs from an idealized ellipsoid. In particular, the long axis may be overestimated from the AO images alone by about 10 km. Therefore...|$|E
40|$|We present SCUBA- 2 850 µm {{observations}} of 7 very low mass stars (VLMS) and brown dwarfs (BDs). 3 are in Taurus and 4 in the TW Hydrae Association (TWA), {{and all are}} classical T Tauri (cTT) analogs. We detect 2 of the 3 Taurus disks (one only marginally), {{but none of the}} TWA ones. For standard grains in cTT disks, our 3 σ limits correspond to a dust mass of 1. 2 M ⊕ in Taurus and a mere 0. 2 M ⊕ in the TWA (3 – 10 × deeper than previous work). We combine our data with other sub-mm/mm surveys of Taurus, ρ Oph and the TWA to investi-gate the trends in disk mass and grain growth during the cTT phase. Assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100 : 1 and fiducial surface density and temperature pro-files guided by current data, we find the following. (1) The minimum disk outer radius required to explain the upper envelope of sub-mm/mm fluxes is ∼ 100 AU for intermediate-mass stars, solar-types and VLMS, and ∼ 20 AU for BDs. (2) While the upper envelope of <b>apparent</b> <b>disk</b> masses increases with M ∗ from BDs to VLMS to solar-type stars, no such increase is observed from solar-type to intermediate-mass stars. We propose this is due to enhanced photoevaporation around intermediate stellar masses. (3) Many of the disks around Taurus and ρ Oph intermediate-mass and solar-type stars evince an opacity index of β ∼ 0 – 1, indicating significant grain growth. Of the only four VLMS/BDs in thes...|$|E
40|$|Aims: We present J, H, K {{interferometry}} with a {{spectral resolution}} of 35 for the Mira variable S Orionis. We aim at measuring the diameter variation {{as a function}} of wavelength that is expected due to molecular layers lying above the continuum-forming photosphere. Methods: Visibility data of S Ori were obtained at phase 0. 78 with the VLTI/AMBER instrument using the fringe tracker FINITO at 29 spectral channels between 1. 29 and 2. 32 mu. <b>Apparent</b> uniform <b>disk</b> (UD) diameters were computed for each spectral channel. In addition, the visibility data were directly compared to predictions by recent self-excited dynamic model atmospheres. Results: S Ori shows significant variations in the visibility values {{as a function of}} spectral channel that can only be described by a clear variation in the apparent angular size with wavelength. The closure phase values are close to zero at all spectral channels, indicating the absence of asymmetric intensity features. The apparent UD angular diameter is smallest at about 1. 3 and 1. 7 mu and increases by a factor of ~ 1. 4 around 2. 0 mu. The minimum UD angular diameter is 8. 1 pm 0. 5 mas, corresponding to ~ 420 R_sun. The S Ori visibility data and the apparent UD variations can be explained reasonably well by a dynamic atmosphere model that includes molecular layers. Conclusions: The measured visibility and UD diameter variations with wavelength resemble and generally confirm the predictions by recent dynamic model atmospheres.

40|$|We {{present a}} Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) imaging study {{that characterizes the}} star cluster {{component}} of nearby galaxy outer disks (beyond the optical radius R_ 25). Expanding on the pilot project of Herbert-Fort et al. (2009), we present deep (~ 27. 5 mag V-band point-source limiting magnitude) U- and V-band imaging of six galaxies: IC 4182, NGC 3351, NGC 4736, NGC 4826, NGC 5474, and NGC 6503. We find that the outer disk of each galaxy is populated with marginally-resolved star clusters with masses ~ 10 ^ 3 M_sun and ages up to ~ 1 Gyr (masses and ages are limited by the depth of our imaging and uncertainties are large given how photometry can be strongly affected by {{the presence or absence}} of a few stars in such low mass systems), and that they are typically found out to at least 2 R_ 25 but sometimes as far as 3 to 4 R_ 25 - even beyond the <b>apparent</b> HI <b>disk.</b> The mean rate of cluster formation for 1 R_ 25 <= R <= 1. 5 R_ 25 is at least one every ~ 2. 5 Myr and the clusters are spatially correlated with the HI, most strongly with higher density gas near the periphery of the optical disk and with lower density neutral gas at the HI disk periphery. We hypothesize that the clusters near the edge of the optical disk are formed in the extension of spiral structure from the inner disk and are a fairly consistent phenomenon and that the clusters formed at the periphery of the HI disk are the result of accretion episodes.
