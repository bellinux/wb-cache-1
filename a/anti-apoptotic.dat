5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an <b>anti-apoptotic</b> and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity {{has been linked to}} inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Regulating ER {{release of}} Ca2+ at the MAM is {{especially}} critical because only a certain window of Ca2+ uptake sustains the mitochondria, and consequently the cell, at homeostasis. Sufficient intraorganelle Ca2+ signaling {{is required to}} stimulate metabolism by activating dehydrogenase enzymes critical to flux through the citric acid cycle. However, once Ca2+ signaling in the mitochondria passes a certain threshold, it stimulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in part by collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential required for metabolism. Studies examining the role of pro- and <b>anti-apoptotic</b> factors support this model; for example, the <b>anti-apoptotic</b> factor Bcl-2 {{has been shown to}} interact with IP3Rs to reduce Ca2+ filling of the ER, leading to reduced efflux at the MAM and preventing collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential post-apoptotic stimuli. Given the need for such fine regulation of Ca2+ signaling, it is perhaps unsurprising that dysregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, while the catalogue of tumor suppressors includes a few that are enriched at the MAM.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{components}} of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. Gankyrin, a recently identified oncoprotein, {{is one of the}} 19S subcomponents that also tightly binds the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and {{plays a key role in}} recognizing ubiquitinated p53, via its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Gankyrin is <b>anti-apoptotic</b> and has been shown to be overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an <b>anti-apoptotic</b> agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, coexpression of <b>anti-apoptotic</b> {{proteins}} such as Mcl-1 suppresses apoptosis {{induced by}} Bok overexpression. Consistent {{with the results}} mentioned above, coexpression of <b>anti-apoptotic</b> Bcl-2 does not prevent Bok-induced apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} that the {{cellular}} ratio of pro-apoptotic to <b>anti-apoptotic</b> Bcl-2 family members effects late apoptotic events such as release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the activation of caspases. Higher levels of pro-apoptotic proteins compared to <b>anti-apoptotic</b> proteins seem to cause apoptosis. In a current model, the formation of heterodimers between pro-apoptotic and <b>anti-apoptotic</b> proteins prevents induction of apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Bcl-2 (B-cell {{lymphoma}} 2), {{encoded in}} humans by the BCL2 gene, is the {{founding member of}} the Bcl-2 family of regulator proteins that regulate cell death (apoptosis), by either inducing (pro-apoptotic) or inhibiting (<b>anti-apoptotic)</b> apoptosis. Bcl-2 is specifically considered an important <b>anti-apoptotic</b> protein but it is NOT considered a proto-oncogene because it is not a growth signal transducer.|$|E
25|$|Activation of the Hedgehog pathway {{leads to}} an {{increase}} in Angiogenic Factors (angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2), Cyclins (cyclin D1 and B1), <b>anti-apoptotic</b> genes and a decrease in apoptotic genes (Fas).|$|E
25|$|Apoptosis {{plays an}} {{important}} role in regulating a variety of diseases. For example, schizophrenia is a neurodegenerative disease that may result from an abnormal ratio of pro- and <b>anti-apoptotic</b> factors. Some evidence suggests that this may result from abnormal expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of caspase-3.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{can be seen}} as a {{disturbance}} in the homeostatic balance between cell growth and cell death. Over-expression of <b>anti-apoptotic</b> genes, and under-expression of pro-apoptotic genes, can result in the lack of cell death that is characteristic of cancer. An example can be seen in lymphomas. The over-expression of the <b>anti-apoptotic</b> Bcl-2 protein in lymphocytes alone does not cause cancer. But simultaneous over-expression of Bcl-2 and the proto-oncogene myc may produce aggressive B-cell malignancies including lymphoma. In follicular lymphoma, a chromosomal translocation commonly occurs between the fourteenth and the eighteenth chromosomes — t(14;18) — which places the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This fusion gene is deregulated, leading to the transcription of excessively high levels of Bcl-2. This decreases the propensity of these cells for apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Rich {{speculates that}} the Z-DNA is {{necessary}} for transcription and that E3L stabilizes the Z-DNA, thus prolonging expression of the <b>anti-apoptotic</b> genes. He suggests that a small molecule that interferes with the E3L binding to Z-DNA could thwart the activation of these genes and help protect people from pox infections.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-3 {{has been}} shown to be the only galectin with <b>anti-apoptotic</b> activity, proven by {{knock-out}} in mice increasing rates of apoptosis. Intracellularly, galectin-3 can associate with Bcl-2 proteins, an antiapoptotic family of proteins, and thus may enhance Bcl-2 binding to the target cell. On the other hand, galectin-3 can also be pro-apoptotic and mediate T cell and neutrophil death.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{the protein}} Bcl-2-related ovarian killer (Bok) was {{identified}} in a yeast two-hybrid experiment with a rat ovarian cDNA library in a screen for proteins interacting with Mcl-1, an abundant <b>anti-apoptotic</b> protein. The overexpression of Bok induces apoptosis. Because {{of its high}} sequence similarity to Bak and Bax, Bok is classified {{as a member of}} the Bcl-2 protein family.|$|E
25|$|The shorter version, Bok-S, lacks exon 3. This {{results in}} a fusion of the BH3 domain with the BH1 domain. The BH3 domain is {{involved}} in the interaction of Bok with Mcl-1 and other molecules. It is dispensable for the induction of apoptosis. Expression of Bok-S may be an immediate response to stress signals. It has been shown to induce apoptosis regardless of the presence of <b>anti-apoptotic</b> molecules.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown {{substantial}} interplay between the apoptosis and necroptosis pathways. At multiple stages of their respective signalling cascades, the two pathways can regulate each other. The best characterized example of this co-regulation {{is the ability of}} caspase 8 to inhibit the formation of the necrosome by cleaving RIPK1. Conversely, caspase 8 inhibition of necroptosis can be bypassed by the necroptotic machinery through the <b>anti-apoptotic</b> protein cFLIP which inactivates caspase 8 through formation of a heterodimer.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{aiming to}} inhibit works to block {{specific}} caspases. Finally, the Akt protein kinase promotes cell survival through two pathways. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits Bas (a Bcl-2 family member), causing Bas {{to interact with}} the 14-3-3 scaffold, resulting in Bcl dissociation and thus cell survival. Akt also activates IKKα, which leads to NF-κB activation and cell survival. Active NF-κB induces the expression of <b>anti-apoptotic</b> genes such as Bcl-2, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. NF-κB has been found to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depending on the stimuli utilized and the cell type.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, {{prolactin}} {{is associated}} with milk production; in fish it {{is thought to be}} related to control of water and salt balance. Prolactin also acts in a cytokine-like manner and as an important regulator of the immune system. It has important cell cycle-related functions as a growth-, differentiating- and <b>anti-apoptotic</b> factor. As a growth factor, binding to cytokine-like receptors, it influences hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and is involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways. The hormone acts in endocrine, autocrine and paracrine manner through the prolactin receptor and a large number of cytokine receptors.|$|E
25|$|Following TNF-R1 and Fas {{activation}} in mammalian cells {{a balance}} between proapoptotic (BAX, BID, BAK, or BAD) and <b>anti-apoptotic</b> (Bcl-Xl and Bcl-2) members of the Bcl-2 family is established. This balance is the proportion of proapoptotic homodimers that form in the outer-membrane of the mitochondrion. The proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable {{for the release of}} caspase activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC. Control of proapoptotic proteins under normal cell conditions of nonapoptotic cells is incompletely understood, but in general, Bax or Bak are activated by the activation of BH3-only proteins, part of the Bcl-2 family.|$|E
25|$|Erythropoietin was {{reported}} to have a range of actions beyond stimulation of erythropoiesis including vasoconstriction-dependent hypertension, stimulating angiogenesis, and promoting cell survival via activation of Epo receptors resulting in <b>anti-apoptotic</b> effects on ischemic tissues. However this proposal is controversial with numerous studies showing no effect. It is also inconsistent with the low levels of Epo receptors on those cells. Clinical trials in humans with ischemic heart, neural and renal tissues have not demonstrated the same benefits seen in animals. In addition some research studies have shown its neuroprotective effect on diabetic neuropathy, however these data were not confirmed in clinical trials that have been conducted on the deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, tibial and sural nerves.|$|E
25|$|GAPDH {{has been}} implicated in several {{neurodegenerative}} diseases and disorders, largely through interactions with other proteins specific to that disease or disorder. These interactions may affect not only energy metabolism but also other GAPDH functions. For example, GAPDH interactions with beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) could interfere with its function regarding the cytoskeleton or membrane transport, while interactions with huntingtin could interfere with its function regarding apoptosis, nuclear tRNA transport, DNA replication, and DNA repair. In addition, nuclear translocation of GAPDH {{has been reported in}} Parkinson's disease (PD), and several <b>anti-apoptotic</b> PD drugs, such as rasagiline, function by preventing the nuclear translocation of GAPDH. It is proposed that hypometabolism may be one contributor to PD, but the exact mechanisms underlying GAPDH involvement in neurodegenerative disease remains to be clarified. The SNP rs3741916 in the 5' UTR of the GAPDH gene may be associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{recently}} described {{example of}} this concept in action {{can be seen in}} the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460. The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is overexpressed in cells of the H460 cell line. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator cytochrome c, therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of proapoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of <b>anti-apoptotic</b> and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die. Defects in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells occur often at the level of control of transcription factors. As a particular example, defects in molecules that control transcription factor NF-κB in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signals, to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belongs. This degree of independence from external survival signals, can enable cancer metastasis.|$|E
25|$|The main {{method of}} {{treatment}} for death from signaling-related diseases involves either increasing or decreasing the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cells, {{depending on whether the}} disease is caused by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis. For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the <b>anti-apoptotic</b> Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa, or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-MDM2 complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway.|$|E
25|$|Programmed {{cell death}} {{can be reduced}} or {{eliminated}} in the developing nervous system by the targeted deletion of pro-apoptotic genes or by the overexpression of <b>anti-apoptotic</b> genes. The absence or reduction of PCD can cause serious anatomical malformations but can also result in minimal consequences depending on the gene targeted, neuronal population, and stage of development. Excess progenitor cell proliferation that leads to gross brain abnormalities is often lethal, as seen in caspase-3 or caspase-9 knockout mice which develop exencephaly in the forebrain. The brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia of these mice develop normally, however, suggesting that the involvement of caspases in PCD during development depends on the brain region and cell type. Knockout or inhibition of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), also results in malformations and increased embryonic lethality. Manipulation of apoptosis regulator proteins Bcl-2 and Bax (overexpression of Bcl-2 or deletion of Bax) produces {{an increase in the}} number of neurons in certain regions of the nervous system such as the retina, trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, PCD of neurons due to Bax deletion or Bcl-2 overexpression does not result in prominent morphological or behavioral abnormalities in mice. For example, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 have generally normal motor skills and vision and only show impairment in complex behaviors such as learning and anxiety. The normal behavioral phenotypes of these mice suggest that an adaptive mechanism may be involved to compensate for the excess neurons.|$|E
2500|$|In yeast two-hybrid experiments, Bok {{was found}} to {{interact}} with the <b>anti-apoptotic</b> proteins Mcl-1, BHRF-1, and Bfl-1. However, interactions with other <b>anti-apoptotic</b> proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w were not detectable [...] (1). Later studies aimed at confirming an interaction between Bok and pro-apoptotic Bak or Bax but were not successful.|$|E
2500|$|HIV enzymes {{deactivate}} <b>anti-apoptotic</b> Bcl-2. This {{does not}} directly cause cell death but primes the cell for apoptosis should the appropriate signal be received. [...] In parallel, these enzymes activate proapoptotic procaspase-8, which does directly activate the mitochondrial events of apoptosis.|$|E
2500|$|Activation of NF-κB: [...] TRADD {{recruits}} TRAF2 and RIP. TRAF2 in turn recruits the multicomponent {{protein kinase}} IKK, enabling the serine-threonine kinase RIP to activate it. An inhibitory protein, IκBα, that normally binds to NF-κB and inhibits its translocation, is phosphorylated by IKK and subsequently degraded, releasing NF-κB. NF-κB is a heterodimeric transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus and mediates the transcription {{of a vast}} array of proteins involved in cell survival and proliferation, inflammatory response, and <b>anti-apoptotic</b> factors.|$|E
2500|$|Induction {{of death}} signaling: [...] Like all death-domain-containing {{members of the}} TNFR superfamily, TNFR1 is {{involved}} in death signaling. However, TNF-induced cell death plays only a minor role compared to its overwhelming functions in the inflammatory process. Its death-inducing capability is weak compared to other family members (such as Fas), and often masked by the <b>anti-apoptotic</b> effects of NF-κB. Nevertheless, TRADD binds FADD, which then recruits the cysteine protease caspase-8. A high concentration of caspase-8 induces its autoproteolytic activation and subsequent cleaving of effector caspases, leading to cell apoptosis.|$|E
2500|$|Apoptosis {{plays an}} active role in {{regulating}} the immune system. When it is functional, it can cause immune unresponsiveness to self-antigens via both central and peripheral tolerance. In the case of defective apoptosis, it may contribute to etiological aspects of autoimmune diseases. The autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes can be caused by defective apoptosis, which leads to aberrant T cell AICD and defective peripheral tolerance. Due to the fact that dendritic cells are the immune system's most important antigen-presenting cells, their activity must be tightly regulated by mechanisms such as apoptosis. Researchers have found that mice containing dendritic cells that are Bim -/-, thus unable to induce effective apoptosis, suffer autoimmune diseases more so than those that have normal dendritic cells. Other studies have shown that [...] dendritic cell lifespan may be partly controlled by a timer dependent on <b>anti-apoptotic</b> Bcl-2.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that estrogen and progesterone have a mitogenic effect on leiomyoma cells and also act by influencing (directly and indirectly) {{a large number of}} growth factors, cytokines and apoptotic factors as well as other hormones. Furthermore, the actions of estrogen and progesterone are modulated by the cross-talk between estrogen, progesterone and prolactin signaling which controls the expression of the respective nuclear receptors. It {{is believed}} that estrogen promotes growth by up-regulating IGF-1, EGFR, [...] TGF-beta1, TGF-beta3 and PDGF, and promotes aberrant survival of leiomyoma cells by down-regulating p53, increasing expression of the <b>anti-apoptotic</b> factor PCP4 and antagonizing PPAR-gamma signaling. Progesterone is thought to promote the growth of leiomyoma through up-regulating EGF, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, and promotes survival through up-regulating Bcl-2 expression and down-regulating TNF-alpha. Progesterone is believed to counteract growth by downregulating IGF-1. Expression of transforming growth interacting factor (TGIF) is increased in leiomyoma compared with myometrium. TGIF is a potential repressor of TGF-β pathways in myometrial cells.|$|E
2500|$|... p38α MAPK {{constitutes}} the main p38 MAPK activity in heart. [...] During cardiomyocyte maturation in new born mouse heart, p38α MAPK activity can regulate myocyte cytokinesis and promote cell cycle exit. while inhibition of p38 MAPK activity leads to induction of mitosis in both adult and fetal cardiomyocyte. Therefore, p38 MAPK {{is associated with}} cell-cycle arrest in mammalian cardiomyocytes and its inhibition may represent a strategy to promote cardiac regeneration in response to injury. [...] In addition, p38α MAPK induction promotes myocyte apoptosis. via downstream targets STAT1, CHOP, FAK, SMAD, cytochrome c, NF-κB, PTEN, and p53. p38 MAPK can also target IRS-1 mediated AKT signaling and promotes myocyte death under chronic insulin stimulation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity confers cardioprotection against ischemia reperfusion injury in heart However, some reports demonstrated that p38 MAPK also involves in <b>anti-apoptotic</b> effect via phosphorylation of αβ-Crystallin or induction of Pim-3 during early response to oxidative stress or anoxic preconditioning respectively [...] More interestingly, p38α MAPK and p38β MAPK appear to have an opposite role in apoptosis. Whereas p38α MAPK has a pro-apoptotic role via p53 activation, p38β MAPK has a pro-survival role via inhibition of ROS formation. [...] In general, chronic activation of p38 MAPK activity is viewed as pathological and pro-apoptotic, and inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is in clinical evaluation as a potential therapy to mitigate acute injury in ischemic heart failure. [...] p38 MAPK activity is also implicated in cardiac hypertrophy which is a significant feature of pathological remodeling in the diseased hearts and a major risk factor for heart failure and advert outcome. [...] Most in vitro evidence supports that p38 MAPK activation promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. [...] However, in vivo evidence suggest that chronic activation of p38 MAPK activity triggers restrictive cardiomyopathy with limited hypertrophy, while genetic inactivation p38α MAPK in mouse heart results in an elevated cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload [...] or swimming exercise. [...] Therefore, the functional role of p38 MAPK in cardiac hypertrophy remains controversial and yet to be further elucidated.|$|E
