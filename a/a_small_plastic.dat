25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} sat down. On my left was Guttierez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{introduced}} Mardas to Lennon, {{and it was}} at {{this point}} that Mardas impressed Lennon with the Nothing Box; <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> box with randomly blinking lights that Lennon would stare at for hours while under the influence of LSD. Lennon later introduced the renamed John Alexis Mardas as his [...] "new guru", calling him [...] "Magic Alex". Mardas allegedly told Lennon about ideas for futuristic electronic devices he was [...] "working on", which he later denied either promising or discussing: a telephone that responded to its owner's voice and could identify who was calling, a force field that would surround the Beatles' homes, an X-ray camera, paint that would make anything invisible, car paint that would change colour by flicking a switch, and wallpaper speakers, which would actually {{be a part of the}} wallpaper. Mardas later asked for the V-12 engines from Lennon's Rolls-Royce and George Harrison's Ferrari Berlinetta car, so he could build a flying saucer. Mardas also denied making these claims.|$|E
2500|$|Other targets, called saturn targets, are {{specifically}} designed to reduce the anisotropy and improve the implosion. They feature <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> ring around the [...] "equator" [...] of the target, which quickly vaporizes into a plasma when hit by the laser. Some of the laser light is refracted through this plasma back towards the equator of the target, evening out the heating. Ignition with gains of just over thirty-five times {{are thought to be}} possible using these targets at NIF, producing results almost as good as the fully symmetric direct drive approach.|$|E
2500|$|The 1999 European, Australian, and Asian CR-V models {{featured}} more drastic changes. Exterior alterations {{included a}} new front bumper, smoothed off rear bumper, and <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>plastic</b> radio antenna {{on the rear}} of the roof. [...] "Nighthawk Black" [...] was added to the list of paint choices, while [...] "Passion Orange" [...] disappeared. New dark blue pearl and red pearl shades replaced the former solid red and metallic blue hues. European models received an enlarged Honda emblem on the front grille, and a new metallic yellow paint in certain markets.|$|R
5000|$|After the Second World War Panagyurishte was {{transformed}} into a large industrial center. The Asarel Medet copper extracting and processing plant is by far the largest single employer in the municipality with over 2,500 workers and also the biggest plant in its kind in the Balkans. [...] "Opticoelectron" [...] is an optic producing plant, unique to the country (740 workers). Recently, a new similar plant, [...] "Optix" [...] was launched (370 workers). There are two big textile plants: [...] "Ryton" [...] (880 employees) and [...] "Bultex" [...] (680 employees). There is also <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastics</b> factory, [...] "Bunai" [...] with some 190 workers and <b>a</b> number of <b>smaller</b> enterprises.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 2 September 2015, Kurdi and his family boarded <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> or rubber {{inflatable}} boat, which capsized about five minutes after leaving Bodrum in Turkey. Sixteen people were in the boat, which was designed for a maximum of eight people. They were trying to reach the Greek island of Kos, about 30 minutes (...) from Bodrum. Kurdi's father said: [...] "We had no life vests", but also said they were wearing life jackets, but they [...] "were all fake". Others have stated that they believed that they were wearing lifejackets but the items were ineffective.|$|E
2500|$|... "Open-fit" [...] or [...] "over-the-ear" [...] (OTE) {{hearing aids}} are small behind-the-ear type devices. This type is {{characterized}} by a minimal amount of effect on the ear canal resonances, as it traditionally leaves the ear canal as open as possible, often only being plugged up by a small speaker resting {{in the middle of the}} ear canal space. Traditionally, these hearing aids have <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> case behind the ear and a small clear tube running into the ear canal. Inside the ear canal, a small soft silicone dome or a molded, highly vented acrylic tip holds the tube in place.|$|E
2500|$|Skin {{testing is}} also known as [...] "puncture testing" [...] and [...] "prick testing" [...] due to the series of tiny {{punctures}} or pricks made into the patient's skin. Small amounts of suspected allergens and/or their extracts (e.g., pollen, grass, mite proteins, peanut extract) are introduced to sites on the skin marked with pen or dye (the ink/dye should be carefully selected, lest it cause an allergic response itself). <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> or metal device is used to puncture or prick the skin. Sometimes, the allergens are injected [...] "intradermally" [...] into the patient's skin, with a needle and syringe. Common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the back.|$|E
50|$|Bubble Tape {{comes in}} <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> round, <b>plastic</b> {{container}} similar {{in size to}} a hockey puck. This contains six feet (1.8 m) of gum wrapped in a spiral. The container functions much like a tape dispenser, although the top half can be removed or broken off.|$|R

There were problems with durability, reliability and overheating (despite appearances, the black stripes {{visible on the}} top rear of the case are merely cosmetic, and are not ventilation slots).|$|R
2500|$|Nitrogen is less soluble than carbon dioxide, {{which allows}} the beer to be put under high {{pressure}} without making it fizzy. High pressure of the dissolved gas is required to enable very small bubbles to be formed by forcing the draught beer through fine holes in a plate in the tap, which causes the characteristic [...] "surge" [...] (the widget in cans and bottles achieves the same effect). This [...] "widget" [...] is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> ball containing the nitrogen with also just a little beer itself. [...] The perceived smoothness of draught Guinness is due to its low level {{of carbon dioxide and}} the creaminess of the head caused by the very fine bubbles that arise from the use of nitrogen and the dispensing method described above. [...] "Foreign Extra Stout" [...] contains more carbon dioxide, causing a more acidic taste.|$|E
2500|$|The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles {{franchise}} {{was arguably}} {{at the height}} of its popularity around the time that The Secret of the Ooze was released in theatres. A number of tie-ins were brought out alongside the release of the film. A new line of toys were introduced for the release of the film, including [...] "Movie Star" [...] toys of all four turtles, with the box art depicting stills from the film, as well as a cartoon rendition of the turtles gathered around a canister of ooze in the top right corner of the package. In contrast to the usual Turtles' figures, the film series figures were softer and more rubbery, to better reflect the look of the animatronic costumes used in the films. They also featured ball joints at the neck, shoulders, and hips, and each figure came with <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> <b>plastic</b> canister with a sticker of [...] "Ooze" [...] wrapped around them. An official film adaptation was also released by Eastman and Laird.|$|E
2500|$|Lego minifigure, {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "mini fig", or simply just [...] "fig", is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plastic</b> articulated figurine, many of which are yellow and other skin tones, available as part of the construction toy Lego, produced by Danish toy manufacturer the Lego Group. They were first produced in 1978, and have become hugely successful, with over 3.7 billion produced, and the figure appearing in a variety of media, including movies, books and video games. The figures are usually found within Lego sets, although they are also sold separately as keychains and magnets. While some are named as specific characters, either licensed from film franchises or of Lego's own creation, many are unnamed and are designed simply to fit within a certain theme (such as police officers, astronauts and pirates). Minifigures are collected by both children and adults. They are highly customizable, and parts from different figures can be mixed and matched, resulting in a large number of combinations.|$|E

5000|$|Every {{bovine animal}} in the EU must have an ear tag in each ear: a primary tag in one ear, which must be a large yellow plastic tag, and a {{secondary}} tag in the other, which may {{be similar to the}} primary, or it may be <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>plastic</b> tag (usually but not always also yellow) or a metal clip. Each tag must have the cattle passport number printed or stamped upon it, and the secondary tag may also include a RFID chip bearing the same number in electronic form. Tags may also include the passport number as a barcode, and they may have a space for [...] "management information" [...] to be written by the farmer (for example a name).|$|R
