5|$|A {{significant}} proportion of food waste is produced by the domestic household, which, in 2007, created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste. Potatoes, bread slices and apples are respectively the most wasted foods by quantity, while salads <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> away in the greatest proportion. A majority of wasted food is avoidable, with the rest being divided almost equally by foods which are unavoidable (e.g. tea bags) and unavoidable due to preference (e.g. bread crusts) or cooking type (e.g. potato skins).|$|E
5|$|The {{single largest}} {{producer}} of food {{waste in the}} United Kingdom is the domestic household. In 2007, households created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste – accounting for 19 per cent of all municipal solid waste. Potatoes account for the largest quantity of avoidable food disposed of; 359,000 tonnes per year <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> away, 49 per cent (177,400 tonnes) of which are untouched. Bread slices account for the second food type most disposed of (328,000 tonnes per year), and apples the third (190,000 tonnes per year). Salad is disposed of in the greatest proportion - 45 per cent of all salad purchased by weight will be thrown away uneaten.|$|E
5|$|During Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice {{sculpture}} {{modeled after}} Kim; the ice shavings <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> {{into the air}} and fall like snow, a rarity for the neighborhood. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him to hold her, but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.|$|E

5|$|In America, {{neoconservative}} {{aspirations to}} use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E
5|$|The camera tracks {{down to a}} lower {{floor on}} the building, where small kittens <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> into a woodchipper-type machine to provide the filling for Bart Simpson plush dolls. The toys are then placed into a cart pulled by a sad panda which is driven by {{a man with a}} whip. A man {{shipping}} boxes with The Simpsons logo on the side uses the tongue from a severed dolphin head to fasten shut the packages. Another employee uses the horn of a sickly unicorn to smash the holes in the center of The Simpsons DVDs. The shot zooms out to reveal that sweatshop is contained within a grim version of the 20th Century Fox logo, surrounded by barbed wire, searchlights, and a watchtower.|$|E
5|$|The hobo's third tale {{tells the}} story of Tom Sawyer, whom Bart portrays, and Huckleberry Finn, whom Nelson portrays. Tom is a rebellious trouble maker while Huck is a bully. Huck is caught holding hands with Becky (Lisa) and is forced to marry her by her father (Homer). Huck dodges the {{marriage}} and goes on the run with Tom, leaving Missouri for Missoura. However, they are chased by townspeople led by Becky's father and their families. Huck and Tom flee to a river boat, but <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> into the Mississippi River and are caught by the townspeople. At their funeral, Tom and Huck are first revealed to not be in their caskets, seemingly watching the proceedings from the rafters which they have big smiles on their faces, until Reverend Lovejoy orders their bodies lowered into the caskets, revealing that Tom and Huck are in fact dead.|$|E

5|$|Harima {{complicates the}} love {{triangle}} through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings {{among the students}} aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, Eri Sawachika, after the pair <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, Yakumo Tsukamoto, who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always {{falls in love with}} him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, Haruki Hanai, who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared surname causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations. Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrives at}} a giant Mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene, the {{apparent}} leader. Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing the screams of the dying victims of the Land Shark. The party battles Nene, but are easily defeated. They <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> out of the base and start to fall to their deaths, but {{a beam of light}} from the base catches them, and brings them back to the base. The party find three small floating spheres {{in the middle of the}} room; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the spheres. The party refuses, and instead hold onto the spheres for safekeeping. As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base, they are forced to fight a large army of Nene's robots. When the battle seems it will never end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E
5|$|The {{process is}} {{repeated}} multiple times; {{in each of}} the five worlds the group travel through, they find and awaken the corrupted crystals, Airy performs her ritual in the pillar of light, and they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> into a new parallel world. In each world, they find variations on the situations they encountered in their own world, and gradually learn several truths about themselves and their adversaries. Nearly all of the Eternian elite they face were taken in by Braev out of compassion as they were rejected by the Orthodoxy, Ringabel is actually a parallel version of Dark Knight Alternis Dim, a close friend of Edea, and Yulyana and DeRosso were key figures in cleansing the original incarnation of the Orthodoxy of corruption. During their travels, both Yulyana and DeRosso give subtle warnings to Tiz and Agnès about Airy's intentions; meanwhile, Ringabel's memories slowly return, and he recalls Airy turning into a monster and murdering the previous incarnations of the party. In truth, Airy is an agent of Ouroboros, an evil being using the crystals as a means of linking all worlds as an energy sources to reach and conquer the Celestial Realm.|$|E

5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E

25|$|Here a {{throwing}} motion acts on the sample. The vertical throwing {{motion is}} overlaid {{with a slight}} circular motion which results in distribution of the sample amount over the whole sieving surface. The particles are accelerated in the vertical direction (<b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> upwards). In the air they carry out free rotations and interact with the openings in the mesh of the sieve when they fall back. If the particles are smaller than the openings, they pass through the sieve. If they are larger, they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> upwards again. The rotating motion while suspended increases {{the probability that the}} particles present a different orientation to the mesh when they fall back again, and thus might eventually pass through the mesh.|$|E
