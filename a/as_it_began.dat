5|$|After its peak, Guillermo {{weakened}} to {{tropical storm}} status <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> losing convection. It subsequently weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated after that on August 10. There were no damages or casualties {{associated with this}} tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed on November23 about 460mi (740km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northeastward, strengthening to peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) on November24. It later turned sharply {{to the west}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> a weakening trend, followed by a curve to the north. The cyclone dissipated on November26 about 450mi (725km) east-northeast of Bermuda, without ever affecting land.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, {{the storm}} weakened rapidly <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to move west-northwest. Later that morning, MFR downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. By April 15, MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression. That very day, the JTWC reported that winds of Helisaonia had fallen below hurricane-force. During the {{morning hours of}} April 17, the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression. Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped monitoring the system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E

5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted very slowly to the west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to make a turn back around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|By 1200UTC on February14, Nancy {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Shortly after, the JTWC assessed Nancy to have peaked with winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds). Increasing forward motion {{to the southeast}} and increasing wind shear caused Nancy to weaken. Early on February15, the storm passed directly over Manuae. Continued weakening took place as a trough approached from the southwest. By February16, Nancy weakened below hurricane intensity {{and turned to the}} southwest <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to undergo a Fujiwhara interaction with Cyclone Olaf to the north.|$|E
5|$|In early November, the 13th Brigade began readying {{itself for}} {{an attack on the}} Hindenburg Line with the {{division}}, which was part of the Second Army. The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre Plain, but before it could begin a full assault, the Allies signed an Armistice ending hostilities. After 33 days on the front lines, the 7th Division suffered 1,988 casualties. It was awarded one campaign streamer for Lorraine. The brigade performed occupation duties for the next year <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> preparations to return to the continental United States.|$|E

5|$|The last {{storm of}} the season was Hurricane Doreen, which formed on October1 off the {{southwest}} Mexican coast. It moved northwestward before curving to the north, although later it turned again to the northwest. Doreen was estimated to have attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h). On October4, Doreen made its closest approach to {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California peninsula <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> a motion to the northeast. Later that day, the hurricane moved over southern Sonora before dissipating on October5. Hurricane Doreen was responsible for light rainfall in the U.S. states of Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainfall}} lightened {{almost as}} soon <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began,</b> but the top riders in the general classification still faced a course made more difficult by the rain. Most of them rode conservatively, to keep their positions intact rather than aim for the stage win, but Danilo Di Luca did not. Di Luca attacked the course, riding with a high cadence from the outset. He had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds slower than the stage winner.|$|E
5|$|A weak trough {{existed in}} the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September29. A {{circulation}} developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October2, estimated at 45mph (75km/h). Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> weakening, {{and the next day}} it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico. How was the only named storm in the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the fights}} between Troilus and Diomedes from the {{traditional}} narrative of Benoît and Guido take place {{the next day in}} Shakespeare's retelling. Diomedes captures Troilus' horse in the first fight and sends it to Cressida. Then the Trojan triumphs in the second, though Diomedes escapes. But in a deviation from this narrative it is Hector, not Troilus, whom the Myrmidons surround in the climatic battle of the play and whose body is dragged behind Achilles' horse. Troilus himself is left alive vowing revenge for Hector's death and rejecting Pandarus. Troilus' story ends, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began,</b> in medias res with him and the remaining characters in his love-triangle remaining alive.|$|E
5|$|By September 2, the storm's {{convective}} thunderstorms warmed slightly, indicating weakening to {{just below}} Category5. An eyewall replacement cycle took place, and two eye structures formed as gradual weakening continued. By September 2, {{the storm was}} downgraded to Category3 just before it turned slightly to the west. The storm underwent another eyewall replacement cycle as winds decreased further. As the storm entered cooler waters, winds decreased to 100mph (160km/h), below major hurricane intensity. Soon Hernan was downgraded to Category1, and the eye became cloud-filled. On September 5, Hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds rapidly weakened to 45mph (72km/h) despite developing a new band of convection. That same day, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to lose tropical characteristics. Strong wind shear developed, further dissipating the depression. On September 6, the system degenerated into a remnant low-pressure system which spawned a remnant plume of moisture that meandered {{off the coast of}} California, producing light showers.|$|E
5|$|Despite being named, Rafael {{remained}} disorganized initially; {{this was}} the result of the interaction between an upper-level trough and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity. Over the course of the next few days, however, the upper-level trough gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm. Wind shear lessened, allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level trough to its west, a central dense overcast was noted on satellite imagery. Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600UTC on October15, while positioned about 650mi (1045km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} morning of June25, Celia started rapidly {{weakening}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> {{to take a}} more northwesterly track into a more hostile environment, with cooler water temperatures and higher wind shear; all of these conditions are highly unfavorable for tropical cyclones. By June26, convection associated with the hurricane had substantially lessened and cloud tops warmed. The storm also began to resume a westward track as it moved into an area of weaker steering currents. Traversing water temperatures estimated at , Celia continued to degenerate as it weakened to tropical storm status, by which time it was situated about 955mi (1,535km) southeast of the southern tip of Baja California Sur. Most of the convection associated with the system had dissipated and the center of circulation became exposed, with a small area of showers and thunderstorms to the north. Throughout June27, the system gradually lost its forward momentum over the open water of the Pacific Ocean but managed to maintain minimal tropical storm status longer than initially anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, the 26th Battalion undertook a series of training camps around northern Queensland <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to re-establish its numbers. Between September and November, it was based around Kissing Point, Queensland, before moving to Townsville in February 1940, and then south of Bowen the following month. At this time, it was placed {{under the command of}} the 11th Brigade, along with the 31st and 51st Battalions, both of which were Queensland-based Militia battalions. In mid-1940, the battalion's strength fluctuated as compulsory service was reintroduced and drafts of national servicemen marched in for short periods of training, while volunteers were released to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) and other services. Many of the initial recruits came from Italian-Australian families from north Queensland, but as the battalion grew, reinforcements from other Australian states arrived during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E

5|$|Girls {{wanted to}} become part of the {{movement}} almost as soon <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began.</b> Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds—later renamed Brownies—for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups did exist. By the 1990s, two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Abby was {{the only}} {{tropical}} cyclone in the Caribbean Sea during the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season. The second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the season, Abby developed on July 10 from a tropical wave {{in the vicinity of}} the Lesser Antilles. Abby rapidly intensified into a hurricane after being a tropical storm for less than six hours. It briefly peaked as a category 2 hurricane before weakening back. Abby rapidly weakened to a minimal tropical storm a few days thereafter. The storm re-strengthened into a hurricane <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to parallel the coast of Honduras. Hurricane Abby made landfall in British Honduras (present-day Belize) on July 15. Abby dissipated over Mexico later the next day. The remnants of Abby ultimately became Hurricane Celeste in the Pacific Ocean. Despite passing through or near several countries, Hurricane Abby had a relatively light impact on land, resulting in just $640,500 (1960 USD, $ USD) in damage and six fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Moving north-northwestward, the {{hurricane}} continued to mature, and it attained an intensity corresponding to Category2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale early on August13 as it approached eastern North Carolina. Shortly thereafter, Barbara {{reached its peak}} winds of 110mph (175km/h) while located south of Cape Hatteras. The cyclone moved over the Outer Banks of North Carolina overnight, crossing the shore between Morehead City and Ocracoke. It weakened as it progressed northward, and curved eastward out to sea due to a building ridge. It passed just southeast of the Mid-Atlantic states and New England, brushing Cape Cod, Massachusetts <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to accelerate northeastward.|$|E
