2500|$|Unbeknownst to Sanders, {{he and his}} men {{had been}} spotted on the roads leading toward Newton, and their {{probable}} destination had been guessed. [...] Jesse Carmichael, a veteran of the 15th Alabama who had served as a corporal and lost <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> Antietam in 1862, was notified by his father of Sanders' impending arrival in Newton that night, and he hastened to warn the town. [...] As the citizens formed up to defend their village, Carmichael and another wounded veteran of the 15th, John McEntyre, rode some distance outside of town, to provide an early warning of Sanders' arrival. [...] Spotting Sanders {{at the head of a}} mounted company of 44 men, Carmichael quickly rode back to Newton, where he led his neighbors to an ambush site he had chosen near a spring a mile east of town. [...] However, once he had headed out on another reconnaissance mission these men abandoned this position and returned to town, fearful for the safety of their families.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Alabama, Sanders began work on a gristmill, which was welcomed by his neighbors as their area was {{described}} a being [...] "quite destitute of mills." [...] Accordingly, they drew up a petition to Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, to ask that Sanders be allowed to resign his commission and remain at his home. [...] Insisting that he was [...] "patriotic and loyal," [...] and that [...] "only his ill health and shattered constitution keeps him away from his command," [...] the signers earnestly pleaded that Davis approve Sanders' resignation from military service. [...] Thirty-two citizens of Dale County signed the petition, including the Probate Judge, Daniel Carmichael, whose son Jesse {{had served as a}} corporal in the 15th Alabama Infantry, losing <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> Antietam. [...] Ironically, Jesse Carmichael would later play a pivotal role in Sanders' defeat when Sanders attacked his own hometown in March 1865this time, while wearing the uniform of a Federal officer.|$|E
