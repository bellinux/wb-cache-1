5|$|Some {{species of}} <b>anurans</b> {{hybridize}} readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the pool frog (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus). The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata {{are similar in}} forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In <b>anurans,</b> males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E

The Pantanal of central Brazil has experienced considerable modifications {{as a result}} of growing land use. The association between <b>anuran</b> assemblage and the local habitat structure of an agroecosystem in central Brazil at the Pantanal is described. It is shown that the structure of the <b>anuran</b> community is reestablished within the new environmental dynamics in such human-modified habitat. Twenty-four <b>anuran</b> species were recorded in the area. The community was dominated by four species (Dendropsophus nanus, Leptodactylus chaquensis, Hypsiboas raniceps, and Rhinella cf. bergi), which accounted for more than 50 % of the sampled individuals. The species distribution pattern was adjusted to the logarithmic, log-normal, and broken stick models, partially reflecting its association with agroecosystem characteristics. Habitat heterogeneity contributes to the <b>anuran</b> community at a local scale, thereby emphasizing the importance of maintaining distinct habitats for <b>anuran</b> species in the Pantanal as a management practice, even in in situations in which anthropic actions are predictable, as in agroecosystems...|$|R

The amphibamid Gerobatrachus, described in 2008, was proposed to be a transitional form between temnospondyls and <b>anurans</b> (frogs and toads) and caudatans (salamanders). It possessed a mixture of anuran and caudatan features, including a broad skull, short tail, and small pedicellate teeth.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>anurans</b> {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to motion, females use conspicuous movements to communicate interest. A female frog may also send vocal signals {{of her own}} to males, motivating copulation and competitive behaviors. Female Iberian midwife toads (Alytes cisternasii) use courtship calls to distinguish themselves from other male competitors. The African common platanna (Xenopus laevis) uses duet calling when males are not visible, allowing females to distinguish territorial males from satellite males. The Emei music frog (Babina daunchina) female calling stimulates male movement towards sound or phonotaxis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anurans</b> {{can only}} {{regenerate}} their limbs during embryonic development. Once the limb skeleton has developed regeneration {{does not occur}} (Xenopus can grow a cartilaginous spike after amputation). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to be required for a regeneration response in the anuran larvae. ROS production is essential to activate the Wnt signaling pathway, which {{has been associated with}} regeneration in other systems. Limb regeneration in salamanders occurs in two major steps. First, adult cells de-differentiate into progenitor cells which will replace the tissues they are derived from. Second, these progenitor cells then proliferate and differentiate until they have completely replaced the missing structure.|$|E

40|$|The histochemically {{determined}} {{distribution of}} acetylcholinesterase, monoamine oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase in the telencephalon of the bullfrog supports the classically recognized {{divisions of the}} pallium and subpallium. Analysis also corroborates the following gernerally recognized anuran-amniotic homologies: <b>anuran</b> medial pallium to amniotic medial cortex <b>anuran</b> septal nuclei to amniotic septal nuclei, <b>anuran</b> striatum to amniotic corpus striatum. On topographical and histochemical criteria the ventrocaudal and basomedial portions of the <b>anuran</b> telencephalon are considered possible homologues to the mammalian amygdala. It is suggested that two divisions can be recognized: a pars lateralis which may be homologous to the mammalian cortico-medial group. And a pars medialis which may be homologous to the mammalian baso-lateral group. Further analysis suggests, particularly when viewed {{in the light of}} recent experimental anatomical studies, that the <b>anuran</b> lateral pallium consists of a pars dorsalis and a pars ventralis. The pars dorsalis may be the reptilian homologue of the dorsal cortex and the pars ventralis may be the field homologue of both the reptilian piriform cortex and the dorsal ventricular ridge...|$|R
25|$|Most labyrinthodonts {{had special}} sense organs in the skin, forming a lateral line organ for {{perception}} of water flow and pressure, like {{those found in}} fish {{and a number of}} modern amphibians. This would enable them to pick up the vibration of their prey and other waterborne sounds while hunting in murky, weed filled waters. Early labyrinthodont groups had massive stapes, likely primarily anchoring the brain case to the skull roof. It is a question of some doubt whether early terrestrial labyrinthodonts had the stapes connected to a tympanum covering their otic notch, and if they had an aerial sense of hearing at all. The tympanum in <b>anurans</b> and amniotes appear to have evolved separately, indicating most, if not all, Labyrinthodonts were unable to pick up airborne sound.|$|E

2500|$|Anuran mating {{systems are}} promiscuous: {{females and males}} breed with {{multiple}} mates and females exhibit sequential polyandry when one female is fertilized {{by more than one}} male at different times. <b>Anurans</b> are external fertilizers so there is no sperm competition. Polyandry has benefits for females such as fertility insurance, paternal care insurance and dispersal of mortality risk. Female <b>anurans</b> have a high risk of mating with sperm depleted males due to frequent mating and tend to select the same few males displaying fitness qualities.

2500|$|The sensory {{exploitation}} hypothesis {{states that}} females have natural preexisting preferences for sexual signals {{that have been}} favored by sexual selection, with males producing calls that {{are known to be}} favorable for females. A recent study of advertisement calls from 72 species of <b>anurans</b> has indicated that most call features in males show phylogenetic correlation, indicating that species-specific evolution of calls might be constrained by a lack of genetic variation or because female preferences for call features have diverged to only a limited extent. Male <b>anurans</b> will often alter the rate of calling in order to intimidate other males though females tend to favor advertisement and courtship calls over aggressive ones, indicating that aggressive vocalizations are a form of male- male competition. as cited by ...|$|E

2500|$|Males can {{intercept}} vocal {{signals that}} were not meant for them in a tactic known as eavesdropping. [...] The Hyla versicolor male increases calling rate and duration once a female is in vicinity. Eavesdroppers will intercept these increased signals and begin to call for the female in a more aggressive manner, which generally leads to escalated conflicts. Eavesdropping also allows male frogs to assess the body size of their competitors. The frequency of vocal signals {{is dependent on the}} mass of the laryngeal apparatus, and a large one will produce lower frequency calls, positively correlated to overall body size. Male frogs will use eavesdropping {{to decide whether or not}} to initiate aggressive conflicts. Male <b>anurans</b> are more likely to attack a frog with higher frequency calls. It can also inform frogs when the competition has become too intense, where it can reduce or stop calling altogether and move to a different location outside of the chorus. In order to save energy they attempt to call females where there is less competition and a better chance to court a female. Once a satellite male hears a change in vocalizations of other males he will begin courtship calling in an attempt to steal a female, with some males now invests more energy into a competitive courtship call which may sway the female’s interest.
