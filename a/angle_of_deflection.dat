5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|This {{and related}} {{predictions}} follow {{from the fact}} that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesic—a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics. Such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity. As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion), several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge. Although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.|$|E

2500|$|To test how the {{scattering}} varied with the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> (i.e. if s ∝ csc4Φ/2) Geiger and Marsden built an apparatus {{that consisted of}} a hollow metal cylinder mounted on a turntable.

[...] The column was also a tube by which air was pumped out of the cylinder. [...] A microscope (M) with its objective lens covered by a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S) penetrated {{the wall of the}} cylinder and pointed at the metal foil. By turning the table, the microscope could be moved a full circle around the foil, allowing Geiger to observe and count alpha particles deflected by up to 150°.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{involved}} in the IDINTOS project, and in particular it studies the preliminary aerodynamic design concerning the stability in cruise conditions, and the flapped configuration of a PrandtlPlane aircraft. Starting from a preliminary CAD design, both stability and equilibrium were investigated in cruise conditions. In fact, {{the first part of the}} study presents the CAD model of the original geometry and both set-up and results of the CFD simulations. By knowing Lift, Drag and Moment and their coefficients (Cl, Cd and Cm), it is possible to create new geometries in order to reach the optimum configuration, which implies that the point of resultant Lift is as closer as possible to the center of the mass CG and that the configuration itself is stable. The second part is focused on both the take-off and the landing conditions. The flapped configuration is designed in order to develop enough Lift and appropriate aerodynamic Moment. The anterior wing was flapped with a fowler flap system that is the most performant one regarding the generated Lift. At first, the flap airfoil was chosen. The main phase of the flap design was to define the optimum position of the flap with respect to the trailing edge of the anterior wing. To achieve this goal detailed maps of Cl with respect to the flap position were made at different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack and <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> flap <b>deflection.</b> Regarding the posterior wing, a plain flap system was chosen and different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> it were investigated in order to obtain the requested Lift and, above all, to equilibrate the aerodynamic Moment of the anterior flapped wing.

50|$|Modeling photon {{propagation}} with Monte Carlo methods is {{a flexible}} yet rigorous approach to simulate photon transport. In the method, local rules of photon transport are expressed as probability distributions which describe the step size of photon movement between sites of photon-tissue interaction and the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> in a photon's trajectory when a scattering event occurs. This {{is equivalent to}} modeling photon transport analytically by the radiative transfer equation (RTE), which describes the motion of photons using a differential equation. However, closed-form solutions of the RTE are often not possible; for some geometries, the diffusion approximation {{can be used to}} simplify the RTE, although this, in turn, introduces many inaccuracies, especially near sources and boundaries. In contrast, Monte Carlo simulations can be made arbitrarily accurate by increasing the number of photons traced. For example, see the movie, where a Monte Carlo simulation of a pencil beam incident on a semi-infinite medium models both the initial ballistic photon flow and the later diffuse propagation.|$|R

50|$|Static balance can be {{measured}} by a static balancing machine where the tire is placed in its vertical axis on a non-rotating spindle tool.

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of photon propagation offer a flexible yet rigorous approach toward photon transport in turbid tissues. This method simulates the “random walk” of photons {{in a medium}} that contains absorption and scattering. The method {{is based on a}} set of rules that govern the movement of a photon in tissue. The two key decisions are (1) the mean free path for a scattering or absorption event, and (2) the scattering angle. Figure 4. 1 illustrates a scattering event. At boundaries, a photon is reflected or moves across the boundary. The rules of photon propagation are expressed as probability distributions for the incremental steps of photon movement between sites of photon—tissue interaction, for the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> in a photon’s trajectory when a scattering event occurs, and for the probability of transmittance or reflectance at boundaries. Monte Carlo light propagation is rigorous yet very descriptive. However, this method is basically statistical in nature and requires a computer to calculate the propagation {{of a large number of}} photons.
