40|$|Abstract: River Mondego is {{the largest}} Portuguese river with its basin entirely within {{national}} territory. The Açude-Ponte dam was built in Mondego in the 80 ’s, along with three other large dams to mitigate floods and to allow the integrated use of river basin water resources for hydroelectric power generation, public supply, industry and irrigation. Considering the river importance for several fish species, namely sea-lamprey and shad, a fishway was constructed. Several structural and hydraulic problems soon revealed that this fishway was inefficient therefore this dam became the first impassable obstacle in the River Mondego. In 2011, {{after several years of}} biological and hydraulic monitoring, and once the reasons for the fishway inefficiency were perfectly identified, a vertical-slot fishway was built to restore river connectivity. The efficiency and effectiveness of the Coimbra Fishway has been studied since 2012 using several monitoring techniques (visual counts, biotelemetry techniques and CPUE abundance with electrofishing). Monitoring results show that several autochthonous species use the fishway, including the diadromous sea-lamprey, <b>allis</b> and twaite <b>shad</b> and European-eel. More than 1, 500. 000 fish have used the fishway during the upstream or downstream migration. PIT telemetry has shown an efficiency of 30 % for Petromyzon marinus and 14 % for Luciobarbus bocagei. Pre and post fishway construction electrofishing monitoring shows improvements in sealamprey larvae abundance both upstream and downstream from the Açude-Ponte dam. Coimbra Fishway project is improving fish migration in River Mondego, but it’s also an integrated project involving other important aspects such as fisheries and river basin management and environmental education. Changes in exploitation regimes of upstream hydropower dams and in the Açude-Ponte are also planned to increase the fishway efficiency. Finally, several activities have been carried out in association with this project to raise public awareness regarding environmental issues, particularly those related with river longitudinal continuity...|$|R
40|$|Tese dout., Ecologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2006 <b>Allis</b> and Twaite <b>shad</b> Alosa spp. are {{anadromous}} clupeid species, {{which still}} migrate into several rivers along Portugal to spawn but {{are regarded as}} Endangered or Vulnerable (using IUCN criteria). Within {{the framework of a}} countrywide research project, this dissertation reports the work carried out (from February 1998 until July 2000) to study the biology and ecology of the early life-history stages of Twaite shad, Alosa fallax fallax, in the River Mira (with a final note on Alosa spp. in the River Guadiana). Twaite shad larvae were more abundant in the surface waters during the day whereas no diel abundance pattern was observed for embryos (i. e. yolk-sac larvae). Furthermore, eggs, embryos and larvae were only found in the upstream stations of River Mira from late-March until mid- June. As expected, no habitat selection occurs at either the egg or embryonic life stages. Conversely, shad larvae abundances were related to several environmental co-variates through a complex non-linear generalised additive model (GAM). Paired translucent and opaque rings in a regularly-recurring sequence deposited around the sagittae of A. fallax fallax were readily visible. The high proportion of sagittae used suggests the usefulness of otolith microstructural analysis to estimate age and to study growth and morality of larvae. Growth and mortality rates varied seasonally (ranging from 0. 36 to 0. 60 mm d - 1 and from 16 to 30 % d - 1, respectively). In a typical year, larvae are in better nutritional condition (RNA/DNA ratio) during two relatively short time-periods, around mid-April and mid to late?May when water temperatures average 22 ?C and levels of prey are 20 nauplii 100 m - 3). The few occurrences of Alosa spp. embryos and larvae in the River Guadiana and the tributary Ribeira de Odeleite precluded sensible analysis.

50|$|The Towy is a {{national}} draw for big sea trout (local name sewin), the seagoing form of the brown trout, Salmo trutta. These fish enter the river each {{spring and early summer}} to breed in the tributaries. The river is thought to produce more double-figure (10lb plus) sea trout than any other in Britain. Anglers and estuary netsmen have taken these fish to over 20 lb (9 kg) in weight. In summer and autumn there is also a substantial run of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In May the Towy has a run of the rare and protected twaite shad (Alosa fallax) and <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa alosa).

In 2014, the first year after a 4 to 5 years period in the sea, hundreds of <b>Allis</b> <b>Shad</b> have been recorded returning to the Rhine system for spawning. In order to form the basis for a future <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> stock in the Rhine, and to develop a natural stock in the long term, monitoring will be continued until at least 2015.

40|$|Prior species {{distribution}} models identified temperature {{as one of}} the most important environmental variables defining the present and future distribution of anadromous <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa alosa). The current study analysed effects of temperature on the recruitment-potential of <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> by investigating growth and survival at 16, 20, 24 and 28 °C during a ten day rearing trial and by measuring mass-specific respiration. Highest growth in length was at 28 °C; growth at 16 °C was minimal. At the end of the rearing-period, no significant differences in survival between tested rearing-temperatures were found. Exposure to temperatures of 13 to 30 °C and subsequent measurement of mass-specific respiration revealed tolerance of temperatures up to 30 °C and a lower temperature limitation close to 16 °C. After acclimatization of larvae to temperatures ranging from 16 − 28 °C for 10 days, Q 10 -values of mass-specific respiration indicated a high adaptive capacity to increasing temperatures, but also the ability to adapt to temperatures as low as 16 °C.

40|$|Background: Wildlife {{repatriation}} {{represents an}} opportunity for parasites. Reintroduced hosts are expected to accumulate generalist parasites via spillover from reservoir hosts, whereas colonization with specialist parasites is unlikely. We {{address the question of}} how myxozoan parasites, which are characterized by a complex life-cycle alternating between annelids and fish, can invade a reintroduced fish species and determine the impact of a de novo invasion on parasite diversity. We investigated the case of the anadromous <b>allis</b> <b>shad,</b> Alosa alosa (L.), which was reintroduced into the Rhine approximately 70 years after its extinction in this river system. Methods: We studied parasites belonging to the Myxozoa (Cnidaria) in 196 <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> from (i) established populations in the French rivers Garonne and Dordogne and (ii) repatriated populations in the Rhine, by screening the first adults returning to spawn in 2014. Following microscopical detection of myxozoan infections general myxozoan primers were used for SSU rDNA amplification and sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses were performed and cloned sequences were analyzed from individuals of different water sources to better understand the diversity and population structure of myxozoan isolates in long-term coexisting vs recently established host-parasite systems. Results: We describe Hoferellus alosae n. sp. from the renal tubules of <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> by use of morphological and molecular methods. A species-specific PCR assay determined that the prevalence of H. alosae n. sp. is 100 % in sexually mature fish in the Garonne/Dordogne river systems and 22 % in the first mature shad returning to spawn in the Rhine. The diversity of SSU rDNA clones of the parasite was up to four times higher in the Rhine and lacked a site-specific signature of SNPs such as in the French rivers. A second myxozoan, Ortholinea sp., was detected exclusively in <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> from the Rhine. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the de novo establishment of myxozoan infections in rivers is slow but of great genetic diversity, which can only be explained by the introduction of spores from genetically diverse sources, predominantly via straying fish or by migratory piscivorous birds. Long-term studies will show if and how the high diversity of a de novo introduction of host-specific myxozoans succeeds into the establishment of a local successful strain in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts...|$|E

Based on these experimental results, a survival model was developed to predict survival rates at different temperatures for embryos and larvae up to 14 days post hatch. The model confirmed that embryonic daily survival is more impacted by temperature than larval survival. The highest survival rates (greater than 80 %) were found for temperatures between 15. 7 and 25. 6 °C for embryos and between 14. 6 and 26. 7 °C for larvae.

Population-level migration and reproduction were studied by counting the number of migrating fish, by estimating the sex ratio, and by counting the number of nocturnal spawning acts for three consecutive years starting in 2000. The influence of the environment, especially water temperature and discharge, was highlighted: temperature during migration may supplant the influence of water flow, although high flow could allow passage over the dam.

These response thresholds are similar to thresholds derived from juvenile American shad (Alosa sapidissima) in previous studies, supporting the suggestion that these members of Alosinae have evolved a dedicated ultrasound detector adapted to detect and respond to approaching echolocating toothed whales...|$|E
40|$|Only {{three cases}} of {{landlocked}} populations of <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa alosa L.) were reported until the present, being {{two of them}} in Portugal. In this paper, data on the feeding habits and condition of these two populations sampled between 1998 and 1999 are presented. Both populations are zooplanktivorous, with cladocerans (Family Daphniidae) and cyclopoid copepods (Cyclops sp.) as the preferential prey for both adults and juveniles from Aguieira reservoir, while in Castelo do Bode adults feed preferentially on calanoid copepods (Copidodiaptomus albidus) and cladocerans (Family Daphniidae). Landlocked adults present lower condition than the migrating ones, while juveniles from the Aguieira reservoir show a better condition than the juveniles captured in the Mondego estuary...|$|E
40|$|The <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa alosa) and the {{twaite shad}} (Alosa fallax) are {{anadromous}} migratory species, which are threatened {{not only in}} Portugal but also in most of their geographic area of distribution. Overfishing and illegal fishing, pollution, physical barriers and river-bed changes {{seem to be the}} main reasons for the populations gradual decline. The progressive reduction in the numbers of anadromous fish registered in the last decades in some Portuguese river basins requires urgent action, namely the implementation of measures to promote the recovery of those populations. The current status of shads populations in Portugal is discussed, and the distribution along the main Portuguese watersheds and major threats to these species are presented, as well...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} past, {{present and future}} of eight {{anadromous}} fish species inhabiting the Lower Rhine (The Netherlands), viz. -sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), whitefish and houting (Coregonus lavaretus, C. oxyrinchus), smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), allis and twaite shad (Alosa alosa, A. fallax), sea trout (Salmo trutta) and salmon (Salmo salar). All species are under threat or became extinct (e. g. sturgeon, <b>allis</b> <b>shad).</b> It {{is not possible to}} single out a specific factor for the decline or disappearance. A combination of factors is responsible, as the degradation of the spawning and nursery areas, river correction for shipping, building of sluices and hydropower dams, extraction of sand and gravel and river pollution. The likelihood that a species will return via natural recovery, or restocking is assessed. The return of the sturgeon is unlikely. Present observations of sturgeon can be attributed to releases of unwanted sturgeon hybrids. A natural stock of coregonids in Dutch waters seems not feasible any more due to irreversible habitat degradation. Present day catches originate from German releases. The anadromous smelt, heavily reduced in numbers, still inhabits some of our waters, the non-migratory smelt is still very common. The <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> is extinct and unlikely to recover. The species never spawned in the Dutch part of the Rhine. Twaite shad, declining in numbers, are still observed in the lower reaches of Rhine and Meuse. Sea trout is presumably still present in the same varying numbers as before. Spawning in our waters has not been documented. The salmon, once fished in large numbers, is now the subject of restocking programmes in Germany. Observations of individuals can partly be attributed to these programmes but also to straying salmon. Restocking programmes should be considerably improved before noticeable success is to be met...|$|E
30|$|Although {{the number}} of fish species has risen over the past 34 years, the species list differs from the one drawn up 100 years ago, since some {{anadromous}} fish such as the <b>allis</b> <b>shad</b> Alosa alosa (L.) and common sturgeon Acipenser sturio L. have been extinct for more than 60 years due to former river contamination (at the beginning of industrialisation), barricades {{along the length of}} the river and intensive fishing [33]. For the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. several reimplementation programmes were established in the late 1990 s to restock populations [34]. This species has still to be found during the electrofishing procedure as the method used is limited to catches along the river banks rather than the middle of the river, and {{the number of}} returning S. salar is still low [30].|$|E
