5000|$|Lanikai Beach {{is located}} in Lanikai, a {{community}} {{in the town of}} Kailua and on the windward coast of Oahu, Hawaii. The name Lanikai means [...] "heavenly sea." [...] This small ½ mile strip of beach is consistently ranked among the best beaches in the world. Adjacent to Lanikai Beach is a primarily upper-class residential area because of this it is accessible through public beach access paths. Although the beach itself is public property, it is not state land and is not a county beach park like many beaches in Hawaii. There is no public parking lot and the area lacks facilities like restrooms, showers or lifeguards. As of July 1, 2014, parking violation fines have increased from $35 to $200 {{in an effort to keep}} people from illegally parking in the residential area surrounding the beach accesses. Parking violations are strictly enforced and include, but are not limited to, no parking within four feet of a driveway entrance or <b>apron,</b> <b>blocking</b> the unimproved pedestrian right of way (where a sidewalk would normally be), within 30 feet of a stop sign, within ten feet of a fire hydrant, or on or within 20 feet of a crosswalk.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As for jacket {{dragging}} load-out foundations, {{the concrete}} skidway blocks were prone to be sheared and wrecked, especially the outer blocks, for they generally swung with the tugboat. This paper takes dragging load-out of LS 36 - 1 jacket on 3 # skidway for example, and proposes a design analysis for dock <b>apron</b> skidway <b>blocks.</b> The design philosophy is replacing original concrete blocks with steel blocks, {{and the new}} steel blocks not only have good shear strength and compressive strength, {{but they are also}} easier to connect and fix with skidway. In addition, some essential strengthen measures are adopted, reformed 3 # skidway blocks are ready for much heavier modules and jackets dragging load-out works...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite the firmly {{established}} occupational risk {{of exposure to}} X-rays, they are used extensively in spine surgeries. Shielding by lead aprons {{is the most common}} protective practice. We quantified the level of their radiation blocking ability in a real-life setting. Methods: Single-center, prospective, randomized study of adult patients with degenerative lumbar disorders, scheduled to undergo posterior lumbar interbody fusion. Instrumentation was performed in either a robot-assisted, minimally invasive approach (RO) or a conventional, fluoroscopically-assisted, open approach (FA). Outcome measures included the quantitative measurement of the surgeon’s actual exposure to radiation, as recorded by thermo-luminescent dosimeters (TLD) worn both above and under the 0. 5 mm thyroid and trunk lead protectors. Findings: Sixty four patients were included in this study, 34 in the RO cohort and 30 in the FA cohort. The radiation <b>blocked</b> by the <b>aprons,</b> represented as the ratio of the under-apron to above-apron TLDs, averaged 37. 1 % (range 25. 4 – 48. 3 %, 95 % confidence interval between 30. 6 – 43. 6 %). In the RO cohort, the average per-screw radiation dose and time were 51. 9 % and 73. 7 % lower, respectively, than the per screw exposure in the FA cohort. Interpretation: The 0. 5 mm lead <b>aprons</b> <b>blocked</b> just over one third of the radiation scattered towards the surgeon. Use of robotic-guidance in a minimally invasive approach provided for a reduction of 62. 5 % of the overall radiation the surgeon was exposed to during open conventional approach. We conclude that reduced radiation use (e. g. by using robotic guidance) is a more effective strategy for minimizing exposure to radiation than reliance on protection by lead aprons, and recommend utilization of practices and technologies that reduce the surgical team’s routine exposure to X-rays...|$|R

40|$|Upper Turonian-Santonian limestones {{at three}} island {{locations}} (Ist, Silba and Premuda) {{in the southwestern}} part of the Adriatic carbonate platform, record slope deposition based on their sedimentological and palaeontological characteristics. These Upper Cretaceous successions consist of three vertically superimposed lithotypes: (1) pelagic mudstonespackstones, (2) laminated pelagic wackestones-packstones, and (3) bioclastic floatstones-rudstones to packstonesgrainstones with fossils of shallow marine organisms. According to {{the proximity of the}} shallow water carbonate platform interior the depositional setting of the slope deposits could be identified as relatively more proximal or distal. The proximal part is characterized by non laminated pelagic limestones with resedimented bioclastic limestones, while the more distal parts have both laminated and nonlaminated pelagic limestones with rare resedimented bioclastic limestones. The resedimented bioclastic limestones represent slope apron deposits. Locally, at Premuda Island, the slope <b>apron</b> includes <b>blocks</b> of laminated pelagic limestones. The depositional environments of the Ist and Premuda profiles could be interpreted as of more distal origin, while those of the Silba profile represents a more proximal part of the slope. </p...|$|R
40|$|The NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer {{has just}} {{completed}} a successful 2010 field season, including its first partnership-building mission to Indonesia, INDEX-SATAL 2010 (Indonesia Exploration Sangihe-Talaud region). The mission was part of President Obama’s initiative to build science and technology partnerships with Muslim nations. The Okeanos Explorer is equipped with progressive technology, including a Kongsberg EM 302 (30 kHz) multibeam system with bottom backscatter and water column backscatter data collection capabilities. The mapping in the Sangihe-Talaud region of the Celebes Sea produced over 31, 000 square kilometers of high resolution data, ranging in depth from 244 meters to more than 7000 meters. The mapped regions include {{the majority of the}} western side of the central Sangihe volcanic arc and a narrow transect across the arc in the south. A ~ 350 km long transect across the northern end of the central Sangihe arc was also mapped, north of the Talaud Islands, and extends eastward across the Sangihe Basin and Molucca Trench to the Philippine Trench. A recent synthesis of deep marine data by Pubellier et al. (2005) 1 documents numerous active and inactive subduction zones of opposite polarity in this narrow region. The high resolution bathymetry reveals new details of the seafloor morphology in this complex tectonic regime. At least five seamounts were mapped, including an unknown 1500 meter high seamount and the volcano Kawio Barat, which rises approximately 3500 meters from the seafloor and is the site of white smokers and surprisingly dense and diverse deepwater biological communities. Several additional features were observed, including submarine channels, fans, debris <b>aprons</b> with <b>blocks</b> up to 800 meters in diameter, accretionary ridges and basins, trenches, and some flat topped seamounts. These well-defined features are consistent with the complex interactions between arc development, mass wasting, and subduction. These data provide new opportunities for further exploration in the Sangihe-Talaud region and work is already underway by regional experts in geology, geophysics, biology, and biogeography to use the Okeanos Explorer’s data to investigate the geological processes and biological diversity in this region...|$|R
40|$|Carbonate slope {{development}} {{north of}} Little Bahama Bank (LBB) {{has been investigated}} via a seismic stratigraphic analysis of approximately 1350 km of air-gun seismic reflection profiles. Slope development is shown to be complex be-cause of the interaction of slope accretion, sediment bypassing, and submarine erosion to produce a single open-ocean carbonate slope. The present slope north of LBB did not develop until after the complete drowning of the southern Blake Plateau {{near the end of}} the Cretaceous. Beginning in the early Tertiary and continuing through the present, this slope has accreted laterally by the accumulation of periplatform oozes along its upper slope, whereas submarine slides and sediment gravity flows have bypassed the upper slope, resulting in a lower slope <b>apron</b> of slide <b>blocks,</b> turbidites, and debris flows. Slope sedimentation north of LBB was more or less continuous, with the exception of a late Oligocene erosional event that may be correlative with the "Au " unconformity in the western North Atlantic. Overall, slope accretion, sediment bypassing, and submarine erosion have acted together during plate tectonic drift to higher latitudes, numerous sea-level fluctuations, and local tectonics to produce a single, open-ocean carbonate slope. This area is well-suited for future Deep Sea Drilling Project drill sites to evaluate the demise of a shallow-water carbonate platform and subsequent carbonate slope development...|$|R
40|$|Present {{study is}} an effort to assess the {{composite}} effect of limestone aggregate and blast furnace slag on the mechanical characteristics of normal and high weight concrete at various structural units (barrage girders, main weir and <b>block</b> <b>apron)</b> of New Khanki Barrage Project, Punjab. Mix designs for different concrete classes falling under the domain of high and normal weight concrete were prepared after aggregate quality testing. On attaining satisfactory results of quality testing nine concrete mixes were designed (three for each class: A 1, A and B) by absolute volume method (ACI- 211. 1). The required compressive strength of normal and high strength was set at 6200, 5200 and 4200 Psi for the concrete types A 1, A and B respectively after 28 days (ACI - 318). For compressive strength assessment, a total 27 concrete cylinders were casted (9 -cylinders for each mix) and were water cured. The achieved average UCS of cylinder concrete specimens at 3, 7 and 28 days are 5170, 6338 and 7320 Psi for A 1 – type, 3210, 4187 and 5602 Psi for A-type and 2650, 3360 and 4408 Psi for B- type mix. It has been found that all concrete mixes for suggested classes attained target strength at age of 7 -days. The coarse aggregate (Margala Hill limestone) and fine aggregates (from Lawrancepur /Qibla Bandi quarries) used in all concrete mix designs have demonstrated a sound mechanical suitability for high and normal weight concrete. ...|$|R
