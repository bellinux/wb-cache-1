25|$|Samuel Pepys {{recorded}} {{in his diary}} for 13 April 1661: To Whitehall to the Banquet House and there saw the King heale, {{the first time that}} ever I saw him do it— which he did with great gravity; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be an ugly office and a simple one. John Evelyn also refers to the ceremony in his Diary on the dates of 6 July 1660 and 28 March 1684.|$|E
500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} the episode [...] "was 30 Rocks best episode of the season , if not the best episode ever from this young series." [...] Canning also said that [...] "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock. It was also an episode that once again proved the {{character}} of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half-hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." [...] Canning rated this episode [...] "9.5 out of 10." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that [...] "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell juuuuuuust a bit short. It's {{almost as if the}} funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by [...] Wiig in the Lifetime movie." [...] He thought that [...] "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Overall, [...] another splendid [...] My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like the show was trying to have its cake and eat it, too." ...|$|E
60|$|Irene smiled. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> Soames {{that she}} was mocking him.|$|R
60|$|Again he stopped, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> us {{watching}} that he smiled a little.|$|R
60|$|I flushed furiously, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> burn {{me through}} the lining of my pocket.|$|R
2500|$|... "We went to Pendlebury in 1909 from a {{residential}} side of Manchester, and we didn't like it. My father {{wanted to go}} to get near a friend for business reasons. We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. Then I began to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1940 he got {{the lead}} role in Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role {{propelled}} him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: [...] "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in Pal Joey—recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{had heard}} those words from him before.|$|E
50|$|Material of {{this species}} has been dated to 750-2850 years before present, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been widely {{distributed}} throughout Madagascar. It was estimated to have gone extinct c.1200 AD. However remains with disputed dating have suggested that some survived up until at least 1500 AD, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have survived a considerable time in coexistence with humans, before it finally died out.|$|R
60|$|Still he stood, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{her that}} her father's gaze pierced to her secret soul.|$|R
60|$|A cañon night-hawk voiced his lonely, weird, and melancholy cry, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> pierce <b>and</b> {{mark the}} silence.|$|R
60|$|At these ominous {{words the}} envoys shivered, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that their faces {{for a moment}} turned grey.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her white, drawn face, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I might carry her yet. I spluttered for words.|$|E
60|$|He {{returned}} my glance, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that there}} was some hidden meaning in his eyes which I failed to catch.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her {{steadily}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> her that his eyes were on fire with evil things.|$|R
60|$|The fellow had slunk up {{like the}} great cat he was. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> Winton that Gyp had winced.|$|R
60|$|Virginia <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> find speech impossible, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{him that}} he could see the tears {{gathering}} in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't LIKE him," [...] {{said the}} {{official}} conclusively, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{at the time}} he was just blind prejudice speaking....|$|E
60|$|He ceased. His face I saw distinctly, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{white and}} terrible and proud and strangely noble. I thought of Milton's Satan.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} your counsel, Wife, so now begone!" [...] said Umslopogaas, {{looking at her}} very strangely, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> not without fear.|$|E
60|$|It is man's nature <b>to</b> soar intellectually, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} his {{ambition}} from earliest ages to soar physically.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she kissed}} the child, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> do him good; for {{he smiled and}} nestled closely into her bosom.|$|R
50|$|Women {{as young}} as 14 years old have {{developed}} the malignant form <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be more aggressive in younger women.|$|R
60|$|She was nervously {{playing with}} the {{fastening}} of her umbrella, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that her silence was purposeful. I ventured some remark about the weather, which she interrupted ruthlessly.|$|E
6000|$|Something arrested my attention. I had {{discovered}} among these needles {{a number of}} little round objects. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that one of these}} had moved. [...] "Cavor," [...] I whispered.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke in}} little, sharp, jerky outbursts, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{to speak at}} all was very painful to him, and that his will all through was {{overriding}} his inclinations.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the longest}} speech I had ever heard the man make, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> impress Bill. He was quite humble.|$|R
60|$|He {{preserved}} the conversational manner of polite society, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> Lucy {{that she would}} never have the strength to get beyond.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brumley {{looked at}} her flushed and tender face <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> him that indeed he could die for her quite easily.|$|R
60|$|Instantly half an hundred rifles were discharged, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as {{if every}} {{feathered}} head went down, after which the scene was obscured from view by clouds of sulphurous smoke.|$|E
60|$|Kenton sat like {{a statue}} {{in the center}} of the canoe, we lads being at either end, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if a full hour passed before a word was spoken.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. They {{were found}} {{floating}} near the margin by a park-keeper. They {{have been identified}} as her clothes, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off." ...|$|E
50|$|In fact, {{the sound}} of Clifford Taylor's music might indeed be mistaken for some by Copland, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have used similarcompositional processes.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{him that}} the wraith of Swanhild {{kissed him on the}} brow, sighed and vanished, bearing the rat in her bosom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indefinitely!" [...] said Roderick; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> his {{companion}} that the tone {{in which he}} said this made it immensely well worth hearing.|$|R
