50|$|Dynamic verbs have duration. They occur over time. This {{time may}} or may not have <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> endpoint, and {{may or may}} not yet have occurred.

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>defined</b> benefit {{pension plan}} {{is a type of}} pension plan in which an employer/sponsor {{promises}} a specified pension payment, lump-sum (or combination thereof) on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns. Traditionally, many governmental and public entities, as well as a large number of corporations, provided defined benefit plans, sometimes as a means of compensating workers in lieu of increased pay. <b>A</b> <b>defined</b> benefit plan is 'defined' {{in the sense that the}} benefit formula is defined and known in advance. Conversely, for a [...] "defined contribution retirement saving plan", the formula for computing the employer's and employee's contributions is defined and known in advance, but the benefit to be paid out is not known in advance. In the United States, [...] specifies <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> benefit plan to be any pension plan that is not <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> contribution plan where <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> contribution {{plan is a}}ny plan with individual accounts. A traditional pension plan that <b>defines</b> <b>a</b> benefit for an employee upon that employee's retirement is <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> benefit plan.|$|R

5|$|Although The Castafiore Emerald {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for making its characters follow a lead of false trails, {{it was not}} a commercial success due to the experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Flight 714 to Sydney, while the series itself became <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their wants {{and needs to be}} met and exhibit <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> lack of impulse control. With age, {{developing}} children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1590s, his championing of native Scottish {{tradition}} {{was reduced to}} some extent by the increasing likelihood of his succession to the English throne. William Alexander and other courtier poets started to anglicise their written language, and followed the king to London after 1603. James's role as active literary participant and patron made him <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> figure in many respects for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which reached a pinnacle of achievement in his reign, but his patronage of the high style in the Scottish tradition, which included his ancestor James I of Scotland, became largely sidelined.|$|E

5|$|During her directorship, Cosima opposed {{theatrical}} innovations and adhered {{closely to}} Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> feature of Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which closely followed {{her death in}} 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.|$|E
5|$|Following on from Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E
5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis {{on the history}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E

30|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of {{increasing}} the retirement age in two economies with overlapping generations and within cohort ex ante heterogeneity. The first economy has <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> benefit system, and the second economy is in transition from <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> benefit to <b>a</b> <b>defined</b> contribution. We find that if increase in the retirement age is phased {{in a way that}} allows agents to adjust, welfare is not reduced and welfare effects have a similar magnitude and between-cohort distribution in both types of the pension systems.|$|R

5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is <b>a</b> <b>defining</b> feature of the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which {{is not unusual for}} Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
