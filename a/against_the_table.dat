25|$|The {{two were}} so {{successful}} at spoon bending that several other tests were invented. In one {{they were given}} pictures in sealed envelopes and then asked to try to identify them from a list shown to them later. The two were left alone {{in a room with}} the envelopes, and although there was a possibility that they would peek, {{this was supposed to be}} controlled by examining the envelopes later. The envelopes were held closed with four staples, which they simply pried open with their fingernails, looked at the picture, and then resealed by inserting the staples back into the same holes and forcing them closed by pressing them <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally I think it is a sign he has got other things on his mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E

50|$|When {{applying}} PICRUSt to a 16S rRNA gene library, PICRUSt matches reference operational taxonomic units <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> and retrieves a predicted 16S rRNA {{copy number}} and gene copy number for each gene family. The abundance of each OTU is divided by its predicted copy number (if a bacterium has multiple 16S copies, its apparent abundance in 16S rRNA {{data will be}} inflated), and then multiplied by the copy number of the gene family. This gives a prediction for the contribution of each OTU to the overall gene content of the sample (the metagenome). Finally, these individual contributions are summed together to produce {{an estimate of the}} genes present in the metagenome.|$|R
