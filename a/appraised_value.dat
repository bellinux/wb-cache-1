Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the company could repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the <b>appraised</b> <b>value</b> would be accepted.

40|$|An {{appraisal}} task {{involves the}} rendering of market value, an unobservable and hypothetical construct. Direct feedback against this objective is typically not possible, so alternative feedback such as confirmation of previous <b>appraised</b> <b>values</b> may be employed. This may alter the appraiser’s {{perception of the}} valuation objective leading to divergence from the appraisal normative model. The real estate literature suggests appraisers have been susceptible {{to the influence of}} previous <b>appraised</b> <b>values,</b> often resulting in biased valuations.

40|$|This paper compares <b>appraised</b> hotel <b>values</b> of Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) {{properties}} in the American Southwest (2 ̆ 2 Oil Patch 2 ̆ 2 states) with their respective market values. The RTC was given the task of having hotel properties appraised and subsequently auctioned for sale. However, RTC officials were aware they had limited time and funding for their operations. Consequently, RTC officials faced {{a significant amount of}} political pressure to sell non-performing assets quickly, particularly in the Oil Patch where banking problems were especially severe. Given these circumstances, the RTC may have been motivated to influence <b>appraised</b> hotel <b>values</b> downward to sell more assets faster. The results of this paper indicate <b>appraised</b> hotel <b>values</b> to be lower than their market values in the region. Moreover, the differences between <b>appraised</b> <b>values</b> and market values were significantly more negative in the Oil Patch than in other regions...|$|R
25|$|Since those {{involved}} with the production {{had no idea of}} the future value of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure. Nine other puppets—including Santa and young Rudolph—were given to a secretary, who gave them to family members. Eventually seven were discarded. In 2005, the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their <b>appraised</b> <b>value</b> was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic. Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005; in 2007, he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project. The figures have been shown at conventions since then.|$|E
25|$|The bank offered {{loans to}} income-producing manor owners (about 70–80% of total loans) or {{property}} owners in cities. Long-term loans were paid not in cash, but in mortgage bonds which provided for a fixed annual interest to their holders. Initially, that interest was 6%. Twice a year, the borrowers {{had to pay}} the interest to mortgage bond holders plus 1% administrative fee to the bank. This fee was lowered several times and in 1900s it was 0.25% for manor owners and 0.5% for city residents. The loans were provided for only up to 60% of the <b>appraised</b> <b>value</b> of the mortgaged real estate. The terms of the long-term loans varied over the years. Initially, the loans for manor owners were offered for 43.5, 48.67, or 54.5 years. More terms were added later, the longest being 66.17 years. The loan terms for city residents were shorter: initially up to 27.5 years and later up to 38.33 years. Most borrowers (more than 80% in 1912–1914) opted for the longest possible loans. Short-term loans, for one to three years, were available only for up to 10% of the appraised real estate value.|$|E

Measurements of sunk costs typically use <b>appraised</b> <b>values</b> of capital. In food and agricultural industries facing asset obsolescence due to government policy, <b>appraised</b> <b>values</b> may be greatly overstated and this has implications for research on industrial structure. A theoretical model to account for the appraisal error is developed and the method is applied to the U. S. sugar beet industry. The sugar beet industry displays symptoms of asset obsolescence.

40|$|In this study, {{we provide}} new {{evidence}} on the performance measurement and reporting of commercial real estate returns. We do so by examining the accuracy of commercial real-estate appraisals that occurred prior to the sale of properties from the NCREIF National Property Index (“NPI”) during 1984 – 2010, a period which spans two up-and-down cycles of the market. We find that, on average, appraisals are more than 10 % above, or below, subsequent sales prices that take place two quarters following the appraisal. Even in a portfolio context, allowing for offsetting positive and negative differences, appraisals are off {{by an average of}} 5 % of value. We also provide new evidence regarding how, and by how much, <b>appraised</b> <b>values</b> lag behind sales prices.

500|$|Cox often filed {{fraudulent}} mortgage documents, and {{in several}} cases was able to mortgage properties for five to six times their actual worth. In this practice, known as [...] "shotgunning" [...] {{in the real estate}} community, Cox either himself forged or had accomplices attain inflated appraisals to increase the value of the mortgages. One of his accomplices was a detention officer, who acquired 14 properties worth nearly $600,000, while making $35,568 a year in his job. Cox took advantage of the Hillsborough County school district by selling it a property for much more than its <b>appraised</b> <b>value,</b> and arranged financing on a $90,000 house for future Florida Representative Janet Cruz. He recorded that sale for $233,000, and hired Cruz to do some rezoning research. Cruz claims she was unaware he inflated the sale price, and that she was never paid for her research. When a female accomplice rented a house in Pinellas County as part of Cox's schemes, then faked ownership of the property, the owner found out about the fraud. A title company manager had become suspicious of a loan Cox's accomplice was applying for on the house and called the property's real owner. The Clearwater Police department was contacted, and they began an investigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a quantifying model that predicts the <b>appraised</b> unit <b>value</b> of parcels in San Francisco County based on number of LEED-NC Public Transportation Access (PTA) qualified bus, light rail and commuter rail stops, distance to closest bus, light rail and commuter rail stops, zoning class and parcel size. As a population of interest, San Francisco County was chosen since it is known as a region having well-organized transportation systems including bus, light rail and commuter rail systems. According to the correlation results, for mixed zone, an <b>appraised</b> unit <b>value</b> increases as the number of LEED qualified transit stops increases (bus, light rail, and commuter rail). In addition, the <b>appraised</b> unit <b>value</b> increases as the distance to LEED qualified bus stops light rail stops decreases. For residential zone, the <b>appraised</b> unit <b>value</b> increases as the number of LEED qualified bus and light rail stations increases. Furthermore, the <b>appraised</b> unit <b>value</b> increases as the distance to LEED qualified bus stops decreases. When it comes to the predictive regression model for mixed zone, the adjusted R-square of the transformed model was 0. 713, which indicates that 71. 3 percent variability in transformed unit value of parcels could be explained by these variables. In addition, for the predictive model of residential zone, the adjusted R-square for the model was 0. 622 thus the independent variables together accounted for 62. 2 percent variability in the transformed unit value of parcels. The predicting models for mixed and residential zones were significant that suggests that the components of LEED-NC PTA criteria, number and distance from parcels, this could affect land development strategies. In addition, an <b>appraised</b> unit <b>value</b> of parcels in San Francisco County can be estimated by using the predictive models developed in this study. Therefore, the findings of this study could encourage real-estate developers to site their projects according to the LEED-NC PTA criteria...|$|R
