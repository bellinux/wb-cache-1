5|$|Kemp {{became the}} {{starting}} right fielder in 2008. He hit his first career grand slam off of Mark Redman on April 26 against the Colorado Rockies. Kemp drove {{in the first}} run of the game for the Dodgers, <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> {{in the first inning}} that scored Juan Pierre.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals scored one run in {{both the}} second and third innings on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Mike Matheny to score Jim Edmonds and a home run to right field by Walker, respectively. However, {{in the bottom of the}} third, the Red Sox scored three runs after seven {{consecutive}} batters reached base, giving them a five-run lead. Dan Haren came in from the Cardinals' bullpen to replace Williams during the inning.|$|E
5|$|After {{six innings}} of {{allowing}} no earned runs – {{which gave him}} a total of 13 innings against the Yankees and Cardinals with only one earned run allowed on a torn ankle tendon – Schilling made way for Alan Embree, who pitched a scoreless seventh. Mike Timlin replaced Embree in the eighth, in which <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Scott Rolen reduced the Red Sox lead to four. Keith Foulke then came in to strike out Jim Edmonds to end the inning and also pitched the ninth to end the game. For the second game in a row, the Red Sox won despite committing four fielding errors.|$|E
25|$|October 11 vs. Red Sox: In Game 2 of the ALCS, B.J. Upton hit <b>a</b> walk-off <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> off of Mike Timlin {{with the}} bases loaded and one out, scoring Fernando Perez from third base.|$|R
5000|$|But, {{the move}} paid off. Lyle shut the Royals {{down for the}} {{remaining}} [...] innings, allowing only two hits and no runners past second base. The Yankees added insurance in the ninth on <b>a</b> Munson <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Freeman had <b>an</b> NL-leading nine <b>sacrifice</b> <b>flies</b> {{along with}} batting [...]259 with 33 doubles, 23 home runs, and 94 RBI in 147 games played.|$|R
5|$|On May 20, 2006, Barrett was {{involved}} in an infamous altercation with A. J. Pierzynski during the Chicago Crosstown Classic between the Chicago White Sox and Cubs. During the game's second inning, Brian Anderson hit <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> which allowed Pierzynski to score the game's first run. Pierzynski collided with Barrett en route to home plate, causing Barrett to fall down. Pierzynski showed his enthusiasm by slapping home plate. As Pierzynski got up, he bumped into Barrett, who proceeded to punch him. Scott Podsednik came to Pierzynski's aid and subdued Barrett. Anderson and John Mabry eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and stormed the field.|$|E
5|$|The Braves scored {{their fifth}} {{run in the}} eighth as Del Crandall hit a one-out triple and then scored on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Mantilla. Don Demeter pinch hit for Churn, the pitcher, in {{the bottom half of}} the inning but the Dodgers were put out in order. Sandy Koufax pitched the top of the ninth for the Dodgers and though he loaded the bases with three {{successive}} walks to Aaron, Torre, and DeMerit he did not allow any runs. Moon and Snider led off the bottom of the frame with successive singles. Bob Lillis pinch ran for Snider and Gil Hodges hit another single to load the bases. Don McMahon relieved Burdette, but allowed a fourth consecutive single to Norm Larker which scored Moon, Lillis, and advanced Hodges to third leaving the score 5–4. Warren Spahn relieved McMahon, Carl Furillo pinch hit for Roseboro, and Joe Pignatano pinch ran for Larker. Furillo tied the game, hitting <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> which scored Hodges. Spahn allowed a single to Wills and was pulled in favor of Joey Jay. Ron Fairly grounded out as a pinch hitter and Gilliam flew out, leaving the game tied at five runs apiece and forcing extra innings.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{responded in}} the top of the 9th, scoring their only runs of the game. Kevin Tapani allowed {{successive}} singles to Brent Mayne and Mueller to open the inning before Terry Mulholland relieved him. Stan Javier singled to score Mayne and Ellis Burks then walked to load the bases. Bonds came to bat with the bases loaded for the second time in the game and lined out to deep right field, scoring Mueller on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> and Javier advanced to third base. Rod Beck entered and got successive outs by Jeff Kent, which scored Javier, and Joe Carter to end the game 5–3 for the Cubs.|$|E
5000|$|August 21: Detroit {{completed}} {{a sweep of}} the Indians in dramatic fashion. With an 8-7 lead and José Valverde's consecutive saves streak on the line, center fielder Austin Jackson gunned down Cleveland's Kosuke Fukudome at the plate on <b>a</b> would-be <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> for the final out of the game.|$|R
50|$|The NL {{regained the}} lead on <b>a</b> bases-loaded <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Parker {{in the second and}} an RBI groundout by Dave Winfield in the third. The AL went back up 5-4 {{in the bottom of the}} third when Carl Yastrzemski batted in a run with a single and Chet Lemon scored on a Schmidt error.|$|R
50|$|After being outrighted to Triple-A in 2011, Santos {{was given}} an {{invitation}} to spring training as a non-roster player. He {{did not make the}} opening day roster, but was called up to the Tigers on May 30, 2012 after injuries to Alex Avila and Gerald Laird. On June 2, 2012, Omir Santos had <b>a</b> walk-off <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> to beat the New York Yankees.|$|R
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first with}} an Alex Rodriguez walk opening {{the bottom of}} the second inning {{followed}} by a two-run home run by designated hitter Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a triple by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> from Jimmy Rollins {{in the top of the}} third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with the bases loaded in {{the bottom of the}} third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was replaced defensively in the top of the fourth by Jerry Hairston, Jr.|$|E
5|$|The game {{then became}} a pitcher's duel; Maglie and Newcombe did not allow a hit in {{the third or fourth}} innings. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled on a bunt, and Thomson hit a double, but the score {{remained}} 1–0 through five innings. Duke Snider singled in the sixth inning, but was caught stealing second. Neither team got another hit until the seventh inning. Rube Walker singled for the Dodgers, and Monte Irvin led off the bottom of the seventh with a double for the Giants. He reached third base after a bunt, and scored on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Thomson, tying the score at one run each.|$|E
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
50|$|The goal of each batter is {{to become}} a base runner himself (by a base hit, a base on balls, being hit by the pitch, a fielding error, or fielder's choice) or to help move other base runners along (by another base hit, <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> bunt, <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> or hit and run).|$|R
25|$|The Red Sox {{did not go}} quietly, scoring {{two runs}} on a Dwight Evans single and <b>a</b> Dave Henderson <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> in the eighth inning, {{but it was not}} enough, and the Mets evened the series at two games apiece.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> is {{credited}} even if another runner is put out on appeal {{for failing to}} tag up, so long as a run scores prior to the third out. In {{the case of a}} fly ball dropped for <b>an</b> error, the <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> is only credited if the official scorer believes the run would have scored had the ball been caught.|$|R
5|$|Now {{trailing}} by five runs, the Angels threatened {{again in}} the eighth inning with runners on second and third, but Hudler grounded out to end the threat. In the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners again had the bases loaded when Tino Martinez singled to score Edgar Martínez, followed by a Dan Wilson double that scored Jay Buhner and Blowers, and finally <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> double play hit by Cora that scored Tino Martinez but got Wilson thrown out at third. Tony Phillips led off the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} pitch thrown by Harvey, Alcides Escobar hit an inside-the-park home run, {{the first in a}} World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series, and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series. In the fourth inning, Murphy {{recorded}} the Mets' first hit, and later scored their first run on a hit by Travis d'Arnaud. Curtis Granderson hit a home run in the fifth inning to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The Mets took a 3–1 lead {{in the top of the}} sixth when Michael Conforto drove in Yoenis Céspedes with <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b> Mike Moustakas then saved a run with a diving stop and throw out to first to end the top of the sixth. Eric Hosmer reduced the lead to 3–2 with <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> and set a new Royals' postseason run batted in (RBI) record in the process. A single by Moustakas tied the game at three, but in the top of the eighth, Wilmer Flores reached on an fielding error by Hosmer, allowing Juan Lagares to score the go-ahead run and give the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the ninth with the Mets 2 outs away from taking Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game for the Royals with a home run to deep center field, as Jeurys Familia blew his first save in six postseason opportunities and his first since July 30. With the home run, Gordon became the first player since Scott Brosius in the 2001 World Series, and just the fifth player in history, to tie a World Series game on a home run in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first when}} Matsui hit a two-run home run with Rodriguez on base after a walk. The Phillies {{responded with a}} triple by Ruiz, who scored on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Rollins {{in the top of}} the third inning. Matsui added to the Yankee lead with a bases-loaded single in the bottom of the inning, scoring Jeter and Damon. Martínez was {{relieved}} after four innings by Durbin, who allowed a ground rule double to Jeter, who later scored on a Teixeira single. Durbin hit Rodriguez and was relieved by Happ after recording one out. Happ allowed a two-run double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth RBI of the game which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by Bobby Richardson in the 1960 World Series.|$|E
50|$|In Game 2, 17-game winner Carl Pavano {{started for}} the Twins, hoping to even the series. Pavano faced the Yankee veteran Andy Pettitte. Like in Game 1, the Twins struck first {{in the second inning}} when Delmon Young scored on <b>a</b> Danny Valencia <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|R
50|$|Looking for a comeback, the Tigers got two back on an Austin Jackson {{home run}} {{in the top of the}} fifth, chasing Holland, but the Rangers {{answered}} with <b>a</b> Josh Hamilton <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> in the bottom of the fifth to make it 10-4 Rangers.|$|R
5000|$|Kris Johnson, the Carp's {{starting}} pitcher, {{allowed one}} run in [...] innings pitched, while Hokkaido's Shohei Otani allowed three runs in six innings. Hiroshima's Ryuhei Matsuyama and Brad Eldred both hit home runs off of Otani {{in the fourth}} inning, while Hokkaido's Brandon Laird {{hit a home run}} in the seventh inning. Hiroshima responded in the seventh inning with a run batted in (RBI) single by Yoshihiro Maru and <b>a</b> RBI <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Eldred.|$|R
5|$|The series {{then moved}} to Shibe Park in Philadelphia for Game 3, where Martin had two hits, {{including}} a double and scored twice in a 5-2 Cardinals' victory over Grove. In Game 4, he produced the only two hits by the Cardinals as they lost to Earnshaw, 3-0. Martin almost single-handedly provided the offense for the Cardinals in Game 5, driving home four runs with two singles, a home run and <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly,</b> as the Cardinals triumphed 5-1. Although he was held hitless {{in the final two}} games of the series, he made an impressive catch to extinguish an Athletics two-run rally in the ninth inning of Game 7 to end the game and clinch the world championship for the Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920 season, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was grandfathered in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28, his wife died suddenly, and he was given some time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. Nearly three months later, he was the starting pitcher against the New York Yankees on August 16. In the game, Coveleski hit <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> to help the Indians win, 4–3, but it was best remembered as the game where Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Ray Chapman, leading to the only death in MLB history from a pitch. He finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA to Bob Shawkey.|$|E
5|$|Granderson and Daniel Murphy {{were the}} two most {{productive}} hitters in the Mets lineup during their 2015 postseason run to the World Series. While Murphy cooled off in the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Granderson {{continued to be a}} consistent threat for the Mets out of the leadoff spot and also had three home runs and five RBIs in that World Series. In Game 1, after the Royals tied the game in the ninth inning with a home run off Mets closer Jeurys Familia, Granderson made an excellent leaping catch with nobody out {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning, off the bat of the Royals fastest runner Jarrod Dyson, preventing what would have at least been a lead off triple and likely saving the game at the time, though the Royals would go on to win the game anyway in the bottom of the 14th inning on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Eric Hosmer. Throughout the series, playing right field, Granderson played the most consistent and solid defense of any Mets fielder.|$|E
50|$|Back home at Memorial Stadium, local {{baseball}} coach Mary Dobkin {{threw out the}} ceremonial first pitch. The Oriole bats continued to be unexpectedly cold as John Candelaria and Jim Palmer locked into a scoreless duel through six innings. Dave Parker broke the ice with a RBI single in the seventh, followed by <b>a</b> Stargell <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b> The Pirates added two more runs in the eighth on a Bill Robinson sac fly and a RBI single by Omar Moreno.|$|R
50|$|It {{was over}} in a hurry. Bob Meusel's two-run triple and <b>a</b> Wally Pipp <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> made it 3-0. Then the Yankees got four more in the second, Joe Dugan's three-run inside-the-park homer the big blow. Bullet Joe Bush {{surrendered}} just three hits to the Giants, who now faced elimination.|$|R
50|$|Game 1 pitted ace {{pitchers}} Catfish Hunter for the A's and Mickey Lolich for the Tigers, and, as expected, {{both were}} brilliant. Norm Cash homered {{to give the}} Tigers a 1-0 lead in the second inning, and the A's tied it in the third on <b>a</b> Joe Rudi <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Reds won Game 3 after scoring seven {{runs in the}} top of {{the third}} inning off of Mike Moore. Pitcher Tom Browning earned the win for Cincinnati, as the game ended at a score of 8–3. The Athletics took a lead in Game 4, as Carney Lansford hit a single that scored Willie McGee from second base. In the eighth inning, however, the Reds loaded the bases after singles by Barry Larkin and Herm Winningham, and an error that allowed Paul O'Neill to reach base. Larkin scored on a groundout and Winningham scored on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> to give Cincinnati the lead, 2–1. The lead held, as Myers came in for Rijo after one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Reds became World Series {{champion}}s. Bates did not play in either game. As with all players on the World Series champion Reds, Bates received a World Series ring and visited the White House.|$|E
5|$|The score {{remained}} the same through the fourth inning. Fogg was relieved by Taylor Buchholz {{in the top of}} the fifth and, following a double by Tulowitzki, Peavy allowed the game-tying run to score on a Holliday single. Seth Smith, pinch hitting for the pitcher in the bottom of the sixth, hit a triple and then scored on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> by Matsui to give the Rockies a 6–5 lead. The Rockies' Garrett Atkins appeared to homer in the bottom of the seventh, extending the Rockies lead, but umpires ruled that the ball hit padding on the outfield wall, which was still in play, and awarded Atkins a double. Jamey Carroll pinch ran for Atkins, but no runs scored in the inning. The Rockies brought in closer Brian Fuentes {{in the top of the}} 8th, but the Padres re-tied the game when Geoff Blum singled to lead off the inning, advanced to second base on a wild pitch, and scored on a double by Brian Giles. This was Fuentes' seventh blown save of the season.|$|E
5|$|To {{start the}} top of the fifth inning, Art Reinhart was put in as pitcher. Reinhart walked Combs and {{followed}} by giving up a run-scoring double to Koenig. He then walked Ruth and Meusel in succession to load the bases for Gehrig. Reinhart walked Gehrig, allowing Koenig to score and keeping the bases loaded with no outs. Hi Bell replaced Reinhart as pitcher, but {{he was not able to}} suppress the Yankees' offense. Lazzeri hit <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly</b> to right field, which scored Ruth and moved Meusel up to third base. Dugan then hit a weak groundball; he was thrown out at first by catcher O'Farrell, but Meusel scored and Gehrig went to second base. Bell then balked, moving Gehrig to third base. Severeid was walked, and pitcher Hoyt ended the inning by hitting into a force play at second base.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Montañez was tabbed as the {{starting}} center fielder for the Phillies, and responded with a career-high 30 home runs (still a Phillies' rookie record), 99 RBI, and <b>a</b> league-leading thirteen <b>sacrifice</b> <b>flies.</b> He finished second behind Atlanta Braves catcher Earl Williams in the National League Rookie of the Year balloting.|$|R
5000|$|Hughes hit [...]333 for Australia in the 2007 Baseball World Cup. Hughes tied a {{game against}} the Dutch {{national}} team with <b>a</b> 9th-inning <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b> Against the Venezuela national team, Luke cracked a 3-run homer {{in the bottom of the}} 11th to win the game. He broke open a tie game against Team Canada in the top of the 9th with a double and the go-ahead run. America's Jayson Nix beat him out for All-Star honours at second base in the tournament.|$|R
5000|$|Jones {{began the}} 2016 {{season with the}} Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International League. The Tigers {{promoted}} Jones to the major leagues on August 30, 2016. [...] In his first two games, he hit 4 for 8, including three doubles. His first major league hit on August 30 was an RBI double against the Chicago White Sox, and on August 31, he scored the game-winning run {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning on <b>a</b> shallow <b>sacrifice</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|R
