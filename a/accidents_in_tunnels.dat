40|$|The {{first part}} of this report is about {{experience}} with (catastrophic) traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>tunnels</b> and describes interviews with representatives of Police and the Department of Transportation, as well as the results of a short questionnaire among involved policemen and victims. The primary causes of (catastrophic) <b>accidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>tunnels</b> are speeding, limited vision (on various grounds), both leading to collisions, and trailer manoeuvres. The lack of training by involved services is striking since practice could reveal all kinds of deficiencies and help to bring procedures into focus. The second part contains a short task analysis of behaviour in tunnels. Systematic accident related behaviour concerns excessive longitudinal and / or lateral behaviour. Additionally, once involved in a potential catastrophic accident, adequate directions could help avoid many problems leading to a catastrophe...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about {{analysis}} of traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>tunnels</b> on Slovenian freeways and expressways. Number of tunnels and traffic is constantly increasing. The media often reports about developments in Slovenian tunnels. We {{have already seen}} a variety of situations such as driving in the opposite direction, driving with excessive speed, fires, traffic accidents and dangerous overtaking. All the events recorded in the database, managed by the Directorate of the Republic of Slovenia for Roads (data on road accidents in the period 2005 - 2009) and Transport - Information Centre for surveillance and traffic management (information on traffic accidents in period 2007 - 2010), are shown and described in this thesis. Precisely, it examines the developments in the six tunnels: tunnel Golovec, tunnel Ljubno, tunnel Trojane, tunnel Kastelec and tunnel Dekani. Every single driver should take care of safety by driving properly through the tunnel, but in reality, this principle does not adhere to all road users. Driving through the tunnel is different from driving on the open route. It happens {{that in spite of}} adequate transport equipment for assisting when drive in a tunnel, the driver ignores warnings. By acting like that, they do not endanger only themselves, but they also threat other road users. In line with developments in tunnels the certain measures has been proposed in order to eliminate traffic accidents...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{years of}} tunnel {{incidents}} have {{produced more than}} 700 victims worldwide. In Europe alone, {{there have been more}} than 60 road <b>accidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Major tunnels are not immune: Mont Blanc (March 1999), Tauern (May 1999), and Saint Gotthard (October 2001), produced 62 deaths and multiple injuries. Despite structural and safety systems improvements, a number of factors must be addressed to ensure maximum safety. Factors include preparedness, timely support to the decision-making process, and planning optimal interventions in emergency management situations. This paper discusses the integration of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and virtual reality (VR) for through-life support to tunnel safety and emergency operations management. A WSN system designed for roadside applications is employed for environmental and traffic monitoring, event detection, and indoor localization. Data from the WSN is passed to a VR application. The VR application provides a 1 : 1 scale 3 D model of the locale; allowing the injection and visualisation of detected events, locations, and other relevant information to support training and emergency situations. The modules presented were implemented and tested during the EU FP 7 project SAVEME, which developed a system to detect incidents in transportation hubs and to support optimal evacuation guidance for multiple differently-abled travellers. For tunnel-specific challenges, SAVEME collaborated with the Gotthard Tunnel, CNVVF (Italian National Fire Brigade), and ANAS (Italian National Road Company). Testimonials and results obtained during training and live trials indicate how such a system can improve timeliness and provide responders with valuable additional capabilities {{in the event of an}} emergenc...|$|E
40|$|When {{driving in}} a tunnel {{the driver is}} {{confined}} to a dark closed environment {{for a long period}} of time, with very little clearance on both sides of the lane. This environment may impair performance and lead to severe accidents. <b>Accidents</b> <b>in</b> <b>tunnels</b> often involve rapidly spreading fires that engulf many drivers. Giving drivers early warnings and clear instructions how to respond to different emergencies should reduce accidents and their severity. To improve safety, the European Union has initiated a "Safe Tunnel " project in which drivers are provided with a 2 -way means of communication with the tunnel traffic control room, through an in-vehicle visual and auditory display. Emergency information, road conditions and vehicle diagnosis and Speed tele-control will be transmitted to drivers approaching the tunnel and inside it. For this study, two alternative interactive displays were designed for truck drivers in tunnels, and prototypes of these displays are currently being integrated in vehicles made by two leading European truck manufacturers. The experiment presented in this paper evaluates drivers ' performance with the two different displays, while driving in a simulated tunnel, designed with the same parameters as one of the longer European tunnels. The study presents the conditions that had to be designed into the system, the ergonomic rationale behind the specific displays, and the relative benefits of the two systems in responding to emergency situations, based on empirical results of the simulation experiment. The effectiveness is evaluated in terms of the mental load each device places on the driver as measured by accuracy of responses and reaction times to the displayed information, as well as in terms of disruption in vehicle control...|$|E

40|$|Tunnel safety – an {{inventory}} of <b>accidents</b> <b>in</b> four road <b>tunnels</b> <b>in</b> Stockholm This report investigates traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>in</b> four road <b>tunnels</b> <b>in</b> Stockholm.

The main purpose of this project was {{to work with a}} delimited part of the project TUFS (Tunnel Framkomlighet och Säkerhet, Tunnel practicability and safety, my translation) that is going to build a knowledge bank for Swedish road tunnel accidents. The goal of this project was to investigate if the forecasts for <b>accident</b> rates <b>in</b> the <b>tunnels</b> calculated from empirical data differ from the forecasts of the road network made by the forecast program used by Trafikverket, Lill-EVA, for the observed tunnels. Another goal was to determine where <b>accidents</b> occur <b>in</b> the <b>tunnels.</b> <b>In</b> addition, two different tunnel types were compared <b>in</b> terms of <b>accident</b> rates. The tunnel types are located in: countryside (high speed, low traffic flows, no on- and off ramps) or urban center (low speed, high traffic flows, on- and off ramps). Accident data has been collected from the data bases STRADA and NTS and compiled <b>in</b> histograms displaying <b>accident</b> type, light conditions, the seriousness of the accident and number of accidents/year. The results showed that there are no differences <b>in</b> <b>accident</b> rates calculated by Lill-EVA and empirical data for accident rate, serious accident rate and death rate. However, there was a difference in the results concerning light injuries. No difference was found regarding the two tunnel types. Rear-end collision was the most common <b>accident</b> type <b>in</b> Söderledstunneln and serial vehicle crashes in Törnskogstunneln and Häggvikstunneln. Vehicles that got stuck <b>in</b> the <b>tunnel</b> entrance dominated the <b>accident</b> type <b>in</b> Klaratunneln. The majority of the <b>accidents</b> occurred <b>in</b> daylight. The coordinate positions for the accidents showed that there was a concentration of accidents near the <b>tunnel</b> entrance <b>in</b> Klaratunneln, Söderledstunneln and Häggvikstunneln.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study carried out in order to estimate accident rates and associated social-cost rates <b>in</b> motorway <b>tunnels.</b> A comparison between the results obtained <b>in</b> the investigated <b>tunnels</b> and those of the corresponding motorways containing these structures was also made. For this aim a 4 -year monitoring period was considered in the analysis. The data-base used consisted of 195 unidirectional <b>tunnels,</b> <b>in</b> which 762 severe accidents were attributable to traffic with 774 injuries and 18 deaths. The results showed that severe accident rates and <b>accident</b> cost rates <b>in</b> <b>tunnels</b> were higher than those on the corresponding motorways.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{aftermath}} of the accidental fire disasters <b>in</b> several road <b>tunnels</b> {{at the turn of the}} century, fire safety <b>in</b> road <b>tunnels</b> was largely addressed through analysis of information drawn from major accidents; i. e. those resulting in significant casualties. This paper demonstrates that minor fire <b>accidents</b> <b>in</b> road <b>tunnels,</b> that is those resulting in no casualties, are also able to provide substantial and useful information relating to fire safety <b>in</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Many of these, fairly frequent, minor incidents had the potential to become major incidents, but a mixture of luck and appropriate actions, taken both by tunnel users and professional rescuers, helped prevent tragedy. Generally, information on minor incidents is limited to short dispatches or small 'news' articles issued for the wider public. This often scarce and scattered material is also marked by a cultural imprint which reveals the courage and initiative of people involved in the incidents, but also blurs and sometimes hides some aspects of the incidents which, perhaps, should have been highlighted. Through an analysis of a few recent examples of minor accidents, from all over the world, this paper shows why such information, despite often being of limited quality, should be systematically collected, integrated into existing databases andprocessed in order to better understand these incidents and, ultimately, prevent minor tunnelfire incidents escalating into major disasters...|$|R
