40|$|The <b>antestia</b> <b>bug</b> Antestiopsis thunbergii (Gmelin 1790) {{is a major}} {{coffee pest}} in East Africa. Nymphs and adults feed on all {{vegetative}} and fruiting parts of the coffee tree leading to yield reduction and poor quality of coffee beans. Our study aimed to characterize the developmental biology and provide life table parameters for A. thunbergii reared in the laboratory. The biology of A. thunbergii was studied at four constant temperatures of 20, 25, 30 and 35 °C with 80 ± 5 % RH and a photoperiod of L:D 12 : 12. Complete development of A. thunbergii from egg to adult occurred between 20 and 30 °C, while eggs did not hatch at 35 °C. Immature stage development time decreased significantly {{with an increase in}} temperature, with the exception of fifth nymphal stage, duration of which was similar for all temperatures. The fecundity was maximal at 20 °C with an average of 132. 8 eggs per female and 1. 7 egg per female per day. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) was the highest at 20 °C with 75. 79 daughters per female compared to 19. 56 and 2. 69 daughters per female at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. The intrinsic rate of increase r was maximal at 20 °C with 0. 013 and negative at 30 °C. The time required for the reared population to double (doubling time Td) was shorter at 20 °C with 53. 31 days compared to 115. 52 days at 25 °C. Our study provides basic information on A. thunbergii biology that will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the pest distribution and dynamics on arabica coffee in East Africa.

40|$|The <b>antestia</b> <b>bug</b> Antestiopsis thunbergii (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) {{is a major}} pest of Arabica {{coffee in}} African {{tropical}} highlands. It feeds on coffee plant vegetative parts and berries leading to a direct reduction in coffee yield and quality. This study aimed to determine A. thunbergii thermal requirements, and to obtain new information on the pest demography as influenced by temperature. Temperature-dependent models were developed using the Insect Life Cycle Modelling software (ILCYM) through a complete life table study at seven constant temperatures in the range 18 – 32 °C. Non-linear functions were fitted to A. thunbergii development, mortality, fecundity and senescence. Model parameters and demographic variables obtained from the models were given for each temperature and development stage. Life table parameters were estimated for nine constant temperatures, from 18 °C to 26 °C, using stochastic simulations. The minimum temperature threshold (Tmin) and the thermal constant (k) for the development from egg to adult were estimated from a linear function at 12. 1 °C and 666. 67 ° days, respectively. The maximum temperature threshold (Tmax) was estimated at 33. 9 °C from a Logan model. The optimum temperature for immature stages' survival {{was estimated to be}} between 22. 4 and 24. 7 °C. The maximum fecundity was 147. 7 eggs female− 1 at 21. 2 °C. Simulated A. thunbergii life table parameters were affected by temperature, and the maximum value of intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was 0. 029 at 22 °C and 23 °C. In general, the life cycle data, models and demographic parameters we obtained were in line with previous reports for antestia bugs or other stink bug species. The relationships between the pest thermal requirements and ecological preferences in highland coffee were discussed. Our results will contribute to risk prediction under climate change for this important coffee pest. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

It was originally isolated from cotton as a pathogen causing stigmatomycosis by Ashby and Nowell in 1926. This disease affects the development of hair cells in cotton bolls and can be transmitted to citrus fruits, which thereupon dry out and collapse (dry rot disease). In {{the first part of}} the 20th century, [...] and two other fungi causing stigmatomycosis ( [...] , [...] ) made it virtually impossible to grow cotton in certain regions of the subtropics, causing severe economical losses. Control of the spore-transmitting insects - cotton stainer (...) and [...] (<b>antestia</b> <b>bugs)</b> - permitted full eradication of infections. [...] was recognized as a natural overproducer of riboflavin (vitamin B2), which protects its spores against ultraviolet light. This made it an interesting organism for industries, where genetically modified strains are still used to produce this vitamin.|$|R
