5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as <b>a</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E

[...] Hanna drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} for several days; on the morning of February 15, his heart began to fail. [...] Roosevelt visited at 3pm, unseen by the dying man. [...] At 6:30pm, Senator Hanna died, and the crowd of congressional colleagues, government officials, and diplomats who had gathered in the lobby of the Arlington left the hotel, many sobbing.

60|$|The {{consequence}} is, {{that under}} the free governments of the present day the people are strong {{and the government is}} weak. The standing army of France consists at the present time[1] of five hundred thousand men, completely armed and equipped, and devoted all the time to the study and practice of the art of war. By means of this force one man is able to keep the whole population of the country in a state of complete and unquestioning submission to his will. In the United States, on the other hand, with a population nearly as great, the standing army seldom amounts to an effective force of fifteen thousand men; and if <b>a</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States were to attempt by means of it to prolong his term of office, or to accomplish any other violent end, there is, perhaps, not a single state in the Union, the population of which would not alone be able to put him down--so strong are the people with us, and so weak, in opposition to them, the government and the army.|$|E
