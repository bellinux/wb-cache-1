500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E
500|$|Hank Williams, {{who heard}} both the Miller and Griffin versions, started {{performing}} the {{song on the}} Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948. Horace Logan, the show's producer and programming director for KWKH, reported that the audience [...] "went crazy" [...] the first time Williams performed the song on the show. [...] In light of the live audience's strong positive reaction, Williams decided to record the song. His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer, Fred Rose, who felt that the song did not merit a recording. Williams, mindful of the reaction he received live, [...] persisted, and the recording {{took place during the}} final half-hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 22, 1948. For this recording, Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band, using a rhythm guitar, mandolin, string bass, drums and a steel guitar. [...] Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass). With little time left, Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "Waiting for a Train". [...] In the episode of American Masters about Williams, Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls, [...] "When they recorded 'Lovesick Blues,' Fred told Hank, 'That song's out of meter! [...] Got too many bars in it. [...] And you hold that note too long.' [...] And Hank said, 'Well, when I find a note I like, I wanna hold on to it as long as I can,' you know, just tryin' to be funny. [...] And Fred said, 'Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. [...] That thing is so much out of meter, I'm gonna get me a cup of coffee <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back maybe ya'll have that thing cut.' [...] And they did, but it was still out of meter. [...] So Fred lived with that the rest of his life." [...] Williams combined Griffin's lyrical arrangement with a two-beat honky-tonk track, borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller's recording. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was recorded in two takes.|$|E
500|$|In 1958 Terry-Thomas {{received}} {{the first of}} his two film award nominations, the BAFTA Award for the [...] "Best British Actor in 1959" [...] for the part of Ivan in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film tom thumb. He later described the film as his second favourite; he appeared opposite Sellers for much of his screen time, and later said that [...] "my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it". Terry-Thomas was still suffering with poor health following the filming of The Naked Truth when he suffered an attack of lumbago; filming went on for 85days during 1957â€“58, and he took painkillers to enable him to continue. The role was physically demanding, and required him to ride a horse, run long distances and fight in a duel. He stated that he fought and ran [...] "just as [...] had seen Douglas Fairbanks Snr do in The Mark of Zorro". Towards the end of filming, Terry-Thomas went to a Christmas party at the Trocadero, where he drank champagne, as well as taking codeine tablets, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. He considered the arresting policemen to have been rude, and [...] "their attitude made me extremely angry <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> angry... I just go completely off my nut". The case came to court on 14 March 1958 and his legal team from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer provided a medical report which showed Terry-Thomas had been on a course of prescription painkillers due to a gruelling filming schedule; along with inconsistencies in the arresting policemen's notes, the case proved inconclusive and was dismissed. For {{much of the rest of}} 1958, Terry-Thomas appeared on stage at the London Palladium in Large as Life, alongside Harry Secombe, Eric Sykes and Hattie Jacques. He played one of the Three Musketeers in one sketch and had another turn called [...] "Filling the Gap"; the show ran for a total of 380performances between May and December 1958. He also released his first record, Strictly T-T, a collection of comic songs and sketches.|$|E

2500|$|By year's end, the Democratic {{governor}} of Missouri, Warren E. Hearnes, warned that Johnson {{would lose the}} state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a 500,000 margin in 1964. [...] "Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs" [...] had eroded the President's standing, the governor reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in interest rates. Johnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson's approval ratings stayed below 50 percent; by January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16%, from 25 percent four months before. He ran about even with Republican George Romney in trial matchups that spring. Asked {{to explain why he}} was unpopular, Johnson responded, [...] "I am a dominating personality, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> things done I don't always please all the people." [...] Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed [...] "complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to." [...] He also blamed [...] "the preachers, liberals and professors" [...] who had turned against him.|$|E
