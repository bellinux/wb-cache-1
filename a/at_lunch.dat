5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners.

5|$|Barnes took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no ball, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side.

5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, {{and from the}} other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. <b>At</b> <b>lunch,</b> Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia {{elected to}} bat first and England made an ideal start.

In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scored many runs from the back cut.

Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched over the leg side fence for six, before hitting another ball for four.

5|$|Cyril Washbrook's benefit match {{brought him}} a then record sum, £14,000, {{but it was a}} mixed {{experience}} because he injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test. The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes (67) reaching 50. Nine of the Australians made a start, reaching 14, but could not capitalise on their opportunities, and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123. The slow left-arm bowler William Roberts took 6/73. Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38, while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece, but the Australians did not enforce the follow on. Australia made 265/5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133, his highest at Old Trafford, with 90 for Barnes. Bradman declared <b>at</b> <b>lunch</b> on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match, but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day. Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers. Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller, who refused to bowl, saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century. Lindwall (4/27) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—between bat and pad for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards, leaving the score at 64/2, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings and took the score to 121 <b>at</b> <b>lunch</b> without further loss. Hutton and Compton were 42 and 37 respectively. Compton started slowly but had accelerated as the adjournment approached. The morning's batting had been relatively slow, with only 67 runs scored in 100minutes, of which Hutton added only 23. The morning session also featured a tight spell of 13 overs by Ring. The leg spinner did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders. At the other end, Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. There were four men in the off side ring and they had {{much work to do}} as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed steadily and both Johnston and Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were no other scares. Towards the end of the morning session, the second new ball became available but Bradman decided to bide his time. He allowed Johnston to rest after his morning spell and used Lindwall and Miller—delivering off spinners—to bowl with the old ball for the last half hour before lunch break so that the trio could use the adjournment to recuperate before attacking with the new ball.|$|E

The four track down and capture Margaret to find out what she is doing there after their previous encounter (in Aliens of London). The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains a functioning tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator that Margaret would have used to flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Margaret back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorious, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Margaret makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then tries to play on the Doctor's sympathies, asking him to take her to another planet instead.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{culminated in}} a match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. With regular captain Don Bradman missing, Brown led a team that {{included}} seven Test debutants. The hosts won the toss and elected to bat first on a wet wicket, which came about {{after a week of}} rain before the match. New Zealand managed to reach 4/37 <b>at</b> <b>lunch,</b> before the sun emerged and caused the wicket to turn into a sticky with unpredictable bounce. Leg spinner Bill O'Reilly—in his last Test—and debutant Ernie Toshack, took 5/14 and 4/12 respectively as New Zealand were bowled out for only 42, losing their last six wickets for five runs. In reply, Australia were 1/9 when Ken Meuleman was dismissed. Having been dropped on 13, Brown then combined in a 109-run first-wicket stand with Barnes, before falling for the innings top-score of 67. It was the only partnership for the Test that went beyond 32. Barnes' dismissal triggered a collapse of 6/57, prompting Brown to declare Australia's innings closed at 8/199. Australia then dismissed New Zealand for 54 in the second innings in just two hours, resulting in victory by an innings and 54 runs in just two days. As the hosts' batsmen fell quickly, many of the Australian bowlers had limited opportunities. With one wicket left in the match, Brown used the toss of a coin to determine which of the debutants Colin McCool and Ian Johnson would bowl in Tests for the first time. McCool was given the ball and ended the match on his second delivery. Brown's solitary Test as captain makes him the first and the only native Queenslander to have led Australia.|$|E
5|$|Miller scored 49 in the First Test at Brisbane as Australia amassed 8/601, before dismissing Simpson and Hutton as England fell to an innings defeat. A {{knee injury}} forced Miller {{to miss the}} Second Test at the SCG, which England won. Miller {{returned}} for the Third Test at the MCG, but was initially unavailable to bowl due to lingering knee problems. However, upon receiving an inquiry {{about the health of}} his knee before the match by Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies, Miller agreed to try to bowl for a short period and lift his team. England elected to bat and Miller removed Hutton, Edrich and Compton with his outswinger. He ended up bowling for the entire first session of play and had 3/5 <b>at</b> <b>lunch</b> from nine overs, before finishing at 3/14. England were bowled out for 191. Miller struggled with the bat, scoring six and seven as Frank Tyson's pace saw England inflict a second successive defeat on Australia. Australia needed to win the Fourth Test in Adelaide to keep the series alive. Miller scored 44 and 14 as Australia were bowled out in the second innings to leave England with 94 for victory. Miller made a late burst, removing Edrich, Hutton and Colin Cowdrey in consecutive overs to leave England at 3/18. He then took a difficult catch from Johnston to dismiss Peter May. England were then 4/49 but hung on to win by five wickets and secure the Ashes. It {{was the first time that}} Australia had lost three consecutive Tests since the Bodyline series of 1932–33. Miller made 19 and 28 in the rain-affected draw in the Fifth Test. He ended the series with 167runs at 23.86, his lowest ever at international level, and took 10wickets at 24.30.|$|E
