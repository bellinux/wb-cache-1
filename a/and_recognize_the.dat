This paper represents different algorithms for the detection and the recognition of coins which are highly overlapped. The proposed system includes three principal steps detection, extraction and recognition. This system is efficient in detecting <b>and</b> <b>recognizing</b> <b>the</b> coins from both the sides. The system uses Otsu’s algorithm for segmentation process, for detecting overlapping uses hough transform <b>and</b> <b>recognizing</b> <b>the</b> coin uses radius thresholding...|$|R

The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted {{to assist with the}} processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> implications behind their work and the information they uncover.|$|E

25|$|Culture is {{definitely}} beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals {{need to learn}} about the tolerance of other's beliefs and remember that the professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with our personal beliefs. Discovering our own beliefs and why we have them (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and actions at time when others are cared firwith different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E

25|$|At {{the first}} signs of hypoglycemia, an insulin user should treat it {{immediately}} by consuming carbohydrate to restore blood glucose to safe levels (thereby preventing progression to severe hypoglycemia). However, not all insulin users can feel <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> early signs, particularly when sleeping. This can quickly lead to an emergency resulting in unconsciousness, inability to swallow, seizures, and in extreme cases death. In the past, treatment consisted of intravenous delivery of dextrose (glucose) usually in the emergency room; however, the delay in treatment due to emergency response and transport to a medical facility is life-threatening.|$|E

The PRC has provided economic, military and technical assistance to Pakistan and each considers the other a close strategic ally. The relationship has recently been the subject of renewed attention due to the publication of a new book, , which is the first extensive treatment of the relationship since the 1970s.|$|E

The modern relationship began in 1950 when India {{was among the first}} countries to end formal ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan) <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> PRC as the legitimate government of Mainland China. China and India are the two most populous countries and fastest growing major economies in the world. Growth in diplomatic and economic influence has increased the significance of their bilateral relationship.

25|$|The Arabs reached Iberia about 645 {{and forced}} its eristavi (prince), Stephanoz II (637-c. 650), {{to abandon his}} {{allegiance}} to Byzantium <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> Caliph as his suzerain. Iberia thus became a tributary state and an Arab emir was installed in Tbilisi about 653. At {{the beginning of the}} 9th century, eristavi Ashot I (813-830) of the new Bagrationi dynasty, from his base in southwestern Georgia, took advantage of the weakening of the Arab rule to establish himself as hereditary prince (with the Byzantine title kouropalates) of Iberia. A successor, Adarnase IV of Iberia, formally a vassal of Byzantium, was crowned as the “king of Georgians” in 888. His descendant Bagrat III (975-1014), brought the various principalities together to form a united Georgian state.|$|E
25|$|Thessalonica's {{ascendancy}} was brief, {{ending with}} the disastrous Battle of Klokotnitsa against Bulgaria in 1230, where Theodore Komnenos Doukas was captured. Reduced to a Bulgarian vassal, Theodore's brother and successor Manuel Komnenos Doukas was unable to prevent the loss of most of his brother's conquests in Macedonia and Thrace, while the original nucleus of the state, Epirus, broke free under Michael II Komnenos Doukas. Theodore recovered Thessalonica in 1237, installing his son John Komnenos Doukas, and after him Demetrios Komnenos Doukas, as rulers of the city, while Manuel, with Nicaean support, seized Thessaly. The rulers of Thessalonica bore the imperial title from 1225/7 until 1242, when {{they were forced to}} renounce it <b>and</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> suzerainty of the rival Empire of Nicaea. The Komnenodoukai continued to rule as Despots of Thessalonica for four more years after that, but in 1246 the city was annexed by Nicaea.|$|E
