5|$|A change {{occurred}} in the game <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced {{the size of the}} scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, {{at each end of the}} pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E

As the basis for <b>the</b> analysis, <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of <b>the</b> teacher in the instructional process in general was looked into in the introductory part. Teacher was first analysed generally, as they are described in literature on teaching psychology and sociology. Further on, the analysis narrowed down to educational theories <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> they assigned to teachers. Moreover, the literature of the teacher of English as a Foreign Language was looked at <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> that modern methodology assigns teachers were commented on.

5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence. For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players and regular people. There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience playing the game, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.|$|E
