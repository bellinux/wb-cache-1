500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E

Eurogamer called XIII [...] "a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking {{from most of the}} factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as [...] "about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, [...] "You'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually stunning game than XIII", but complained that [...] "numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its [...] "style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [...] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane"; he concluded, [...] "But if <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> solid shooter fix, XIII will do just fine. It has no fatal flaws, and the conspiracy-laced story should keep you going".|$|E
