5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, Blue Shift is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Blue Shift does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the only significant pauses <b>are</b> <b>when</b> the game needs to load the next part of an environment.|$|E

After release, a new capture the flag mode with additional levels, items and powerups, was created by Gearbox for the game.|$|E
5|$|Common defects of the forelegs include base-wide and base-narrow, {{where the}} legs are farther apart or closer {{together}} on the ground then they <b>are</b> <b>when</b> they originate in the chest; toeing-in and toeing-out, where the hooves point inwards or outwards; knee deviations to the front (buck knees), rear (calf knees), inside (knock knees) or outside (bowleg); short or long pasterns; and many problems with the feet. Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked). Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg, as foals with these defects are generally easy prey for predators. Foals raised by humans {{have a better chance}} for survival, as there are therapeutic treatments that can improve even major conformation problems. However, some of these conformation problems can be transmitted to offspring, and so these horses are a poor choice for breeding stock.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{levels in the}} {{covariation}} model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus <b>is</b> <b>when</b> many people can agree on an event or area of interest. Low consensus <b>is</b> <b>when</b> very few people can agree. High distinctiveness <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest is fairly common. High consistency <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest goes away quickly.|$|R

5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they <b>are</b> <b>when</b> attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you <b>are</b> <b>when</b> you are in your 20’s.|$|E

25|$|Loss-of-{{function}} mutations, {{also called}} inactivating mutations, {{result in the}} gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated). When the allele has a complete loss of function (null allele), it is often called an amorph or amorphic mutation in the Muller's morphs schema. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often recessive. Exceptions <b>are</b> <b>when</b> the organism is haploid, or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product {{is not enough for}} a normal phenotype (this is called haploinsufficiency).|$|E

His lasting contribution {{has been}} to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, <b>are</b> <b>when</b> treated as poets first and foremost. He {{thought this was a}} point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose. Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, {{he would have had to}} use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.|$|E
25|$|The virus circulates between ticks and rodents, {{with humans}} being the {{secondary}} hosts. People {{at risk for}} catching the disease are hikers and campers {{that are in the}} risk areas. Also, April, May, and June <b>are</b> <b>when</b> the infections mainly occur, because this is the time when the adult ticks are prevalent in the environment. Unfortunately, this is also when the weather is pleasant for hiking and camping. The best way to avoid getting bitten and catching this disease is wearing long sleeves or pants, avoiding high tick-infested areas, and wearing tick repellent.|$|E
25|$|Morrison {{became a}} {{regularly}} elected honorary {{member of the}} Trades Assembly, and, {{in the spring of}} 1895, was asked to speak at an executive meeting about the boycott of the Imperial Mill’s flour products.

25|$|Soil {{respiration}} and its rate across ecosystems {{is extremely}} important to understand. This is because soil respiration plays {{a large role in}} global carbon cycling as well as other nutrient cycles. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO2 but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. Soil respiration is also associated with positive feedbacks with global climate change. Positive feedbacks <b>are</b> <b>when</b> a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, soil respiration rates can be effected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} (3×3×3) Rubik's Cube {{has eight}} corners and twelve edges. There are 8! (40,320) ways {{to arrange the}} corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; {{the orientation of the}} eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 37 (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners <b>are.</b> (<b>When</b> arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 211 (2,048) possibilities.|$|E
25|$|About 90% of {{the time}} sciatica {{is due to a}} spinal disc {{herniation}} pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. Other problems that may result in sciatica include spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, piriformis syndrome, pelvic tumors, and compression by a baby's head during pregnancy. The straight-leg-raising test is often helpful in diagnosis. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person is lying on their back, pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed. Exceptions to this <b>are</b> <b>when</b> bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern of a tumor or infection. Conditions that may present similarly are diseases of the hip and early herpes zoster before the rash appears.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> there <b>is</b> a lack of attachment behavior.|$|R
