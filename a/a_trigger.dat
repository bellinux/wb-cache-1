5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with cross-reactivity of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as <b>a</b> <b>trigger,</b> including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
5|$|Sati– A Meluhan princess, {{she is the}} {{daughter}} of King Daksha. Shiva falls in love with her and marries her. Sati is a skilled swords-woman and is very brave since childhood. She assists Shiva on his journey to destroy Evil, but dies a valiant death while saving her people from a group of assassins. Her death becomes <b>a</b> <b>trigger</b> for the wars to cease. She is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes are spread throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti).|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of recent {{proposals}} for distributed monitoring infrastructures. We argue that a vital missing component from these proposals is <b>a</b> distributed <b>triggering</b> mechanism, by which nodes in the system can proactively work together to maintain invariants and constraints over the system-wide behavior. Without such <b>a</b> <b>triggering</b> component, existing proposals are doomed to poor performance, high detection latency, or both. A key research challenge in building such <b>a</b> <b>triggering</b> mechanism lies in devising solutions whereby individual nodes can independently detect (and react to) violations of constraints that are defined in terms of the aggregate behavior of nodes in the system. We discuss our early efforts in designing such <b>a</b> <b>triggering</b> system and the research challenges that lie ahead. 1...|$|R
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and <b>a</b> <b>trigger</b> mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for <b>a</b> <b>trigger</b> event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 5,000 RAF airmen {{prepared}} {{to take part in}} 817 heavy bombers which were fueled and armed in the evening. <b>A</b> <b>trigger</b> plan was prepared, which would act as a feint but, this night, Bomber Command amended the feint which was partially compromised by weather conditions. Restrictions on the flight path of the bombers was also changed. Bomber streams were permitted to fly over Ingoldmells Point to Filey; but not over coastal areas where no ground defences were stationed. The route took them downstream to southern England by Reading, and across the English Channel, as the trigger plan required. However, they were then ordered to turn back toward the North Sea. The reason behind this was the low-lying cloud which was ever-present over the continent that night. The clouds made it difficult for pilots to see and steer clear of zones heavily guarded by Allied ground defences near to the frontline. The possibility of losing aircraft to Friendly fire was too great.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{designed the}} online multiplayer component {{to be balanced}} and rewarding for new players while still offering something for experienced players. An early idea to implement air support (air strikes and attack helicopters) involved players fighting over special zones to access <b>a</b> <b>trigger</b> for air support against enemies. This idea was discarded because it discouraged the type of deathmatch gameplay they intended. The kill streak reward system was put in its place to encourage the improvement of player skills. Players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting. Maps were designed primarily for deathmatch games—the developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well. Map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use <b>a</b> <b>trigger</b> to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at 4years {{of age in}} the wild and at 3years in captivity. The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July (the dry season). Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as <b>a</b> <b>trigger</b> for intercourse. Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female's back. As the time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation. The female lays 2–4eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be present {{in the vicinity of the}} nest when providing food. Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame. The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65days after they hatch. Nonetheless, they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season.|$|E
