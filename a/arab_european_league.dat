Both the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation suspended Syria's membership.

5000|$|According to Centrum Informatie en Documentatie Israel (CIDI) a {{think tank}} {{established}} by the Jewish community in the Netherlands in 1974: [...] "In April 2002 the Antwerp-based <b>Arab</b> <b>European</b> <b>League</b> (AEL) leader Dyab Abou Jahjah (1971) performed {{for the first time}} at a pro-Palestine demonstration in Antwerp that got completely out of hand, 'Where flags of Israel were set on fire and demonstrators shouted anti-Semitic chant' (De Volkskrant, 11/5/02). 'Jews are dogs,' was heard in the streets (Reformatorisch Dagblad, March 1, 2003)".|$|E
5000|$|According to a 2005 US State Department report, in Europe: Anti-Semitism, {{particularly}} among Muslims, was linked {{in many cases}} to the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Most anti-Semitic incidents were not violent and included abusive language, hate mail, verbal insults at soccer matches, Internet [...] "chat room" [...] discussions, as well as persistent historical revisionism (such as Holocaust denial). However, pockets of militant young Muslims, mostly Moroccan Arabs, {{on a number of}} occasions assaulted or intimidated identifiable Jews. In addition to the anti-Semitic acts carried out by a relatively small group of Arab youths, the virulent anti-Israel sentiment among certain groups in society, such as the <b>Arab</b> <b>European</b> <b>League</b> (AEL) and the [...] movement, also have contributed to an anti-Semitic atmosphere in some quarters.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the murder}} of a 27-year-old Belgian of North African descent by an {{allegedly}} mentally ill native Belgian man in Antwerp in 2002, which led to racially influenced riots in the city, the <b>Arab</b> <b>European</b> <b>League</b> began patrolling the streets of Antwerp with video cameras to monitor police activity. The AEL claimed that Belgian police were engaging in a racist [...] "manhunt" [...] of the city's Moroccan youth and that many police officers sympathized with the political party Vlaams Blok. The AEL patrols were stopped after the Antwerp public prosecutor's office began an investigation into whether the activities violated Belgian laws against the organization of private militias. The court however decided on 31 May 2006 that the patrols were not enough to prosecute the organization. Three leaders of the AEL however will be tried for their leading role in the unrest and riots after the 2002 murder.|$|E
