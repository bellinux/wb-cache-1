5|$|Gale Eugene Sayers (born May 30, 1943) is {{a former}} {{professional}} American football player who earned acclaim both as a halfback and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL). In <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play.

5|$|Rococo {{provided}} <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> significant interlude in Norway, appearing {{primarily in}} the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E

5|$|He had a {{short and}} {{relatively}} unsuccessful playing career, spent mostly as a striker in non-league football. He turned out {{for a wide variety}} of clubs, including: Gillingham, Barnet, Wycombe Wanderers, Kingstonian, Wealdstone, Farnborough Town, Harlow Town, Enfield, Aylesbury United, Harrow Borough, Tooting & Mitcham United, Molesey and Walton & Hersham. He started his managerial career at the age of 28, managing Kingstonian for five months, before spending a year in charge of Enfield. In 1999, Westley became manager of Farnborough Town, guiding them to the Football Conference in 2002. He left Farnborough the following season, to become manager of Stevenage. He took the club to within one game of promotion to the Football League, but left the club in 2006 when his contract expired. Westley then had <b>a</b> <b>brief,</b> <b>but</b> successful, spell with Rushden & Diamonds, as well as acting as caretaker manager at Kettering Town.|$|E
5|$|Minogue was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer at age 36 on 17 May 2005, leading to the postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl– The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival. Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of support. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E
5|$|Morgan's Raid, the Confederate army's major {{incursion}} into Indiana, occurred a {{month after}} Hines' raid. On July 8, 1863, General Morgan crossed the Ohio River, landing at Mauckport, Indiana, with 2,400 troopers. Their arrival was initially contested by a small party from the Indiana Legion, who withdrew after Morgan's men began firing artillery from the river's southern shore. The state militia quickly retreated towards Corydon, Indiana, where a larger body was gathering to block Morgan's advance. The Confederates advanced rapidly on the town and engaged in the Battle of Corydon. After <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> fierce fight, Morgan took command of high ground south of town, and Corydon's local militia and citizens promptly surrendered after Morgan's artillery fired two warning shots. Corydon was sacked, but little damage was done to its buildings. Morgan continued his raid north and burned most {{of the town of}} Salem.|$|E

5|$|To {{accomplish}} her goal, Varian {{sought the}} assistance of British horse breeder Patricia Lindsay, who traveled to Poland and purchased three mares on Varian's behalf. The mares arrived in California in December 1961. They were Bachantka (sired by Wielki Szlem out of Balalajka, who was by Amurath Sahib), purchased from the Albigowa stud; Ostroga (Duch × Orda by Omar 11), from the Nowy Dwór stud; and Naganka (Bad Afas × Najada by Fetysz), from the Michalow stud. Bachantka and Naganka had been trained and raced in Poland. Bachantka had a record of 2/15 (0-1-3), and Naganka a record of 2/12 (3-4-1). After her arrival in the USA, Bachantka also had <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> successful horse show career.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Docherty was {{appointed}} manager in 1971 and had <b>a</b> <b>brief,</b> <b>but</b> successful, time in charge. Docherty lost {{only three of}} his 12 matches as manager, but he left the job in late 1972 to become manager of Manchester United. Despite losing 5–0 to England in his first match in charge, Scotland qualified for the 1974 World Cup under the management of Willie Ormond. Scotland performed creditably at the finals, winning against Zaire and drawing against Brazil and Yugoslavia, but were eliminated on goal difference. Ormond suffered from player indiscipline during his tenure, which included an infamous incident where Jimmy Johnstone, after a night out drinking, sat in a rowing boat that was drifting out to sea. Two teammates attempted to rescue Johnstone, but eventually {{he had to be}} retrieved by local fishermen. Ormond left the Scotland job in 1977 to become manager of Hearts.|$|E
5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} of {{his ability}} to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the Battle for Saigon. After <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss {{him in the middle of}} the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên. In addition, General Paul Ely, the head of the French presence in Vietnam, tried to impede Diệm; his troops put road blocks against the VNA and gave intelligence to the Bình Xuyên.|$|E

5|$|Just to {{the north}} of Culmstock, at Culmstock Beacon, is one of a chain of Elizabethan beacons built to warn of {{possible}} invasion by the Spanish Armada. On 5 November 1380, King Richard II granted Sir William and Lady Margaret Asthorpe a licence to crenellate the Hemyock manor house, meaning the permission to fortify it. Over the centuries, Hemyock Castle had many notable owners including Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham. During the English Civil War it was held for Parliament, subjected to <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> brutal siege and eventually slighted to destroy its military value. Parts of the castle walls, towers and moat still remain. They are a scheduled ancient monument and include displays of history and archaeology. The castle was also owned by General Sir John Graves Simcoe the first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada in 1792. He is buried at Wolford Chapel near Dunkeswell. The chapel is now owned by the Province of Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi {{arrived on}} the western shore of Lake Petén Itzá with his {{soldiers}} on 26 February 1697. Once there they built a heavily armed galeota attack boat, which carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces. On 10 March, Ursúa received a mixed Itza and Yalain embassy in peace, and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day, Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake. That morning, a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital. The city fell after <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. After the battle the surviving defenders swam across to the mainland and melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy the abandoned town. Martín de Ursúa renamed Nojpetén as Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). Kan Ek' was soon captured {{with help from the}} Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu; The Kowoj king was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|The November 2008 Carolinas tornado {{outbreak}} was <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> deadly tornado outbreak {{which began}} shortly after midnight (local time), while {{many people were}} sleeping. Most of the eight tornadoes that touched down were produced by two supercell thunderstorms over North Carolina. At 12:25a.m. EST, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina as the risk of tornadoes increased. Not long after, the first tornado of the outbreak, an EF2, touched down in South Carolina. Almost an hour later, the second tornado touched down in Robeson County, North Carolina. Three other minor tornadoes, two EF0 and an EF1, touched down {{over the next two}} hours. Around 3:10a.m. EST, the first of two killer tornadoes touched down near Kenly, North Carolina. The EF2 tornado destroyed a few homes and damaged several others. Roughly 20 minutes later, an EF3 tornado touched down in Wilson County. This tornado killed one person and injured a few others after destroying several homes. Total damages from the outbreak amounted to $2.5million, about half of which was a result of the EF3 tornado.|$|E

5|$|The city fell after <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> bloody {{battle in}} which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish {{suffered}} only minor casualties. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss {{of life on the}} island; the surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water. After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. Martín de Ursúa planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpetén as Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). The Itza nobility fled, dispersing to Maya settlements throughout Petén; in response the Spanish scoured the region with search parties. Kan Ek' was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu; The Kowoj king (Aj Kowoj) was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|The little {{railroad}} went broke a {{few years}} later. At about this time, the Arkansas, Oklahoma & Western Railroad (AO) was forming. The railroad ran from Rogers to Siloam Springs, over a distance of approximately 30miles (43km). It was opened for traffic on New Year's Day 1908, connecting with the Frisco at Rogers and the Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf (P) at Siloam Springs. The AO planned to build eastward to Eureka Springs. On December 1, 1909, the AO purchased the Monte Ne railroad. To connect the AO and the Monte Ne, a track {{would have to be}} laid from Hazelwood, Arkansas on the AO to Lowell; the Frisco line was in the way, and they would not allow a connection. The AO instead built an expensive underpass of the Frisco. The construction of the underpass enabled the Monte Ne line to turn over much of its outbound freight business to the AO rather than competitor Frisco. So the line enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> substantial volume of outgoing freight traffic from the Rogers White Lime Company located at Limedale. The underpass still exists and is still crossed by trains of Frisco Central Division successor Arkansas and Missouri Railroad.|$|E
5|$|In 609BC Necho II went to {{war with}} Babylonia, the Chaldeans, the Medians and the Scythians {{in an attempt to}} save Assyria, which after a brutal civil war was being overrun by this {{coalition}} of powers. However, the attempt to save Egypt's former masters failed. The Egyptians delayed intervening too long, and Nineveh had already fallen and King Sin-shar-ishkun was dead by the time Necho II sent his armies northwards. However, Necho easily brushed aside the Israelite army under King Josiah but he and the Assyrians then lost a battle at Harran to the Babylonians, Medes and Scythians. Necho II and Ashur-uballit II of Assyria were finally defeated at Carchemish in Aramea (modern Syria) in 605BC. The Egyptians remained in the area for some decades, struggling with the Babylonian kings Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar II for control of portions of the former Assyrian Empire in The Levant. However, they were eventually driven back into Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar II even briefly invaded Egypt itself in 567BC. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525BC, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia (modern Iran), leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.|$|E
