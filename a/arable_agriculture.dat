5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} grassland, {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for <b>arable</b> <b>agriculture,</b> particularly since World WarI. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to <b>arable</b> <b>agriculture</b> or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, average {{temperatures}} began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting {{the extent of}} <b>arable</b> <b>agriculture,</b> particularly in the Highlands. The introduction of new monastic orders such as the Cistercians in this period also brought innovations in agriculture. Their monasteries became major landholders, particularly in the Borders. They were sheep farmers and producers of wool for the markets in Flanders. By the late Middle Ages, Melrose Abbey and the Earl of Douglas had about 15,000 sheep apiece, making them among the largest sheep farmers in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is <b>arable,</b> <b>agriculture</b> contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E
5|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size of England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly the same amount of {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, today about 700cm per year in the east and more than 1,000cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high levels of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and {{may have contributed to the}} fragmented nature of political power. The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of <b>arable</b> <b>agriculture,</b> particularly in the Highlands.|$|E
5|$|Runrigs, of a furrow and ridge, usually ran {{downhill}} so {{that they}} included both wet and dry land, helping to offset {{some of the problems}} of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective on heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill. Key crops included kale (for both humans and animals), and hemp and flax for cloth production. Sheep and goats were probably the main sources of milk, while cattle were raised primarily for meat. The rural economy appears to have boomed in the thirteenth century and {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Black Death, probably the bubonic plague, which reached Scotland in 1349 and killed perhaps over a third of the population, was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes that can be seen in clerical benefices, of between a third and half compared with the beginning of the era, to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century. Towards the end of the period average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of <b>arable</b> <b>agriculture,</b> particularly in the Highlands.|$|E

2500|$|Two-thirds of Wiltshire, {{a mostly}} rural county, lies on chalk, {{a kind of}} soft, white, porous {{limestone}} that is resistant to erosion, giving it a high chalk downland landscape.

2500|$|Birmingham's {{market is}} likely to have {{remained}} primarily one for agricultural produce throughout the medieval period. The land of the Birmingham Plateau, particularly the unenclosed area of the manor of Birmingham {{to the west of the}} town, was more suited to pastoral then <b>arable</b> <b>agriculture</b> and excavated animal bones indicate that cattle were the dominant livestock, with some sheep but very few pigs. References in 1285 and 1306 to stolen cattle being sold in the town suggest that the size of the trade at this time was sufficient for such sales to go unnoticed. Trade through Birmingham diversified as a merchant class arose, however: mercers and purveyors are mentioned in early 13th century deeds, and a legal dispute involving traders from Wednesbury in 1403 reveals that they were dealing in iron, linen, wool, brass and steel as well as cattle in the town.|$|E

2500|$|Situated on {{the east}} coast, Norfolk was {{vulnerable}} to invasions from Scandinavia and Northern Europe, and forts were built to defend against the Angles and Saxons. By the 5th century the Angles, after whom East Anglia and England itself are named, had established control {{of the region and}} later became the [...] "north folk" [...] and the [...] "south folk", hence, [...] "Norfolk" [...] and [...] "Suffolk". Norfolk, Suffolk and several adjacent areas became the kingdom of East Anglia (one of the heptarchy), which later merged with Mercia and then with Wessex. The influence of the Early English settlers {{can be seen in the}} many place names ending in [...] "-ton" [...] and [...] "-ham". Endings such as [...] "-by" [...] and [...] "-thorpe" [...] are also common, indicating Danish place names: in the 9th century the region again came under attack, this time from Danes who killed the king, Edmund the Martyr. In the centuries before the Norman Conquest the wetlands of the east of the county began to be converted to farmland, and settlements grew in these areas. Migration into East Anglia must have been high: by the time of the Domesday Book survey it was one of the most densely populated parts of the British Isles. During the high and late Middle Ages the county developed <b>arable</b> <b>agriculture</b> and woollen industries. Norfolk's prosperity at that time is evident from the county's large number of medieval churches: out of an original total of over one thousand, 659 have survived, more than in the whole of the rest of Great Britain. The economy was in decline by the time of the Black Death, which dramatically reduced the population in 1349. By the 16th century Norwich had grown to become the second largest city in England; but over one-third of its population died in the plague epidemic of 1579, and in 1665 the Great Plague again killed around one-third of the population. During the English Civil War Norfolk was largely Parliamentarian. The economy and agriculture of the region declined somewhat. During the Industrial Revolution Norfolk developed little industry except in Norwich which was a late addition to the railway network.|$|E
