50|$|By {{comparison}} with {{the large number of}} Afrikaners who participated in the annual celebrations of the Voortrekker victory, some did take exception. In 1971, for instance, Pro Veritate, the journal of the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>organization</b> the Christian Institute of Southern Africa, devoted a special edition to the matter.|$|E
50|$|The South African Congress of Democrats (SACOD) was a radical, left, white, <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>organization</b> {{founded in}} South Africa in late 1953 {{as part of}} the multi-racial Congress Alliance. The {{establishment}} of the COD sought to illustrate opposition to apartheid among whites. The COD identified closely with the African National Congress and advocated racial equality and universal suffrage.|$|E

50|$|During {{the latter}} {{years of the}} {{apartheid}} era, South African companies made several investments in Brazil. However, while Brazil developed relations with the former Portuguese colonies of Africa, it didn't cultivate a strong relationship with the apartheid-era government, and instead developed ties with the allies of such <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>organizations</b> such as ANC and SWAPO.|$|R
5000|$|The All Black {{visit to}} South Africa in 1985 was {{cancelled}} due to political pressure from <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>organizations.</b> Trials {{had already been}} held to select a national squad. To compensate South African players for the cancellation, the South African Rugby Board selected a so-called [...] "Shadow" [...] Springbok team for an internal tour. The team included Louw and two players of colour, Dolly Ntaka from the black South African Rugby Association, and Wilfred Cupido from the coloured Western Province Leagues.|$|R
50|$|The Northeast Coalition for the Liberation of Southern Africa (NECLSA) was an <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>organization</b> {{founded in}} 1977 at Yale University {{by members of}} the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY) and {{students}} at Rutgers University in response to the massacre of black students by the South African police during the Soweto student uprisings in June 1976. The organization quickly expanded to a majority membership of white Americans. At its height, NECLSA became the umbrella organization of Anti-Apartheid committees on some 100 campuses throughout the North East region of the United States.|$|E
5000|$|The West German arms {{industry}} exported armour to South Africa - {{even after the}} 1977 official proclamation of the UN arms embargo. [...] "Daimler is a vital partner of the South African war industry," [...] concluded Abdul Minty, {{director of the international}} <b>anti-Apartheid</b> <b>Organization</b> in the late 1980s. [...] "And if there is an international company, which could weaken the army of the apartheid state, it would be Daimler-Benz." [...] Despite UN sanctions, Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm exported helicopters to South Africa. To evade the sanctions in 1979 the South African company Atlantis Diesel Engines was established. Daimler-Benz had a 12 % share in this company.|$|E
5000|$|Students {{organized}} {{to demand that}} their universities [...] "divest", meaning that the universities were to cease investing in companies that traded or had operations in South Africa. At many universities, many students and faculty protested in order to force action on the issue. The first organized <b>Anti-Apartheid</b> <b>Organization</b> on University Campuses in the United States was CUAA founded at the University of California Berkeley by Ramon Sevilla. Sevilla was a principal organizer that had support from Nelson Mandela, with whom Sevilla was in communication while Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island in South Africa {{as well as with}} The African National Congress (the ANC). Some of the most effective actions in support of the divestment of investments of U.S. companies doing business in South Africa took place between the years of 1976 and 1985, as Sevilla travelled throughout the American Continent and Europe gathering support for the overthrow of the South African Apartheid Government, which also led to his arrest at U.C. Berkeley on several occasions in the successful effort to force the University of California to divest all of their investments in companies doing business in South Africa, which also became the driving force for divestment worldwide in all companies doing business in the country of Apartheid South Africa. For example, in April 1986, 61 students were arrested after building a shantytown in front of the chancellor's office at UC Berkeley, Ramon Sevilla Chair CUAA.|$|E

5000|$|The Five Freedoms Forum (FFF) was a {{group of}} <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>organizations</b> made up of mostly white people. It was {{launched}} in Johannesburg on 18 March 1987. The name of the group was based on five freedoms: [...] "freedom from want, freedom from fear, freedom from discrimination, freedom of speech and association and freedom of conscience." [...] Several organizations fell under the umbrella of the Five Freedoms Forum including NUSAS, Black Sash, Young Christian Students, Jodac, the Catholic Church Commission for Justice and Peace, Concerned Social Workers, Jews for Social Justice and the Detainees' Parents Support Committee. The Five Freedoms Forum organized a two-day conference of 800 delegates in September 1987, which was the first [...] "nationwide meeting of South African white groups opposed to apartheid." [...] In 1989, an anti-apartheid campaigner, David Webster, who was white and involved with the Five Freedoms Forum, was assassinated.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Schlebusch Commission was a {{parliamentary}} commission established in 1972 by the South African government of Prime Minister BJ Vorster to investigate four <b>anti-apartheid</b> civil society <b>organizations.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{his term}} at the South African Council of Churches ended, Naudé {{continued}} {{to serve a}} number of <b>anti-apartheid</b> and development <b>organizations,</b> including the South African Legal Defence and Aid Fund, the Ecumenical Service for Socio-Economic Transformation, Kagiso Trust, and the Editorial Board of Challenge Magazine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970 Naudé {{was among}} few white South African Christian leaders [...] "who openly called for {{understanding}} of the WCC decision" [...] to provide financial support for liberation movements in southern Africa. [...] "If blood runs {{in the streets of}} South Africa it will not be because the World Council of Churches has done something but because the churches of South Africa have done nothing," [...] Naudé said. In response, the state formed the Schlebusch Commission in 1972 to investigate <b>anti-apartheid</b> Christian <b>organizations.</b> When Naudé refused to testify, he was tried and imprisoned. After a night in the cells, a DRC minister paid his fine.|$|R
5000|$|Tape {{trading was}} also in some respects an early {{precursor}} of podcasting, as the method {{could be used to}} redistribute radio programs to fans outside of a radio station's local broadcast area, or even as the main distribution method of non-broadcast amateur programming. This form of trading was especially, but not exclusively, used as an underground distribution method for content that was politically censored: for instance, the Cassette Education Trust, an <b>anti-apartheid</b> activist <b>organization</b> in South Africa, used tape trading as the [...] "broadcast" [...] platform for its political and cultural programming prior to its launch as Bush Radio, the country's first licensed community radio station, and the Hungarian punk rock band CPg used its tape trading network to redistribute anti-Communist political commentary from Radio Free Europe alongside its music.|$|R
40|$|De zoektocht naar transnationaal gezag. De anti-apartheidsbewegingen in de Europese Gemeenschap De anti-apartheidsbeweging is wijd erkend als een belangrijke mondiale actor uit de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw. Dit artikel levert een bijdrage tot recente inspanningen om anti-apartheid te begrijpen als een trans{{nationale}} sociale beweging. De aandacht gaat vooral naar de anti-apartheidsorganisaties in de landen van de Europese Gemeenschap (eg) en hun pogingen om het besluitvormingsproces van nationale overheden te beïnvloeden. Het eg-proces van samenwerking rond buitenlands beleid, zo wordt betoogd, vormde een ernstige beperking op lobbyactiviteiten die gericht waren op het nationale niveau. Anti-apartheidsorganisaties voelden zich dan ook genoodzaakt om hun activiteiten op een transnationaal niveau te coördineren. Dit bereikte een hoogtepunt met de oprichting van de Liaison Group of National Anti-Apartheid Movements in the Countries of the European Community. The Quest for Transnational Authority. The Anti-Apartheid Movements of the European Community The {{anti-apartheid movement}} has been widely recognized as an important global actor {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. This article makes a contribution to recent efforts to understand anti-apartheid as a transnational social movement. Its primary focus lies with the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>organizations</b> in the countries of the European Community (ec) and their attempts to influence the decision making of their national governments. The ec process of foreign policy cooperation, it is argued, offered a serious constraint to lobbying activities geared at the national level. Antiapartheid organizations therefore felt compelled to coordinate their activities at a transnational level. This culminated in the creation of the Liaison Group of National Anti-Apartheid Movements in the Countries of the European Community. La quête de l’autorité transnationale. Les mouvements anti-apartheid dans la Communauté européenne Le mouvement anti-apartheid est largement reconnu comme un acteur mondial important dans la seconde moitié du xxe siècle. Cet article étudie ce mouvement en tant que mouvement social transnational. L’accent est mis sur les organisations anti-apartheid dans les pays de la Communauté européenne et leurs tentatives pour influencer les décisions de leurs gouvernements nationaux. D’après l’auteur, le processus de coopération européenne concernant la politique étrangère entravait le lobbying à l’échelon national. Par conséquent, les organisations anti-apartheid se sentaient obligées de coordonner leurs activités au niveau transnational. Cela a abouti à la création du Groupe de liaison des mouvements nationaux anti-apartheid dans les pays de la Communauté européenne. Goedertier Wouter.
