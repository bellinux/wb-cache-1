40|$|The {{objective}} of {{research was to}} know the effect of learning models on mathematics learning achievement viewed from the student learning style. The learning models compared were TAPPS, TAI and classical with scientific approach. This research used the quasi experimental method. The population was the students of junior high school in Surakarta regency on academic year 2014 / 2015. The tecnique of taking sample was stratified cluster random sampling. The {{size of the sample}} was 291 students. The instruments used were examination test and learning styles test. The proposed hypothesis were analyzed using the unbalanced two-way analysis of variance. The conclusions were as follows. 1) TAPPS with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> better mathematics achievement than TAI and classical with scientific approach, TAI and classical with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> the same achievement. 2) auditory students have better mathematics achievement than visual and kinesthetic students, visual and kinesthetic students have the same achievement. 3) In TAPPS with scientific <b>approach,</b> auditory students <b>have</b> better achievement than visual students, kinesthetic studentshave the same achievement as visual and auditory students. In TAI with scientific <b>approach,</b> auditory students <b>have</b> better achievement than visual and kinesthetic students, visual and kinesthetic students have the same achievement. In classical with scientific <b>approach,</b> auditory students <b>have</b> the same achievement as visual and kinesthetic students, visual students have better achievement than kinesthetic students. 4) In visual students, TAPPS with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> the same achievement as TAI and classical with scientific approach, classical with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> better achievement than TAI with scientific approach. In auditorial students, TAPPS and TAI with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> the same achievement, TAPPS and TAI with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> better achievement than classical with scientific approach.

5|$|The {{identification}} of thrips to species is challenging as types are maintained as slide preparations of varying quality over time.

5|$|The {{solar power}} source is via {{photovoltaic}} modules that convert light directly to electricity.

5|$|Two <b>approaches</b> <b>have</b> {{dominated}} {{explanations of}} the story of the green children: that it is a folktale describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world, perhaps subterranean or even extraterrestrial, or it is a garbled account of a historical event. The story was praised as an ideal fantasy by the English anarchist poet and critic Herbert Read in his English Prose Style, published in 1931. It provided the inspiration for his only novel, The Green Child, written in 1934.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} <b>approaches</b> <b>have</b> {{been used to}} {{estimate}} {{the year of the}} crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{repetitive}} {{actions and}} long-playing times, 4X games {{have been criticized}} for excessive micromanagement. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some <b>approaches</b> <b>have</b> been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that Galactic Civilizations succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game's use of programmable governors. Sins of a Solar Empire was designed to reduce the incentives for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game's interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, Master of Orion III reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>approaches</b> <b>have</b> been {{suggested}} over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans. Other ideas range from covering {{the ocean in}} a substance that inhibits evaporation, dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop), or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone. These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived {{for any of the}} weakening techniques to be practical.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other <b>approaches</b> <b>have</b> since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E
