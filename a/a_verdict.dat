5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned <b>a</b> <b>verdict</b> of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such <b>a</b> <b>verdict</b> would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Five {{defendants}} were then indicted for forcing {{their way in}} the house of Rev. John Vachell in Littleport, threatening him and stealing £2. Mr Gurney addressed the jury. Two witnesses testified. <b>A</b> <b>verdict</b> of guilty was returned against Harley and Newell whilst Warner and Stibbard were acquitted.|$|E

5000|$|In a jury trial, <b>a</b> {{directed}} <b>verdict</b> is <b>an</b> {{order from}} the presiding judge to the jury to return <b>a</b> particular <b>verdict.</b> Typically, the judge orders <b>a</b> directed <b>verdict</b> after finding that no reasonable jury could reach a decision to the contrary. After <b>a</b> directed <b>verdict,</b> {{there is no longer}} any need for the jury to decide the case.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the jury}} will be {{directed}} {{to try to reach}} <b>a</b> unanimous <b>verdict.</b> If they fail to reach <b>a</b> unanimous <b>verdict,</b> the judge may later (after not less than two hours) give directions that <b>a</b> majority <b>verdict</b> will be acceptable, but still no less than ten to two, although the jury should continue to try to reach <b>a</b> unanimous <b>verdict</b> if possible.|$|R
50|$|Reversal of <b>a</b> jury's <b>verdict</b> by <b>a</b> judge {{occurs when}} the judge {{believes}} that there were insufficient facts {{on which to base}} the jury's verdict, or that the verdict did not correctly apply the law. This procedure is similar to a situation in which a judge orders a jury to arrive at <b>a</b> particular <b>verdict,</b> called <b>a</b> directed <b>verdict.</b> <b>A</b> judgment notwithstanding the verdict is occasionally made when a jury refuses to follow a judge's instruction to arrive at <b>a</b> certain <b>verdict.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sutton {{received}} straight A grades from Chase Terrace Technology College in August 2012, and had interviews at Cambridge University {{to study}} medicine, {{as well as}} universities in Leicester and Leeds. He later withdrew his applications before getting <b>a</b> <b>verdict,</b> after his cancer {{was determined to be}} incurable.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>verdicts</b> and {{sentences}} {{were handed}} {{down in the}} trials of the Bali Nine, additional arrests were made in Australia.|$|R
50|$|A coroner giving <b>a</b> {{narrative}} <b>verdict</b> {{may choose}} {{to refer to the}} other <b>verdicts.</b> <b>A</b> narrative <b>verdict</b> may also consist of answers to a set of questions posed by the Coroner to himself or to the jury (as appropriate).|$|R
50|$|Similar {{legislation}} was passed for Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, where <b>a</b> unanimous <b>verdict</b> {{was not always}} required, <b>a</b> majority <b>verdict</b> could be given by {{five of the seven}} jurors.|$|R
5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) {{included}} war crimes against civilians and property committed in Lovas in October 1991 in its indictment of Milošević.

The juvenile was released on 20 December 2015.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>a</b> <b>verdict</b> {{delivered}} by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death. However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held criminally liable, {{and most of the}} blame lay with promoters and security members. The acquittal was upheld by the Prague High Court on June 5, 2013.|$|E

50|$|Oregon is {{the only}} state where someone can be convicted of a capital crime without <b>a</b> {{unanimous}} <b>verdict</b> from the jury: 11 jurors are enough to find the defendant guilty, unless the prosecution requests <b>a</b> unanimous <b>verdict.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{the long}} {{litigation}} was completed with <b>a</b> jury <b>verdict.</b> <b>As</b> reported in The Union, a newspaper located in Grass Valley, California, on October 30, 2002: ...|$|R

5|$|Although some eyewitnesses {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, was at fault, following a few words from the coroner the jury returned <b>a</b> <b>verdict</b> of accidental death. The directors and engineers of the L were explicitly absolved of all blame, and no deodand was to {{be attached to the}} locomotive or the railway.|$|E
5|$|Completed in {{the context}} of the Yugoslav wars, the film {{constitutes}} an investigation into the consequences of xenophobia and state-sanctioned repression, as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out. It is thus often described as <b>a</b> <b>verdict</b> on the history of Romania, as well as on problems facing the Balkans at large, and occasionally described as a warning that violence could also erupt in a purely Romanian context.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>verdicts</b> and {{sentences}} {{were handed}} {{down in the}} trials of the Bali Nine, additional arrests were made in Australia. Lawrence appealed the sentence to the Indonesian Supreme Court. On 26 April 2006, a sentence of 20years imprisonment was handed down.|$|R

5|$|John Surratt stood {{trial in}} Washington in 1867.

50|$|This can—using the {{judicial}} analogue above—be {{compared with the}} truly guilty defendant who is released just because the proof {{is not enough for}} <b>a</b> guilty <b>verdict.</b> This does not prove the defendant's innocence, but only that there is not proof enough for <b>a</b> guilty <b>verdict.</b>|$|R
50|$|On December 1, 2008, {{the jury}} {{delivered}} <b>a</b> complete defense <b>verdict</b> for Chevron. On September 10, 2010 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld <b>a</b> jury <b>verdict</b> {{in favor of}} Chevron Corporation.|$|R

5|$|Playtex {{responded by}} litigating. In one suit, it alleged patent {{infringement}} over Pearl's applicator design. It also alleged that advertising claiming Tampax Pearl had better leakage protection and comfort than Gentle Glide was false.

On 2 December 2013, the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations with respect to <b>a</b> <b>verdict</b> on Smith's death.|$|E
50|$|It was {{established}} in Bushel's Case that a judge cannot order the jury to convict, no matter how strong the evidence is. In civil cases <b>a</b> special <b>verdict</b> can be given, but in criminal cases <b>a</b> general <b>verdict</b> is rendered, because requiring <b>a</b> special <b>verdict</b> could apply pressure to the jury, {{and because of the}} jury's historic function of tempering rules of law by common sense brought to bear upon the facts of a specific case. For this reason, Justice Black and Justice Douglas indicated their disapproval of special interrogatories even in civil cases.|$|R
50|$|On these {{instructions}} the jury returned <b>a</b> guilty <b>verdict.</b>|$|R
