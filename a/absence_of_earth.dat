40|$|This paper {{presents}} current {{developments of}} the attitude determination algorithm for Del¦-n 3 Xt, TU Delft next nanosatellite. Several novel quaternion ¦lters using Sun vector and Earth magnetic ¦eld measure-ments and rate gyro outputs are presented. The quaternion measure-ment matrix associated with each line-of-sight measurement is shown to be rank de¦cient. This property is exploited in order to design re-duced order measurement update stages in the ¦lters. The measurement model reduction is designed such as to preserve the statistical informa-tion. The ¦lter covariance propagation can cope rigorously with the multiplicative process noises. The paper also describes {{the development of the}} Sun vector determination algorithm, which merges the outputs of 6 body-mounted four-quadrant Sun sensors. For each sensor, a sim-ple algorithm allows Sun vector determination while avoiding the use of uncertain physical parameters. This algorithm takes into account geometrical imperfections linked to manufacturing limitations. A thor-ough error analysis of the photodiodes measurement outputs is carried out. A spacecraft Sun vector determination algorithm is proposed and illustrated, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Earth</b> albedo e¨ect, via Monte-Carlo simu-lations and experimental validation. In addition, extensive Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate the good performances of the quaternion ¦lters us-ing spacecraft Sun vector and Earth magnetic ¦eld measurements. The novel reduced ¦lter shows good performances in a challenging tumbling dynamics environment, where a standard additive Kalman ¦lter fails to converge. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Additions <b>of</b> rare <b>earth</b> {{elements}} to magnesium alloys are qualitatively {{reported in the}} literature to retard recrystallisation. However, their effect in the presence <b>of</b> other (non-rare <b>earth)</b> alloy additions has not been systematically shown nor has the effect been quantified. The microstructural restoration following the hot deformation of Mg-xZn-yRE (x = 2. 5 and 5 wt. %, y = 0 and 1 wt. %, and RE = Gd and Y) alloys has been studied using double hit compression testing and microscopy. It was found that, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> rare <b>earth</b> additions, increases in zinc level had a negligible influence on the kinetics of restoration and the microstructure developed both during extrusion and throughout double hit testing. Adding rare earth {{elements to}} Mg-Zn alloys was found to retard restoration of the microstructure and maintain finer recrystallised grains. However, in the Mg-Zn-RE alloys, increasing the zinc concentration from 2. 5 wt. % to 5 wt. % accelerated the restoration process, most likely due to a depletion <b>of</b> rare <b>earth</b> elements from solid solution and modification of the particles present in the matrix...|$|R

[*]=[*] 0.131 nearly equals Earth’s present surface average {{cloudless}} albedo (0.122 – 0.13) {{inferred from}} satellite- and ground-based observations (Stephens et al. 2012; Wild et al. 2013). This is {{in spite of}} the fact that our Planet has highly reflective regions such as deserts, glaciers, and Polar Ice Caps that are absent on the Moon. However, the high reflectivity <b>of</b> these <b>Earth</b> surfaces is counterbalanced by the low albedo of the World’s Oceans. Aside from this coincidental similarity of surface albedos between present-day Earth and the Moon, one can also argue that, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> atmosphere, <b>Earth</b> would have no liquid oceans and/or exposed glaciers, since these require an atmospheric pressure (P) and temperature (T) above the triple point of water to exist, i.e. T[*]>[*] 273.2 K and P[*]>[*] 611.73  Pa (Cengel and Turner 2004). Without an atmosphere, the surface of our planet would be subjected to the same geologic processes that presently govern regolith formation on the Moon (e.g. bombardment by cosmic radiation and micrometeorites). Hence, an airless Earth would likely have a surface soil layer of similar radiative and optical properties (shortwave albedo and long-wave emissivity) as the lunar regolith. The uncertainty of the ATE estimate associated with Earth’s airless albedo is further discussed below.|$|R

40|$|As human {{presence}} in space becomes longer, supplying all food, oxygen and water from Earth {{will result in}} a tremendous cost. For this reason the international scientific community has been making efforts towards developing technologies and equipment to realise a sustainable Bioregenerative Life Support System for food production, water purification, air revitalisation and waste recovery. Plants produce food and oxygen for human needs, contribute to remove and reclaim carbon dioxide, relative humidity and the organic wastes. Aim of this research is a critical analysis of the materials and equipment requirements used up to now, in order to highlight the equipment engineering solutions for a system for plant cultivation on-board the International Space Station supported by Italian Space Agency. Creating a Bioregenerative Life Support System is an extremely sophisticated scientific problem. Space environment is characterised by the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Earth’s</b> gravitational and magnetic fields, of tidal forces and of the influence of the cyclical events of celestial mechanics and so, the prediction of fluid and heat behaviour is less intuitive. Besides, this environment would severely impact plant growth and metabolism.
