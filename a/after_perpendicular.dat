In the former case we can deduce from the depolarization the effective height heffof the domains and from the angular dependence of the depolarization the section width δ (which is proportional to the domain width) in the remanent states <b>after</b> <b>perpendicular</b> and after in-plane saturation. As expected, heffappears to be larger <b>after</b> <b>perpendicular</b> saturation and for a film thickness h ∼ 400 nm, heffapproaches h. This is attributed to the disappearance of reversed spike domains in the thinnest films. The lower hefffound in magnetron films with a lower surface/bulk coercivity ratio is also consistent with spike domain theory. The section width δ is found to he proportional to hx with x depending on the preparation or magnetic history of the film between 0. 6 and 0. 8. For magnetron films δ is ∼ 1. 5 as large as in RF films of equal thickness, in qualitative agreement only with the fact that K 1 is twice as large as for RF films...|$|E

Magnetization versus magnetic field reveals room temperature soft ferromagnetism in all the YCo films. Thin films which were grown at 100 W sputter power with growth rates of 0. 677, 0. 694 and 0. 711 Å/sec show better morphology and composition than 50 W (0. 333, 0. 444 and 0. 277 Å/sec) grown films. Perpendicular exchange bias in as deposited bilayers is evident for IrMn/YCo bilayers. Exchange bias (EB) decreases in case of in plane measurements and enhances for out of plane measurements <b>after</b> <b>perpendicular</b> field annealing. EB is more in case of out of plane direction due to large perpendicular anisotropy in comparison with in plane direction. Above the critical thickness, EB variation is explained {{on the basis of}} random field model in the Heisenberg regime, which has been proposed by Malozemoff. Indeed there exists an inverse relationship between EB and IrMn layer thickness. Evidenced vertical shift apart from the horizontal shift for magnetization loops is attributed to frozen magnetic moments in one of the layers at the interface.

50|$|Recent {{developments}} in LIBS {{have seen the}} introduction of double-pulsed laser systems. For double-pulse LIBS one distinguishes between orthogonal and perpendicular configuration. In perpendicular configuration the laser fires twice on the same spot on the specimen with a pulse separation {{in the order of}} one to a couple of tens of microseconds. Depending on pulse separation, the second pulse is more or less absorbed by the plasma plume caused by the previous pulse, resulting in a reheating of the laser plasma leading to signal enhancement.In orthogonal configuration a laser pulse is fired parallel to the sample surface either before or <b>after</b> the <b>perpendicular</b> pulse hits the specimen. The laser plasma ignited in the surrounding medium above the surface by a first pulse causes (by its shock wave) an area of reduced pressure above the specimen into which the actual plasma from the sample can expand. This has similar positive effects on sensitivity like LIBS performed at reduced pressures.If the orthogonal laser pulse is delayed with respect to the perpendicular one, the effects are similar as in the perpendicular configuration. Timing electronics such as digital delay generators can precisely control the timing of both pulses. In recent, fully 3D simulation/modeling captured the shockwave movement and interactions with wall.|$|R

Wetting experiments show that switching of brushes? surface composition upon exposure to solvents of various thermodynamic quality occurs faster than in 6 s. It takes longer time (5 - 10 min), if rate of solvent diffusion into the brush film is low. Discontinuous switching of surface composition of binary brushes is found upon exposure to binary solvents with gradually changed selectivity. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) shows quantitatively that the top brush layer (1) is dominated by respective favourite polymers after exposure to solvents of opposite selectivity and (2) comprises both brush constituents in almost symmetric ratio after exposure to non-selective solvents.

40|$|International audienceA {{statistical}} analysis is conducted on sequential (10 - 12) -(10 - 12) double extension twinning in a Mg AZ 31 alloy obtained <b>after</b> two mutually <b>perpendicular</b> successive compressions. Indeed, primary twins form {{during the first}} compression, which produce secondary twins during the second compression. Here, ``sequential double twinning'' is adopted to describe this twinning mechanism, which is different from classic double twinning obtained during monotonic loading. Double extension twins, no matter sequential or classic ones, can be classified into Groups I-IV according to their misorientations {{with respect to the}} parent grain. In the present study, the majority of the sequential double extension twins have relatively high Schmid factors (SFs) and a misorientation of 60 degrees with respect to the parent grain (Group III). However, the classical SF based analysis fails to explain why secondary twin variants in Group III are preferred over their nearest orientated neighbors in Group IV, since their SF differences are negligible. Therefore, a static double inclusion model is developed to analytically compute the elastic energy in a final configuration of sequential double twinning. The model well explains the predominance of secondary twins in Group III by a noticeable greater decrease of free energy after secondary twinning...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To measure {{changes in}} penile length (PL) over time {{before and after}} radical prostatectomy (RP), and to {{investigate}} the underlying mechanisms for these changes. Patients and Methods: The stretched PL (SPL) of 102 patients was measured before, 10 days after, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months <b>after</b> RP. The <b>perpendicular</b> distance from the distal end of the membranous urethra to the midline of the pelvic outlet was measured on mid-sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice at three time points: preoperatively; 10 days after RP; and 12 months after RP. Pre- and postoperative SPLs were compared using paired Student's t-test. Predictors of PL shortening at 10 days and at 12 months after RP were evaluated on univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The SPL was shortest 10 days after RP (mean PL shortening from preoperative level: 19. 9 mm), and gradually recovered thereafter. SPL at 12 months after RP was {{not significantly different from}} preoperative SPL. On MRI examination, the distal end of membranous urethra was found to have moved proximally (mean proximal displacement: 3. 9 mm) at 10 days after RP, and to have returned to the preoperative position at 12 months after RP. On univariate analysis, only the volume of the removed prostate was a predictor of SPL change at 10 days after surgery; on multivariate analysis, the association was not statistically significant. No predictor of SPL change was found at 12 months after RP. Conclusion: The SPL was shortest at 10 days after RP and gradually recovered thereafter in the present study. Anatomically, the glans and corpus spongiosum surrounding the urethra are an integral structure, and the proximal urethra is drawn into the pelvis during urethrovesical anastomosis.

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of the spintronics paradigm, there is a compelling reason to find novel methods to manipulate and measure magnetic spin in condensed matter systems at nanometre length scales. In metal-oxide materials, the combination of magnetic super-exchange, strongly correlated electrons and low symmetry crystalline environments gives rise to a plethora of useful phenomena: antiferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, semiconducting behaviour and magneto-electric coupling. The break in translational symmetry at an interface further modifies the intrinsic properties of such magnets in nanometre-thick films. This thesis focuses on the study of the magnetic structure of cubic and perovskite metal-oxide magnets, particularly when these are incorporated intometal/metal-oxide thin film systems. The goal is to investigate the varied effects that an interface exerts on neighbouring magnetic layers to understand the delicate role of nano-architecture and microstructure on the overall magnetic properties. Although three thin film systems are discussed - Ni 80 Fe 20 /α-Fe 2 O 3, BiMn 0. 5 Fe 0. 5 O 3 and Ni 80 Fe 20 /CoO/Co - these are united through the importance of interfacial effects. A major part of the work was the deployment of advanced experimental techniques such as polarised neutron reflectometry and high-angle neutron diffraction to reveal atomic-scale magnetic information buried at interfaces {{below the surface of the}} thin film. A versatile classical spin model was developed using a computer simulation of 2 D/ 3 D spin-lattices obeying a modified Heisenberg equation to model the experimental findings. A pronounced exchange bias effect was found experimentally for an antiferromagnetic hematite α-Fe 2 O 3 / ferromagnetic permalloy Ni 80 Fe 20 bilayer film below the blocking temperature of 40 K. Polarised neutron reflectometry was used to characterise the asymmetric reversal behaviour in the exchange biased state. Using complementary techniques, a detailed fitting and error analysis was performed of the polarised neutron reflectometry data to place an upper limit on the concentration and length scale of a layer of uncompensated moments at the antiferromagnetic interface in the saturated state. The data is consistent with an induced magnetic region at the antiferromagnetic interface of 0. 5 - 1. 0 µB per Fe within a depth of 1 - 2 nanometres. By extending contemporary models of exchange bias to the nanocrystalline case, the Monte Carlo computer simulation provides a qualitative explanation for the mechanisms of formation of uncompensated magnetic spins at the interface, the magnetic reversal behaviour and the consequence of variable antiferromagnetic anisotropy. For BiMn 0. 5 Fe 0. 5 O 3 epitaxial thin films, a temperature-dependent experiment was performed to investigate the antiferromagnetic order. High-angle neutron diffraction was used to directly reveal the atomic-scale magnetic structure of the single-crystalline thin film deposited on a SrTiO 3 (001) substrate. A transition to long-range G-type antiferromagnetism was observed below 120 K with a (½½½) propagation vector. A weak ferromagnetic component was observed using SQUID magnetometry. The thin film has a reduced critical temperature compared to the related bulk material La 0. 2 Bi 0. 8 Fe 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 O 3 attributed to the strained growth of the film on the substrate interface. There is no indication of the spin cycloid, known for BiFeO 3, in the BiMn 0. 5 Fe 0. 5 O 3 thin film. Monte Carlo simulations were used to elucidate the types of local and global perturbation of the molecular fields required to generate or destroy an incommensurate spin structure and lead to a weak ferromagnetism. For the Ni 80 Fe 20 /CoO/Co section, a series of ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/ferromagnet trilayer thin films were fabricated by ion-beam assisted deposition with varying CoO spacer thickness. A microstructural study was performed using electron microscopy, X-ray reflectometry and polarised neutron reflectometry to determine the relationship between the film morphology and the magnetic properties. At 200 K, <b>after</b> field-cooling, both <b>perpendicular</b> and longitudinal magnetic exchange bias was present in a double-shifted hysteresis loop. Based on layer-resolved polarised neutron reflectometry, it is shown that ion-beam modification during the deposition led to an oxygen-rich CoO/Co nanocomposite interface region...|$|R
40|$|Magnetism {{plays an}} {{important}} role in today’s technology and has a very broad range of applications. In the medical industry and research, high resolution medical scanners use magnetism and magnetic nanoparticles can be useful for therapeutic drug delivery, contrast enhancement agents for magnetic resonance imaging applications, magnetic separation of labelled cells, … Also in the information technology industry, it’s impossible to imagine life today without magnetic materials. Examples are VCR’s, credit cards, hard disks, … Due to the current and new promising applications, magnetism remains in the forefront of current fundamental and applied research. In this thesis, the exchange bias effect is investigated. Exchange bias arises from the coupling at the interface between a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic layer. The antiferromagnetic layer is almost insensitive to external magnetic fields because it has no macroscopic magnetization and as a result, the coupling between an antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic layer stabilizes the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer in a certain direction. This “pinning”, which results in a shift of the ferromagnetic hysteresis loop, is referred to as the exchange bias effect and has been discovered 50 years ago by Meiklejohn and Bean. A detailed and reliable theoretical understanding of the exchange bias effect is, however, still lacking. This lack of understanding has its roots in the difficulty of visualizing the magnetic configuration of the antiferromagnetic layer and the uncertainty about the state of the common interface region between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layer. As a result, a wide variety of models exist today with different physical parameters, including roughness, grain size, compensated or uncompensated antiferromagnetic interfacial spins, perpendicular coupling, anisotropy, … Apart from the horizontal shift, other phenomena are related to the exchange bias effect, such as coercivity enhancement, training effect, asymmetric hysteresis loops, positive exchange bias, magnetic relaxation and a vertical shift of the hysteresis loop. The origin of some of these effects is still under debate and await complete understanding. One of these phenomena, the training effect, is the main research topic of this work. The training effect is a reduction of the horizontal shift of the hysteresis loop when cycling the bilayer through consecutive hysteresis loops. It has been widely accepted that the training effect is related to a change of the spin structure in the antiferromagnetic layer when cycling the exchange bias system in an external field. However, the microscopic origin of the training effect is still under debate. This is reflected by the large amount of models with different physical backgrounds that try to explain the training effect. The aim of this thesis is twofold. First, we want to gain further insight in the training effect and the associated domain structure in exchange biased polycrystalline Co (ferromagnetic layer) /CoO (antiferromagnetic layer) bilayers. The bilayer system is selected for its pronounced training effect and asymmetry of the first hysteresis loop after field cooling. Second, we want to reverse the training effect or, in other words, re-initialize the bilayer to the original state obtained after field cooling. In order to investigate (the reversal of) the training effect, several techniques are applied, including anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), low temperature magnetic force microscopy (LT-MFM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR). Polycrystalline Co/CoO bilayers were grown by magnetron sputtering or molecular beam epitaxy and subsequent in-situ oxidation at room temperature. After field cooling, the system showed a horizontal shift of the hysteresis loop and a considerable increase in coercivity. The first magnetization reversal after field cooling is abrupt and characterized by domain wall motion, while the following reversals are more rounded and dominated by a rotation of the magnetization. The asymmetric behavior of the first hysteresis loop after field cooling is a consequence of the training effect. A theoretical description of the training effect, based on the model of Fulcomer and Charap, shows that the granular structure of the oxide layer is responsible for the pronounced training effect in Co/CoO bilayers. Each antiferromagnetic grain has an uncompensated magnetic moment and, dependent on the crystalline anisotropy, some grains are stable while other grains rotate during a hysteresis loop due to the interaction with the ferromagnetic layer. The stable grains cause the exchange bias shift and the non stable rotatable grains are responsible for the increase in coercivity. The training effect is caused by the non stable grains because their uncompensated magnetization does not rotate back to the initial position after a complete Hysteresis loop. Low temperature magnetic force microscopy measurements have shown that a ferromagnetic magnetization reversal after field cooling creates ferromagnetic domains with a typical wavelength around 1 μm at remanence. The ferromagnetic domains, once created, remain present and detectable at saturation. The ferromagnetic roughness, which is formed after the first magnetization reversal, is a direct consequence of the misalignment between the uncompensated magnetization of the granular antiferromagnet and the applied magnetic field. In order to reverse the training effect or, in other words, re-induce the untrained state, the uncompensated magnetization of the unstable antiferromagnetic grains had to be more aligned along the cooling field. A straightforward approach is the application of a very large field aligned parallel to the cooling field direction. A DC magnetic field of 12 T had only little effect on the trained hysteresis loop. Furthermore, a pulsed magnetic field of 34. 5 T reversed only very partially the training effect. The increase of the exchange bias shift after the application of a pulsed magnetic field directed parallel to the cooling field is an indirect evidence of the ferromagnetic nature of the interaction between the uncompensated spins of the antiferromagnetic grains and the spins of the ferromagnetic layer. The pulsed magnetic field measurements are not simulated by the extended model of Fulcomer and Charap, because the suggested energy equation does not contain a term that directly links the uncompensated moments of the antiferromagnetic grains to the external field. We also reported on the surprising possibility to largely re-induce the untrained state and asymmetry by performing a hysteresis measurement with an in plane external field oriented perpendicular to the cooling field direction, without changing the temperature of the bilayer. The next hysteresis loop along the cooling field obtained <b>after</b> the <b>perpendicular</b> hysteresis loop resembles the initial asymmetric hysteresis loop with a reduced amount of spin rotation occurring at the first coercive field. The reversal of the training effect is measured with several techniques: SQUID, AMR, LT-MFM and neutron reflectivity. It is even more surprising that the reversal of the training effect is strongly dependent on the magnitude of the applied perpendicular magnetic field. If the perpendicular field has a maximum value around 150 mT, the initial situation after field cooling (large training effect and asymmetry) is largely recovered. If the perpendicular field is increased above 400 mT, the training effect and asymmetry could no longer be recovered. It is possible to explain the recovery and disappearance of the training effect within the framework of the extended model of Fulcomer and Charap. If the perpendicular field is too low, the interfacial magnetization of the antiferromagnetic grains remains unaffected. If on the other hand, the external field becomes too high, the interfacial antiferromagnetic magnetization vectors rotate beyond their initial field cooling position, and the asymmetry again disappears. Since the model is able to consistently explain the evolution of the training effect and the asymmetry of the hysteresis loop, including the peculiar influence of a perpendicular magnetic field, we are confident to have identified the microscopic origin of the asymmetry and training effect in Co/CoO bilayers. Furthermore, it is shown, to our knowledge for the first time, that the AMR effect can be used to determine the average rotation sense of the ferromagnetic magnetization. This is accomplished by applying the in plane magnetic field under an angle of 45 ° with respect to the current direction. The measurements demonstrate that a cooling field direction exists along which the in plane magnetization rotates in one direction. This can probably be explained by taking into account the anisotropy of the ferromagnetic Co layer. The sense of the magnetization rotation can be changed with a perpendicular hysteresis loop that ends in the direction opposite to rotation direction of the magnetization reversal during a hysteresis loop after field cooling. status: publishe...|$|R
