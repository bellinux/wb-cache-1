25|$|Until 1950 {{the line}} was a freight-only service. The first {{passenger}} service launched in 1950 and connected Esquel with Buenos Aires (arriving at Constitución station), changing trains at Jacobacci. Passengers would occupy loose wooden benches around a stove {{which could be used}} for light cooking and above all to prepare mate <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b> The bends of the line in the Andean foothills and the slow speed of the network allowed passengers to walk alongside the train on certain sections along the 14-hour journey.|$|E

60|$|At half-past one {{the steady}} downpour ceased, and only showers fell thereafter. The {{homeless}} folk {{came away from}} {{the protection of the}} buildings, and slouched up and down and everywhere, in order to rush up the circulation <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b>|$|E

25|$|Zarathustra {{contrasts}} the overman {{with the}} last man of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an apathetic creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living <b>and</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>warm.</b> This concept appears only in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and {{is presented as a}} condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.|$|R

It is quite possible, you know, that he may be in the sick bay, and they won't let any one on board till the vessel is made fast. You are quite sure, I suppose, that it was the Orontes in which your husband said he was coming?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Most of us {{know the}} beaver chiefly in a simile. [...] "Working like a beaver," [...] or [...] "busy as a beaver," [...] {{is one of those}} proverbial {{expressions}} that people accept without comment or curiosity. It is about one-third true, which is a generous proportion of truth for a proverb. In winter, for five long months at least, he does nothing but sleep and eat <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b> [...] "Lazy as a beaver" [...] is then a good figure. And summer time--ah! that's just one long holiday, and the beavers are jolly as grigs, with never a thought of work from morning till night. When the snow is gone, and the streams are clear, and the twitter of bird songs meets the beaver's ear as he rises from the dark passage under water that leads to his house, then he forgets all settled habits and joins in the general heyday of nature. The well built house that sheltered him from storm and cold, and defied even the wolverine to dig its owner out, is deserted for any otter's den or chance hole in the bank where he may sleep away the sunlight in peace. The great dam, upon which he toiled so many nights, is left to the mercy of the freshet or the canoeman's axe; and no plash of falling water through a break--that sound which in autumn or winter brings the beaver like a flash--will trouble his wise little head for a moment.|$|E

50|$|The {{species is}} oviparous, with females laying 10-50 eggs at a time. Afterward, females coil around the eggs {{to protect them}} <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> them <b>warm</b> through using muscular contractions to {{generate}} heat. This type of maternal care, which is typical for pythons, ceases once the hatchlings have emerged.|$|R
50|$|Working in brakeman's cabins was dangerous, {{especially}} in winter because the cabins were unheated and draughty {{and there was}} little room to move around <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b> As a result brakemen frequently froze, sometimes even to death, placing the entire train at risk {{due to lack of}} braking power.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the extreme}} winter climate, the {{residents}} of the Trans-Himalayas burn a lot of coal, wood and dung to cook <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> in winters. However, using the abundant solar energy in the region, they can minimize fuel-wood consumption, and reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and health problems associated with excessive smoke.|$|E

50|$|More {{and more}} women in the United States are using water to find comfort during labor. This is called hydrotherapy.

5000|$|Nietzsche {{warned that}} {{the society of the}} last man could be too barren and decadent to support the growth of healthy human life or great individuals. The last man is only {{possible}} by mankind having bred an apathetic person or ethnic group who are unable to dream, who are unwilling to take risks, and simply earn their living <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm.</b> The society of the last man is antithetical to Nietzsche's theoretical will-to-power, the main driving force and ambition behind human nature, according to Nietzsche, as well as all other life in the universe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} on which Gray embarked, {{to build the}} Franklin Dam, aroused protests from environmentalists, led by Dr Bob Brown (later a Senator). Gray in 1982 allied with militant left wing FEDFA trade union leader Kelvin McCoy to form in November 1982 the Organisation for Tasmanian Development (OTD) which was directly associated with notable stickers seen on cars in Tasmania like Doze in a Greenie: help Fertilize the South-West, If It's Brown, Flush It, <b>and</b> <b>Keep</b> <b>Warm</b> This Winter:Burn a Greenie. Gray and McCoy praised each other publicly in their promotion of the Gordon-below-Franklin dam. One of the more notable events of Gray's involvement with the OTD was the 3,000-strong rally in Queenstown on 11 December 1982, which included former Premier Eric Reece. Despite Reece's ALP background, Gray praised Reece as [...] "the greatest living Tasmanian." ...|$|E

50|$|Scooters {{were also}} a {{practical}} and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens. In the early 1960s, public transport stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs. To keep their expensive suits clean <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> while riding, mods often wore long army parkas. For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, {{and they could be}} bought on a payment plan through newly available hire purchase plans. After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. The cover of The Who's album Quadrophenia, which includes themes related to mods and rockers, depicts a young man on a Vespa GS with four mirrors attached. The album spawned a 1979 motion picture of the same name.|$|E
5000|$|Mixed terrain bicycle {{travel for}} {{pleasure}} & commerce has seen {{varying degrees of}} interest over the years. Cyclo-cross racing likely got its start when European road racers in the early 1900s began cutting through farm fields and over fences {{as a way to}} train <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>warm</b> during the winter off season. Club riding in early 1900s Europe often included mixed terrain (called rough stuff or pass storming) {{as an integral part of}} typical routes. Early recreational cyclists would extend their biking range to include off-road cycling. [...] "Evidence of how much rough stuff was viewed as an integral part of the experience for the touring cyclist can be found in the format of the BCTC (British Cycle Tourist Competition). Run by the CTC and inaugurated in 1952 until the late 1980s its aim was to find Britain's best tourist. Rough stuff riding was a key element and the organizers often went to great lengths to find awkward tracks, fords, etc. that would test a rider's skill." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{ecological}} benefits of earth-house architecture lies in its natural insulation. The unique architecture cools the house down in summer <b>and</b> <b>keeps</b> it <b>warm</b> in winter. A further advantage is the higher air humidity of 50 to 70% compared to overheated rooms of conventional houses in winter. Furthermore, as earth houses are impermeable, they can be considered ideal for controlled air conditioning.|$|R
