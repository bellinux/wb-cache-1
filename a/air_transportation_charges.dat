Other flowers cannot survive for long periods out of water such as orchids, gerberas (gerber daisies) and water lilies. These are either sent with their own sealed water container (called picks) on each stem end - for more expensive or tropical flowers - or are transported in buckets of water (This method of transport in water {{is often referred to}} as [...] "Procona"). The latter method extends the life of flowers and reduces labor time as flowers are ready for sale, but obviously also reduces the amount of flowers that can be transported as they are much heavier than dry-packed flowers and hence <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> <b>charges</b> are higher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> {{industry}} {{has a great}} impact on the economy. In this paper, we analyze the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network in the U. S. to better understand its characteristics. For this, we measure several complex network features including average shortest path, degree distribution, assortative mixing, clustering, betweenness centrality, and resiliency. We also analyzed changes over the previous two decades and compared the networks with earlier <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network studies. In our analysis, we did not observe considerable changes in the analyzed complex network features of the U. S. <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> over the past two decade. Moreover, the U. S. <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network exhibits small world characteristics and has an assortative mixing by the degree similar to the earlier study on the world-wide <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>transportation</b> {{usage and}} {{economic}} activity are interdependent. <b>Air</b> <b>transportation</b> provides employment and enables certain economic activities which {{are dependent on}} the availability of <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> services. The economy, in turn, drives the demand for <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> services resulting in the feedback relationship between the two. The objective of this work is to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} relationship between <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> and economic activity. More specifically, this work seeks to (1) develop a feedback model to describe the relationship between <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> and economic activity and (2) identify factors which stimulate or suppress <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> development. To achieve these objectives this work uses an exploratory research method which combines literature review, aggregate data and case study analyses. First, this work uses data at the individual country level to identify different types of growth patterns between <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> passengers and GDP for 139 countries. This analysis is then used to identify twenty-two representative countries which span a range of possible interaction behaviors, geographies and income categories. The case study analysis at the individual country level is performed to describe the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> impact for each individual economy. These findings help develop a feedback model which describes the relationship between <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> and economic activity. (cont.) Specifically, the analysis is used to describe (1) how <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> flows of passengers and cargo enable the flows of goods, services, knowledge, tourism, investment, remittances and labor among economies and (2) how <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> flows can affect the country's factor, demand and business conditions. The feedback model is then extended to perform quantitative analysis of the evolution of the enabling impact of <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> in a particular economy. Specifically, a quantitative system dynamics model is developed to describe the interaction between the demand for leisure travel and the resulting enabling impact of tourism on Jamaica's economy. Case study analysis is also used to identify factors which may stimulate or suppress <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> system development. The factors are identified both from the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> supply and demand sides. The following supply side change factors are identified: changes in the regulatory framework, infrastructure capability, vehicle capability and airline strategy. The <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> demand is found to be directly affected by exogenous demand shocks, economic downturns, political and economic sanctions, and the development of other transportation modes. The analysis also identifies the following change factors which affect the demand indirectly by changing the country's economic attributes: economic liberalization, institutional and political reforms, supporting infrastructure investment, exchange rate fluctuations, political and macroeconomic stability, growing consumer demand, and changes in management practices. (cont.) This analysis of stimulating and suppressing factors helps to describe the role of government intervention in changing <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> system development and its impact on economic activity. The results of this work can help guide further development efforts, investment and policy decisions pertaining to <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> usage especially in developing economies. by Mariya A.

This situation {{will result in the}} generation and the propagation of delays throughout the system, impacting passengers’ quality of travel and more broadly the economy. There is therefore the need to investigate the mechanisms by which the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> system scaled to meet demand in the past and will do so in the future. In order to investigate limits to scale of current <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> networks, theories of scale free and scalable networks were used. It was found that the U. S. <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network is not scalable at the airport level due to capacity constraints. However, the results of a case study analysis of multi-airport systems that led to the aggregation of these multiple airports into single nodes and the analysis of this network showed that the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network was scalable at the regional level. In order to understand how the network evolves, an analysis of the scaling dynamics that influence the structure of the network was conducted. Initially the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network scales according to airport level mechanisms –through the addition of capacity and the improvement of efficiency- but as infrastructure constraints are reached; higher level scaling mechanisms such as the emergence of secondary airports and the construction of new high capacity airports are triggered. These findings suggest that, given current and future limitations on the ability to add capacity at certain airports, regional level scaling mechanisms will be key to accommodating future needs for <b>air</b> <b>transportation.</b> This work was supported by NASA Langley under grant NAG- 1 - 2038 and by the FAA under contract DTFA 01 - 01 -C- 00030 ’D. 0 # 16...|$|R

This thesis proposes the investigation of the mechanisms by which the <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> system has scaled to meet demand in the past and is expected {{to do so in the}} future using a multi-level engineering systems approach. The <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> system was first analyzed at the U. S. national level using network abstractions. In order to investigate limits in scaling of the U.

However, the construction and analysis of a new network for which sets of two or more significant airports that serve passenger traffic in a metropolitan region (i. e. multi-airport systems) were aggregated into single nodes showed that it was scale-free and scalable. These results were also supported by a time series analysis of airport and multi-airport system growth.
