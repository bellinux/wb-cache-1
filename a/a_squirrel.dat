5|$|In August 2012, {{a scarlet}} ibis {{escaped from the}} zoo and went on the loose in the city after <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> had chewed {{a hole in the}} netting at the top of its cage. Keepers noticed it was missing and later that day it was spotted more than 3 miles away in Dundas Street, near the city centre. The ibis was missing for nearly a week before being recaptured four miles from the zoo.|$|E
5|$|Lagrivea {{is known}} from three mandibles (lower jaws)—one, the holotype, with the fourth premolar (p4) {{and all three}} molars (m1–3) preserved; one with the incisor and m2; and one with the incisor, p4, m1, and m2—an {{isolated}} lower incisor, and an isolated m2. It was large for <b>a</b> <b>squirrel,</b> and can be distinguished from the fossil squirrels Palaeosciurus, Aliveria, and Ratufa obtusidens by its larger size.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1911. Timmy Tiptoes is <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> believed to be a nut-thief by his fellows, and imprisoned by them in a hollow tree with the expectation that he will confess under confinement. Timmy is tended by Chippy Hackee, a friendly, mischievous chipmunk who has run away from his wife and is camping-out in the tree. Chippy urges the prisoner to eat the nuts stored in the tree, and Timmy does so but grows so fat he cannot escape the tree. He regains his freedom when a storm topples part of the tree. The tale contrasts the harmonious marriage of its title character with the less than harmonious marriage of the chipmunk.|$|E

5|$|The eighth season {{featured}} Tom Kenny as {{the voice}} of the title character SpongeBob SquarePants and his pet snail Gary. SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, was voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, while Rodger Bumpass played the voice of Squidward Tentacles, an arrogant and ill-tempered octopus. Other members of the cast were Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money who is SpongeBob's boss at the Krusty Krab; Mr. Lawrence as Plankton, a small green copepod and Mr. Krabs' business rival; Jill Talley as Karen, Plankton's sentient computer sidekick; Carolyn Lawrence as Sandy Cheeks, <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> from Texas; Mary Jo Catlett as Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob's boating school teacher; and Lori Alan as Pearl, a teenage whale who is Mr. Krabs' daughter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> from Texas. She is a {{scientist}} and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} with little regard for narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E

25|$|Within context, {{some of the}} {{banknotes}} have figurative meanings {{with the}} 100-krone note {{sometimes referred to as}} a hund (dog) shortening the word hundrede (a hundred). The 500-krone note can be referred to as a plovmand (ploughman) because previous circulations of the note featured a picture of a man with a plough and the 1000-krone note, too, can be referred to as a tudse (toad) taken from a wordplay on the word tusinde meaning a thousand. The 1000-krone note may also be referred to as an egern (squirrel) because of previous circulations of the note featuring <b>a</b> <b>squirrel.</b>|$|E

25|$|Sidney Edgerton (August 17, 1818 – July 19, 1900) was an American politician, lawyer, {{judge and}} teacher from Ohio. He served during the American Civil War, as <b>a</b> <b>Squirrel</b> Hunter. During this time, Edgerton {{served as a}} U.S. Congressman. In 1863, Abraham Lincoln {{appointed}} him the first Chief justice of the Idaho Territorial Court. Edgerton lobbied {{for the creation of}} separate territories, out of the Idaho Territory, and in 1864, Abraham Lincoln appointed Edgerton as the first Territorial Governor of Montana. During his term as Territorial Governor, he was an alleged member of the infamous Montana Vigilantes, and was reputedly among its founders.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} mascot of the 2001 Southeast Asian Games is <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> named Si Tumas, {{short form}} for Tupai Emas (Golden squirrel). It is said the Squirrel is a lovable creature found almost {{everywhere in the}} world. In folk tales of many countries, the squirrel is depicted as a friendly and fun animal known for its high energy and speed of motion. The adoption of the squirrel as the games mascot is to borrow its pleasant, friendly fun characteristics to add life to the event. The gold colouring on the squirrel enhances the winning aspect. The word SI is phonetically similar to Sea as in SEA GAMES and also a friendly form of address in Malay. TU is {{the first part of}} Tupai which means squirrel in Malay and MAS comes from the word EMAS which is Malay for gold.|$|E
25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as {{you get to the}} second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as <b>a</b> <b>squirrel,</b> deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of the}} nature connectedness construct.|$|E

25|$|There {{originally}} {{was a brief}} shot in the scene where Bambi's mother dies of her jumping over a log and getting shot by man. Larry Morey, however, felt the scene was too dramatic, {{and that it was}} emotional enough to justify having her death occurring off screen. Walt Disney was also eager to show man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started, but this was discarded when it was decided not to show man at all. There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing like an old married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground, but Disney found that talking flora did not work {{in the context of the}} film, and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead. Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. However, after years of experimentation, Walt felt that the story should focus on the three principal characters: Bambi, Thumper and Flower. The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film.|$|E
25|$|Several {{contrary}} {{claims have}} been made against that the flight capabilities of Confuciusornis. The first of these regarded problems to attain a steep flight path due to a limited wing amplitude. In Senter's {{of the position of}} the shoulder joint, a normal upstroke would be impossible precluding flapping flight entirely. Less radical is the assessment that {{due to the lack of}} a keeled sternum and a high acrocoracoid, the Musculus pectoralis minor could not serve as a M. supracoracoideus lifting the humerus via a tendon running through a foramen triosseum. This, coupled with a limited upstroke caused by a lateral position of the shoulder joint, would have made it difficult to gain altitude. Some authors therefore proposed that Confuciusornis used its large thumb claws to climb tree trunks. Martin assumed that it could raise its torso almost vertically like <b>a</b> <b>squirrel.</b> Daniel Hembree however, while acknowledging that tree climbing was likely, pointed out that the rump was apparently not lifted more than 25° relative to the femur in vertical position, as shown by the location of the antitrochanter in the hip joint. Dieter S. Peters considered it very unlikely that Confuciusornis climbed trunks as turning the thumb claw inwards would stretch the very long wing forwards, right in the path of obstructing branches. Peters sees Confuciusornis as capable of flapping flight but specialised in soaring flight.|$|E
