The drug has a 5 -position amine that is variably acetylated to form a toxic metabolite in humans, increasing adverse effects and complicating the dosing of <b>amonafide.</b> Numonafides, 6 -amino derivatives of <b>amonafide</b> that avoid the toxic acetylation, also show in vitro anticancer activity, as we have previously described. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo activities of two numonafides, 6 -methoxyethylamino-numonafide (MEAN) and 6 -amino-numonafide (AN) with comparisons to <b>amonafide.</b> The in vitro potencies and cellular anticancer mechanisms are similar for the two numonafides and <b>amonafide.</b> Results from several mouse models of human cancer demonstrate that AN and MEAN require slightly higher doses than <b>amonafide</b> for equal efficacy in short-term dosing models, but the same dose of all three compounds in long-term dosing models are equally efficacious. MEAN is tolerated much better than <b>amonafide</b> and AN at equally efficacious doses based on weight change, activity, stool consistency, and dose tolerance with survival as the end point. The studies presented here demonstrate that MEAN is much less toxic than <b>amonafide</b> or AN in mouse models of human liver and gastric cancers while being equally efficacious in vivo and inhibiting cancer cells through similar mechanisms.

40|$|<b>Amonafide</b> is a DNA {{intercalator}} and topoisomerase II inhibitor {{in clinical}} {{development for the}} treatment of neoplastic diseases. <b>Amonafide</b> contains a free arylamine, which causes it to be metabolized in humans by N-acetyl transferase- 2 (NAT 2) into a toxic form. To eliminate the NAT 2 acetylation of <b>amonafide</b> while retaining the anticancer properties, we have synthesized nine derivatives that are structurally similar to <b>amonafide</b> that should not be acetylated. Eight derivatives have arylamines at the 6 -position (vs. 5 -position of <b>amonafide)</b> and one derivative completely lacks the arylamine. The derivative with a free amine in the 6 -position and one with a substituted amine in the 6 -position are not acetylated, whereas <b>amonafide</b> is extensively acetylated as determined by an NAT 2 assay. The biological activities of these compounds were evaluated to determine whether they behaved similarly to <b>amonafide</b> in purified systems and in vitro. We found that three compounds had similar cancer cell-selective growth inhibition to <b>amonafide,</b> while retaining similar subcellular localization, DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition activities. In addition, these compounds were able to eliminate a marker of metastatic potential, the perinucleolar compartment. These three compounds (named numonafides) might thus allow for better patient management than those treated with amonafide; hence, they should be developed further as potential clinical replacements for <b>amonafide</b> or as novel anticancer drugs...|$|E

CALGB 8642 randomizes previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients either to one of several Phase II agents given for up to four cycles and then followed by standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin- 5 -fluorouracil, or to immediate treatment with standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin- 5 -fluorouracil. The end point of CALGB 8642 is to assess the difference in survival, toxicity, and overall response when limited exposure to Phase II agents precedes standard chemotherapy.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{antitumor}} drugs including naphthalimides, {{a new class}} of intercalating agents, interfere with the DNA breakage-reunion activity of mammalian DNA topoisomerase II resulting in DNA cleavage stimulation. In this work, the sequence specificity of a lead compound of this series, <b>amonafide,</b> in stimulating DNA cleavage by murine topoisomerase II has been studied. Amonafide-stimulated cleavage intensity patterns were markedly different from those of other antitumor drugs by using pBR 322 and SV 40 DNAs. This drug had an unusually high site selectivity since about 60 % of DNA cleavage was observed at only one site in pBR 322 DNA, and at two sites in SV 40 DNA. A total of ninety-four drug-stimulated sites were collected, and a statistical analysis of their sequences showed that <b>amonafide</b> highly prefers a cytosine, and excludes guanines and thymines instead, at position - 1. A lower preference for an adenine at position + 1 was also noted. In agreement with the statistical analysis, the DNA sequences of the three sites stimulated by <b>amonafide</b> at exceptionally high levels showed that the drug requirements of a cytosine (- 1) and adenine (+ 1) were present in both the two strands. In addition, a particular feature of these prominent cleavage sites was the presence of an inverted repeat from position - 3 to + 7. Comparison of <b>amonafide</b> stimulation of DNA cleavage in oligonucleotides bearing base mutations at positions - 2, - 3 and/or + 6, + 7 suggested that DNA sequence, and not a putative cruciform structure, was critical for drug action. Moreover, the results showed that, for strong cleavage stimulation, the primary drug requirements at - 1 and + 1 positions were not sufficient and that the sequence 5 '-WRC decreases A- 3 ' (W, A or T; R, A or G) is required from - 3 to + 1 positions at both strands. The results suggest that the exceptionally high sequence specificity of <b>amonafide</b> is the result of optimal drug interactions with both the two enzyme subunits...|$|E

40|$|Naphthalimides, {{particularly}} <b>amonafide</b> and 2 -(2 -dimethylamino) - 6 -thia- 2 -aza-benzo[def]chrysene- 1, 3 -diones (R 16), {{have been}} identified to possess anticancer activities and to induce G 2 -M arrest through inhibiting topoisomerase II accompanied by Chk 1 degradation. The current {{study was designed to}} precisely dissect the signaling pathway(s) responsible for the naphthalimide-induced cell cycle arrest in human colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells. Using phosphorylated histone H 3 and mitotic protein monoclonal 2 as mitosis markers, we first specified the G 2 arrest elicited by the R 16 and <b>amonafide.</b> Then, R 16 and <b>amonafide</b> were revealed to induce phosphorylation of the DNA damage sensor ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) responding to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Inhibition of ATM by both the pharmacological inhibitor caffeine and the specific small interference RNA (siRNA) rescued the G 2 arrest elicited by R 16, indicating its ATM-dependent characteristic. Furthermore, depletion of Chk 2, but not Chk 1 with their corresponding siRNA, statistically significantly reversed the R 16 - and amonafide-triggered G 2 arrest. Moreover, the naphthalimides phosphorylated Chk 2 in an ATM-dependent manner but induced Chk 1 degradation. These data indicate that R 16 and <b>amonafide</b> preferentially used Chk 2 as evidenced by the differential ATM-executed phosphorylation of Chk 1 and Chk 2. Thus, a clear signaling pathway can be established, in which ATM relays the DNA DSBs signaling triggered by the naphthalimides to the checkpoint kinases, predominantly to Chk 2,which finally elicits G 2 arrest. The mechanistic elucidation not only favors the development of the naphthalimides as anticancer agents but also provides an alternative strategy of Chk 2 inhibition to potentiate the anticancer activities of these agents...|$|E
40|$|Several naphthalimides {{have been}} {{evaluated}} clinically as potential anticancer agents. UNBS 3157, a naphthalimide that belongs to the same class as <b>amonafide,</b> was designed to avoid the specific activating metabolism that induces amonafide’s hematotoxicity. The current study shows that UNBS 3157 rapidly and irreversibly hydrolyzes to UNBS 5162 without generating <b>amonafide.</b> In vivo UNBS 5162 after repeat administration significantly increased survival in orthotopic human prostate cancer models. Results obtained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) using UNBS 3157 and UNBS 5162 against the NCI 60 cell line panel did not show a correlation with any other compound present in the NCI database, including <b>amonafide,</b> thereby suggesting a unique mechanism of action for these two novel naphthalimides.

Our viability assay showed that B 1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl- 2 in human promyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells. Various apoptosis assessment assays showed that B 1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl- 2 in HL 60 cells by inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, we elucidated the marked downregulation of 14 - 3 - 3 s protein by B 1, indicating that B 1 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl- 2 inHL 60 cells via 14 - 3 - 3 s.

Derivatives of azonafide have shown enhanced activity against various cancer models, especially leukemias, breast cancer and melanoma. Naphthalimides in general and <b>amonafide</b> in particular, are most probably the agents which {{have been involved in}} the greatest number of clinical trials without ever acceding to the market because of dose-limiting toxicity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 365 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either immediate chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) or up to four cycles of one of five sequential cohorts of single-agent drugs: trimetrexate, melphalan, <b>amonafide,</b> carboplatin, or elsamitrucin, followed by CAF. RESULTS: The toxicity of each single agent followed by CAF was {{comparable to that of}} CAF alone. The cumulative response rates for the single agent followed by CAF were not statistically different from those of CAF alone (44 % v 52 %; P =. 24). However, in the multivariate analysis, patients with visceral disease had a trend toward lower response rates on the phase II agent plus CAF arm (P =. 078). Although survival and response duration also were not statistically significantly different between the two study arms (P =. 074 and P =. 069, respectively), there was a suggestion of benefit for the CAF-only arm. CONCLUSION: The brief use of a phase II agent, regardless of its efficacy, followed by CAF resulted in response rates, toxicities, durations of response, and survival statistically equivalent to those seen with the use of CAF alone.

40|$|Ethonafide is an anthracene-containing {{derivative}} of <b>amonafide</b> {{that belongs to}} the azonafide series of anticancer agents. The lack of cross-resistance in MDR-expressing cancer cell lines {{and the absence of}} a quinone and hydroquinone moiety make ethonafide a possible less-cardiotoxic replacement for existing anthracene-containing anticancer agents, such as mitoxantrone and doxorubicin. For this study, we investigated the anticancer activity and mechanism of action of ethonafide in human prostate cancer cell lines. Ethonafide was cytotoxic against three human prostate cancer cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. Ethonafide was also found to be better tolerated and more effective at inhibiting tumor growth compared to mitoxantrone in DU 145 prostate cancer-bearing mice. Mechanistically, we found that ethonafide inhibits topoisomerase II activity in human prostate cancer cell lines and equally inhibits purified topoisomerase IIα and recombinant topoisomerase IIβ. The inhibition of topoisomerase II activity was due to stabilization of the cleavable complex, involving both topoisomerase IIα and β. By creating stable DU 145 cell lines with decreased expression of either topoisomerase IIα or β, we found that topoisomerase IIα is necessary for ethonafide-induced cytotoxicity. The decrease in sensitivity to ethonafide was due to a decrease in DNA damage and an increase in DNA repair as measured by the neutral comet assay. Additionally, ethonafide induces potent G₂ cell cycle arrest in the DU 145 human prostate cancer cell line. Ethonafide also induces apoptosis as measured by procaspase and PARP cleavage. In conclusion, we have identified ethonafide as a topoisomerase II poison and determined that it is topoisomerase IIα-specific in the DU 145 human prostate cancer cell line. Due to ethonafide’s activity in vitro and in vivo, decreased toxicity in mice compared to mitoxantrone, and its activity in multi-drug resistant cancer cell lines, ethonafide may be a suitable replacement to mitoxantrone for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Topoisomerase {{inhibiting}} chemotherapy is {{most appropriate}} in cancers containing {{high levels of}} topoisomerase. Study of these drugs is particularly difficult because two receptors, enzyme plus DNA, are involved. Genes of all three known human topoisomerases have neighboring oncogenes and those amplified receptors {{may be used to}} target topoisomerase inhibitors to transformed cells. To facilitate design of inhibitors, modeling tools of graphic imaging, sequence analysis, homology, molecular dynamics, energy evaluation, and QSAR were used. The principle findings are: (a) The widely accepted model of 5 ' attachment to DNA and 5 ' overhang is inconsistent with topoisomerase structure; 3 ' overhang is more likely. (b) The active site region near the catalytic tyrosine hydroxyl is well conserved between yeast and humans with some exceptions: 4 Å away Glu 554 ->His 566 is likely to modify the proton transport of the trans-esterification reaction conducted by this enzyme; two base pairs away, the yeast Asp 552 appears to probe the DNA major groove and becomes an oppositely charged Arg 565 in humans; 8 - 15 A away along the probable location of DNA backbone, the acid pair Glu-Asp 512 - 13 is conserved and repeated in humans as Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp (522 - 5); these residues might coordinate the required Mg 2 + along with the conserved Asp 635 (644 in humans); the acidic triad 590 - 2 evolves to a hydroxy triad and might provide a proton transport pathway for the trans-esterification reaction. (c) Drug resistant mutant structure analysis suggests multiple sites of action on topoisomerase and suggests the region of DNA binding. (d) Prediction of intercalator binding to DNA is correctly ranked by molecular mechanics for <b>amonafide</b> and azonafide; however, there remains significant error from experimental cytotoxicity; force field error derives from the approximation of electron orbitals as van der Waals spheres, lack of polarization functions, poor handling of hydrogen bond variability, and force field parameterization from packed protein crystals. (e) Wide variability of the azonafide analogs on whole cell assays makes QSAR difficult and suggests other biochemical pathways are affected; the measurements need to be redone on a simple enzyme-DNA assay...|$|E
