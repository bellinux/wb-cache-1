40|$|SummaryGraded {{guidance}} {{labels are}} widely used in neural map formation, {{but it is not}} well understood which potential strategy leads to their graded expression. In midbrain tectal map development, FGFs can induce an entire midbrain, but their protein distribution is unclear, nor is it known whether they may act instructively to produce graded gene expression. Using a receptor-alkaline phosphatase fusion probe, we find a long-range posterior > <b>anterior</b> FGF protein <b>gradient</b> spanning the midbrain. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) is required for this gradient. To test whether graded FGF concentrations can instruct graded gene expression, a quantitative tectal explant assay was developed. Engrailed- 2 and ephrin-As, normally in posterior > <b>anterior</b> tectal <b>gradients,</b> showed graded upregulation. Moreover, EphAs, normally in anterior > posterior countergradients, showed coordinately graded downregulation. These results provide a mechanism to establish graded mapping labels and more generally provide a developmental strategy to coordinately induce a structure and pattern its cell properties in gradients...|$|R

Currently, the clinical {{emphasis is placed on}} the radiological and genetic aspects for the diagnosis of lissencephaly. MethodsThis is a retrospective review of consecutive EEG recordings and imaging data from 14 children, with the diagnosis of lissencephaly, who were admitted from January 1998 to January 2010. All EEG recordings were performed with the 10 – 20 system of electrode placement, in both awake and sleep states. All EEG recordings were reviewed using anterior-posterior bipolar and transverse montages and then they were interpreted blindly, with respect to the imaging and genetic investigations for each patient. ResultsAll children showed one of the three characteristic EEG patterns reported in the literature of lissencephaly. The EEG pattern I, showed an <b>anterior</b> posterior <b>gradient</b> that corresponded to the severity of the imaging study abnormality. All patients were on two or more AEDs and reported to continue having active epilepsy. ConclusionIn a child with clinical characteristics of lissencephaly, one of these three reported EEG patterns can prove useful in making the diagnosis very probable, preceding imaging and genetic testing...|$|R

The {{natural history of}} Barrett metaplasia and its neoplastic progression are still controversial. <b>Anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 is up-regulated in both Barrett intestinal metaplasia and Barrett adenocarcinoma, but no information is available on <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 expression in the spectrum of the phenotypic changes occurring in {{the natural history of}} Barrett adenocarcinoma (Barrett esophagus cardiac-type metaplasia, Barrett esophagus intestinal metaplasia, low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia [formerly called low-grade dysplasia], and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia [formerly called high-grade dysplasia]). Applying immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, this study addressed the role of <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 in Barrett carcinogenesis. <b>Anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 expression was assessed semiquantitatively in 125 consecutive biopsy samples in the adenocarcinoma spectrum arising in Barrett esophagus (Barrett esophagus cardiac-type metaplasia, 25; Barrett esophagus intestinal metaplasia, 25; low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, 25; high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, 25; Barrett adenocarcinoma, 25). Additional biopsy samples of esophageal squamous mucosa (n= 25) served as controls. <b>Anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 messenger RNA expression was also tested (reverse transcription and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) in a different series of 40 samples (esophageal squamous mucosa, 10; Barrett esophagus cardiac-type metaplasia, 10; Barrett esophagus intestinal metaplasia, 10; Barrett adenocarcinoma, 10). <b>Anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 was never expressed in squamous esophageal epithelium but consistently overexpressed (to much the same degree) in the whole spectrum of Barrett disease (Barrett esophagus cardiac-type metaplasia, Barrett esophagus intestinal metaplasia, low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and Barrett adenocarcinoma). <b>Anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 messenger RNA was expressed significantly more in Barrett esophagus cardiac-type metaplasia, Barrett esophagus intestinal metaplasia, and Barrett adenocarcinoma than in native squamous epithelium (P<. 001), with {{no significant differences between the}} 3 groups. <b>Anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 overexpression affects the whole spectrum of the metaplastic/neoplastic lesions involved in Barrett carcinogenesis.

Similar correlations were also seen in the pallidum and orofacial regions of motor and somatosensory cortices.

40|$|Development {{of spatial}} {{patterns}} in multicellular organisms depends on gradients in {{the concentration of}} signaling molecules that control gene expression. In the Drosophila embryo, Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen controls cell fate along 70 % of the anteroposterior axis but is translated from mRNA localized at the <b>anterior</b> pole. <b>Gradients</b> of Bcd and other morphogens are thought to arise through diffusion, but this basic assumption has never been rigorously tested in living embryos. Furthermore, because diffusion sets a relationship between length and time scales, {{it is hard to}} see how patterns of gene expression established by diffusion would scale proportionately as egg size changes during evolution. Here, we show that the motion of inert molecules through the embryo is well described by the diffusion equation on the relevant length and time scales, and that effective diffusion constants are essentially the same in closely related dipteran species with embryos of very different size. Nonetheless, patterns of gene expression in these different species scale with egg length. We show that this scaling can be traced back to scaling of the Bcd gradient itself. Our results, together with constraints imposed by the time scales of development, suggest that the mechanism for scaling is a species-specific adaptation of the Bcd lifetime...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLocalized gene {{expression}} patterns {{are critical for}} establishing body plans in all multicellular animals. In Drosophila, the gap gene hunchback (hb) is expressed in a dynamic pattern in anterior regions of the embryo. Hb protein is first detected as a shallow maternal gradient that prevents expression of posterior gap genes in anterior regions. hb mRNA is also expressed zygotically, first as a broad anterior domain controlled by the Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen, {{and then in a}} stripe at the position of parasegment 4 (PS 4). Here, we show that the PS 4 -hb stripe changes the profile of the <b>anterior</b> Hb <b>gradient</b> by generating a localized peak of protein that persists until after the broad domain has started to decline. This peak is required specifically for the formation of the mesothoracic (T 2) segment. At the molecular level, the PS 4 -hb stripe is critical for activation of the homeotic gene Antennapedia, but does not affect a gradient of Hb repressive activity formed by the combination of maternal and Bcd-dependent Hb. The repressive gradient is critical for establishing the positions of several target genes, including the gap genes Kruppel (Kr), knirps (kni), and giant (gt), and the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx). Different Hb concentrations are sufficient for repression of gt, kni, and Ubx, but a very high level of Hb, or a combinatorial mechanism, is required for repression of Kr. These results suggest that the individual phases of hb transcription, which overlap temporally and spatially, contribute specific patterning functions in early embryogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Limb {{regeneration}} in salamanders proceeds by {{formation of}} the blastema, a mound of proliferating mesenchymal cells surrounded by a wound epithelium. Regeneration by the blastema depends {{on the presence of}} regenerating nerves and in earlier work it was shown that axons upregulate the expression of newt <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> (nAG) protein first in Schwann cells of the nerve sheath and second in dermal glands underlying the wound epidermis. The expression of nAG protein after plasmid electroporation was shown to rescue a denervated newt blastema and allow regeneration to the digit stage. We have examined the dermal glands by scanning and transmission electron microscopy combined with immunogold labelling of the nAG protein. It is expressed in secretory granules of ductless glands, which apparently discharge by a holocrine mechanism. No external ducts were observed in the wound epithelium of the newt and axolotl. The larval skin of the axolotl has dermal glands but these are absent under the wound epithelium. The nerve sheath was stained post-amputation in innervated but not denervated blastemas with an antibody to axolotl <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> protein. This antibody reacted with axolotl Leydig cells in the wound epithelium and normal epidermis. Staining was markedly decreased in the wound epithelium after denervation but not in the epidermis. Therefore, in both newt and axolotl the regenerating axons induce nAG protein in the nerve sheath and subsequently the protein is expressed by gland cells, under (newt) or within (axolotl) the wound epithelium, which discharge by a holocrine mechanism. These findings serve to unify the nerve dependence of limb regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Proteomic {{technologies}} verified <b>Anterior</b> <b>Gradient</b> 2, AGR- 2, as {{a protein}} over-expressed in human cancers, including breast, prostate and oesophagus cancers, {{with the ability}} to inhibit the tumour suppressor protein p 53. AGR- 2 gene is a hormone responsive gene with an unexpected induction by the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen highlighting the proto-oncogenic role of this protein. Anterior Gradient- 2 encodes one protein that gives rise to two forms· the full length and the mature one. Full length bears a leader sequence that leads the protein to secretion. Localization studies of both forms of AGR- 2 were performed using fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation, in order to determine in which compartment the protein functions. Localization mutants of the mature and full length protein determined the exact sequence required for certain localization patterns. Once localization was confirmed, the mechanism of how Anterior Gradient- 2 localization within the cell can inhibit p 53 was initiated. Furthermore, novel peptide aptamers that bound to the protein were cloned into GFP vectors and their effect on AGR- 2 was investigated. AGR- 3, another member of the family, was also examined in terms of localization and function in MCF- 7 cells. Yeast two hybrid analysis has identified potential nuclear and cytoplasmic binding partners for AGR- 2, essential for the upstream or downstream regulation of the AGR- 2 pathway. In conclusion, we present data showing models of how the <b>Anterior</b> <b>Gradient</b> protein family might function as drug-resistance survival factor in cancer as well as a p 53 inhibitor, suggesting a multi-potent role of its members when it comes to trafficking, cellular localization and activation or inhibition pathways in cancer.

40|$|The {{striatum}} {{is a large}} brain nucleus with {{an important}} role in the control of movement and emotions. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are striatal output neurons forming prominent descending axon tracts that target different brain nuclei. However, how MSN axon tracts in the forebrain develop remains poorly understood. Here, we implicate the Wnt binding receptor Frizzled 3 in several uncharacterized aspects of MSN pathway formation [i. e., anterior-posterior guidance of MSN axons in the striatum and their subsequent growth into the globus pallidus (GP), an important (intermediate) target]. In Frizzled 3 knock-out mice, MSN axons fail to extend along the anterior-posterior axis of the striatum, and many do not reach the GP. Wnt 5 a acts as an attractant for MSN axons in vitro, is expressed in a posterior high, <b>anterior</b> low <b>gradient</b> in the striatum, and Wnt 5 a knock-out mice phenocopy striatal anterior-posterior defects observed in Frizzled 3 mutants. This suggests that Wnt 5 a controls anterior-posterior guidance of MSN axons through Frizzled 3. Axons that reach the GP in Frizzled 3 knock-out mice fail to enter this structure. Surprisingly, entry of MSN axons into the GP non-cell-autonomously requires Frizzled 3, and our data suggest that GP entry may be contingent on the correct positioning of "corridor" guidepost cells for thalamocortical axons by Frizzled 3. Together, these data dissect MSN pathway development and reveal (non) cell-autonomous roles for Frizzled 3 in MSN axon guidance. Further, they are the first to identify a gene that provides anterior-posterior axon guidance in a large brain nucleus and link Frizzled 3 to corridor cell development...|$|R

The Tribolium caudal (Tc-cad) gene arrangement {{is unusual in}} {{that there is a}} partial duplication of the gene resulting in alternative transcripts with identical 5 '-exons, but different 3 '-exons encoding two different homeoboxes. Expression analysis was done by whole-mount in situ hybridization and by staining with an antibody raised against the N-terminal part of the protein that is common to both transcripts. At early stages we observe a homogeneously distributed maternal mRNA which is initially also translated throughout the embryo. A little later, a posterior to <b>anterior</b> CAD protein <b>gradient</b> is formed, very similar to that in Drosophila. However, because of the differences in the fate map between Drosophila and Tribolium, the CAD protein expression at blastoderm stage covers the prospective head and thoracic region and not the abdomen as in Drosophila. Expression of Tc-cad in the prospective abdomen is only seen during further germband growth where it becomes restricted to the growth zone in which the segments are formed. This expression is very similar to the growth zone expression in the somitogenic region seen for cad homologues in vertebrates. After the completion of the segmentation process Tc-cad expression becomes confined to a terminal stripe which resembles a similar stripe at late blastoderm stages in Drosophila...|$|R
40|$|Shvartsman et al. [1] have {{recently}} proposed {{a mathematical model}} of the EGF receptor pathway activation in the predevelopment of dorsal appendages (DA) in Drosophila. In particular, a one-dimensional model for {{the interaction of the}} ligands: Gurken, Rhomboid, Spitz, and Argos, was presented, with a predefined Gurken shape and evolution. With their model, they were able to reproduce many of the observed behaviors of these ligands about the midline of the anterior – dorsal region of the oocyte, and even predict mutations. A subsequent experimental study [2] showed that the number of DA varies between species of Drosophila and is related to differences in the expression of Argos and Rhomboid. This is a startling demonstration of the power of mathematics for predicting the range of states available to a biological system. Here, we present results of a 2 -dimensional (2 D) extension to the above model. With an axisymmetric concentration of Gurken, the 2 D model predicts the possibility of concentric rings of DA. Indeed concentric rings have been observed in experiments in which the oocyte nucleus was (abnormally) localized in the posterior region [3]. By including an additional morphogen, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), which is known to display an <b>anterior</b> – posterior <b>gradient</b> in <b>anterior</b> – dorsal follicle cells, we demonstrate that Dpp can determine the anterior – posterior extent of the DA follicle cell patterning...|$|R
40|$|Androgens and {{oestrogens}} {{have been}} implicated in prostatic carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Although the actions of androgens have been studied extensively, the mechanisms underlying oestrogen signalling in prostate cancer are not fully understood. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of androgens and oestrogens on the expression of <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 (AGR 2) and <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 3 (AGR 3), comprising two highly-related genes encoding secretory proteins that are expressed in prostate cancer and one of which (AGR 2) {{has been associated with}} tumour metastasis. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR and western blot analysis showed androgen induction of AGR 2 and AGR 3 in three androgen receptor positive cell lines, starting at concentrations of 0. 1 nm. Both AGR genes were also transcriptionally activated by >/= 5 nM oestradiol but not by isotype selective or nonselective oestrogen receptor agonists in DUCaP cells that harbour a high-level of wild-type androgen receptor. A functional androgen receptor but not oestrogen receptor turned out to be required for both androgen and oestrogen regulation. This pattern of androgen and oestrogen regulation was confirmed in VCaP cells and was also observed for FKBP 5, a well-characterized androgen-regulated gene. Genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies coupled with deep sequencing identified androgen receptor binding sites localized in the distal promoter and intron regions of the AGR 2 and AGR 3 genes, respectively. The androgen responsiveness of these enhancers was verified by luciferase reporter gene assays and site-directed mutagenesis analysis. Androgen treatment also induced p 300 and RNA Pol II recruitment to androgen receptor enhancers of AGR 2 and initiated local chromatin remodelling and the formation of RNA Pol II-containing androgen receptor transcription complexes...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{occlusion}} {{of objects}} is ubiquitous in nature. We {{have shown that}} Rhesus monkeys are able to identify partially occluded stimuli as long as diagnostic image parts remain visible. Based on these results, we constructed partially occluded variants {{for a number of}} natural scenes, so that the scenes’ diagnostic parts were either visible or occluded. Here we report how the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in area TE depend on the diagnosticity of a visible image region. The LFP was recorded from a total of 214 sites in two Rhesus monkeys. We sampled a large extent of area TE ranging from AP 11 to 23 mm, and covering the lower bank of the STS and lateral TE. LFPs were characterized by computing the visual evoked potentials (VEPs). In both monkeys, we found sites at which diagnosticity was a significant determinant of VEP amplitude. Interestingly, these sites were distributed according to a posterior to <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient,</b> and were more common in anterior TE (χ 2 -test, p<. 001). We also examined how diagnosticity modulated the raw LFP amplitudes. Again, the influence of diagnosticity on the LFP increased from posterior to anterior recording locations (correlation with recording location, p<. 01). An analysis of single neuron responses recorded at the same sites revealed no significant differences along this posterior to anterior axis (correlation with recording location, p=. 59). Our results reveal a posterior to <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> in LFP amplitudes reflecting the extraction of diagnostic image parts. Such effects were not seen in single neuron responses collected at these sites. Because LFPs provide an estimate of local dendritic processing, our findings are consistent with the idea that diagnosticity is first encoded in posterior TE, but not in the preceding visual areas. These findings suggest that LFPs provide information about the distribution of function in the ventral pathway that is not available from single neuron activity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nemertodermatida is {{the sister}} {{group of the}} Acoela, which {{together}} form the Acoelomorpha, a taxon that comprises bilaterally symmetric, small aquatic worms. While there are several descriptions of the embryology of acoel species, descriptions of nemertodermatid development are scarce. To be able to reconstruct the ground pattern of the Acoelomorpha {{it is crucial to}} gain more information about the development of several nemertodermatid species. Here we describe the development of the nemertodermatid Meara stichopi using light and fluorescent microscopic methods. Results: We have collected Meara stichopi during several seasons and reconstruct the complex annual reproductive cycle dependent on the sea cucumber Parastichopus tremulus. Using common fluorescent markers for musculature (BODIPY FL-phallacidin) and neurons (antibodies against FMRFamide, serotonin, tyrosinated-tubulin) and live imaging techniques, we followed embryogenesis which takes approximately 9 – 10 weeks. The cleavage pattern is stereotypic up to the 16 -cell stage. Ring- and longitudinal musculature start to develop during week 6, followed by the formation of the basiepidermal nervous system. The juvenile is hatching without mouth opening and has a basiepidermal nerve net with two dorsal neurite bundles and an anterior condensation. Conclusions: The development of Meara stichopi differs from the development of Acoela in that it is less stereotypic and does not follow the typical acoel duet cleavage program. During late development Meara stichopi does not show a temporal <b>anterior</b> to posterior <b>gradient</b> during muscle and nervous system formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) studies of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) {{have focused on the}} hippocampus and entorhinal cortex; gray matter structures in the medial temporal lobe. Few studies have investigated the integrity of white matter in patients with AD or MCI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a MRI technique that allows for the interrogation of the microstructural integrity of white matter. Based on increases in translational diffusion (mean diffusivity: MD) and decreases directional diffusion (fractional anisotropy: FA) damage to white matter can be assessed. Studies have identified regions of increased MD and decreased FA in patients with AD and MCI in all lobes of the brain, as well as medial temporal lobe structures including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal white matter. The pattern of white matter integrity disruption tends to follow an <b>anterior</b> to posterior <b>gradient</b> with greater damage noted in posterior regions in AD and MCI. Recent studies have exploited inter-voxel directional similarities to develop models of white matter pathways, and have used these models to assess the integrity of inter-cerebral connections. Particular focus has been applied to the parahippocampal white matter (including the perforant path) and the posterior cingulum. Although many studies have found DTI indicators of impaired white matter in AD and MCI, other studies have failed to detect any differences in MD or FA between the groups, demonstrating the need for large replicative studies.

40|$|In {{the limb}} bud, {{patterning}} along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis {{is controlled by}} Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), a signaling molecule secreted by the "Zone of Polarizing Activity", an organizer tissue located in the posterior margin of the limb bud. We {{have found that the}} transcription factors GATA 4 and GATA 6, which are key regulators of cell identity, are expressed in an <b>anterior</b> to posterior <b>gradient</b> in the early limb bud, raising the possibility that GATA transcription factors may play an additional role in patterning this tissue. While both GATA 4 and GATA 6 are expressed in an A-P gradient in the forelimb buds, the hindlimb buds principally express GATA 6 in an A-P gradient. Thus, to specifically examine the role of GATA 6 in limb patterning we generated Prx 1 -Cre; GATA 6 (fl/fl) mice, which conditionally delete GATA 6 from their developing limb buds. We found that these animals display ectopic expression of both Shh and its transcriptional targets specifically in the anterior mesenchyme of the hindlimb buds. Loss of GATA 6 in the developing limbs results in the formation of preaxial polydactyly in the hindlimbs. Conversely, forced expression of GATA 6 throughout the limb bud represses expression of Shh and results in hypomorphic limbs. We have found that GATA 6 can bind to chromatin (isolated from limb buds) encoding either Shh or Gli 1 regulatory elements that drive expression of these genes in this tissue, and demonstrated that GATA 6 works synergistically with FOG co-factors to repress expression of luciferase reporters driven by these sequences. Most significantly, we have found that conditional loss of Shh in limb buds lacking GATA 6 prevents development of hindlimb polydactyly in these compound mutant embryos, indicating that GATA 6 expression in the anterior region of the limb bud blocks hindlimb polydactyly by repressing ectopic expression of Shh...|$|R

We had the hypothesis that nAG might have an inhibitory effect on collagen production since excessive collagen production results in scarring, which is a major enemy to regeneration. nAG gene was designed, synthesized, and cloned. The cloned vector was then transfected into primary human fibroblasts. The results showed that the expression of nAG protein in primary human fibroblast cells suppresses the expression of collagen I and III, with or without TGF-β 1 stimulation. This suppression is due to a dual effect of nAG both by decreasing collagen synthesis and by increasing collagen degradation. Furthermore, nAG had an inhibitory effect on proliferation of transfected fibroblasts. It was concluded that nAG suppresses collagen through multiple effects...|$|E
40|$|In short germ embryos, {{the germ}} rudiment forms at the {{posterior}} ventral {{side of the}} egg, while the anterior-dorsal region becomes the extra-embryonic serosa, It {{is difficult to see}} how an <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> like that of bicoid in Drosophila could in these embryos be directly involved in patterning of the germ rudiment. Moreover, since it has not yet been possible to recover a bicoid homologue from any species outside the diptera, it has been speculated that the anterior bicoid gradient could be a late addition during insect evolution. We addressed this question by analysing the regulation of potential target genes of bicoid in the short germ embryo of Tribolium castaneum. We demonstrate that homologues of caudal and hunchback from Tribolium are regulated by Drosophila bicoid, In Drosophila, maternal caudal RNA is translationally repressed by bicoid, We find that Tribolium caudal RNA is also translationally repressed by bicoid, when it is transferred into Drosophila embryos under a maternal promoter. This strongly suggests that a functional bicoid homologue must exist in Tribolium, The second target gene, hunchback, is transcriptionally activated by bicoid in Drosophila. Transfer of the regulatory region of Tribolium hunchback into Drosophila also results in regulation by early maternal factors, including bicoid, but in a pattern that is more reminiscent of Tribolium hunchback expression, namely in two early blastoderm domains. Using enhancer mapping constructs and footprinting, we show that caudal activates the posterior of these domains via a specific promoter. Our experiments suggest that a major event in the evolutionary transition from short to long germ embryogenesis was the switch from activation of the hunchback gap domain by caudal to direct activation by bicoid, This regulatory switch can explain how this domain shifted from a posterior location in short germ embryos to its anterior position in long germ insects, and it also suggest how an <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> can pattern the germ rudiment in short germ embryos, i. e. by regulating the expression of caudal...|$|E

The present study shows that AGR 2 induces expression of amphiregulin (AREG), a growth promoting EGFR ligand. Induced AREG expression in adenocarcinoma cells is able to rescue the transformed phenotype that is lost when AGR 2 expression is reduced.

The protein exists in monomer-dimer equilibrium with a K(d) of 8. 83 ??M, and intermolecular salt bridges involving E 60 and K 64 within the folded domain serve to stabilize the dimer. The unstructured region is primarily responsible for the ability of AGR 2 to promote cell adhesion, while dimerization is less important for this activity. The structural data of AGR 2 show a separation between potential catalytic redox activity and adhesion function within the context of metastasis and development...|$|E
40|$|Nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) {{has a high}} metastatic {{character in}} the clinic, but its mechanism is not clear. As a carcinogen with organ specificity for the nasopharyngeal epithelium, N,N 9 -Dinitrosopiperazine (DNP) is involved in NPC metastasis. Herein, our data revealed that <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 (AGR 2) was overexpressed in human NPC tissues, particularly in cervical lymph node metastatic NPC (LMNPC). High AGR 2 expression was associated with NPC metastasis. Importantly, DNP induced AGR 2 expression, and increased cell motility and invasion in the NPC cell line 6 – 10 B. However, DNP-mediated cell motility and invasion was dramatically decreased when transfected with siRNA-AGR 2. Further, AGR 2 directly regulated cathepsin (CTS) B and D by binding them in vitro. These results indicate that DNP induces AGR 2 expression, regulates CTSB and CTSD, increases cell motility and invasion, and promotes NPC tumor metastasis. Therefore, DNP-mediated AGR 2 expression {{may be an important}} factor in prolific NPC metastasis...|$|E
40|$|Mouthbrooding is an {{elaborate}} form of parental care displayed by many teleost species. While the direct benefits of mouthbrooding such as protection and transportation of offsprings are known, {{it is unclear}} if mouthbrooding offers additional benefits to embryos during incubation. In addition, mouthbrooding could incur negative costs on parental fish, due to limited feeding opportunities. Parental tilapia fish (Oreochromis spp.) display {{an elaborate}}d form of parental care by incubating newly hatched embryos in oral buccal cavity until the complete adsorption of yolk sac. In {{order to understand the}} functional aspects of mouthbrooding, we undertake a proteomics approach to compare oral mucus sampled from mouthbrooders and non-mouthbrooders, respectively. Majority of the identified proteins have also been previously identified in other biological fluids or mucus-rich organs in different organisms. We also showed the upregulation of 22 proteins and down regulation of 3 proteins in mucus collected from mouthbrooders. <b>Anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> protein, hemoglobin beta-A chain and alpha- 2 globin levels were lower in mouthbrooder samples. Mouthbrooder oral mucus collectively showed increase levels of proteins related to cytoskeletal properties, glycolytic pathway and mediation of oxidative stress. Overal...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 (AGR 2) is {{a protein}} {{disulfide}} isomerase-like protein widely expressed in many normal tissues {{as well as}} cancers. In our study, non-neoplastic bronchial epithelial cells as well as {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) cells express AGR 2 protein. Methods: AGR 2 expression was analyzed on lung tissue microarrays. Tumor staining was correlated with clinical outcomes. Results: On a lung cancer tissue microarray using immunohistochemistry, expression levels in cancer showed generally decreasing intensities in order from adenocarcinomas with mucinous components, other adenocarcinomas, squamous carcinomas, to large cell carcinomas. The study cohort was comprised of 400 cases. As a group, there was a slight trend of lower expression with increasing tumor grade. AGR 2 expression level {{was a significant predictor of}} overall survival in younger patients only. Patients under 65 with lower levels showed a significantly better survival for both men and women. Patients over 65, in contrast, showed no such trend. Conclusions: Nearly all NSCLC tumors show AGR 2 expression. Lung cancer expression of AGR 2 has prognostic value for younger patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the retinotectal system, {{positional}} {{information has}} long been postulated to {{take the form of}} molecular gradients within both the retina and the tectum. Recent reports have implicated Mek 4, a member of the Eph (also named class V) family of tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs), and two ligands, RAGS and ELF- 1, in this process. Here, we report the cloning and distribution pattern of QEK 5, another member of the Eph family of RTKs, isolated from a quail cDNA library. During retinal differentiation, QEK 5 transcripts accumulate in a ventral to dorsal gradient within the retinal neuroepithelium, where its expression becomes restricted to the ganglion and bipolar cell layers. Within the tectum, QEK 5 transcripts are detectable in a posterior to <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> in the ventricular layer and newly formed superficial layers. The pattern of QEK 5 expression in the retina and tectum is distinct from that of Mek 4, suggesting that complex patterns of Eph RTKs and their ligands {{may play a role in}} cell–cell interactions involved in retinotectal projections and differentiation of the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Biliary tract cancers include cancers of the {{gallbladder}} and extrahepatic bile ducts, and its {{prognosis is}} poor. The <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> 2 (AGR 2) is a protein disulfide isomerase and is highly expressed in various human cancers, such as breast, prostate and pancreas cancers. AGR 2 {{is expressed in}} normal cholangiocytes and its expression is maintained during biliary carcinogenesis. However, the clinical significance of AGR 2 expression in biliary tract cancer {{has not yet been}} assessed. Thus, we examined the expression of AGR 2 protein in biliary tract tumors using immunohistochemistry and its association with various clinicopathologic parameters. This study included 100 patients who underwent surgery for biliary tract cancers: 46 men and 54 women with a mean and median age of 64. 2 and 65. 0 years, respectively. AGR 2 expression was detected in ductal epithelial cells of the normal biliary tract and in 95 % of biliary tract cancer tissues. While the AGR 2 expression was not associated with cancer location, patient age, patient sex, degree of regional lymph node metastasis (N-status), or residual status, the AGR 2 expression leve...|$|E

40|$|Protein {{disulfide}} isomerases (PDIs) aid {{protein folding}} and assembly by catalyzing formation and shuffling of cysteine disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Many {{members of the}} PDI family are expressed in mammals, but the roles of specific PDIs in vivo are poorly understood. A recent homology-based search for additional PDI family members identified <b>anterior</b> <b>gradient</b> homolog 2 (AGR 2), a protein originally presumed to be secreted by intestinal epithelial cells. Here, we show that AGR 2 is present within the ER of intestinal secretory epithelial cells and is essential for in vivo production of the intestinal mucin MUC 2, a large, cysteine-rich glycoprotein that forms the protective mucus gel lining the intestine. A cysteine residue within the AGR 2 thioredoxin-like domain forms mixed disulfide bonds with MUC 2, indicating a direct role for AGR 2 in mucin processing. Mice lacking AGR 2 were viable but were highly susceptible to colitis, indicating a critical role for AGR 2 in protection from disease. We conclude that AGR 2 is a unique member of the PDI family, with a specialized and nonredundant role in intestinal mucus production...|$|E
