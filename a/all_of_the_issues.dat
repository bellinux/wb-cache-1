500|$|Chicago-based singer-songwriter Rickey Allen pushed {{allegations}} that [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{was inspired by}} a song he had composed with the same title and spelling, which was copyrighted in the mid-1990s and 2000 and performed locally during that time. He claimed he handed over a version to producer Maurice Joshua, who allegedly went on to cover the song with Destiny's Child. Joshua denied his claims, noting that he never held a copy of Allen's song. Allen filed a lawsuit against the group for compensation in a Chicago, Illinois court in 2006 where the trio was due to appear in December 10 for an eight-day trial. However, they managed to avoid any given court dates after their public split in 2005 and agreed to settle behind closed doors. In early December 2009 it was confirmed by Chicago Sun-Times that the group had reached a settlement with Allen. His attorney, Matthew Wildermuth, said in a statement, [...] "I can confirm that yes, [...] did settle. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> have been amicably resolved and the case is going to be dismissed. [...] excited about being able to devote time to pursuing his musical career. All legal terms and agreement will not be released and the case will be dismissed by a judge".|$|E
