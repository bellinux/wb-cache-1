In a meeting held by teleconference on 22 September 2006, the SBSTTA Bureau identified, among other issues, the interlinkages between biodiversity and liquid biofuel production as a new and emerging issue for consideration by SBSTTA at its twelfth meeting. The present note, prepared to facilitate the work of SBSTTA, summarizes information from literature and from a six-week electronic forum organized fro...|$|R

50|$|This {{is further}} {{complicated}} by the classified nature of intelligence funding. Currently, appropriations are authorized through a classified <b>appendix</b> or <b>annex</b> <b>to</b> the annual defense appropriations bill and the specific numbers are not released. The 9/11 commission urged the public release of the overall funding amounts, while keeping specific agency funding secret. The current administration opposes the release of this information, citing concerns that the release of such information, even on a broad basis, could benefit America’s enemies. However, specific funding for military intelligence budget is already public released, so the Commission {{saw no reason to}} continue keeping the remainder of the intelligence budget secret. Also, many in Congress are concerns that creating a stand-alone committee responsible for the appropriations while keeping them classified would further complicate the open, public operations of Congress.|$|R

30|$|The six <b>appendices</b> <b>to</b> the {{reference}} guidance were prepared in 2012 {{to address the}} lack of nanospecific guidance. These documents include recommendations on physico-chemical characterization (<b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 7 a), aquatic ecotoxicity and (bio)degradability (<b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 7 b), aquatic bioaccumulation and terrestrial ecotoxicity (<b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 7 c), dose–response characterization, human toxicity (<b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 8), dose–response characterization, environment (<b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 10) and occupational exposure (<b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 14), respectively. Some of the guidance in current appendices is quite extensive, such as the guidance on how to determine particle size distribution, specific surface area, and particle shape in the <b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 7 a. On the other hand, very limited guidance is given on water solubility in that same appendix, on ecotoxicological testing in the <b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 7 b or on dose–response characterization (environment) (<b>appendix</b> <b>to</b> R. 10).|$|R
