They expect a flurry of joint ventures with global majors for expansion capital and opportunity to gain expertise in supply chain management.

With the relaxation in international investments in Indian retail, India’s Foodworld expects its global relationship will only get stronger. Competition and investment in retail will provide more benefits to consumers through lower prices, wider availability and significant improvement in supply chain logistics.|$|E

The President congratulated the pilgrims for {{successfully}} completing the journey and praised the Chinese Muslim Association as an important asset of Taiwan, saying that the association has successfully promoted the frequent contacts and exchanges between Taiwan and the Muslim worlds, and serves as the communication window for Taiwan to those nations. He said that Islam is the current fastest growing religion in the world and has a major role and contribution to mankind and civilization. The core value of Islam is {{that there is only one}} God, people should do good deeds and people should love their fellow men and citizens. He personally believes that Taiwanese Muslims must emphasize the principle of Islam that stresses peace and love in order to enable others to understand the true nature of Islam. He further added that in recent years, Taiwan has made significant progress in expanding affairs with the Muslim world, creating <b>a</b> <b>win-win</b> <b>situation</b> for all parties involved and also triggering more interest in Islam among Taiwanese people. Although there are only around 60,000 Taiwanese Muslims, this community has made Taiwan becomes more diverse and richer in culture. He assured to the local Muslims that the Muslim people in Taiwan will always enjoy religious freedom and that the government will pay close attention to any raising needs to the group. He also hoped that Taiwanese Muslims will participate in Islamic-related international affairs and play even more role in helping Taiwan solidifies itself with the Islamic nations.|$|E

40|$|WHAT IS THE ISSUE? Pricing {{can be a}} {{particular}} challenging issue for marine suppliers with multiple products and services especially when suppliers want to address specific customer needs {{and at the same}} time achieves the efficiency in pricing. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? Appropriate pricing of products-and-services combination can have a much broader impact on the business. First, it will boost the sales and revenue by differentiating customers’ varied preference between offerings while reducing the transaction costs. In addition, it will enhance the competitiveness and minimize the ability of new entrants to compete in the market. Lastly, customer satisfaction and loyalty will be increased accordingly. WHAT CAN BE DONE? The pricing challenge for multiple products and services can be overcome by applying the modular concept on pricing, where each product or service is offered as a module, so suppliers can either set different prices for each module or offer a couple of modules at a bundled price. Pursuing price bundling will allow suppliers to balance the tradeoff between customization and standardization in pricing, thus creating <b>a</b> potential <b>win-win</b> <b>situation...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{reaction}} is equilibrium limited and, being exothermic, is thermodynamically favoured at lower reaction temperatures. However, {{the temperature of}} operation is dictated by the requirement to achieve acceptable process kinetics. Whilst the Haber–Bosch Process can, to some extent, {{be viewed as a}} mature technology, the development of more active (or even more poison tolerant) catalysts which would allow a reduction in the stringent conditions of operation is of significant interest. In this context, it is salient to note that, taken in its entirety, including the provision and purification of reactant feedstreams, on a global scale, the operation of the Haber Process currently consumes 1 – 2  % of the world’s energy demand, e.g. [2, 3]. Therefore, any improvements can potentially yield massive rewards both in terms of economic and environmental benefits. The identification and application of more active catalysts could lead to lowering of the process temperatures and/or pressures of operation necessary to achieve a desired space time yield of product. Indeed, lowered reaction temperatures result in improved obtainable equilibrium yields offering the tantalising prospect of <b>a</b> possible <b>win–win</b> <b>situation,</b> providing sufficiently favourable kinetics can be achieved. This is, however, a very significant challenge.|$|R

There are suggested approaches toward <b>a</b> so-called <b>win-win</b> <b>situation</b> where both industry and environment can benefit. According to ‘Porter Hypothesis’, environmental regulation {{can act as a}} trigger to shoot the target. In the way that, more stringent regulation system will be imposed on a firm, more a firm will be motivated to innovate. The environmental innovation has been divided in two categories: Treatment innovation and Prevention innovation. From the Porter school point of view those firms, which invest in environmental prevention technology, will enjoy innovation offset. Innovation offset can exceed the compliance cost and firms can increase their benefit. In this thesis, this idea that prevention innovation is more profitable than treatment innovation has been investigated. The analysis is based upon Statistic Norway and Norwegian Pollution Control Authority database, which includes observation from approximately 4323 firms in five industrial sections over four years. In general, the empirical finding of this thesis does not support the idea. On the contrary, there is a strong support for profitability of treatment innovation...|$|R
