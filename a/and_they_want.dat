5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

Darlene asks her parents if David can move in, because his mother is moving away <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to stay together. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let him stay because {{it reminded her of}} her own troubled childhood with her equally abusive father.

500|$|Despite the {{armistice}} ending the war, {{and the end}} of the revolts, Luxembourg's own future was still uncertain. [...] Belgium was one of the countries hit hardest by the war; almost the whole of the country was occupied by Germany, and over 43,000 Belgians, including 30,000 civilians, had died as a result. [...] Belgium sought compensation, and had its eye on any and all of its neighbours; in November 1918, Lord Hardinge, the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office, told the Dutch ambassador in London, [...] "The Belgians are on the make, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to grab whatever they can." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and people looking at you." [...] As for others, she believed it could describe high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be who they are. A relationship, or whatever, it is just breaking out and feeling free." [...] Hollywood Records described [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "a self-empowering song in which Miley asserts that she has to stay true to herself in relationships".|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to remain in disguise, George Sr. joins the Blue Man Group. Michael discovers this and {{arranges}} to have his father placed under house arrest. George Sr. claims that he {{was set up by}} an underground British group. Michael goes to Wee Britain, a fictional British-themed city district, to investigate, and in the process meets a new love interest, Rita Leeds (Charlize Theron). Michael and the audience are led to believe that Rita is a mole for the underground British group, working for a man named [...] "Mr. F". However, love-struck Michael proposes to her, and the couple run off to wed. Finally, it is revealed that Rita is actually an [...] "MRF", or [...] "mentally retarded female". Despite Rita's [...] "condition", the family pushes him to go forward with the marriage because Rita is wealthy <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> her money. Michael is not persuaded and gently ends the relationship just as he and Rita are about to walk down the aisle. Meanwhile, Tobias and Lindsay seek legal help from Bob Loblaw (Scott Baio) concerning their troubled marriage.|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|Juliet {{explains}} that Ethan kept {{a stash of}} the serum at a nearby drop point. She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E

500|$|Still {{during the}} race, the {{stewards}} handed Nico Hülkenberg a three-place grid penalty {{for the following}} race in Japan for causing the collision with Felipe Massa on lap 14. Hülkenberg was [...] "frustrated" [...] with the decision, saying: [...] "The accident with Felipe was very unlucky and I don't understand why I've been given a penalty before there has even been the chance to discuss the incident in the stewards' room [...] In my view it was my corner and I'm surprised Felipe backed out of it much too late, locking up just before he hit me." [...] Massa had a different view about the incident, stating: [...] "I was braking for the corner and he turned his car in on mine, leaving me with nowhere to go, so we hit." [...] Force India decided not to appeal the decision. Williams's Head of Vehicle Performance Rob Smedley lamented the slow pit stop of his team that preceded the incident, saying that Massa should have exited the pit lane safely ahead of Hülkenberg. While initial reactions in the United Kingdom agreed with the stewards' decision, German tabloid Bild called the penalty a [...] "joke". Hülkenberg later accepted {{that he was at}} fault and apologised to Massa via text message. Concerning the accident between Button and Maldonado, no further action was taken by the stewards. Jenson Button however followed up on his [...] "mental"-remark during the race, by stating that he felt Maldonado's driving was [...] "very strange" [...] and that he [...] "won't ever change". Maldonado answered by saying: [...] "No driver's happy if there's a car in front of them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to get past, especially if it damages their car trying to overtake [...] We both got damage to our cars; he was behind me trying to get past, I was defending my position. That's racing." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During their negotiations, {{both sides}} {{agreed that the}} opening act from the inaugural show until their {{scheduled}} performance on April 4 in Philadelphia would be Manson's option, stoner rock band Monster Magnet. A dispute arose on who would take over. According to Erlandson and Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, the two groups had a two-hour meeting {{to arrive at a}} resolution. Manson and his band voted for early 1980s Brit-pop groups like Fun Boy Three and Fine Young Cannibals, while members of Hole wanted [...] "more modern" [...] bands. Auf der Maur noted that [...] "we want romance <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> theater. We want love <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> shtick. We had to explain to them that those kinds of bands make them look good, but us look silly". Eventually, Manson's band ceded the selection of the subsequent opening act to Love, who chose Imperial Teen. During their negotiations, both bands agreed to split the cost of producing each show, which resulted in Hole unwittingly financing most of Manson's disproportionately higher production costs at their own expense. The revenue earned at each show would be split 50/50 between the two bands.|$|E

[...] That year, British Midland and British Airways agreed to swap some of their routes, resulting in BMA relinquishing its routes from Birmingham to Brussels and Frankfurt, and BA handing over its routes from Liverpool to London Heathrow, Belfast, Dublin, Jersey, the Isle of Man and Glasgow.

2500|$|In 2009, Higgins was a {{political}} opponent of the Irish government's re-run of the Treaty of Lisbon referendum. He said the guarantees did not change the Treaty.
