40|$|AbstractBackground: Purification of polypeptides and {{proteins}} {{derived from}} recombinant DNA techniques and of long synthetic polypeptides often represents a challenge. Affinity methods exist, but generally require {{addition of a}} large recognition unit to the target protein and use of expensive purification media. Use of large units is dictated by the characteristics of non-covalent complexes, where the energy necessary to form the complex derives from the sum of multiple weak energy interactions. Covalent interactions in contrast are of high energy, even when only a few bonds are formed. We decided to explore {{the use of the}} reversible covalent bond formed between N-terminal cysteine and threonine residues with an aldehyde as a method of protein purification. Results: A series of test peptides with N-terminal cysteine and threonine were captured by a polyethyleneglycol–polyacrylamide resin to which an <b>aldehyde</b> <b>function</b> had been grafted. Peptides with other amino acids at the N-terminus did not interact with the resin. A recombinant polypeptide with N-terminal cysteine was purified to 90 % purity in one step. Polypeptides were eluted from the resin simply by adding a hydroxylamine derivative, which reacts with <b>aldehyde</b> <b>functions</b> to form an oxime. Conclusions: Polypeptides possessing N-terminal cysteine or threonine can be easily purified using this ‘covalent capture’ approach...|$|R

In keeping with previous reports the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) enhanced the intercalation {{of all four}} peptides into lipid monolayers and liposomal bilayers under low ionic strength conditions. Interestingly, similar effect was observed for 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -(9 ′-oxo-nonanoyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (PoxnoPC), a zwitterionic oxidized phospholipid bearing an <b>aldehyde</b> <b>function</b> {{at the end of}} its truncated sn- 2 acyl chain. Instead, the structurally similar 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -azelaoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (PazePC) containing a carboxylic moiety was less efficient in promoting the membrane association of these peptides. Physiological saline reduced the binding of the above peptides to membranes containing PG, whereas interactions with PoxnoPC were found to be insensitive to ionic strength. Notably, membrane intercalation of temporin L, the most surface active of the above peptides could be into PoxnoPC containing monolayers was strongly attenuated by methoxyamine, suggesting the importance of Schiff base formation between peptide amino groups and the lipid <b>aldehyde</b> <b>function.</b> PoxnoPC and similar aldehyde bearing oxidatively modified phospholipids could represent novel molecular targets for AMPs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGelatin is a {{biopolymer}} produced worldwide {{through its}} dissolution rate is variable. During the manufacturing process, gelatin {{is exposed to}} high temperatures known {{to be responsible for}} cross-link formation. Moreover, bleaching agents such as hydrogen peroxide are added to lighten the gelatin, leading to oxidation reactions that form cross-links. Cross-links {{have been reported in the}} literature to be formed between amino acids and related to decreased gelatin dissolution. The variability of gelatin dissolution is important since gelatin is used in the pharmaceutical industry to make hard capsules which have to satisfy strict dissolution specifications. The objective of this study was to determine how the oxidative potential of gelatin may explain the variability of its dissolution. Amino acid composition was assessed by HPLC and gelatin chemical composition was studied with HRMAS-NMR. Iron and aldehyde contents were also measured. Cross-links involving <b>aldehyde</b> <b>functions</b> were strongly suspected to be formed with aging, as were desmosine-like and dityrosine cross-links. All these cross-links were formed during oxidation reactions that are also strongly suspected to occur during aging. In addition, the origin of production affects the oxidative potential of gelatins when considering their iron content. The amount of <b>aldehyde</b> <b>functions,</b> which reflects the oxidation state of gelatins, differed as a function of their origin of production. The dissolution rate of gelatins could be linked to their oxidative potential (iron content) and the aldehydic products of lipid oxidation. Interestingly, the causes for differences in dissolution varied as a function of their origin of production...|$|R

40|$|A new {{strategy}} for AFM (atomic force microscopy) tip functionalization {{based on the}} use of aldehyde-phosphorus dendrimers for the immobilization of biomolecules such as proteins (e. g. antibodies) is presented. Firstly functionalized with amino groups, the tips are reacted with dendrimers leading to dendrimer-activated tips (so-called dendritips). Free <b>aldehyde</b> <b>functions</b> on the dendrimer are therefore available to react with amino-functions present on every protein and many biomolecules. Using biofunctionalized-dendritip, single molecule force interactions between glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and its cognate antibody immobilized on dendritips (67 +/- 11 pN for single interaction) were probed by AFM spectroscopy. The specificity of our measurements was demonstrated by performing blocking tests resulting in the loss of interactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The other pyrazoles 22, 23, 26, 30 and 33 were converted via intramolecular nitrile oxide cycloaddition (INOC) into fused dihydroisoxazoles.

When the coniferaldehyde content in the initial synthetic mixture was more than 30 % (w/w), only a low fraction of condensed products was generated during the K 10 clay hydrolysis step.
