5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of an <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> from acetyl-CoA to an acceptor amine is a ubiquitous biochemical transformation catalyzed by Gcn 5 -related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs). Although it is {{established that the}} reaction proceeds through a sequential ordered mechanism, {{the role of the}} <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> in driving the ordered formation of binary and ternary complexes remains elusive. Herein, we show that CoA and acetyl-CoA alter the conformation of the substrate binding site of an arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) to facilitate interaction with acceptor substrates. However, it is the presence of the <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> within the catalytic funnel that triggers high affinity binding. <b>Acetyl</b> <b>group</b> occupancy is relayed through a conserved salt bridge between the P-loop and the acceptor binding site, and is manifested as differential dynamics in the CoA and acetyl-CoA-bound states. The capacity of the <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> carried by an acceptor to promote its tight binding {{even in the absence of}} CoA, but also its mutually exclusive position to the <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> of acetyl-CoA underscore its importance in coordinating the progression of the catalytic cycle...|$|R

25|$|The {{pharmacology}} {{of heroin}} and morphine is identical except the two <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> increase the lipid solubility of the heroin molecule, causing heroin {{to cross the}} blood–brain barrier and enter the brain more rapidly in injection. Once in the brain, these <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> are removed to yield morphine, which causes the subjective effects of heroin. Thus, heroin may {{be thought of as}} a more rapidly acting form of morphine.|$|E
25|$|In many {{industrial}} wastewater treatment plants, EDTA elimination {{can be achieved}} at about 80% using microorganisms. Resulting byproducts are ED3A and IDA – suggesting that both the backbone and <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> were attacked.

25|$|Sucralose is {{manufactured}} by the selective chlorination of sucrose in a multistep synthesis, which substitutes {{three of the}} hydroxyl groups of sucrose with chlorine atoms. This chlorination is achieved by selective protection of a primary alcohol group, followed by chlorination of the partially acetylated sugar with excess chlorinating agent, and then by removal of the <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> to give the desired sucralose product. A company realignment announced April 21, 2015 moved sucralose production from Tate & Lyle's plant on Jurong Island, Singapore to the recently reopened plant in McIntosh, Alabama.|$|E
50|$|This {{reaction}} {{is known as}} an acetylation reaction, that refers {{to the process of}} introducing an <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> (resulting in an acetoxy group) into a compound, namely the substitution of an <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> for an active hydrogen atom.|$|R
50|$|Acetylation {{refers to}} the process of {{introducing}} an <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> (resulting in an acetoxy group) into a compound, namely the substitution of an <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> for an active hydrogen atom. A reaction involving the replacement of the hydrogen atom of a hydroxyl <b>group</b> with an <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> (CH3 CO) yields a specific ester, the acetate. Acetic anhydride is commonly used as an acetylating agent reacting with free hydroxyl groups. For example, it is used in the synthesis of aspirin, heroin, and THC-O-acetate.|$|R

25|$|Another {{implication}} of histone acetylation {{is to provide}} a platform for protein binding. As a posttranslational modification, the acetylation of histones can attract proteins to elongated chromatin that has been marked by <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups.</b> It has been hypothesized that the histone tails offer recognition sites that attract proteins responsible for transcriptional activation. Unlike histone core proteins, histone tails {{are not part of the}} nucleosome core and are exposed to protein interaction. A model proposed that the acetylation of H3 histones activates gene transcription by attracting other transcription related complexes. Therefore, the acetyl mark provides a site for protein recognition where transcription factors interact with the acetylated histone tails via their bromodomain.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of histone acetylation causing changes in transcription activity {{can be traced}} back to the work of Vicent Allfrey and colleagues in 1964. The group hypothesized that histone proteins modified by <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> added negative charges to the positive lysines, and thus, reduced the interaction between DNA and histones. [...] Histone modification is now considered a major regulatory mechanism that is involved in many different stages of genetic functions. [...] Our current understanding is that acetylated lysine residues on histone tails is associated with transcriptional activation. In turn, deacetylated histones are associated with transcriptional repression. In addition, negative correlations have been found between several histone acetylation marks.|$|E

50|$|Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are {{enzymes that}} acetylate conserved lysine amino acids on histone {{proteins}} by transferring an <b>acetyl</b> <b>group</b> from acetyl-CoA to form ε-N-acetyllysine.

2500|$|Epigenetic marks (epi-marks) are {{temporary}} [...] "switches" [...] {{that control}} how our genes are expressed during gestation and after birth. Moreover, epi-marks [...] are modifications of histone proteins. Epigenetic marks are modifications of the methyl and <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups</b> that bind to DNA histones thereby changing how the proteins function {{and as a}} result, alter gene expression. Epi-marks change how the histones function and as a result, influence the way genes are expressed. Epigenetic marks promote normal sexual development during fetal development; however, they can {{be passed on to}} offspring through the process of mitosis. When they are transferred from one parent to an offspring of the opposite sex, it can contribute to an altered sexual development, thus leading to masculinization of female offspring and feminization of male offspring. However, these epi-marks hold no consistency between individuals in regard to strength and variability.|$|E
2500|$|A loline {{alkaloid}} is {{a member}} of the 1-aminopyrrolizidines (often referred to as lolines), which are bioactive natural products with several distinct biological and chemical features. The lolines are insecticidal and insect-deterrent compounds that are produced in grasses infected by [...] endophytic fungal symbionts of the genus Epichloë (anamorphic species: Neotyphodium). Lolines increase resistance of endophyte-infected grasses to insect herbivores, and may also protect the infected plants from environmental stresses such as drought and spatial competition. They are alkaloids, organic compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms. The basic chemical structure of the lolines comprises a saturated [...] pyrrolizidine ring, a primary amine at the C-1 carbon, and an internal ether bridge—a hallmark feature of the lolines, which is uncommon in organic compounds—joining two distant ring (C-2 and C-7) carbons (see Fig. 1). Different substituents at the C-1 amine, such as methyl, formyl, and <b>acetyl</b> <b>groups,</b> yield loline species that have variable bioactivity against insects. Besides endophyte–grass symbiota, loline alkaloids have also been identified in some other plant species; namely, Adenocarpus species (family Fabaceae) and Argyreia mollis (family Convolvulaceae).|$|E
