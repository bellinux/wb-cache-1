5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D <b>approach</b> due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D <b>approach</b> requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D <b>approach.</b> The 2D-3D hybrid <b>approach</b> in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D <b>approach</b> allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D <b>approach</b> could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D <b>approach</b> for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E
