5000|$|In the anime, the Quartet's {{history of}} being Sailor Soldiers is never shown to viewer {{and the story}} is {{followed}} after they are captured by Queen Nehelenia and is already {{a part of her}} Dead Moon Circus. They begin working for Queen Nehelenia after she appears inside a magical mirror after hearing the Amazoness Quartet playing in a forest, and then offered to keep the Amazoness Quartet from ever growing old in return. Nehelenia changed their dreams into the physical form of <b>Amazon</b> <b>Stones,</b> instructing them to use these to remove the [...] "dream mirrors" [...] of humans.

50|$|Zircon (Jirukon) is Zirconia's {{companion}} and tool, a flaming eyeball with wings. In the beginning, it simply floats around her staff, but later can fly anywhere, and Zirconia {{uses it to}} gather images of those with beautiful dreams. She also uses it as a weapon, or to spy on her underlings. When Zircon is hit hard, any images it has gathered but not yet presented become distorted. It {{can also be used}} as a weapon with which to remove a human's Dream Mirror, similar to the <b>Amazon</b> <b>Stones</b> of the Quartet.|$|R

25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} Taz {{appeared in the}} 2017 DC Comics/Looney Tunes crossover comics, where he was designed more for the DC Universe and faced off against Wonder Woman in the Wonder Woman/Tasmanian Devil Special. In the story, Taz is a Guardian of the Labrynth on Themyscira and fought Diana {{when she was a}} teenager during her trials to become an Amazon warrior. Before Taz could attack her, Diana plays the harp and puts it to sleep before snipping off some of his fur as proof of her victory. She returns to Taz years later as Wonder Woman after Circe uses the Talisman of Eurytale to turn Hippolyta and the other <b>Amazons</b> into <b>stone.</b> As the Talisman can only be stopped by the Minotaur's Amulet, she requests Taz's help as Taz's connection to the other Guardians would lead them down the right path. During the journey, Taz reveals that he wasn't mad at Diana for tricking him, but was rather upset that she took the music away. The two defeat the Minotaur and Circe and the Amazons reward him with a large feast in return. In the issue's backup story (done more {{in the style of the}} classic Looney Tunes shorts), Diana sings to Taz the tale of the Trojan War with her and the Looney Tunes characters roleplaying the major players, but Taz in his dream alters the events to work out more in his favor.|$|R
