5000|$|Early Deep Water Culture (DWC) systems {{consisted}} of a five-gallon bucket, <b>air</b> <b>stone,</b> air pump and net pot with a medium. Five gallon buckets were the favorite of many early adopters of the system as they were readily available at hardware stores. Net pots come in three sizes: 6", 8" [...] and 10". Net pots are then filled with a hydroponic medium such as Hydroton and a Rockwool cube is added in the center that holds {{the base of the}} plant. For Oxygenation of the hydroponic solution, an airstone is added. This <b>air</b> <b>stone</b> is then connected to an airline that runs to an air pump.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{method of}} protein skimming, running pressurized air through a diffuser to produce {{large quantities of}} micro bubbles, remains a viable, effective, and economic choice, although newer technologies may require lower maintenance. The <b>air</b> <b>stone</b> is most often an oblong, partially hollowed block of wood, most often of the genus Tilia. The most popular wooden air-stones for skimmers are made from limewood (Tilia europaea or European limewood) although basswood (Tilia americana or American Linden), works as well, may be cheaper and is often more readily available. The wooden blocks are drilled, tapped, fitted with an air fitting, and connected by air tubing {{to one or more}} air pumps delivering at least 1 cfm. The wooden <b>air</b> <b>stone</b> is placed {{at the bottom of a}} tall column of water. The tank water is pumped into the column, allowed to pass by the rising bubbles, and back into the tank. To get enough contact time with the bubble, these units can be many feet in height.|$|E

50|$|Masonry piers {{were built}} to heights of almost 120 ft, about {{the height of}} a ten-story building. About 78 ft of that span was driven through the sandy {{riverbed}} until it hit bedrock. Eads implemented a building method that he had observed in Europe, whereby masonry was set atop a metal chamber filled with compressed <b>air.</b> <b>Stone</b> was added to the chamber, which caused the caisson to sink. Workers then dove into the caisson to shovel sand into a pump that shot it out into the air so the masonry could be sunk into the riverbed. Thirteen men died during this process and two were paralyzed, suffering from what we now know as the bends. Still today, the Eads Bridge is built on the deepest pneumatic caisson ever constructed.|$|E
50|$|Reoxygenating {{the system}} {{water is a}} crucial part to obtaining high {{production}} densities. Fish require oxygen to metabolize food and grow, as do bacteria communities in the biofilter. Dissolved oxygen levels can be increased through two methods aeration and oxygenation. In aeration air is pumped through an <b>air</b> <b>stone</b> or similar device that creates small bubbles in the water column, {{this results in a}} high surface area where oxygen can dissolve into the water. In general due to slow gas dissolution rates and the high air pressure needed to create small bubbles this method is considered inefficient and the water is instead oxygenated by pumping in pure oxygen. Various methods are used to ensure that during oxygenation all of the oxygen dissolves into the water column. Careful calculation and consideration must be given to the oxygen demand of a given system, and that demand must be met with either oxygenation or aeration equipment.|$|E

50|$|All Toa have {{elemental}} powers, {{which they}} can use to manipulate existing elements or create new substance, {{as well as physical}} traits they possessed as Matoran. These elemental powers recharge naturally over time - the amount the energy exerted will determine {{how long it takes to}} return to full strength. They also have the mental discipline to use Great and Noble Kanohi Masks (only the Toa Nuva can use Kanohi Nuva). An ability all Toa share is the ability to perform Nova Blasts in which they release all their elemental energies at once. This has only ever been seen once in the story, when Gali of the Toa Nuva leveled the realm of Karzahni with a wall of water in a last-ditch attempt to defeat Makuta Icarax; it took all her concentration to save the other Toa from drowning. Jaller planned to unleash a Nova Blast in the Pit to buy Matoro time from the armies of the Barraki, and would almost certainly have killed everyone in the immediate area by doing so. Six Toa can combine their elemental powers to create a Protodermis Seal. Any six Toa can do this as long as two of the Toa are not Light and Shadow, as the two are cancelled out. This ability has only been seen being done by teams consisting of a Fire, Ice, Water, <b>Air,</b> <b>Stone,</b> and Earth. Toa are also able to use their Toa Power to heal certain things and create Toa Stones, which contain some of their own Toa Power. When a Toa has united with others, completed his or her duty, and achieved his or her destiny, he or she can sacrifice all of his or her Toa Power, and he or she becomes a Turaga. They can also choose to give up their Toa Power before their destiny is complete, and will become Turaga upon fulfilling that destiny.|$|E

40|$|Anesthesia of {{cephalopods}} {{is discussed}} {{more than ever}} before due to the work in progress for their welfare legislation. Different approaches to anesthesia in cephalopods have been tried by a number of scientists, but in most cases the animals were not truly anesthetized. Several workers have simply used muscle relaxants or simple hypothermia under the name anesthesia. This approach will not be adequate in the future. Inhalational anesthetics such as isoflurane (C 3 H 2 ClF 5 O) reduce L-type calcium currents and potassium currents in a dosedependent manner in the pulmonate mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis and there is evidence from cell culture that such anesthetics also block excitatory chemical synapses, more effectively than inhibitory synapses. Here we report, for the first time, on the effects of clinical doses of the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane on the behavioral responses of Octopus vulgaris. The volatile anesthetic isoflurane (0. 5 - 2. 5 % v/v) was equilibrated into seawater (1600 ml) via an <b>air</b> <b>stone</b> to adult Octopus vulgaris (n= 14) of about 400 g. Using a web camera we recorded the animals response to touch stimuli eliciting withdrawal responses of the arms and siphon and observed changes in the respiratory rate and the chromatophoric pattern over time during the anesthetic application. We found that different animals of the same size responded with similar behavioral changes as the isoflurane concentration was gradually increased. Sudden application of the highest concentration of isoflurane can be lethal to the animal (n= 2). After application of 2. 5 % isoflurane (5 minutes at the most), when all the responses indicated deep anesthesia, the animals recovered within 45 to 60 minutes in fresh aerated sea water. Based on previous findings in gastropods and the discovery of an L-type calcium channel sequence in the Octopus transcriptome, we believe that the molecular and electrophysiological bases of anesthesia induced by isoflurane are similar in that previously observed in Lymnaea. In the 30 minutes following anesthesia, the octopus can be handled without pain or distress, and an overdose of anesthetic can be used to euthanise the animal...|$|E

Laboratory bench-scale continuous reactors, fed with synthetic wastewater were used. The operational volume of the reactor was 20 litres and included a membrane. The membrane was made from a polymer material (HDPE) with a thickness of 3. 5 mm. The membrane, whose pore size ranged between 0. 1 – 1 mm, {{played the role of}} a secondary clarifier. Effects of temperatures of 27, 32, 37, 42, and 47 °C were studied. Studies on the effects of temperatures were carried out as the pH was maintained in the range of 6. 5 to 8. 00 by adjustment of the feed pH with NaOH. Nutrients levels were maintained in the ratio of COD: N: P at 100 : 5 : 1. The biomass was considered to be acclimatized when MLSS concentration maintained constant levels (3000 ± 2000 mg/L). The reactor was aerated continuously with an aquarium <b>air</b> <b>stone</b> with compressed air supplied at approximately 3 L/min to maintain dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 1. 5 to 3. 0 mg/L. Results indicated that as the operating temperatures of the reactors were increased, the percent removal of the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) also increased. The highest percent removal of soluble COD was obtained at 47 ºC (90. 45 %) while the lowest percent removal of soluble COD was obtained at 32 ºC (24. 27 %). The higher concentration of MLSS was obtained at 42 ºC (80 mg/L) while the lowest concentration was obtained at 10 mg/L at the same temperature (42 ºC).
