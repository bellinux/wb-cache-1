5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s Frunze {{was used as}} a barracks hulk while she was {{stripped}} for parts, until she was formally discarded 1 December 1940, after scrapping had already begun at <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> pace. After the German invasion she was towed to Kronstadt and run aground in late July 1941 near the Leningrad Sea Canal. During the Siege of Leningrad her hull {{was used as a}} base for small ships. Frunze raised on 31 May 1944, towed to Leningrad and scrapped beginning in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The Log {{from the}} Sea of Cortez is the {{narrative}} portion of an unsuccessful earlier work, Sea of Cortez: <b>A</b> <b>Leisurely</b> Journal of Travel and Research, {{which was published}} by Steinbeck and Ricketts shortly after their return from the Gulf of California, and combined the journals of the collecting expedition, reworked by Steinbeck, with Ricketts' species catalogue. After Ricketts' death in 1948, Steinbeck dropped the species catalogue from the earlier work and republished it with a eulogy to his friend added as a foreword.|$|E

5|$|With western France in {{the hands}} of the Allies, in late September Middleton made <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> trip east across France to the Ardennes Mountains, {{stopping}} en route to visit battlefields where he had served with distinction in 1918 during the Great War. The Germans were now behind a line from west of Metz, France, through Luxembourg, and east of the Belgian cities of Bastogne, Liege and Antwerp. The Allies had outrun their supply lines and had to slow their advance to resupply.|$|E
5|$|Bridgewater {{remained}} on the China Station until 1935, when she joined the Africa Station (later known as the South Atlantic Station). The ship returned to Devonport Dockyard on 1 September 1936 for a month's refit {{and then returned to}} Simonstown. Bridgewater had her second high-angle four-inch gun installed during a refit there. It was interrupted by the Munich Crisis of September 1938 when she was ordered to Freetown, Sierra Leone. The ship later resumed her refit and remained in South Africa until she returned to Devonport for another refit on 13 April 1939. It was completed on 17 May when Bridgewater began <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> cruise back to South Africa and arrived there in August.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936 the Middletons made <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> {{drive to}} New York City where they boarded a ship for the Philippines. The trip took them 42 days and {{included}} {{passage through the}} Panama Canal with stops in Panama, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Guam. When they arrived in Hawaii, they were greeted by George Patton and his wife Bea. Patton was on duty in Honolulu and had sailed his own boat from San Diego to Hawaii, and later sailed {{it back to the}} states {{at the end of his}} tour.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{warmed up}} for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF. In the Test, played at Bramall Lane, Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively, {{provoking}} an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> attitude towards bowling, so his success led to calls for him to start taking it seriously, instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball. Despite this, Australia lost the match.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2011, {{the three}} year-old {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} Belmont Stakes after holding the lead {{for much of the}} race on a sloppy track. As the pacesetter, Shackleford led throughout most of the 1-1/2 mile race, which started with a moderate quarter-mile in :23.9, then slowed to <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> :49.0 for the opening half, 1:14.5 for three-quarters, and 1:39.9 for a mile. After leading the first nine furlongs, he faded in the stretch. Winner Ruler On Ice as well as Stay Thirsty, Brilliant Speed and Nehro passed him.|$|E

Pimple and Angelica decide to take <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> trip on Pimple's flying car. They are ambushed and {{captured}} by the Dark Queen's ship, the Gargantua. Pimple sends out a distress signal to the Vulture, alerting Professor T. Bird, Rash, and Zitz that himself and Angelica had been captured. Learning that the Gargantua is hidden {{beneath the surface of}} a nearby planet called Ragnarok's World, Professor T. Bird flies Rash and Zitz there in the Vulture to rescue them.|$|E

5|$|After {{settling}} {{down at the}} landlady's house, Vanaja gets invited {{to play a game}} of ashta chamma (<b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady. Knowing that losing isn’t the mistress’s forte, she deliberately gives up her game. This gesture, in turn, eventually secures her the landlady’s mentorship, first in music and then in dance. Vanaja excels at these art forms and seems to be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government. Sexual chemistry is ignited between Shekhar and Vanaja (still a minor at 15) when flirtation and sexual innuendo bloom.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable {{arrived at}} Sydney on 18 September and began <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> refit that lasted until 15 November. After touring Australia and New Zealand, {{she arrived at}} Spithead on 15 March 1946 where she was {{modified}} to accommodate over 1,900 passengers. She ferried troops to and from Australia, Ceylon, Singapore and America {{for the rest of}} the year before being placed in reserve at the beginning of 1947. The ship was modified for use as a training ship and recommissioned in 1950 for service with the Home Fleet Training Squadron. She was decommissioned at Rosyth in October 1954 and towed to Gareloch in June 1955 where she was listed for disposal. Indefatigable was sold for scrap in September 1956 and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 24September that Edward left Acre. Arriving in Sicily, he was met {{with the news that}} his father had died on 16November, 1272. Edward was deeply saddened by this news, but rather than hurrying home at once, he made <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> journey northwards. This was due partly to his still-poor health, but also to a lack of urgency. The {{political}} situation in England was stable after the mid-century upheavals, and Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had until then been customary. In Edward's absence, the country was governed by a royal council, led by Robert Burnell. The new king embarked on an overland journey through Italy and France, where among other things he visited Pope Gregory X. Only on 2 August 1274 did he return to England, and he was crowned on 19 August.|$|E

5|$|The Kankaria Lake, {{built in}} 1451 AD, {{is one of}} the biggest lakes in Ahmedabad. In earlier days, it was known by the name Qutub Hoj or Hauj-e-Kutub. Vastrapur Lake is located in the western part of Ahmedabad. Lal Bahadur Shastri lake in Bapunagar is almost 136,000 square metres. In 2010, another 34 lakes were planned in and around Ahmedabad of which five lakes will be {{developed}} by AMC; the other 29 will be developed by the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA). Chandola Lake covers an area of 1200 hectares. It is home for cormorants, painted storks and spoonbills. During the evening time, many people visit this place and take <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> stroll. There is a recently developed Naroda lake and the world's largest collection of antique cars in KathWada at IB farm (Dastan Farm). AMC has also developed the Sabarmati Riverfront.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{had been}} keen {{to return to}} {{excavation}} in Britain. Based on {{the one he had}} organised in India, Wheeler developed an archaeological training course, which he ran at Verulamium in the summer of 1949 to instruct British students in the methodologies of excavation. In summer 1950, he was invited by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments to direct a trial excavation at Bindon Hill in Dorset. It was <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> project which he treated as a seaside holiday. He was invited by the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works to excavate the Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications in North Riding, Yorkshire, which he proceeded to do over the summers of 1951 and 1952. Aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the British archaeological scene, he was joined by Alcock and Alcock's wife, among others. Wheeler published his report on the site in 1954.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1945, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, {{commander}} of the BPF, came aboard and addressed the crew. Indefatigable continued flying operations until she entered Sagami Bay on 5 September. She departed three days later for Manus en route to Sydney. The ship arrived at Sydney on 18 September and began <b>a</b> <b>leisurely</b> refit that lasted until 15 November. On 1 November, Captain Ian MacIntyre relieved Graham as captain of the ship. She became Vian's flagship on 22 November and sailed to New Zealand to show the flag. She arrived in Wellington on 27 November and was opened for public tours, during which time the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, also visited. Indefatigable then sailed to Auckland, arriving on 12 December, and was again opened for tours. She returned to Sydney for the holidays and visited Melbourne on 22 January 1946 before departing for home nine days later. Vian transferred his flag to her sister ship Implacable that day and the ship stopped off at Fremantle and Cape Town en route. While Indefatigable was visiting the latter city, she was opened to the public, and the Governor-General of South Africa toured the ship.|$|E
