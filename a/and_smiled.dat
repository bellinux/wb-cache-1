5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, an {{opportunity}} to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis' {{rise to power}}, both companies {{spent the better part}} of 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas' chalet in Lugano in November with a plan to sign him for the 1934 Grand Prix season if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out so much he spent much of his time lying on his hotel bed recuperating.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that infants who have been the {{recipients}} of positive touch experience more benefits as they develop emotionally and socially. Experiments have been done with infants up to four months of age using both positive touch (stroking or cuddling) and negative touch (poking, pinching or tickling). The infants who received the positive touch cried less often and also vocalized <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> more than the infants who were touched negatively. Infants who were the recipients of negative touching have been linked with emotional and behavioral problems later in life. A lower amount of physical violence in adults has been discovered in cultures with greater levels of positive physical touching.|$|E

5000|$|On Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile,</b> Roth {{returned}} to a hard rock sound, comparable with that of early Van Halen, albeit featuring eclectic forays into lounge, jazz, and speed metal. Both a critical and commercial success, Rolling Stone wrote that no song on Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> was as slick {{as any of the}} singles from Van Halen's 5150 album, (which featured Roth's replacement Sammy Hagar) and also opined that Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> was much more [...] "trashy fun". Indeed, many of the reviews of Eat 'Em <b>and</b> <b>Smile</b> compared it directly with Van Halen's synth-heavy 5150, often favorably.|$|R

500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} from Havana to record the Buena Vista Social Club album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director Wim Wenders on the soundtrack to Wenders' film The End of Violence, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it {{was an effort to}} force Cooder to focus on the project, [...] "He always sort of looked in the distance <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> and I knew he was back in Havana." [...] Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer's first solo album, in 1998.|$|E

Reagan exited the limousine and insisted on walking. Reagan acted casual <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> at onlookers as he walked in. While he entered the hospital unassisted, once inside the president complained of difficulty breathing, his knees buckled, and he went down on one knee; Parr and others assisted him into the emergency room. The Physician to the President, Daniel Ruge, arrived with Reagan; believing that the president might have had a heart attack, he insisted that the hospital's trauma team, and not he himself or specialists from elsewhere, operate on him as it would treat any other patient. When a hospital employee asked Reagan aide Michael Deaver for the patient's name and address, only when Deaver stated [...] "1600 Pennsylvania" [...] did the worker realize that the President of the United States was in the emergency room.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{was mostly}} mixed, with results ranging from negative to positive. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'The Rain King' was cute. Very cute. [...] And yet I never found myself suffering from cuteness overload. In fact, I laughed <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> the entire way through." [...] Starpulse named [...] "The Rain King" [...] as the ninth best X-Files episode and praised the lighter approach to the paranormal, saying that the episode was an [...] "ingenious way to use the paranormal motif of the show for something other than thrills". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade. Despite criticizing the show for [...] "filming {{in the land of}} sunshine and lemon drops" [...] and [...] "border on that overly twee independent movie vibe", Handlen noted that [...] "the episode’s essential sweetness has enough snarky asides from our heroes [...] that it never goes completely off the rails." [...] He did, however, note that the episode's placement, after a string of several humorous episodes, hurt its reception; he argued that, had it appeared in an earlier, darker season, the entry would now be viewed as [...] "a cock-eyed classic".|$|E
500|$|By 1948 Olivier was on {{the board}} of {{directors}} for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in Richard III and also performed with Leigh in The School for Scandal and The Skin of Our Teeth. The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to [...] "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had [...] "dried her tears <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> brightly onstage". By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, [...] "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." [...] Later, he would observe that he [...] "lost Vivien" [...] in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} find the factors that affect dental {{esthetics}} <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> attractiveness in orthodontically treated patients according to laypeople’s judgment, and {{to determine whether there}} is any relationship between dental <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> esthetics. Materials <b>and</b> Methods: Using the Q-sort technique, 60 laypersons (30 males, 30 females) rated dental <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> photographs of 48 orthodontically treated patients based on their degree of attractiveness. Dental <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> parameters of each rated image were measured by Smile Analyzer software. The Student’s t-test and chi-square test were used to compare dental <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> parameters between attractive and unattractive images. The logistic regression was used to assess which variables predicted dental <b>and</b> <b>smile</b> esthetics in treated individuals. Results: The philtral to commissural height ratio and gingival display were significantly different in attractive <b>and</b> unattractive <b>smiles</b> (P= 0. 003 and P= 0. 02, respectively). None of the dental variables were found to be a determinant of dental esthetics {{at the end of the}} orthodontic treatment (P> 0. 05). According to the judgment of all raters (female and male) and the male raters’ judgment, smile attractiveness could be predicted by philtral to commissural height ratio and buccal corridor ratio (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The philtral to commissural height ratio and buccal corridor ratio can be considered as predictors of smile attractiveness in orthodontically treated patients. Achieving dental esthetics at the end of orthodontic treatment does not guarantee smile attractiveness. </p...|$|R

Three years later he married a young Protestant widow, with whom he had a son. After excommunication had been pronounced against him, he continued to travel round France giving lectures. While clerical papers called Loyson a [...] "renegade monk" [...] and Leon Bloy lampooned him, Thérèse prayed for her [...] "brother". She offered her last communion, 19 August 1897, for Father Loyson.|$|E
2500|$|Abel Linares offered Paige $100 {{per game}} to play winter ball for the Santa Clara {{team in the}} Cuban League. Gambling on {{baseball}} games in Cuba was such a huge pastime that players {{were not allowed to}} drink alcohol, so they could stay ready to play. Paige—homesick for carousing, hating the food, despising the constant inspections and being thoroughly baffled by the language—went 6–5 in Cuba. He left Cuba abruptly {{before the end of the}} season, with several stories told about the circumstances. Paige told one version in which the mayor of a small hamlet asked him, in Spanish, if he had intentionally lost a particular game. Paige, not understanding a word the man said, nodded <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> thinking the man was fawning over him, and then had to flee from the furious mayor. Another version, also told by Paige, says that when he called on an attractive local girl at her home, she and her family interpreted his attentions as an official engagement and sent the police to enforce it, leading Paige to flee the island with police in pursuit. A third version, told by the general manager of the Santa Clara Leopards, says that he left Cuba in haste after legal charges were brought against him regarding an amorous incident with [...] "a young lady from the provincial mulatto bourgeoisie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at Jiangdu, it {{was said}} that Emperor Yang's {{lifestyle}} grew increasingly decadent. [...] His palace contained over 100 chambers, each exceedingly luxurious and full of beautiful women. [...] The women of each chamber would serve as hostesses for a feast each day, and Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and Emperor Yang's favored concubines would be their guests. [...] Emperor Yang began to come to the realization that his fall was near, but still commented as if he did not care. [...] It was said that on one occasion, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "There must be many people who want to hurt me. [...] However, I will at least be the Duke of Changcheng , and you will at least be like Empress Shen [...] [...] Do not worry. [...] Let us drink and be merry." [...] It was also said that on another occasion, when he was looking in the mirror, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "I have a good neck, and I'm waiting for someone to sever it." [...] Empress Xiao, surprised and distressed by his comment, asked him why he was saying so, and he responded <b>and</b> <b>smiled,</b> [...] "Honor and wealth and poverty and dishonor, as well as pain and pleasure, all come in cycles. [...] Why be distressed?" [...] Meanwhile, not wanting to return to the turbulent north, he discussed with his officials about moving the capital to Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). [...] His elite Xiaoguo Army guards, missing their families in the north and realizing that Emperor Yang did not intend to return north, began to desert. [...] Their commanders Sima Dekan (司馬德勘), Yuan Li (元禮), and Pei Qiantong (裴虔通), worried that Emperor Yang would punish them, began considering rebelling and taking the Xiaoguo Army north themselves instead. [...] They associated with a number of other officers and officials, discussing so publicly that even the ladies in waiting began to hear about it. [...] When one reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao had her report to Emperor Yang—but Emperor Yang, not wishing to hear about the bad news, beheaded her. [...] When another reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao no longer permitted her to report to Emperor Yang, figuring that it was too late.|$|E
