5|$|He {{was dressed}} in <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way.</b> A šajkača was pulled {{to the front of}} his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
25|$|Then there's the odd, of course, {{fact that}} he had a very long love affair with a woman who he owned, who he {{inherited}} from his father-in-law, who was his wife's half-sister, and produced several children by her, whose descendants have mainly been brought up on the white side of the color line. So in <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way,</b> his own patrimony disproves his own belief that there couldn't be coexistence between black and white Americans.|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way</b> to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E

500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} {{to the character}} of Dexter. Entertainment Weeklys Josh Wolk called him [...] "the hippest-looking killer since American Psychos Patrick Bateman". The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman said [...] "What makes the series work so well is twofold. Hall is magnificent; it's another sterling performance from him. But instead of being pent up yet emotionally explosive, like his David Fisher on [...] "Six Feet Under," [...] he's cool and calculated and entirely without compassion as Dexter. That makes him alluring, in <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way.</b> while Ryan found him to be [...] "among the more compelling characters on the small screen". Gilbert described Dexter as a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, calling him a vigilante obsessive murderer with a slippery personality, but [...] "also a hero of sorts". InsidePulse.com reviewer Mathan Erhardt said that the episode did not quite meet his expectations and that [...] "to me the major flaw in the show is Dexter’s noir-esque narration", although he finished the review by saying [...] "Dexter, despite [...] flaws is yet another reason why Sunday night {{is one of my favorite}} nights to watch TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Selman {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that the episode praises {{collaborative}} writing, and answers {{the question of}} whether or not writing in a group is as valuable as writing alone. He commented: [...] "I've been with The Simpsons for 15 years and [...] it's been pretty much writing as a team. We’re proud of what we've done even if it's not the traditional idea of one writer sitting down with a passion and a vision. In <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way</b> this episode ends up as a defense of writing in a group and celebrating the way it makes you feel connected to the work and to the people in that group in ways you didn't expect. It's all about a writers room ... and you know, in the story, Homer's cynical heist team does end up being incredibly productive." [...] The episode features several references to literature and parodies several popular young-adult book series, particularly Twilight, a vampire-themed fantasy book series by Stephenie Meyer that has received much popularity. While chasing T. R. Francis through the stadium where the dinosaur show took place, Lisa passes a bathroom in which a group of dinosaurs are smoking in reference to a Far Side comic of dinosaurs smoking. The dinosaur show itself, Sitting with Dinosaurs, is based on the live Walking with Dinosaurs show.|$|E
500|$|Describing Vala's {{attitude}} towards bonding with other characters as [...] "in <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way</b> quite level-headed" [...] and [...] "quite honest", Black interpreted Vala's {{behavior as a}} reaction to growing attached to people where the relationships never seem to work out. Cooper explained that by Vala's contacting of Stargate Command about the imminent threat at the end of season 9, she [...] "has reached a point of honesty with [...] characters and possibly herself on a level that she's never had before." [...] From the beginning of season 10, Claudia Black and Amanda Tapping requested a similarly positive camaraderie between their characters as male characters have. Tapping noted Carter's respect for Vala despite them being at opposite ends in their actions; Tapping also thought Carter finds Vala amusing rather than annoying. A scene in [...] "Morpheus" [...] that was intended to establish this relationship was cut for time, and until the late season 10 episode [...] "Family Ties" [...] would accommodate this with a shopping scene, the actresses acknowledged their connection through looks and subtle nuances. By joining SG-1, Vala also shared a spot with stoic warrior Teal'c as the only alien members of the team, and actor Christopher Judge (Teal'c) explained that his character's amusement with Vala contributed to Teal'c's loosening up. The relationship between Vala and SG-1 team leader Colonel Cameron Mitchell (played by Ben Browder) was rarely emphasized in the series since Black and Browder were well known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series Farscape.|$|E

But the record was made with a sincerity and a true intention, no matter the results, and I thought it was like ruining it a bit because of the joke.. and that was too much!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{discovering}} Morgan and Ava's {{affair and}} losing her father, Kiki spirals {{out of control}} and turns to alcohol. Kiki finally hits [...] "rock bottom" [...] on Halloween she gets behind the wheel drunk—and causes a car accident. The actress relished in her portrayal of Kiki during the alcohol story. [...] "Drunk Kiki was great" [...] Erin enthused. Erin also credited the storyline with helping to sway viewer opinion about her character. She later said [...] "I was doing something a bit out of the norm for me. It was actual acting." [...] Head writer Jean Passanante described Kiki as someone [...] "who is still growing up and struggling to figure out who she is, even as she moves forward." [...] Passanante continued, [...] "You can't go through what she went through [...] and not change." [...] In addition to Franco, his girlfriend and her former stepmother Nina Clay (Michelle Stafford) and Morgan rallying around her, Kiki holds down a steady job {{for the first time since}} her introduction. Kiki also works toward rebuilding a relationship with her mother. [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way,</b> right now, Kiki has more support than she's had for quite a while." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2005, Tom Cruise, {{an actor}} and scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, {{condemned}} Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking {{in favor of the}} antidepressant drug Paxil. As Cruise said, [...] "Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because I think she is an incredibly talented woman, you look at , where has her career gone?" [...] Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "dangerous." [...] She said that he should [...] "stick to fighting aliens" [...] (a reference to Cruise's starring role in War of the Worlds {{as well as some of}} the more esoteric aspects of Scientology doctrine and teachings), [...] "and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression." [...] The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay [...] "War of Words" [...] published in The New York Times on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way,</b> it was comforting to me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, I have since tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today." [...] On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com, Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident. Shields accepted Cruise's apology, which she said was [...] "heartfelt." [...] Three months later in November 2006, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes.|$|E
2500|$|Leatherface was {{originally}} slated for a 2016 release, {{which it did}} not meet. Despite having reached completion, it was temporarily shelved by Lionsgate Films. Sherwood speculated that the studio might have been afraid that they wouldn't make back their investment after another film underperformed, but {{admitted that he had}} no concrete explanation for the delay: [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way,</b> I started to romanticize the idea it became some legendary lost film. It would be coveted – something spoken about, something people would try to contrive some way of seeing, something that would show up on a tired unused media at a convention in 50 years." [...] A film titled Leatherface received a direct-to-video release from Lightning Pictures in the United Kingdom in January 2017, featuring a masked chainsaw-brandishing figure on the home video cover. However, this film was not the Texas Chain Saw Massacre prequel, but rather a re-packaging of the unrelated Playing With Dolls: Bloodlust. The release was criticised by members of the press for its misleading marketing, with William Bibbiani scrutising on Blumhouse.com that [...] "It's not uncommon for horror movies to pick up new titles in domestic or foreign markets in an attempt to capitalize on various trends, but this is a particularly egregious example. It goes beyond mockbusters, which try to trick you into thinking it's the real deal, and simply takes the title of an upcoming, anticipated horror movie and tries to pass itself off as that movie." [...] Playing With Dolls director Rene Perez apologised for the title change, [...] "I am [...] to this title change but I am powerless to stop it. The sales agency didn't even inform me that a sale was made to the UK. At the moment I am making a 3rd Playing with Dolls movie. I will be self releasing the new Playing with Dolls online to avoid any issues like this in the future." ...|$|E
