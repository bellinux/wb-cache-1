40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} a simple {{mathematical}} model for susceptible prey (S) -infected prey (I) -predator (P) interaction, where the susceptible prey population (S) is infected directly from external sources {{as well as through}} contact with infected class (I) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> predator completely avoids consuming the infected prey. The model is analyzed to obtain different thresholds of the key parameters under which the system exhibits stability around the biologically feasible equilibria. Through numerical simulations we display the effects of external <b>infection</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>infection</b> through contact on the system dynamics in the absence {{as well as in the}} presence of the predator. We compare the system dynamics when infection occurs only through contact, with that when it occurs through contact and external sources. Our analysis demonstrates that under a disease-selective predation, stability <b>and</b> oscillations of <b>the</b> system is determined by two key parameters: <b>the</b> external <b>infection</b> rate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> force of <b>infection</b> through contact. Due to the introduction of external <b>infection,</b> <b>the</b> predator <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prey population show limit-cycle oscillations over a range parametric values.
