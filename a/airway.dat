5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent <b>airway.</b> Alternative techniques for <b>airway</b> management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include the laryngeal mask <b>airway,</b> i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal <b>airway,</b> continuous positive <b>airway</b> pressure (CPAP mask), nasal BiPAP mask, simple face mask, and nasal cannula.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} <b>airway</b> obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening <b>airway</b> obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. <b>Airway</b> obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the <b>airway</b> or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening <b>airway</b> obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the <b>airway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Croup is {{typically}} diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The {{first step is}} to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper <b>airway,</b> especially epiglottitis, an <b>airway</b> foreign body, subglottic stenosis, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis.|$|E

5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the <b>airway</b> can obstruct the <b>airway,</b> impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective <b>airway</b> reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the <b>airway</b> and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E
5|$|Several {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} via bronchoscopy {{for the management}} of <b>airway</b> obstruction or bleeding. If an <b>airway</b> becomes obstructed by cancer growth, options include rigid bronchoscopy, balloon bronchoplasty, stenting, and microdebridement. Laser photosection involves the delivery of laser light inside the <b>airway</b> via a bronchoscope to remove the obstructing tumor.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the <b>airway</b> is patent so that the patient can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open <b>airway</b> and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the <b>airway,</b> {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the <b>airway</b> in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the <b>airway,</b> so alternative techniques to visualize the <b>airway,</b> such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open <b>airway.</b> However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial <b>airway.</b> Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient <b>airway,</b> or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be usedâ€”blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E

5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent <b>airway</b> during certain life-threatening situations, such as <b>airway</b> obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the <b>airway</b> or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the <b>airway</b> do not allow a lacerated <b>airway</b> to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole <b>airway</b> can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the <b>airway,</b> preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive <b>airway.</b> Such devices include the laryngeal mask <b>airway,</b> cuffed oropharyngeal <b>airway</b> and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Though rare, TBI is {{a serious}} condition; it may cause {{obstruction}} of the <b>airway</b> with resulting life-threatening respiratory insufficiency.

Of those who do reach a hospital, the mortality rate may {{be as high as}} 30%.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper <b>airway.</b> It can also {{be associated with}} potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual <b>airway</b> anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the <b>airway</b> must always be readily available.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the <b>airway</b> and poor patient cooperation.

5|$|Tracheal intubation, usually simply {{referred}} to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open <b>airway</b> or {{to serve as a}} conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or <b>airway</b> obstruction.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the <b>airway,</b> the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical <b>airway</b> such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
