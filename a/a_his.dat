Baggio refound his form with the club and had a dominant season, scoring a personal best of 22 goals in Serie A, as well as providing 6 assists, leading Bologna to an eighth-place finish, allowing them to qualify for the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Baggio was the highest scoring Italian in Serie A that season, and the third-highest goalscorer in Serie <b>A.</b> <b>His</b> performances earned him a place in Italy's 1998 World Cup squad. Baggio also led Bologna to the round of 16 in the Coppa Italia, where he scored one goal in three appearances. Although he rose to hero status amongst the fans, he had difficulties with his manager Renzo Ulivieri, in particular when he was left out of the starting 11 against Juventus. Ulivieri later denied ever having any difficulties with Baggio. At the beginning of the season, Baggio cut off his iconic ponytail, signifying his rebirth. Baggio was named as Bologna's captain for part of the season, before handing the armband to Giancarlo Marocchi. Baggio made his 300th Serie A appearance while at Bologna, in a 0–0 draw against Empoli on 11 January 1998. Baggio received nominations for both the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year due to his performances for Bologna and Italy that season. He was also nominated for the 1998 Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year and Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, losing out to Alessandro Del Piero and Ronaldo, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 2016, Buffon {{kept his}} eighth {{consecutive}} clean sheet in Serie A in a 2–0 win over Inter. In the process, {{he set a}} new personal best in the top flight, and the outright sixth-best unbeaten streak {{in the history of}} the Italian league, after going 746 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, overtaking Morgan De Sanctis and Marchegiani. In the following league match against Atalanta on 6 March, he extended his unbeaten record by keeping another clean sheet in a 2–0 away win, also equalling Dino Zoff's and Sebastiano Rossi's league record of nine consecutive clean sheets in Serie <b>A.</b> <b>His</b> unbeaten streak of 836 minutes without conceding a goal was the third best unbeaten streak in Serie A history, behind only Zoff and Rossi, and was also the longest period a goalkeeper has gone without conceding a goal since three points for a win were introduced in Serie A during the 1994–95 season. He overtook Zoff in a 1–0 home victory over Sassuolo on 11 March, achieving a league record 10 consecutive clean sheets, and extended his unbeaten streak to 926 minutes without conceding a goal, only three minutes behind the all-time record holder, Rossi; the last time he had conceded a goal was when he was beaten by Antonio Cassano, in the 64th minute of a 2–1 away win over Sampdoria, on 10 January 2016. Buffon surpassed Rossi's record of 929 minutes by 45 minutes in a 4–1 away win over inter-city rivals Torino on 20 March, also surpassing Gianpiero Combi's Italian league record unbeaten streak of 934 minutes in the process; he set the new all-time record at 974 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal. Andrea Belotti finally ended his goalless streak by beating him from the penalty spot in the 48th minute of the same match.|$|E

25|$|However, it {{was viewed}} as a new {{challenge}} for Rush who would have the task of unlocking the much tighter defences in Serie <b>A.</b> <b>His</b> time at Juventus was less than successful, as he scored only eight times in 29 games; though this partly explained by the Italian tradition at this time of tighter defences meaning that strikers tended to score fewer goals in Italy than they did in England.|$|E

His free kicks caused such an impact that TV sports programs would debate how to stop them. Despite his excellent performance, the club's season ended in disappointment as Udinese, in spite of scoring almost twice as many goals as the previous year, only gathered 32 points and was ninth in the final standing, losing three places in comparison to 1982–83. His personal top scoring dispute against Juventus's Michel Platini was exciting – Zico scored 19 goals, one fewer than top scorer Platini, having played 4 fewer matches than the French footballer due to an injury. Plus, he was voted 1983 Player of the Year by World Soccer Magazine.|$|E
25|$|After {{his first}} taste of {{international}} cricket, Powell returned {{to play for the}} Leeward Islands but periodically represented West Indies <b>A.</b> <b>His</b> progress was hindered by an injury in 2011, but in July that year (two years after he was first called into the West Indies squad) Powell was selected to replace batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan for the third Test against India. At the time Powell averaged 38.91 from 23 first-class matches. Chris Gayle, who regularly opened the batting for the West Indies, was not playing at the time due to a dispute with the WICB, so on debut Powell joined Adrian Barath (who made his Test debut in 2011 and was similarly inexperienced) to open the West Indies innings. Powell managed scores of 3 and 4 while the match ended in a draw.|$|E

25|$|As {{a reward}} for his {{services}} Louis XIV appointed him bishop of Strassburg in succession to his brother in 1682, in 1686 obtained for him from Pope Innocent XI the cardinal's hat, and in 1688 succeeded in obtaining his election as coadjutor-archbishop of Cologne and successor to Maximilian. At the instance of the emperor, however, the pope interposed his veto on 26 August 1688; the canons followed the papal lead. Louis XIV attacked the Empire, citing this action as well <b>a</b> <b>his</b> sister-in-law's claim to the inheritance of the Palatinate as his pretexts. As {{the progress of the}} Allies against Louis XIV in the Nine Years War deprived him of all prospect of success, Wilhelm Egon retired to France.

At the 2011 European T20 Championship, beginning shortly after the Nordic Cup, he played in all seven matches, having little batting success but taking seven wickets from his 12 overs bowled.|$|E
25|$|Peter Connell {{made his}} Twenty20 debut on 27 June 2008 in {{a match for}} Ireland against Bangladesh <b>A.</b> <b>His</b> three overs conceded twenty runs for no wickets and he opened the bowling with Thinus Fourie.

The second volley, fired after a signal by Major Kent, found many in Captain Delaney's Company <b>A.</b> <b>His</b> group was fired upon by a company of Confederate soldiers in the street and from locals in the houses. One local, recalling this volley many years later, said [...] "The colonel commanding the raiding party was killed, {{and the head of the}} column went down, men and horses in a confused mass." [...] He also said [...] "The momentum of the column of cavalry carried many who were near the front over the dead and wounded men and horses. It was death to them to remain or hesitate. They spurred their horses forward over their dead and dying comrades and passed between our ranks as we opened out to the sidewalks. While they dashed by us firing their pistols, we continued the use of the musket. The bugle sounded the retreat, and the column of cavalrymen faced about and retired, only to re-form and come at us again." ...|$|E
