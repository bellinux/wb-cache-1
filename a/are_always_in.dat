5|$|The {{scattered}} disc {{is a very}} dynamic environment. Because {{they are}} still capable of being perturbed by Neptune, SDOs' orbits <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> danger of disruption; either of being sent outward to the Oort cloud or inward into the centaur population and ultimately the Jupiter family of comets. For this reason Gladman et al. prefer {{to refer to the}} region as the scattering disc, rather than scattered. Unlike Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), the orbits of scattered-disc objects can be inclined as much as 40° from the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> flocks, {{which may be}} of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of items {{scattered}} around the castle, of which the player may carry up to three at a time. Some of these <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> the same place {{at the start of the}} game, whereas others are distributed randomly. Items include differently-coloured keys which will unlock their respective doors, the three pieces of the ACG key, and other items that affect certain enemies or are mere red herrings. Common enemies appear in each room upon entering and will attack the player on sight. Collision with these enemies destroys them but drains a portion of the player's health. There are also stationary poisonous fungi which will drain health constantly if the player is in contact with them, and enemies that require special items in order to either distract, repel or kill them, otherwise they remain invulnerable to conventional attacks. Bosses guard pieces of the ACG key, and contact with them will rapidly drain away the player's health.|$|E

5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} di Penates is more defined in Etruria: Arnobius (citing a Caesius) {{states that the}} Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; {{according}} to Nigidius Figulus, they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men. According to Varro the Penates reside in the recesses of Heaven and are called Consentes and Complices by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> agreement among themselves. While these last gods {{seem to be the}} Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.|$|E

25|$|This rivalry {{is totally}} {{different}} and interesting. It is started on Season 86. Arellano and Perpetual are tight and wild contenders in many sports, such as Basketball, Track and Field, {{and especially in}} Beach Volleyball, volleyball, and cheerleading.

In these particular sports, these two schools <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> the Final 2, they are always compete with each other and vie for the win.

Key players for this rivalry are Arellano's Jiovanni Jalalon, Zach Nicholls, John Pinto, and Keith Agovida, in basketball; Christine Joy Rosario, Menchie Tubiera, Rialen Sante, and Danna Henson in volleyball. While on Perpetual are: Scottie Thompson, Bright Akhuetie, Gerald Dizon, in basketball; Royse Tubino, Coleen Bravo, and Lourdes Clemente in volleyball.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of correlation of parts was also Cuvier's {{way of understanding}} function in a non-evolutionary context, without invoking a divine creator. In the same 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in plaster quarries near Paris, Cuvier emphasizes the predictive power of his principle, writing,Today comparative anatomy has reached such a point of perfection that, after inspecting a single bone, one can often determine the class, and sometimes even the genus of the animal to which it belonged, above all if that bone belonged to the head or the limbs... This is because the number, direction, {{and shape of the}} bones that compose each part of an animal's body <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> a necessary relation to all the other parts, in such a way that—up to a point—one can infer the whole from any one of them and vice versa.Though Cuvier believed that his principle's major contribution was that it was a rational, mathematical way to reconstruct fossils and make predictions, in reality it was difficult for Cuvier to use his principle. The functional significance of many body parts were still unknown at the time, and so relating those body parts to other body parts using Cuvier's principle was impossible. Though Cuvier was able to make accurate predictions about fossil finds, in practice the accuracy of his predictions came not from application of his principle, but rather from his vast knowledge of comparative anatomy. However, despite Cuvier's exaggerations of the power of his principle, the basic concept is central to comparative anatomy and paleontology.|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{extends the}} {{distinction}} between work and control-related technologies to the larger concept of holistic and prescriptive ones.

[...] Artisans may specialize in {{a particular kind of}} product, but they <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> total control of the process of production and each thing they make or create is unique.
