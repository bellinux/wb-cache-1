25|$|According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the fecal-oral {{cycle of}} {{transmission}} can be disrupted by cooking food properly, preventing cross-contamination, instituting barriers such as gloves for food workers, instituting health care policies so food industry employees seek treatment when they <b>are</b> <b>ill,</b> pasteurization of juice or dairy products and proper hand washing requirements.|$|E

25|$|The {{health care}} {{transport}} infrastructure transports people who <b>are</b> <b>ill,</b> accident victims, or otherwise {{in need of}} medical attention. It includes ambulances, as well as air ambulances: helicopters and airplanes whose interiors are specially modified for the purpose. For most purposes, of course, ground transport is preferred, but sometimes distances or the difficulty of reaching particular locations make air transport more practical.|$|E
25|$|Preventative {{measures}} one {{can take}} to help {{prevent the spread of}} the disease include washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing food. Stay away from any food if you <b>are</b> <b>ill,</b> and wear gloves if there are any open wounds on your hands or wrists while preparing food. If storing food for longer than 2 hours, keep the food above 140 degrees Fahrenheit or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E

In 2014 the group sterilized 10,950 cats and dogs, including 851 pit bulls and 584 feral cats, at a discounted rate or free of charge. PETA also shelters neglected dogs and cats who <b>are</b> <b>ill</b> and injured, pursues cruelty cases, and sets up doghouses with straw bedding for dogs chained outside all winter. It supplied 340 doghouses, 1,000 bales of straw, and 2,500 dog toys in 2013. The group urges population control through neutering and adoption from shelters and campaigns against {{organizations such as the}} American Kennel Club that promote the selection of purebred breeds.|$|E

25|$|Muslims are {{commanded}} {{to perform}} prayers {{five times a}} day. These prayers are obligatory on every Muslim who has {{reached the age of}} puberty, with the exception being those who are mentally ill, too physically ill for it to be possible, menstruating, or experiencing postnatal bleeding. Those who <b>are</b> <b>ill</b> or otherwise physically unable to offer their prayers in the traditional form are permitted to offer their prayers while sitting or lying, as they are able. The five prayers are each assigned to certain prescribed times (al waqt) at which they must be performed, unless there is a compelling reason {{for not being able to}} perform them on time. These times are measured according to the movement of the sun. These are: near dawn (fajr), after midday has passed and the sun starts to tilt downwards/noon (zuhr), in the afternoon (asr), just after sunset (maghrib) and around nightfall (Isha). Under some circumstances ritual worship can be shortened or combined (according to prescribed procedures). In case a ritual worship is not performed at the right time, it must be performed later.|$|E
500|$|Many {{findings}} linking {{workers and}} other cancer development are muddled due to the [...] "strong healthy worker effect" [...] (that workers tend to have lower overall death rates than general population because those that <b>are</b> <b>ill</b> or disabled are restricted from working). [...] Also the standard mortality rates for cancers of stomach and rectum {{were found to be}} much higher than other studies of nuclear workers which indicates the necessity for further study since inhalation of plutonium can distribute to these areas.|$|E
500|$|Yet {{another option}} is to create the UNPA as a nongovernmental {{organization}} of democratically elected legislators. This would have the advantage of not requiring the cooperation of (sometimes dictatorial) national governments or world parliamentary organizations with dictatorial members, so only democratic legislators, parliaments and countries would be represented. The World Constitution and Parliament Association and other NGOs have attempted to set up workable parliaments. Dieter Heinrich critiqued this approach by saying, [...] "If it did succeed on any scale, it would divert resources from pressuring governments on thousands of specific issues, which citizens are good at, into the operation of a pan-global institutional structure, which citizens' groups <b>are</b> <b>ill</b> equipped to do...And the resulting assembly would always be of doubtful legitimacy (who does it really represent?) and of unlikely value as an evolutionary starting point for a real world parliament." ...|$|E

500|$|Plants, {{including}} many now used as culinary herbs and spices, {{have been used}} as medicines, not necessarily effectively, from prehistoric times. Spices have been used partly to counter food spoilage bacteria, especially in hot climates, and especially in meat dishes which spoil more readily. Angiosperms (flowering plants) were the original source of most plant medicines. Human settlements are often surrounded by weeds used as herbal medicines, such as nettle, dandelion and chickweed. Humans were not alone in using herbs as medicines: some animals such as non-human primates, monarch butterflies and sheep ingest medicinal plants when they <b>are</b> <b>ill.</b> Plant samples from prehistoric burial sites are among the lines of evidence that Paleolithic peoples had knowledge of herbal medicine. For instance, a 60 000-year-old Neanderthal burial site, [...] "Shanidar IV", in northern Iraq has yielded large amounts of pollen from 8 plant species, 7 of which are used now as herbal remedies. [...] A mushroom was found in the personal effects of Ötzi the Iceman, whose body was frozen in the Ötztal Alps for more than 5,000 years. The mushroom was probably used against whipworm.|$|E
