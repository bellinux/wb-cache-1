Interference is considered harmful if it causes disruption in user’s service. In general, examples of deployment parameters for HetNets are [4, 5] primary exclusion zones (radius of protection of a primary receiver/transmitter), transmission power limits on secondary users, number of admitted secondary users, <b>acceptable</b> level of <b>interference</b> in primary receptor, and monitoring time. The deployment parameters depend on the dynamic spectrum access technique (overlay or underlay) that a secondary user performs to exploit a primary band. In the case of deploying a HetNet with spectrum underlay access, it is relevant to set a limit on the transmission power of secondary users, primary exclusion zones, permissible number of secondary users, and <b>acceptable</b> level of <b>interference</b> in the primary receptor. The detection threshold and monitoring time are factors to overlay access mode. The first refers to the maximum value to be set to detect the primary signal; therefore, the primary channel status is known (busy or idle).

In the current accepted interference model, co-channel interfering cells beyond the first tier (subsequent tier co-channel cells) are neglected. This currently accepted interference models is suitable for cellular wireless communication systems operating at carrier frequencies, f c = 0. 9 and 1. 8 GHz, cell size radii R > 1 km and basic path loss exponent α ≥ 2. The future and emerging wireless communication systems are expected to be operating at frequencies f c > 2 GHz (3. 35 - 15. 75 GHz), cell size radii R≤ 1 km and basic path loss exponent α ≤ 2. This, makes the current <b>acceptable</b> co-channel <b>interference</b> model unsuitable for information capacity analysis of the future cellular systems.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{is a powerful}} tool in nuclear medicine allowing the visualization and quantification of metabolic processes down to the molecular level. As a tracer-based imaging modality, PET images lack anatomic information required for co-registration and localization, thus another imaging system is required to contribute the missing information. A highly regarded candidate is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which offers besides anatomic images with great soft-tissue contrast also {{a wide range of}} other contrast mechanisms allowing the extraction of e. g. functional information. Hence, combined PET/MRI became an interesting hybrid modality. The integration of those two systems into a hybrid devices allowing for simultaneous data acquisition is however a challenging endeavor: as the MRI system makes use of strong, static (the magnetic B 0 field) as well as fast switching electromagnetic (EM) fields (the gradient fields and the radiofrequency (RF) field), it provides a harsh environment for any electronic device (the PET scanner) designated to be operated inside the bore of the MRI scanner. On the other hand, MRI is known to be a low-sensitive imaging modality whose image acquisition principle and image quality relies on strict quality criteria with respect to the applied EM fields (homogeneity, linearity etc.). Therefore, the presence of a PET scanner might severely influence the imaging process of the MRI system. Hence, the MR compatibility of a PET scanner is serious issue and the assessment of interference phenomena is important to evaluate the limitations on the imaging process and to understand the problems occurring. In this thesis, the MR compatibility of preclinical PET insert, the Hyperion-II-D detector, is assessed. The insert is designed to be operated inside a clinical 3 T MRI scanner and makes use of a digital implementation of Silicon Photomultipliers as photo detectors which were firstly presented by Philips Digital Photon Counting. In contrast to other PET/MRI research prototypes, most of the readout electronics are operated inside the bore of the MRI system, thus potentially intensifying the MR compatibility issue. As no standardized evaluation protocols exist for PET/MRI devices, a set of test protocols, which allows a reliable assessment of the MR compatibility, is developed in this thesis, whereby the focus lies on the application of technical, synthetic test protocols which allow the differentiation of interference phenomena between the PET insert and the individual subsystems of the MRI scanner. Overall, an <b>acceptable</b> level of <b>interference</b> was observed: although the PET scanner influences the MRI acquisition noticeably, the degradation effects can be considered as acceptable for morphological scan as well as for more advanced acquisition schemes. On the PET side, a degradation of the energy and timing resolution was observed when highly demanding MRI test sequences, which produce maximum demanding gradient fields, are applied. However, this effect only occurs for extreme scenario and play a subordinate role for normal imaging sequences. Besides the MR compatibility assessment, a B 0 optimization approach on PET detector level is proposed: as any material brought inside the bore of the MRI scanner distorts the B 0 field, the B 0 distortion can be regarded as an inherent MR compatibility issue which is counteracted by avoiding materials for the PET development which have a high magnetic susceptibility. As this design paradigm limits the design flexibility, the application of additional (highly magnetic) material (passive shimming) or conductor loop configurations (active shimming) on PET module level is proposed in this thesis. The resulting B 0 distortions originating from the PET module and the additional materials superimpose yielding a homogenized B 0 field distribution if applied correctly. A simulation and optimization toolkit is developed in thesis and first proof-of-principle experiments are conducted on basis of single PET modules...|$|R
