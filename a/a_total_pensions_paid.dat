5000|$|Beauregard's {{suggestion}} that judges {{should not have}} to contribute to pensions owed partly to section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867, which assigned the administration of justice to the provincial governments. This suggested the federal and provincial governments would have to agree {{to the creation of a}} pension to which judges must contribute. Dickson refuted this argument by saying the general effect of the section 92(14) is limited by other more specific parts of the Constitution, in this case section 100. [...] Another interpretation of section 100 was that the type of pensions it mentioned was the kind that existed at the time of Canadian Confederation, i.e. pensions to which judges did not contribute. Moreover, the section's requirement that Parliament provides the pension could be taken as meaning Parliament alone; the section did not say judges along with Parliament had the responsibility. [...] Dickson rejected the idea that the type of pension had to be the same as it was at Confederation in 1867, because the Constitution is meant to adapt to changing circumstances. This was the living tree doctrine. [...] As for the notion that Parliament alone must pay for the pension, Dickson replied under section 100, Parliament must pay a pension, but section 100 did not say what percentage of <b>a</b> <b>total</b> <b>pension.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical {{contribution to the}} field of overlapping-generations general equilibrium modelling, i. e. an upgrade of this branch of models with a pension system. Within the pension block we model both the first pension pillar, financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, and the fully-funded second pillar of the Slovenian pension system. The modelling of the first pension pillar is based on cash flows of the mandatory pension insurance institution, the relationship between the pension base and the pension, and the process of harmonising pension growth to wage growth. The modelling of the second pillar centres on implementation of the liquidity constraint. Use was made of supplementary pension profiles, and the ratio between premia <b>paid</b> and <b>pensions</b> <b>paid</b> out from supplementary pension insurance.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{long-term}} relationship between salaries and asset prices and relates it to asset allocation decisions of defined benefit pension funds. In particular, it discusses whether a 100 % bond allocation {{is indeed the}} minimum risk position for an ongoing scheme whose benefits accruing to active members rise in line with their wages. The main finding is that, while shorter-run correlation evidence is less consistent, there is indeed a long-run link between the evolution of salary-linked liabilities {{and a range of}} asset classes including equities. This longrun positive linkage is consistent with economic theory. The implications for effective practice in minimum risk asset allocation depend on portfolio rebalancing costs, how much short and medium-run asset allocations move around the long-term equilibrium as well as how significant active liabilities are as <b>a</b> proportion of <b>total</b> <b>pension</b> liabilities...|$|R

In the third section, I consider pensions based upon contributions by employers and employees (Disability, Old Age and Survivorship pensions). Both the "pay as you go" and the funded schemes are considered. They are put in relationship with several demographic variables, like the old people dependency ratio, the birth rate and life expectancy. I show that, according to these factors, pensions should be higher in most southern regions, in particular Campania, and lower in many central and northern regions, in particular Liguria, Toscana and Umbria. In the fourth section, <b>pensions</b> <b>paid</b> as welfare measures are considered. I show that, with a redistributive scheme based on PPP per capita income and consumption at the regional level, pensions should be higher in the North and lower in the South. In the fifth section I show that the sum of the asbolute values of the changes estimated in the other two steps amounts to 14 b. euros, i. e. more than 7 % of <b>total</b> <b>pensions</b> ex-penditure and 1 % of GNP. italy, pension system, regional differences...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Pension {{funds are}} large {{institutional}} investors in South Africa and hold {{some of the}} highest levels of investment, relative to gross domestic product, in the world. The South African stock market is also the largest stock market in Africa. Research has shown that pension funds can {{play an important role in}} developing stock markets. This assignment investigated the impact that pension fund investment has had on the development of the South African stock market. This question is particularly relevant in the light of the changing domestic pension policy environment and the need to better develop stock markets in Southern Africa and globally to generate economic growth. The Johansen cointegration approach was applied to evaluate the impact of pension funds on the development of the South African stock market. Stock market development was measured by its depth or market capitalisation, liquidity and volatility. The analysis shows that South African pension funds have improved the liquidity and reduced the volatility of the stock market. Pension fund investment in shares increased market capitalisation, while market capitalisation was reduced when the prime lending rate was included as <b>a</b> control variable. <b>Total</b> <b>pension</b> fund investment decreased market capitalisation, probably through the impact of interest rates on interest-bearing assets held in the portfolio...|$|R

40|$|The present pension systems {{allocate}} only {{a minimal}} allowance (about 1 or 2 % of the <b>total</b> <b>pension</b> budget) {{to those who}} raise children, endangering the reproduction {{of the population and}} leading to an ageing society.

The financial source of this system can be a separated and well-defined ratio of children’s <b>pension</b> contributions <b>paid</b> for at least 13 years until the age of 37. Mothers reaching the retirement age could obtain the suggested pre-determined amount of pension supplement (approximately HUF 140 thousand per children tailored to the demographic and economic conditions in Hungary).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the decline of}} National Insurance in Britain, as witnessed by its declining share of all social security spending and the steady dilution of the "contributory principle" on which it was originally based. It argues that this decline is not an accident: under governments of the Left, arguments in favour of inclusion have been predominant, non-contributory benefits expanded and contribution conditions softened; under those of the Right, the emphasis has been on focussing limited resources on the poorest through means-testing. Given where we are now, the strong arguments in principle for social insurance look much weaker. However, there are also reasons why the system has not been swept away, notably {{the way in which}} the bulk of the system is concerned with state pension rights which have already accrued. The paper explores current plans for the future development of state pensions, arguing that their combined effect is to restore something like a flat rate state pension, but with significant complexity. This could be developed into a more transparent system guaranteeing <b>a</b> <b>total</b> state <b>pension</b> at <b>a</b> fixed percentage of average earnings for those meeting a participation test, rather than being based on contribution records. This leaves a choice for the remaining sixth of National Insurance benefits: to separate out state pensions and absorb the other insurance benefits within the rest of working age social security, or to maintain the scope of National Insurance, but also based on participation, not past contributions. social insurance, social security, pensions, direct taxation...|$|R
