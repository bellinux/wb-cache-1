40|$|Despite {{the current}} {{interest}} {{in the works of}} Konstantin Leontyev, scholars have so far mainly addressed his philosophic and political essays, with his works of fiction attracting considerably less attention. Our article is devoted to one of Leontyev least studied text — the novel Odysseus Polihroniades, which the author himself considered his best work. The novel is written as memoirs of a Greek man from Zagora and is based on real-life events. We have traced a link between the writer's outlook as reflected in his essays and the proto-Byzantine tradition as defined by S. S. Averintsev which {{plays an important role in}} the novel. An important feature of the early Byzantine culture is the synthesis of the Christian and the heathen. We examine the issue of mutual influence of the classical and Christian traditions in Leontyev's texts. We also suggest that “old age in infancy” is one of the key motifs of the novel. Greek characters have specific speech features, with the emphasis on Gospel language preserved in patriarchal Greek society. The article concludes by reaffirming the thesis of <b>affinity</b> <b>existing</b> between Leontyev's view of the world and the early Byzantine religious consciousness...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of activation of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 1) from pig kidney by Mg 2 + ions was investigated {{with the aid}} of kinetic measurements. Mg 2 + ions are essential for enzyme activity. The following model (Scheme 1 of the text) for the reaction of enzyme, substrate and Mg 2 + ions was derived: [Formula: see text] The binding of the substrate to the enzyme is independent of the binding of the activator, and vice versa. Mg 2 + must therefore play a part in the substrate decomposition. It is not possible to determine whether the Mg 2 + ions are involved directly in the catalytic process, or whether they act as regulatory effectors. Because of the strong <b>affinity</b> <b>existing</b> between the alkaline phosphatase and Mg 2 +, it is necessary to adjust the metal-ion concentration {{with the aid of}} a metal buffer. In the Appendix the necessary equations are derived for calculating the concentration of free metal ions in a system with several different metal ions.

Here, we investigated whether disulfide-trapping, an approach new to nuclear receptors, would provide effective lead compounds targeting human liver receptor homolog 1 (hLRH- 1, NR 5 A 2). Despite the fact that hLRH- 1 contains a large ligand binding pocket and binds phospholipids with high <b>affinity,</b> <b>existing</b> synthetic hLRH- 1 ligands are of limited utility due to poor solubility, low efficacy or significant off-target effects. Using disulfide-trapping, we identified a lead compound that conjugates with remarkably high-efficiency to a native cysteine residue (Cys 346) lining the hydrophobic cavity in the ligand binding domain of hLRH- 1. Guided by computational modeling and cellular assays, the lead compound was elaborated into ligands PME 8 and PME 9 that bind hLRH- 1 reversibly (no cysteine reactivity) and increase hLRH- 1 activity in cells. When compared with the existing hLRH- 1 synthetic agonist RJW 100, both PME 8 and PME 9 showed comparable induction of the LRH- 1 dependent target gene CYP 24 A 1 in human HepG 2 cells, beginning as early as 3 h after drug treatment. The induction is specific as siRNA-mediated knock-down of hLRH- 1 renders both PME 8 and PME 9 ineffective. These data show that PME 8 and PME 9 are potent activators of hLRH- 1 and suggest that with further development this lead series may yield useful chemical probes for manipulating LRH- 1 activity in vivo...|$|R

These species have been quantitatively studied in regard to their relative abundance and distribution. Frequency distribution study of Foraminifera shows that Miliammina fusca, Ammobaculites exiguus, Trochammina hadai, Jadammina macrescens, Gaudryina exilis, Ammonia beccarii (Linne), A. tepida and Asterorotalia dentata are the dominant species of the fauna. Mean values of number of species (S), Shannon-Wiener index, H (S) and evenness index (H) are highest in summer (May) for the outer channel suggesting very high species diversity of the area as compared with {{other parts of the}} lake due to strong marine influence. In contrast, Pielou's index of species dominance (D) decreases towards the sea. Variations in the mean diversity indices for the areas covered in the lake are related to the water characteristics prevailing there during different seasons. The sites dominated by M. fusca and A. exiguus are mostly inside the lagoon, while those dominated by A. beccarii (Linne) besides T. hadai, G. exilis, Hanzawaia asterizans, H. nitidula, A. tepida, A. dentata, Elphidium crispum and E. galvestonense are in the outer channel of the lake.

40|$|The {{view that}} the lute {{exercised}} an important influence on the formation of French harpsichord style {{in the seventeenth century}} is a commonplace of musicology which has not until now been thoroughly investigated. This thesis is an attempt to determine the nature of that influence taking into account as much of the available relevant material as possible. The first chapter outlines the status and function of stringed keyboard instruments, particularly in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, using a wide variety of non-musical sources whether literary, archival, or documentary. It also charts the relative standing of the two instruments and the interrelationship of their repertoires as viewed by contemporaries throughout the seventeenth century. The second chapter provides a survey of the evolution of French lute style based on a detailed study of most of the French lute sources from the period cl 600 -cl 670 and including the more important sources from cl 670 -cl 700. The third chapter presents detailed comparisons of individual works existing in versions for both lute and keyboard. These are based on numerous parallel transcriptions presented in the second volume. The material for this section is provided by a concordance file for virtually all French seventeenth-century lute sources designed to be usable in conjunction with Gustafson's keyboard catalogue. The final chapter is an attempt to define the degree of <b>affinity</b> <b>existing</b> between particular features of the central harpsichord style and that of the lute on the basis of principles established in the previous discussions. This thesis contains the first detailed discussion of the works of the principal seventeenth-century French lutenists {{in the context of a}} survey of the general development of the lute style. Numerous illustrative examples of hitherto unpublished lute music are included in the second volume. The final chapter also discusses some new sources of French harpsichord music dating from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, with transcriptions. Also discussed for the first time is the Premier Livre (1687) of Elizabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, and a transcription of a suite supposedly written in imitation of the lute is given.

The interactions between the compounds and the crystallographically determined active site residues of HSV- 1 TK have been studied by molecular modeling with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm of docking program AutoDock 3. 0. All compounds mentioned bind to both enzymes in the low m to sub-m range, comparable to binding <b>affinities</b> of <b>existing</b> prodrugs. Findings from the docking procedure indicate multiple binding modes for all of the compounds and are in accordance with the results of phosphorylation and binding-affinity studies.

40|$|Phorbol ester-induced {{release of}} LH and GH from rat {{anterior}} pituitary tissue in vitro is differentially inhibited by some, but not other, inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), suggesting that pharmacologically distinct species of PKC {{may have different}} functional roles in these cells. Since stimulus-induced anterior pituitary hormone release can be enhanced by oestradiol- 17 β (OE 2) pretreatment, we investigated the effect of OE 2 treatment of long-term (4 weeks) ovariectomized rats on the amount, activity and cellular actions of pharmacologically distinct PKC species in rat anterior pituitary tissue. Here we report that OE 2 treatment enhanced phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu) -induced LH but not GH release measured in vitro. This effect of OE 2 on LH release may involve synthesis of additional PKCs that are not targeted by the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1, 2 -dioctanoyl-snglycerol (DOG). Measurements of anterior pituitary PKC activity and [3 H] phorbol ester-binding studies suggested that the facilitatory action of OE 2 on LH release may occur, at least in part, by altering the quantity and activity of PKC(s). Our results also demonstrate that the OE 2 -induced PKC(s) which facilitate LH release may be of the type that are not dependent upon raised intracellular Ca 2 + for their activation and display distinct pharmacological properties (being readily activated by PDBu, but not by DOG, and are staurosporine-sensitive but H 7 -insensitive). This facilitatory action of OE 2 on PKC-induced LH release {{does not appear to}} involve OE 2 -induced changes in the <b>affinity</b> of <b>existing</b> PKC(s) for PDBu, or changes in the amount of releasable LH in the pituitary prior to the stimulus...|$|R
40|$|The {{received}} {{signal strength}} (RSS) clustering {{has played a}} significant role in site surveying and data pre-processing for the location tracking in Wi-Fi environment. To this end, this paper presents a novel clustering algorithm to cluster the raw RSS vectors with large similarities in both the RSS and physical locations together. The clusters of RSS vectors are determined by the cells which are generated by the Dirichlet tessellation in a transformed low-dimensional space. Our algorithm consists of two steps. We first use the Laplacian embedding to transform the raw measurements into a low-dimensional space, while preserving the RSS and location neighborhood relations. Second, after the seeds of cells are carefully selected, we will tessellate the low-dimensional space by the Dirichlet cells to obtain the clustering results. The experiments conducted in an actual public Wi-Fi environment prove that our algorithm can achieve the smallest cluster scattering in both the RSS and locations compared with the <b>existing</b> <b>affinity</b> propagation clustering, K-means clustering and binary support vector classifier (SVC) algorithms. © 2014 ISSN 1881 - 803 X...|$|R
