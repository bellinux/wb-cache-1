An important safeguard for trafficked children who have been exploited in illegal or criminal activities is the ‘non-punishment clause’.

Political parties before the nineteenth century were not as cohesive or organised as they later became. Contemporary commentators (even the reputed leaders of parties or factions) in the eighteenth century did not necessarily agree who the party supporters were. The traditional parties, which had arisen in the late seventeenth century, became increasingly irrelevant to politics in the eighteenth century (particularly after 1760), although for some contests in some constituencies party labels were still used. It was only {{towards the end of the}} century that party labels began to acquire some meaning again, although this process was by no means complete for several more generations.|$|E
25|$|The other {{lead that}} was {{discarded}} {{was one that}} suggested that Tobares was kidnapped for ransom, mainly because his possible abductors have not reached out to his family for a payment.

His last activity was on Facebook, where Tobares made a profile picture change on May 28, a few days before he went missing. Investigators believe that Tobares was probably hired as a cook by a drug lord for <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>or</b> event without him knowing who he was cooking for. At some point, investigators alleged, Tobares might have seen something suspicious that put him in danger, or might have had a problem with someone at those private events. In addition, investigators concluded that Tobares might have been a victim of gang retaliation. They allege that rival gang members might have kidnapped Tobares {{to send a message to}} his employers.|$|E
500|$|After {{the split}} from the Centre Party, the {{ideology}} of the Centre Democrats was broadly similar to that of its originator, although the Centre Party became increasingly radical in the following years. The Centre Democrats did not publish <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>or</b> electoral manifesto before 1989, and until then its policies were known primarily through the small-scale distribution of pamphlets, which were almost exact copies of old Centre Party pamphlets. Like the Centre Party, the Centre Democrats claimed to be at the centre of the political spectrum, representing a [...] "centre-democratic ideology". Nevertheless, the party focused mainly on the issue of immigration, and mainstream observers considered the party's ideology to be a populist form of nationalism.|$|E

500|$|The Populist {{strategy}} for 1896 was to nominate the candidate most supportive of silver. Populist leaders correctly believed the Republicans unlikely to nominate a silver man. They hoped the Democrats either would not endorse silver in their platform {{or if they}} did, that the Democratic candidate would be someone who could be painted as weak on silver. [...] Bryan's sterling record on the issue left the Populists with a stark choice: They could endorse Bryan, and risk losing their separate identity as <b>a</b> <b>party,</b> <b>or</b> nominate another candidate, thus dividing the pro-silver vote to McKinley's benefit. [...] According to Stanley Jones, [...] "the Democratic endorsement of silver and Bryan at Chicago precipitated the disintegration" [...] of the Populist Party; it was never again a force in national politics after 1896.|$|E

500|$|Altman's Gosford Park {{is similar}} to The Rules of the Game in many of its plot elements, {{including}} the relationship between wealthy people and their servants, and the hunting sequence.

500|$|The fourth {{legislative}} assembly election of Madras State (later renamed as Tamil Nadu) {{was held in}} February 1967. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) led coalition {{under the leadership of}} C.N. Annadurai won the election defeating the Indian National Congress (Congress). Anti-Hindi agitations, the rising prices of essential commodities and a shortage of rice were the dominant issues. K. Kamaraj's resignation as the Chief Minister in 1963, to concentrate on party affairs, along with persistent rumours of corruption had weakened the incumbent Congress Government. This was the second time after Communist Party of India winning Kerala assembly elections in 1957, for a non-Congress party to gain majority in a state in India, and the last time that Congress held power in Tamil Nadu. It was the first time <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>or</b> pre-election alliance was formed a nob-Congress government with absolute majority. [...] It marked the beginning of Dravidian dominance in the politics of Tamil Nadu. Annadurai, who became the first non-Congress chief minister of post-independence Tamil Nadu, died in office in 1969 and V.R. Nedunchezhiyan took over as acting chief minister.|$|E
500|$|Smythe also envisioned {{building}} a new shrine for his team. He described it as [...] "a place where people can go in evening clothes, {{if they want to}} come there for <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>or</b> dinner ... a place that people can be proud to bring their wives or girlfriends to". Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and Carlton Streets from the Eaton's department store chain for $350,000. Skeptics argued that Smythe would never get the arena built, nor fill it, as the Depression was in full swing. [...] They referred to the arena plan as [...] "Smythe's Folly". [...] To help fund the arena, the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20% of their wages in shares in the arena. Just 4½ months after breaking ground, Maple Leaf Gardens opened on November 12, 1931. Many in the sold-out crowd of over 13,000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe's stated goal in building the arena. [...] In 1932, five years after Smythe's promise, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers.|$|E
500|$|Confessions on a Dance Floor is a full-on dance, {{electronic}} and disco record, which is structured like a nightly set composed by a DJ. The music starts out light and happy, {{and as it}} progresses, it becomes intense, with the lyrics dealing more about personal feelings, hence [...] "Confessions". According to Madonna, [...] "his is the direction of my record. That's what we intended, to make a record that you can play at <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>or</b> in your car, where you don't have to skip past a ballad. It's nonstop." [...] Madonna used samples and references of music by other disco artists. In the album's first song, [...] "Hung Up", she sampled ABBA's 1979 hit [...] "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)", for which she wrote a personal letter to songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, who gave Madonna {{permission to use the}} track. References of other disco-influenced acts, including Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, and Daft Punk, were also used on the album, as were the disco hits of Parisian DJ Cerrone.
