25|$|As {{a result}} of the Partitions, Poles were forced to seek a change of status quo in Europe. Polish poets, politicians, noblemen, writers, artists, many of whom were forced to emigrate (thus the term Great Emigration), became the revolutionaries of the 19th century, as desire for freedom became one of the {{defining}} parts of Polish romanticism. Polish revolutionaries participated in uprisings in Prussia, the Austrian Empire and Imperial Russia. Polish legions fought alongside Napoleon and, under the slogan of For our freedom <b>and</b> <b>yours,</b> participated widely in the Spring of Nations (particularly the Hungarian Revolution of 1848).|$|E
5000|$|He who says, [...] "What's mine is mine <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is yours", is {{the median}} type, though {{some say that}} this is the quality of Sodom. He who says, [...] "What's mine is <b>yours</b> <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is mine", is a simple man. He who says, [...] "What's mine is <b>yours</b> <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is yours", is a pious man ("Hasid"). And he who says, [...] "What's <b>yours</b> is mine, <b>and</b> what's mine is mine", is wicked. (Avot, 5:10) ...|$|R
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} some viewed {{the people of}} Sodom as {{embracing}} a philosophy of [...] "what's mine is mine." [...] The Mishnah taught that there are four types of people: (1) One who says: [...] "What's mine is mine, <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is yours"; this is a neutral type, some say this {{was the type of}} Sodom. (2) One who says: [...] "What's mine is <b>yours,</b> <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is mine"; this is an unlearned person. (3) One who says: [...] "What's mine is <b>yours,</b> <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is yours"; this is a pious person. And (4) one who says: [...] "What's mine is mine, <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is mine;" [...] this is a wicked person.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{passage in}} Pirkei Avot lists four {{possible}} social relationship schemes: [...] "He who says, 'What's mine is mine <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is yours', is the median type, though {{some say that}} this is the quality of Sodom. He who says, 'What's mine is <b>yours</b> <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is mine', is a simple (or, according to other readings, an ignorant) man. He who says, 'What's mine is <b>yours</b> <b>and</b> what's <b>yours</b> is yours', is a pious man ('Hasid'). And he who says, 'What's <b>yours</b> is mine, <b>and</b> what's mine is mine', is wicked.'" [...] (Avot, 5:13). According to Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, consistent application of this ethical rule by all members of the society leads to voluntary communism.|$|R

The run of shows should start in Wavendon on 2 November and end in New Brighton on 26 November. Theo Travis reported that the band should be playing material from the 70s era – compositions by Hugh Hopper, Mike Ratledge and Karl Jenkins – {{as well as other}} pieces composed by John Etheridge or himself plus some band improvisations. The band (still) features John Etheridge on guitar, Roy Babbington on bass and John Marshall on drums <b>and</b> <b>yours</b> truly on sax, flute and keyboards.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of the day's schedule {{is determined by the}} day of the week, with the following 'fixtures' on weekdays: Book of the Week at 09:45 (the Daily Service on LW), Woman's Hour at 10:02 (including a 15 Minute Drama at 10:45), You <b>and</b> <b>Yours</b> at 12:15, The World at One and a repeat of the previous day's The Archers at 14:02, the Afternoon Drama at 14:15. At 17:00 another current affairs programme, PM, is broadcast. At 18:30 there is a regular comedy 'slot', The Archers at 19:02, Front Row at 19:15 and a repeat of the 15 Minute Drama at 19:45. The World Tonight airs at 22:00, followed by Book at Bedtime at 22:45. At weekends the schedule is different, with other fixed features at various times.|$|E
25|$|Many {{programmes}} are pre-recorded. Programmes transmitted live include Today, magazine programme Woman's Hour, {{consumer affairs}} programme You <b>and</b> <b>Yours,</b> and (often) the music, film, books, {{arts and culture}} programme Front Row. Continuity is managed from Broadcasting House with news bulletins, including the hourly summaries and longer programmes such as the Six O'Clock News and Midnight News, and news programmes such as Today, The World at One and PM, which by early 2013 had returned to Broadcasting House after 15 years at BBC Television Centre in White City. The news returning to Broadcasting House has also meant that newsreaders can provide cover for continuity, which regularly occurs at 23:00 each night and 16:00 on a Sunday. This has reduced {{the total number of}} continuity announcers required each day down from four to three.|$|E

25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine <b>and</b> <b>yours,</b> and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E

[...] Stuff.co.nz described the lyrics as [...] "happy ending" [...] and [...] "patch things up", when specifically singing the lines, [...] "I don't recall the reasons why, I must have meant them at the time, is this the sound of sweet surrender?" ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying [...] "Some of the stories I could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach." [...] Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came [...] "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, but love for my children <b>and</b> <b>yours.</b> Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals." ...|$|E

500|$|MacGregor {{said that}} he had come to London to attend King George IV's {{coronation}} on the Poyers' behalf, and to seek investment and immigrants for Poyais. He claimed to have inherited a democratic system of government there, with a basic civil service and military. To those interested MacGregor showed what he said was a copy of a printed proclamation he had issued to the Poyers on 13 April 1821. He therein announced the 1820 land grant, his departure for Europe to seek investors and colonists—"religious and moral instructors... and persons to guide and assist you"—and the appointment of Brigadier-General George Woodbine to be [...] "Vice-Cazique" [...] during his absence. [...] "POYERS!", the document concluded, [...] "I now bid you farewell for a while... I trust, that through the kindness of Almighty Providence, I shall be again enabled to return amongst you, and that then it will be my pleasing duty to hail you as affectionate friends, <b>and</b> <b>yours</b> to receive me as your faithful Cazique and Father." [...] There is no evidence that such a statement was ever actually distributed on the Mosquito Coast.|$|E
500|$|In 1846, Seward {{became the}} center of {{controversy}} in Auburn when he defended, in separate cases, two felons accused of murder. Henry Wyatt, a white man, was charged with fatally stabbing a fellow inmate in prison; William Freeman, an African American, was accused of breaking into a house after his release and stabbing four people to death. In both cases the defendants were likely mentally ill and had been abused while in prison. Seward, having long been an advocate of prison reform and better treatment for the insane, sought to prevent each man from being executed by using the relatively new defense of insanity. Seward gained a hung jury in Wyatt's first trial, though he was subsequently convicted in a retrial and executed despite Seward's efforts to secure clemency. Freeman was convicted, though Seward gained a reversal on appeal. There was no second Freeman trial, as officials were convinced of his insanity. Freeman died in prison in late 1846. In the Freeman case, invoking mental illness and racial issues, Seward argued, [...] "he is still your brother, and mine, in form and color accepted and approved by his Father, <b>and</b> <b>yours,</b> and mine, and bears equally with us the proudest inheritance of our race—the image of our Maker. Hold him then to be a Man." ...|$|E
500|$|West first {{collaborated with}} Jackson several {{months prior to}} the release of his debut album, The College Dropout (2004). West stated, [...] "I don't {{want to talk about it}} before it comes out, but it'll be unbelievable." [...] John Legend, who co-wrote the track, also plays the piano on the track. Legend was an {{upcoming}} artist and relatively unknown at the time, having not yet released his debut album Get Lifted or any singles. The song was among Legend's first major credits along with Jay-Z's [...] "Encore", West's remix of Britney Spears' [...] "Me Against the Music", and The Black Eyed Peas' [...] "The Boogie that Be." [...] Legend commented, [...] "I'm not going to focus on her breast like the rest of y'all. I'm about the music. Since everyone's paying attention to her, it should bode well for her next single [...] "Have Your Way With Me" [...] which is gonna drop next week. We're just wrapping up the production now. It's produced by Kanye West and co-written by Kanye, Harold Lilly <b>and</b> <b>yours</b> truly. I played some piano on there too. It's a sweet, soulful song. I think it'll be a smash." [...] The song also features contributions from Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari. Simon Umlauf of CNN commented Ari's contribution [...] "gently caresses" [...] the song, providing [...] "a dramatic edge you won't find anywhere else." ...|$|E
