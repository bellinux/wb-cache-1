5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{attempts to}} establish homology between {{two or more}} polymer structures based on their shape and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but {{can also be used}} for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural alignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural alignment is <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} many calls for {{alternative}} approaches to rupture risk assessment over the past number of years, with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach. Numerical modeling is <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated, thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm. Experimental models are required to validate these numerical results and provide a further insight into the biomechanical behavior of the AAA. In vivo, AAAs exhibit a varying range of material strengths from localised weak hypoxic regions to much stronger regions and areas of calcifications.|$|E
25|$|As the {{temperature}} increases, an amorphous solid will become less viscous. At {{some point the}} molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This {{is known as the}} crystallization temperature (Tc). This transition from amorphous solid to crystalline solid is an exothermic process, and results in a peak in the DSC signal. As {{the temperature}} increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (Tm). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine transition temperatures and enthalpies makes DSC <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in producing phase diagrams for various chemical systems.|$|E

25|$|Many forces also operate unmarked cars, {{in any of}} {{the roles}} shown above, but most {{frequently}} for the use of traffic enforcement or detectives. They have the advantage of not being immediately recognizable, and are <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in catching criminals while the crime is still taking place. In the United States, unmarked cars are also used by federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and the Secret Service, but can be recognized by their U.S. government plates. However, not all unmarked police cars have government license plates. Many U.S. jurisdictions use regular civilian issued license plates on unmarked cars, especially gang suppression and vice prevention units. Also see Q-car.|$|E
25|$|Recently, chloroplasts {{have caught}} {{attention}} by developers {{of genetically modified}} crops. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism {{has not yet been}} studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.|$|E
25|$|The cooling {{produced}} in the Joule–Thomson expansion makes it <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in refrigeration. The effect is applied in the Linde technique as a standard process in the petrochemical industry, where the cooling effect is used to liquefy gases, and also in many cryogenic applications (e.g. {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon. However, the Joule–Thomson effect can be used to liquefy even helium, provided that the helium gas is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.|$|E

Fine needle aspiration revealed negatively birefringent needle shaped crystals consistent with monosodium urate crystals in amorphous granular debris. Diagnosis of gouty tophi was given. On follow up serum uric acid levels {{were found to be}} high and a diagnosis of gout was established. FNAC is <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> diagnostic <b>tool</b> for {{the diagnosis of}} periarticular nodules and pathologists should be aware of cytological features of gouty tophi, particularly in cases of unusual presentation...|$|R
25|$|Chirality {{is another}} {{property}} that a DNAzyme can exploit.

Later it was found that an enantiomeric excess of 99% could be induced, and that both the rate and the enantioselectivity were related to the DNA sequence.|$|E
25|$|The affair, {{while not}} an impossibility, would {{certainly}} not have persisted beyond Marozia’s marriage to Alberic I of Spoleto in 909. The {{question of whether}} Theophylact and Theodora needed to tie Sergius to them by such means, particularly when Sergius was already deeply indebted to them for his elevation to the papacy, as well as wasting Marozia in a relationship when, {{as the daughter of}} an important house, she would have been <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> to link via marriage to another noble house, is open to debate. The birth of the future John XI in 910, after her marriage to Alberic, would seem to indicate that Sergius was not the father. However, it was highly unusual that the eldest son of a noble house would be destined for a career in the church, instead of inheriting his father’s title. That the younger brother Alberic took his father’s place as duke of Spoleto, suggests the possibility that the elder brother John was illegitimate, with Sergius being the most likely candidate for his father.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts (United States) {{established}} {{a population of}} domestic albino brown rats to {{study the effects of}} diet and for other physiological studies. Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, which have added to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for {{the health and well-being of}} humankind. The aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system. Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common cartoid artery and left subclavian artery, as well as geometrically similar, non-planar curvature in the aortic branches. Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches.
