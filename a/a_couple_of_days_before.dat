5|$|<b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the Varsity Match, talk in {{the press}} had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the second trial match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his form was lacking and he was outshone by Poulton. So for {{the third and final}} trial, England versus The Rest on 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> <b>before</b> they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
5|$|The period did {{lead to some}} {{reform of}} {{internal}} Society statutes, such as in 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along {{with a copy of}} the total income and expenditure of the Society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before.</b> As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates. The Society's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850, when a government grant-in-aid of £1,000 a year was accepted. This was increased to £4,000 in 1876, with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds, doling them out to individual scientists. This grant has now grown to over £47million, some £37million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.|$|E

25|$|With {{one point}} in hand, Lyon {{traveled}} to Munich to take on group leaders Bayern, who defeated Steaua București 1–0 on the opening matchday. With both teams coming off unimpressive matches <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> (Lyon an unspectacular 2–1 victory over Nancy and Bayern, a 0–1 loss away to Hannover 96), the match showed why with Lyon's only goal coming off the head of Bayern defender Martín Demichelis in the 25th minute from one of Juninho's spot-kicks. Bayern later equalised through Zé Roberto in the second half. Though Lyon had decent chances, including one where Karim Benzema {{had a chance to}} capitalize on a Bayern mistake late in the second half, the match remained 1–1 with Lyon leaving Munich with just two points through two matches.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in India on 8 July 1947, Radcliffe was given just five weeks {{to decide on}} a border.

He objected to the short time frame, but all parties were insistent that the line be finished by the 15 August British withdrawal from India. Mountbatten had accepted the post as Viceroy {{on the condition of}} an early deadline. The decision was completed just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the withdrawal, but due to political manoeuvring, not published until 17 August 1947, two days after the grant of independence to India and Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|Wynter {{embarked}} from Melbourne on 15 May 1940 {{with the}} advance party of I Corps with orders {{to establish a}} base organisation in the Middle East but the convoy he was travelling with was diverted to the United Kingdom. Up until <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> it arrived, the convoy had been {{under the command of}} Brigadier Leslie Morshead of the 18th Infantry Brigade but on 18 April, Wynter discovered that the Military Board back in Australia had promoted him to major general and appointed him to command the AIF in the United Kingdom. Wynter decided that, given the immediate danger of a German invasion of the United Kingdom, his force had to be ready to fight. He therefore reorganised the troops available to form a second infantry brigade. The 18th Infantry Brigade became the Southern Command Striking Force, with {{a key role in the}} defence of southern England. However, the anticipated invasion did not eventuate.|$|E
25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds.

The posters invited people to come to a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said {{that it was a good}} idea to show up with your face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, not many people would attend.|$|E

25|$|Powell {{was next}} slated {{to run the}} Aviva London Grand Prix, however he pulled out, citing a groin strain. Later in late August, just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> {{the start of the}} World Championships in Daegu, Powell shocked the world by pulling out of the highly {{anticipated}} 100m as his groin strain aggravated and did not allow him to compete. Powell expressed great disappoinment but vowed to come back strong for the London Olympics in 2012, but still hoped to run the 4x100m relay in Daegu. However, he was unfit to run the relay and had to watch his compatriots win gold in a world record time of 37.04s. Powell competed in the 100m at the Diamond League Final in Zurich on 9 September. He looked very impressive in the first 60m, but faded to second place as newly crowned world champion, Yohan Blake, took victory in 9.82s. Powell registered a 9.95s run, which was impressive given the fact that his injury was still present. By completing the race, the sprinter took the Samsung Diamond Trophy with $40,000 in cash. Powell ended his season with another injury, almost a repeat of year 2010, where he showed excellent form {{in the first half of}} the year, but unfortunately suffered injuries.|$|E
25|$|The second {{pilot was}} penned by writers Don Nicholl, Michael Ross, and Bernie West, {{better known as}} NRW, who had gained fame in {{adapting}} another British series, Till Death Us Do Part, into All in the Family. The second pilot followed the British series even more closely, with the filmmaker character David Bell becoming cooking student Jack Tripp like his English counterpart, chef Robin Tripp, {{and one of the}} women being renamed Chrissy (a character name also featured in the British version; however, the US character bore more resemblance to the other British female character, Jo). Jack's female roommates were portrayed by Joyce DeWitt as florist Janet Wood, and Susan Lanier as secretary Chrissy Snow (actress Denise Galik had originally been given the role but was dismissed <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the pilot taped). The setting of the show was also moved from North Hollywood to the beachside in Santa Monica. NRW went on to conceive the show as an all out farce, building the show's plot line heavily on the many misunderstandings encountered by each of the characters. This pilot was actually a remake of the British series episode And Mother Makes Four which was the second episode of the show. The new concept was well liked, with the exception of Lanier's portrayal of Chrissy.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the game}} at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium {{with the passing of}} North Carolina's legendary coach Dean Smith <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before,</b> both Duke and UNC coaches, players and staff all {{gathered}} at center court and held a moment of silence for Smith. Once the game started Duke jumped right out of the gate with an 18-6 lead early in the game thanks to hot shooting. UNC would respond by outscoring Duke 30-22 over the next several minutes of the 1st half to cut Duke's lead down to 40-36 with around 4 minutes left in the 1st half. Duke then went on a 9-0 run over the next 2 minutes to get their largest lead of {{the game at}} 49-36 with 2 minutes left in the half. UNC would score the last 6 points of the half to cut Duke's lead down to 49-42 at halftime. In the 2nd half almost everything went UNC's way as UNC started dominating the post and eventually built their largest lead of the game 77-67 over Duke with 4 minutes left in regulation to complete a 41-18 run over Duke in an 18-minute span. With Duke still trailing UNC 79-72 with around 2 1/2 minutes left in regulation Duke's Tyus Jones would help Duke finish regulation on a 9-2 run over UNC to tie the game at 81 points apiece to send it to overtime. In overtime, the game was filled with missed free throws, missed shots, fouls, turnovers, lead changes and ties with Duke eventually winning the game 92-90.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to Comerica Park {{for a series}} against the Detroit Tigers. They hit six doubles, including two by Chris Taylor for a 8–5 win. The Dodgers tied a major league record the next day, with their 13th consecutive interleague win, 3–0 over the Tigers. The 2004 Devil Rays and 2006 Red Sox had also won 13 in a row. However, that streak {{came to an end}} the next day, with a 6–1 loss in the series finale. Curtis Granderson, whom the Dodgers had acquired from the Mets <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before,</b> hit a solo homer for the Dodgers only run but a four-run sixth, sparked by a Justin Upton homer did them in. They {{traveled to}} PNC Park the next day for a four-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Puig hit a home run in the 12th inning to give the Dodgers a 6–5 win. Granderson hit a grand slam homer earlier in the game, and became the first player in MLB history to hit two grand slams in the same week for two different organizations. The following day, spot starter Brock Stewart struggled, allowing five runs in the third inning without recording an out but the Dodgers bullpen prevented more damage and the offense picked up the clack. Chris Taylor had three hits and three RBI as they came back to win 8–5. In the next game, Rich Hill took a perfect game into the ninth inning only to have it broken up by an error on Logan Forsythe. With the Dodgers offense unable to score, he remained in the game for the 10th and allowed his first hit, a leadoff homer by Josh Harrison to lose the game 1–0. Granderson hit his third homer of the week in the next game, and Yasmani Grandal and Adrian Gonzalez hit back-to-back homers in the eighth as they took the final game of the series, 5–2. They became the first Dodgers team ever and the first in the majors since the 2001 Mariners to win their 90th game within their first 126 games.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, having {{retreated to}} the island of Lobau after the battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{knew that he had}} failed in his attempt to cross the Danube and was so {{astonished}} by the severity of the setback that he remained in unaccustomed inaction for 36 hours. After recovering his usual drive, his immediate concern was to improve the dire situation of his army, which was in very bad shape and virtually trapped on Lobau island, after the Danube had swollen. With his usual tireless activity, he supervised the transformation of Lobau island into a huge army base. The French built temporary campaign hospitals for his 20,000 wounded, as well as warehouses and barracks, which sheltered a numerous permanent military garrison. As soon a secure bridge was built, the Emperor had the wounded and a part of the troops transferred to the mainland, but maintained IV Corps on the island. He did not intend to abandon this position, as he was planning {{to use it as a}} springboard for his upcoming crossing. His next task was to rebuild the army. Casualties had been roughly equal to those of the enemy, but, with fewer troops engaged, some of Napoleon's battalions needed rebuilding from scratch. Losses in officers in particular had been extremely high and proved difficult to replace. Maréchal Jean Lannes, one of Napoleon's ablest commanders and a personal friend, had been mortally wounded in action and died nine days after the battle. Another irreplaceable loss was Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire, who had been created a Marshal of the Empire just a month before, in recognition of his brilliant conduct during the earlier campaign, but received a mortal wound during the battle and died before the coveted baton could arrive from Paris. Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne, another famous general was killed in action at the head of his cuirassiers and the commander in chief of the artillery, Nicolas-Marie Songis des Courbons, became severely ill and had to leave his command a few weeks after the battle. Despite all these setbacks, the army and its officers retained total confidence in Napoleon's ability to lead them to victory and morale remained high. Evidence of this came <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the newly planned crossing of the Danube, when Napoleon's most senior Corps commander, Maréchal André Masséna fell from his horse and badly injured his foot, rendering him unable to ride for some time. In sheer contrast with Hiller's gesture, Masséna, although in significant pain, made arrangements to lead his men in battle from a phaeton and vowed to retain his command, much to the Emperor's relief.|$|E
