5|$|The video {{begins with}} One Direction {{waking up in}} a tent. Outside, Payne starts singing the opening lines, as others are seen playing guitars sitting on hay bales in a camp setting. Subsequent scenes inter cut {{featuring}} One Direction performing the song at the camp setting in a circle, on an open field, driving a car, and at a lake where {{members of the group}} play in plastic bubbles and boats. As it turns to nighttime, the camp is the main setting; they conduct a football match and afterwards a pool party. The video ends with One Direction looking at the camera, with Malik singing the last line. Throughout the video, teenage boys and girls <b>are</b> <b>showing</b> with the band.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, {{the virus is}} spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both {{before and during the}} time they <b>are</b> <b>showing</b> symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{regulations}} have introduced the Build–operate–transfer (BOT) scheme for Iranian projects. This {{is a rather}} new possibility in the Iranian market.

Iranian authorities <b>are</b> <b>showing</b> some flexibility regarding the BOT, which could potentially pave the way for more foreign investment in the market.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{motivation}} to learn is not solely influenced on {{their desire to}} belong but also their eagerness to see their community succeed.

It is suggested it would integrate Sandia's latest designs using LTDs. Sandia labs recently proposed a conceptual 1 petawatt (1015 watts) LTD Z-pinch power plant, where the electric discharge would reach 70 million amperes. As of 2012, fusion shot simulations at 60 to 70 million amperes <b>are</b> <b>showing</b> a 100 to 1000 fold return on input energy.

Australia's notes are printed by Note Printing Australia, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Note Printing Australia prints polymer notes or simply supplies the polymer substrate for a growing number of other countries including Bangladesh, Brunei, Chile, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Romania, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.

25|$|In January 2013, the Architect of the Capitol {{announced}} a four-year, $10 million project to repair and conserve the Capitol Dome's exterior and the Capitol rotunda. The proposal {{would require the}} stripping of lead paint from {{the interior of the}} dome, repair to the ironwork, repainting of the interior of the dome, rehabilitation of the interstitial space between the dome and rotunda, and installation of new lighting in the interstitial space and the rotunda. The dome and rotunda, which were last conserved in 1960, <b>are</b> <b>showing</b> significant signs of rust and disrepair. There is a danger that decorative ironwork could fall from the rotunda to the space below, and that weather-related problems could damage the artwork in the rotunda.

25|$|Kurzweil {{explains}} that in 1999 computers {{are essential to}} most facets of life, yet he predicts no major disruption related to the then-pending Y2K problem. He says computers are narrow-minded and brittle so far, but suggests in specific domains they <b>are</b> <b>showing</b> signs of intelligence. As examples Kurzweil cites computer generated or assisted music, and tools for the automatic or semi-automatic production of literature or poetry. He shows examples of paintings by AARON as programmed by Harold Cohen which can be automatically created. Kurzweil reviews some of his predictions from The Age of Intelligent Machines and various past presentations, and is very pleased with his record. Finally he predicts a new Luddite movement as intelligent machines take away jobs, although he predicts {{a net gain of}} new and better jobs.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, MREs {{have been}} {{developed}} using the Dietary Reference Intake, created by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM indicated servicemembers (who were classified as highly active men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 30) typically burn about 4,200 Calories (kcal) a day, but tended to only consume about 2,400 Calories a day during combat, entering a negative energy balance. This imbalance occurs when servicemembers fail to consume full portions of their rations. Although manipulations to the food items and distribution of macronutrients to help boost the amount of kilocalories per MRE have been made, more studies <b>are</b> <b>showing</b> many servicemembers still do not meet today's standards of daily consumption, often trading and discarding portions of the ration. Researchers continue to study the habits and eating preferences of servicemembers, making constant changes that encourage servicemembers to eat the entire meal and thus get full nutritional value.|$|E
