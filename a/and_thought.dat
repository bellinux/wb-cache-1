5|$|Both McLuhan and Innis {{assume the}} {{centrality}} of communication technology; where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization <b>and</b> <b>thought.</b> McLuhan has {{much to say about}} perception <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> but little to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception <b>and</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E

However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, it is thought that her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E
5|$|Ahimsa (Non-violence or Non-injury). Mahavira {{taught that}} every living being has {{sanctity}} and dignity {{of its own}} {{and it should be}} respected just as one expects one's own sanctity and dignity to be respected. Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The concept applies to action, speech, <b>and</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} {{originator}} of {{the principle}} of nonviolence, {{he was the first to}} apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words <b>and</b> <b>thought.</b> Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.|$|E

5|$|As {{there were}} no further goals, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Wright and Denis Irwin missed their penalties; the decisive penalty, taken by Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman, was saved by his {{opposite}} number, Peter Schmeichel. Arsenal manager George Graham admitted his surprise over how the game was decided <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> both clubs would share the trophy; his counterpart Alex Ferguson, though delighted with his team's victory, felt the sudden death aspect was unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend {{had fallen into}} depression, {{wondering}} if {{he was no longer}} a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
5|$|Captain John Saris {{may have}} brought back {{examples}} of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613, a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C.

5|$|In 1805, on {{the journey}} westward down the Columbia, the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{recorded}} seeing the mountain; noting that it was “a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow” <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> it “perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.” They initially misidentified it as Mount St. Helens, which had been previously discovered and named by George Vancouver. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it “a very high humped mountain”. This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the race, Secretariat was seen as the {{favorite}} to win by many; however there were doubts about him following a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby. In the wake of Secretariat's loss, Angle Light and, in particular, Sham were the horses that were seen as the most likely to win the Derby, aside from Secretariat. Many sportswriters believed that the horses in the field possessed great speed <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> the course record would be broken.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate.

Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E
