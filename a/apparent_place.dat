Thus, also, aberration and nutation resulted as residual phenomena from that portion of the changes of the apparent places of the fixed stars which was left unaccounted for by precession. And thus again the apparent proper motions of the stars are the observed residues of their apparent movements outstanding and unaccounted for by strict calculation of the effects of precession, nutation, and aberration. The nearest approach which human theories can make to perfection is to diminish this residue, this caput mortuum of observation, as it may be considered, as much as practicable, and, if possible, to reduce it to nothing, either by showing that something has been neglected in our estimation of known causes, or by reasoning upon it as a new fact, and on the principle of the inductive philosophy ascending from the effect to its cause or causes.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Artificial {{intelligence}} {{has always been}} a controversial field of research, assaulted from without by philosophers disputing its possibility and riven within by divisions of ideology and method. Recently the re-emergence of neural network models of cognition has combined with the criticisms of Hubert Dreyfus to challenge the pre-eminent position of symbolicist ideology and method within artificial intelligence. Although the conceits of symbolicism are well worth exposing, I find the marriage between connectionism and Dreyfus's philosophical viewpoint unnatural and much of the disputation between connectionism and artificial intelligence misbegotten. 1 1 Introduction In recent years {{much has been made of}} the tensions, disputes and divergent methods of `traditional ' artificial intelligence on the one hand [...] which relies upon the use of purely symbolic, qualitative reasoning, such as that supported by symbolic logic [...] and connectionism on the other [...] which prefers to use neural network models of reasoning that have no <b>apparent</b> <b>place</b> for symbols at all. It has been commonly asserted that connectionist AI has opened up new possibilities for investigating mind and reasoning using non-algorithmic, sub-symbolic approaches that would otherwise be unavailable. Connectionist modeling has also received a (partially) sympathetic response from Hubert Dreyfus, who has spent much energy since the 1960 s attempting to establish the impossibility of artificial intelligence [...] at least if using non-connectionist means. Many connectionists have in their turn decided that Dreyfus's arguments offer support in their own disputes with symbolic AI...|$|E
40|$|Daily {{schedules}} {{of limited}} access to food, palatable high calorie snacks, water and salt can induce circadian rhythms of anticipatory locomotor activity in rats and mice. All of these stimuli are rewarding, but whether anticipation can be induced by neural correlates of reward independent of metabolic perturbations associated with manipulations of food and hydration is unclear. Three experiments were conducted to determine whether mating, a non-ingestive behavior that is potently rewarding, can induce circadian anticipatory activity rhythms in male rats provided scheduled daily access to steroid-primed estrous female rats. In Experiment 1, rats anticipated access to estrous females in the mid-light period, but also exhibited post-coital eating and running. In Experiment 2, post-coital eating and running were prevented and {{only a minority of}} rats exhibited anticipation. Rats allowed to see and smell estrous females showed no anticipation. In both experiments, all rats exhibited sustained behavioral arousal and multiple mounts and intromissions during every session, but ejaculated only every 2 – 3 days. In Experiment 3, the rats were given more time with individual females, late at night for 28 days, and then in the midday for 28 days. Ejaculation rates increased and anticipation was robust to night sessions and significant although weaker to day sessions. The anticipation rhythm persisted during 3 days of constant dark without mating. During anticipation of nocturnal mating, the rats exhibited a significant preference for a tube to the mating cage over a tube to a locked cage with mating cage litter.
