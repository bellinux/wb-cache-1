5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert <b>and</b> <b>ready.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the {{legislature}} added {{an extension of}} Route 15 from US 101 at Willits (north of Ukiah) west to SR 1 near Fort Bragg.

Subsequent improvements include {{the construction of the}} Golden Center Freeway, connecting Grass Valley with Nevada City, in the late 1960s, and a new alignment of SR 20 west from Grass Valley, bypassing Rough <b>and</b> <b>Ready,</b> in the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|The first {{batches of}} vinegar {{produced}} by fermentation probably followed {{errors in the}} winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the grapes. As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners {{did not understand the}} process.|$|E
