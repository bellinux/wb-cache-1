25|$|In the Netherlands, a low-lying country, dams {{were often}} applied to block rivers {{in order to}} {{regulate}} the water level and to prevent the sea from entering the marsh lands.

In the case of E Pluribus Unum, Wilson encouraged research about the African American experience in Indianapolis and incorporated public outreach in order to educate the community and promote dialogue.|$|E
25|$|The Trail of Tears is {{the name}} given to the forced {{movement}} of {{the peoples of the}} Cherokee, Muscogee, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations out of their home, walking to the Indian Territory under President Andrew Jackson to make their homelands available to white settlers. This was a comparable experience of rejection from long time homelands, with the difference that these tribes never returned home, but were given reservations, ever-shrinking, in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> climate unlike their historic lands.|$|E
25|$|After having {{achieved}} this victory, Elisabeth did not stay to enjoy it, but instead {{embarked on a}} life of travel, and saw little of her children. “If I arrived at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> knew that I could never leave it again, the whole stay would become hell despite being paradise”. After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace in Corfu which she named the Achilleion, after Homer's hero Achilles in The Iliad. After her death, the building was purchased by German Emperor Wilhelm II. Later it was acquired by the nation of Greece and converted to a museum.|$|E

25|$|Richards {{was born}} at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in South Kensington, London. She was named Dakota Blue because her mother wanted a {{combination}} of <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> a colour. The family moved to Sussex where she attended Newlands School. At school, she took very few drama classes {{and she was not}} an active participant in class assemblies or school plays; she missed out on the part of Mary in the nativity play. Nonetheless, throughout primary school, she attended weekend drama classes and took time out of school to attend auditions. She finished at St Paul's Primary School, then began attending Blatchington Mill School in Hove and the K-Bis Theatre School.|$|E
25|$|While {{borrowing}} {{much from}} the preceding Etruscan architecture, {{such as the use}} of hydraulics and the construction of arches, Roman prestige architecture remained firmly under the spell of Ancient Greek architecture and the classical orders. This came initially from Magna Graecia, the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and indirectly from Greek influence on the Etruscans, but after the Roman conquest of Greece directly from the best classical and Hellenistic examples in the Greek world. The influence is evident in many ways; for example, in the introduction and use of the Triclinium in Roman villas as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> manner of dining. Roman builders employed Greeks in many capacities, especially in the great boom in construction in the early Empire.|$|E
25|$|According to Catholic teaching, {{the whole}} of Christ, body and blood, soul and divinity, is in the sacrament, under each of the {{appearances}} of bread and wine and in {{each part of the}} appearances of bread and wine (since the substance of bread or wine is in each part of ordinary bread or wine, and the substance of Christ is in each part of the consecrated and transubstantiated elements of the host and the cup of the sacrament), but he is not in the sacrament as in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> is not moved when the sacrament is moved. He is perceptible neither by the sense nor by the imagination, but only by the intellectual eye.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

Among the speculated subjects are <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> a person. Hugh Laurie recorded a cover of the song {{around the time of}} its selection to the National Recording Registry. He commented about the mystery as follows: [...] "I thought it was better not knowing. It adds to its mystique and its power to make me laugh and cry all in one go." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Morrison {{released}} The Healing Game. The album received mixed reviews, {{with the}} lyrics being described as [...] "tired" [...] and [...] "dull", though critic Greil Marcus praised the musical {{complexity of the}} album by saying: [...] "It carries the listener into a musical home so perfect and complete {{he or she might}} have forgotten that music could call up such <b>a</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> then populate it with people, acts, wishes, fears." [...] The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a two-disc set, The Philosopher's Stone. His next release, 1999's Back on Top, achieved a modest success, being his highest charting album in the US since 1978's Wavelength.|$|E

500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of <b>a</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E
500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh at themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was about to say about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{finds an}} Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes another 'side operation' via a local agency {{operative}} named Skip (Vince Colosimo) {{and that he}} is to conduct an operation without Ferris' knowledge. Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi, who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house. As he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in such <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam (via 'back channels') corroborates the acceptance of killing by those who remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running [...] "side operations" [...] which interfere and (at least) undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam flower market, and kill at least 75 people.|$|E
