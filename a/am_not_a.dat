5|$|From 1954 to 1959 Dawkins {{attended}} Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English {{public school}} with a distinct Church of England flavour, where he was in Laundimer house. While at Oundle, Dawkins read Bertrand Russell's Why I <b>Am</b> <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> Christian for the first time. He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and Doctor of Philosophy degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year. Tinbergen was {{a pioneer in the}} study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning and choice; Dawkins's research in this period concerned models of animal decision-making.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread.

Still I did not cry, because I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
