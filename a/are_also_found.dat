5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E

Small but commercially important quantities <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa. The native form of ruthenium is a very rare mineral (Ir replaces part of Ru in its structure).|$|E
