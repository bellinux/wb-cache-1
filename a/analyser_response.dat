40|$|Background: The Innocor device {{contains}} a highly sensitive photoacoustic gas analyser {{that has been}} used to perform multiple breath washout (MBW) measurements using very low concentrations of the tracer gas SF 6. Use in smaller subjects has been restricted by the requirement for a gas <b>analyser</b> <b>response</b> time of, 100 ms, in order to ensure accurate estimation of lung volumes at rapid ventilation rates. Methods: A series of previously reported and novel enhancements were made to the gas analyser to produce a clinically practical system with a reduced response time. An enhanced lung model system, capable of delivering highly accurate ventilation rates and volumes, was used to assess in vitro accuracy of functional residual capacity (FRC) volume calculation and the effects of flow and gas signal alignment on this. Results: 10 – 90 % rise time was reduced from 154 to 88 ms. In an adult/child lung model, accuracy of volume calculation was 20. 9 to 2. 9 % for all measurements, including those with ventilation rate of 30 /min and FRC of 0. 5 L; for the un-enhanced system, accuracy deteriorated at higher ventilation rates and smaller FRC. In a separate smaller lung model (ventilation rate 60 /min, FRC 250 ml, tidal volume 100 ml), mean accuracy of FRC measurement for the enhanced system was minus 0. 95 % (range 23. 8 to 2. 0 %).

We estimated {{for the first time the}} heritability of the pulsatility of choroidal blood flow. We also sought to confirm the heritability of corneal hysteresis, central corneal thickness, and 3 ways of measuring intraocular pressure. Methods: Measurements were performed on 96 first-degree relatives recruited from Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal. Corneal hysteresis was determined using the Reichert Ocular <b>Response</b> <b>Analyser.</b> Central corneal thickness was measured with an ultrasound pachymeter. Three measures of intraocular pressure were obtained: Goldmann-correlated and corneal compensated intraocular pressure using the Ocular <b>Response</b> <b>Analyser,</b> and Pascal intraocular pressure using the Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer. The pulsatility of choroidal blood velocity and flow were measured in the sub-foveolar choroid using single-point laser Doppler flowmetry (Oculix).

The <b>response</b> of the YAP detector to the radiative capture g emission from the uranium analyser foil has been characterized with a biparametric measurement of a reference Pb sample, which allowed simultaneous measurements of both neutron time-offlight and gamma pulse height (energy) spectra.

DCT was closest to Goldmann IOP and had the lowest variance. CCT was significantly different (F= 8. 305, p< 0. 001) between the 3 conditions as was CH (F= 6. 854, p= 0. 002) and CRF (F= 19. 653, p< 0. 001). IOPcc measures were not affected by CCT. The DCT was generally not affected by corneal biomechanical factors. Conclusion: This study suggests that as the true pressure of the eye cannot be determined non-invasively, measurements from any tonometer should be interpreted with care, particularly when alterations in the corneal tissue are suspected...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare corneal biomechanical {{parameters}} and two measures of intraocular pressure (IOP) in eyes {{before and after}} excimer laser refractive surgery, with the Ocular <b>Response</b> <b>Analyser</b> (ORA). Materials and methods: Eighty normal eyes of 41 patients undergoing excimer laser refractive surgery in Birmingham, U. K. were recruited into three groups: Laser Assisted-Epithelial Keratomileusis (LASEK) (Myopes), Laser Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) (myopes) and LASIK (hyperopes). The preop and 3 months postop Goldmann correlated IOP (IOPg), corneal compensated IOP (IOPcc), corneal hysteresis (CH), and corneal resistance factor (CRF) were measured by the ORA. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured using ultrasonic pachymeter. The differences {{of the changes in}} IOPg, IOPcc, CH, CRF and CCT between the three groups were estimated. A General Linear Model was selected to investigate the influence of gender, age, initial conditions (CH, CRF, CCT, IOPcc and IOPg) and changes in CCT on the measured IOP. Results: The differences between the mean IOPg, CH and CRF after refractive surgery were statistically significant for all three groups. The hyperopic LASIK group had a significantly smaller change compared to the other groups (which had no statistical significance). The preop IOPg, preop CH and gender were significant predictors of the changes in measured pressure and biomechanical parameters after surgery in the myopic groups only. Conclusion: CH and CRF were found to decrease after both myopic and hyperopic refractive surgery. CH and CRF measurement may prove important tools to clarify the role of corneal biomechanics for refractive surgery...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the influence of corneal astigmatism, corneal curvature and meridional differences on corneal hysteresis (CH) and the corneal resistance factor (CRF) {{in a group of}} normal Chinese persons. Methods: Ninety-five participants were recruited and data from the eye with higher corneal astigmatism were analysed. The anterior corneal curvature was measured by corneal topography. The Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg), corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc), CH and CRF at different meridians (default horizontal position, 10 °, 20 ° and 30 ° along the superotemporal and inferonasal meridians) were obtained from an ocular <b>response</b> <b>analyser.</b> The corneal powers at these specific meridians also were calculated. Results: At the default position, the IOPg and CRF had weak correlations with corneal astigmatism, while the IOPcc and CH were not significantly correlated with corneal astigmatism. Both the IOPg and IOPcc were measured significantly higher at the default position. The CH and CRF were lower at the default position but the difference in the CRF from obliquity could not reach statistical significance. The CH was not significantly correlated with the corneal power at all meridians. The CRF correlated with the corneal power only at 30 ° superotemporal. Conclusion: Corneal astigmatism and head tilt did not have much effect on the measurement of CH and the CRF, both of which were lowest along the horizontal meridian. Clinically, the difference was small. The influence of corneal power on CH and the CRF was minimal. School of Optometr...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{embrittlement}} is {{a significant}} issue in the gas processing industry, where the precipitation of mercury from the gas stream in cryogenic heat exchangers can lead to embrittlement of the aluminium structure {{and it has been}} the cause of several significant failures. This paper studies the use of impedance spectroscopy to examine the interface between mercury droplets and 5083 aluminium. As-received, mechanically polished and artificially aged samples were examined using a two electrode mode with a zero bias. The Nyquist results indicated that as-received and polished and aged samples behaved as an Rs-C-Rp type circuit, indicating that the oxide film could be modelled as a capacitor and resistor in parallel. Using the dielectric constant of alumina, the capacitance results yielded oxide films of thickness between 2. 2 and 50 nm, depending on the degree of aging of the sample. By gradually increasing the voltage amplitude, {{it was found that the}} interface broke down at a field strength of approximately 10 MV/m, which is similar to the dielectric field strength of alumina. Immediately after polishing, however, no film was found and the interface appeared to be a simple short circuit. A series of bend tests coupled with the frequency <b>response</b> <b>analyser</b> were used to demonstrate that the film remained continuous beyond the point at which plastic deformation occurred and in many cases up until the point at which embrittlement occurred. These results have confirmed that the oxide film on aluminium can effectively separate mercury from the underlying aluminium alloy and that impedance spectroscopy is a useful tool for studying the stability of the interface...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation of}} corneal biomechanical parameters to structural characteristics in normal, forme fruste keratoconic, keratoconic and collagen crosslinked eyes. The study was based at Macquarie University eye clinic, Sydney and Sydney Cornea Clinic, Sydney. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 50 normal, 10 forme fruste keratoconic, 100 keratoconic and 25 crosslinked eyes. All eyes were imaged using the Scheimpflug camera Pentacam and the Ocular <b>response</b> <b>analyser.</b> The main outcome measures were central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal volume (CV), maximal keratometry (Kmax), corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF). Results: Significant differences were noted between all four groups of eyes for CCT, CV, Kmax, CH and CRF values (p < 0. 05 by ANOVA). CH and CRF correlated negatively (CH: r = − 0. 40, CRF: r = − 0. 44, both p < 0. 0001) with the Pentacam topographic keratoconus classification. Both CH and CRF correlated positively with CCT and CV for normal, keratoconic and crosslinked eyes. In contrast, significant negative correlations were observed between CH, CRF and Kmax in keratoconic eyes (CH: r = − 0. 43, CRF: r = − 0. 53; both p < 0. 0001) whereas no association was noted for normal and crosslinked eyes. Conclusions: Corneal biomechanical parameters progressively decrease as severity of keratoconus increases. CH and CRF are influenced by corneal structure, with higher values noted in corneas with greater thickness and volume and flatter curvature. Collagen cross linking appears to normalise the relationship of corneal curvature to biomechanical profile in keratoconic eyes. 1 page(s...|$|R
