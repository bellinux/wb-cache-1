5|$|An <b>abelian</b> <b>group,</b> or {{commutative}} {{group is}} a group whose group operation is commutative.|$|E
25|$|A ring is an <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> with {{a second}} binary {{operation}} that is associative, is distributive over the <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> operation, and has an identity element. By extension from the integers, the <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> operation is called addition and the second binary operation is called multiplication.|$|E
25|$|Every ring is an <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> {{with respect}} to its {{addition}} operation. In a commutative ring the invertible elements, or units, form an abelian multiplicative group. In particular, the real numbers are an <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> under multiplication.|$|E
50|$|Finitely-generated <b>Abelian</b> <b>groups</b> are better-behaved than non-finitely-generated <b>Abelian</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{theory of}} <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> is decidable. The theory of Infinite {{divisible}} torsion-free <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> is complete, {{as is the}} theory of Infinite <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> of exponent p (for p prime).|$|R
50|$|Taking the torsion {{subgroup}} makes torsion <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> into a coreflective subcategory of <b>abelian</b> <b>groups,</b> {{while taking}} the quotient by the torsion subgroup makes torsion-free <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> into a reflective subcategory.|$|R
25|$|As we have stated, {{the dual}} group of a locally compact <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> is a locally compact <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> {{in its own}} right and thus has a Haar measure, or more {{precisely}} a whole family of scale-related Haar measures.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} infinite <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> is {{the infinite}} cyclic group Z. Any finitely generated <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> A is isomorphic to the direct sum of r copies of Z and a finite <b>abelian</b> <b>group,</b> {{which in turn}} is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many cyclic groups of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number r, called the rank of A, and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.|$|E
25|$|A finitely {{generated}} torsion-free <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> is free.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Abelian</b> <b>groups</b> of rank 0 {{are exactly}} the {{periodic}} <b>abelian</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the category}} of all <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> is an <b>abelian</b> category. The category of all finitely generated <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> is also an abelian category, as is {{the category of}} all finite <b>abelian</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Infinitely {{generated}} <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> {{have very}} complex structure and {{are far less}} well understood than finitely generated <b>abelian</b> <b>groups.</b> Even torsion-free <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> are vastly more varied in their characteristics than vector spaces. Torsion-free <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> of rank 1 are far more amenable than those of higher rank, and a satisfactory classification exists, {{even though there are}} an uncountable number of isomorphism classes.|$|R
25|$|The rationals Q (with addition) form an {{injective}} <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> (i.e. an injective Z-module). The factor group Q/Z and {{the circle}} group are also injective Z-modules. The factor group Z/nZ for n > 1 is injective as a Z/nZ-module, but not injective as an <b>abelian</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
25|$|A torsion-free <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> has no non-trivial finite subgroups.|$|E
25|$|Every {{group is}} a monoid and every <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> a {{commutative}} monoid.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{fundamental}} theorem of finitely generated <b>abelian</b> <b>groups,</b> {{it follows that}} <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> are amenable.|$|R
50|$|If R is {{the ring}} of integers, then non-trivial free <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> and non-trivial <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> of prime power order are coprimary.|$|R
5000|$|Ab, the {{category}} of <b>abelian</b> <b>groups,</b> with the direct sum of <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> as monoidal product and the trivial group as unit.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} basic invariants of an {{infinite}} <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> A is its rank: the cardinality of the maximal linearly independent subset of A. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are necessarily subgroups of Q and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> of finite rank r is a subgroup of Qr. On the other hand, the group of p-adic integers Zp is a torsion-free <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> of infinite Z-rank and the groups Z with different n are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.|$|E
25|$|Every {{infinite}} cyclic {{group is}} isomorphic to the additive group of Z, the integers. Every finite cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the additive group of Z/nZ, the integers modulo n. Every cyclic group is an <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> (meaning that its group operation is commutative), and every finitely generated <b>abelian</b> <b>group</b> {{is a direct}} product of cyclic groups.|$|E

It follows that the Euler characteristic of the n-torus is 0 for all n. The cohomology ring H•(Tn,Z) can be identified with the exterior algebra over the Z-module Zn whose generators are the duals of the n nontrivial cycles.|$|E

The current paper studies the more general case of quasi-ordered <b>abelian</b> <b>groups,</b> identifying some of their more fundamental properties and their relationships to partially ordered and lattice-ordered groups. We reinterpret the category of quasi-ordered <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> with order preserving morphisms by examining the interplay between the group and the set of all positive elements under the quasi-ordering. The main result shows that the category of quasi-ordered <b>abelian</b> <b>groups</b> is monadic over the category of set monomorphisms...|$|R
