40|$|<b>Agribusinesses</b> rely on {{producers}} choosing {{their products}} and services {{for the success of}} their business. <b>Agribusinesses</b> can use information regarding how producers rate the importance of certain areas of risk and what takes most of the producers 2 ̆ 7 time to offer specific services to different segments of producers to better meet their needs. An ordered logit model and a multinomial logit model are used to determine factors significant to producers 2 ̆ 7 use of time and importance of various areas of risk. The producers are then segmented into groups based on their risk perceptions. From this research, <b>agribusinesses</b> can recognize that different types of producers will view risks as more important and will {{spend most of their time}} differently. It is important to recognize these differences between producers and have conversations with producers about making their operation more efficient or about risks that are important to them. Relating to producers will allow <b>agribusinesses</b> to get their attention and potentially allow them to win their business. <b>Agribusinesses</b> should also offer multiple products that would meet the needs of the different segments of producers...|$|R

40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 In {{this study}} brand loyalty of {{pharmaceutical}} livestock products among commercial farmers was measured. The {{purpose of the}} study was to assist <b>agribusinesses</b> to identify the dominant determinant when commercial farmers purchase pharmaceutical livestock products from them. The study analysed two marketing mix elements price and product (specifically brand name) in farmer buying behaviour. A structured questionnaire was used to employ an empirical study in a quantitative style to determine the commercial farmers‟ perceptions and buying behaviour when they buy pharmaceutical livestock products. For <b>agribusinesses</b> the study makes it clear where to focus resources and energy in today‟s dynamic, uncertain and competitive environment that <b>agribusinesses</b> operate in, specifically in the North West Province of South Africa. The literature study addressed the brand loyalty constructs and their application in the agricultural market. Resultantly the contribution to the body of knowledge pertains to brand loyalty‟s influence in the marketing strategy (price and brand name). The study also explored opportunities for the successful distribution of pharmaceutical livestock products through <b>agribusinesses.</b> Management of <b>agribusinesses</b> will have to adopt a market-oriented strategy that will assist <b>agribusinesses</b> on various dimensions of performance and will have a significant positive effect on return on assets, sales growth and sustainability.

40|$|The gap {{in access}} to {{broadband}} internet service between {{rural and urban}} areas of Missouri is wide and growing. This has serious implication for the competitiveness and viability of farms and <b>agribusinesses</b> and {{for the quality of}} life for rural residents, especially farm families. Agriculture has become a highly information dependent industry. High speed internet is necessary to efficiently access markets information and to market their products locally, regionally, nationally and globally. Information is even more important for producers in higher value niche markets. Many farming technologies require high speed, wireless connectivity. Broadband combined with GPS, allows farmers to reduce inputs and increase quality and quantity of products. Similarly, broadband access allows Missouri’s <b>agribusinesses</b> to compete in national and global markets. Broadband access allows <b>agribusinesses</b> reduce costs, increase markets, and more effectively manage branch offices. An overwhelming percentage (88 %) of <b>agribusinesses</b> using dial-up would prefer a broadband connection. Trends suggest that the current rural-urban gap will continue to grow wider.

In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion Malagasy francs. He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion Malagasy francs, and declared 77 million Malagasy francs in annual revenues.

5|$|There {{had been}} {{criticism}} of MIS companies generally, and Great Southern Group (as the largest {{company in the}} sector) in particular, suggesting that their appetite for land for plantations and <b>agribusiness</b> was driving up land prices in some regions, and distorting some commodity markets. In 2004, Great Southern's leading competitor Timbercorp reported a rise in plantation land prices from around A$3,000 to around A$6,000 per hectare in just five years. The high demand for forestry MIS schemes led to plantations being expanded on to less suitable land, with timber growth and yield then falling below projections that were based on better quality plantations. Some farmers claimed that MIS were driving up prices in agricultural water markets. Opinion was also divided about whether the expansion of MIS properties in a region was causing shrinkage of towns or was, conversely, stimulating employment.|$|E

To achieve this purpose, we developed some hypotheses and critically reviewed existing theoretical and empirical literatures. <b>Agribusinesses</b> quoted in the Nigerian Stock Exchange Factbook of 2009 were considered as the population for this study.
