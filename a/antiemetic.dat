5|$|<b>Antiemetic</b> {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|CPAs {{have been}} {{implemented}} {{for the management of}} a plethora of chronic disease states, including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous thromboembolism in outpatient clinics, and in the oncology setting, including the management of <b>antiemetic</b> (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. <b>Antiemetic</b> drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Middle ear surgery (tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy) {{performed}} {{under general}} or local anesthesia is associ-ated {{with a high}} incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Between 50 % and 80 % of patients who un-dergo these surgical procedures experience PONV. Numerous <b>antiemetics</b> have been studied for the prevention of PONV after middle ear surgery. Traditional <b>antiemetics,</b> including anticholinergics (e. g., scopolamine), phenothiazines (e. g., promethazine), butyrophenones (e. g., droperidol), and benzamide (e. g., metoclopramide), are used for the prevention of PONV during 0 - 24 h after anesthesia. The available nontraditional <b>antiemetics</b> that {{have been shown to be}} effective for the prophylaxis against PONV are propofol, dexamethasone, tandospirone, and midazolam. Antiserotinins (ondansetron, granisetron, and ramosetron) are highly effective in decreasing the incidence of PONV for 24 h postoperatively, compared with traditional <b>antiemetics.</b> Ramosetron is effective for the long-term (up to 48 h) prevention of PONV. None of the available <b>antiemetics</b> is entirely effective, perhaps because most of them act through the blockade on one type of receptor. There is a possibility that combined <b>antiemetics</b> with different sites of activity would be more effective than one drug alone for preventing PONV. Nonpharmacological technique is acustimulation at P 6 (Nei-Kuwan) point. Clinicians should consider these clinical strategies as mentioned above for preventing PONV after middle ear surgery in adult patients...|$|R

40|$|Background: The authors {{assessed}} {{the willingness to}} pay (WTP) for "perfect" prophylactic <b>antiemetics</b> and analgesics in patients who were scheduled to undergo surgery during general anesthesia. Furthermore, they determined whether postoperative experiences of pain and nausea and vomiting (PONV) changed patients' WTP. Methods: Data were collected alongside a randomized clinical trial that investigated the incidence of PONV in patients anesthetized with either inhalation anesthesia or total intravenous anesthesia. A subset of 808 consecutive patients participating in the trial completed WTP questionnaires 1 day before and 2 weeks after surgery. The outcome measure was {{the maximum amount of}} money that patients were willing to pay for "perfect" <b>antiemetics</b> and analgesics. Preoperative WTP and individual WTP changes after surgery were analyzed in relation to baseline characteristics and postoperative pain and PONV experiences. Results: Prevention of postoperative pain was valued higher than prevention of PONV.
