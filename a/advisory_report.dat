[...] During this time, the state-sponsored National Council for Human Rights held a major symposium on the issues surrounding religious affiliation and identity cards, at which the Bahá'í community offered some testimony. The hearing was, however, postponed by the Supreme Administrative Court on 21 September 2006 until 20 November, to await the completion of an <b>advisory</b> <b>report</b> by the State Commissioner’s Authority.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1995, the United States Senate {{asked the}} U.S. Court of Federal Claims to {{determine}} if the United States owed Inslaw compensation for the government's use of Promis. On July 31, 1997, Judge Christine Miller, the hearing officer for the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that all of the versions of Promis were in the public domain and that the government had therefore always been free to do whatever it wished with Promis. The following year, the appellate authority, a three-judge Review Panel of the same court, upheld Miller's ruling; it also determined that Inslaw had never granted the government a license to [...] "modify Promis to create derivative software" [...] although Inslaw was automatically vested with the exclusive copyright rights to Promis. The Review Panel then held that the United States would be liable to Inslaw for copyright infringement damages if the government had created any unauthorized derivatives from Promis, but noted that Inslaw [...] "had failed to prove in court that the government had done so;" [...] moreover, the Board held that the issue of [...] "derivative works" [...] was [...] "of no consequence." [...] Inslaw challenged this interpretation but the Review Panel refused Inslaw's request to reopen discovery. In August 1998, Chief Judge Lorin Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims sent an <b>Advisory</b> <b>Report</b> to the Senate, [...] noting that the court had not found that the United States owes Inslaw compensation for the government's use of Promis, and enclosing the decision of the hearing officer and the decision of the Review Panel.|$|E

30|$|A first {{indication}} is {{the growth of}} the number of publications about innovation diplomacy and more specifically in the number of <b>advisory</b> <b>reports</b> to governments. A simple Google search on “innovation diplomacy” shows that the concept is of recent date. With very few exceptions, most publications are from 2005 or later, taking into account that the EL-CSID project from which this paper is a result contributes to the number of publications. The same is true for government <b>advisory</b> <b>reports,</b> such as in Spain, the Netherlands, Japan, UK and the European Union. [11 – 14]. These reports also provide insights into how the concept of “innovation diplomacy” is developing. International scientific, technological and innovation collaboration is important in each of the <b>reports.</b> But all <b>advisory</b> <b>reports</b> also recognise the importance of technology and innovation in the context of economic and competition policy. The Dutch report (AWTI) is probably most explicit about this in the following statement: “It is essential that the Netherlands takes care that science, technology and innovation (STI) and diplomacy reinforce each other to benefit from global opportunities and not to lose from competing nations.” 6 In other words, STI collaboration needs to be seen in a context of growth and competition.|$|R

40|$|This {{compendium}} {{is published}} {{in two volumes}} divided into three main parts. The first part presents the German Data Forum’s recommendations on the further development of the research infrastructure for the social, economic, and behavioral sciences. The second part of this publication, also contained in the first volume, provides “executive summaries” {{of all of the}} <b>advisory</b> <b>reports,</b> including detailed recommendations on how to meet current and future data needs. The summaries serve to provide the reader with a compact overview of current issues and needs in each research field. The third part is comprised of the 68 <b>advisory</b> <b>reports</b> commissioned by the German Data Forum and makes up by far the largest section of this final volume. The <b>advisory</b> <b>reports</b> cover a wide range of fields in the social, economic, and behavioral sciences: economics, sociology, psychology, educational science, political science, geoscience, and communications and media research. Some reports focus mainly on substantive issues, some on survey methodology and issues of data linkage, some on ethical and legal issues, and others on the assurance of quality standards. The third part begins with the assessment reports that address future demands likely to be placed on Germany’s research infrastructure as well as the progress made since the first KVI report of 2001. One of the main topics dealt with here is the harmonization of European research infrastructures and possibilities for the permanent institutionalization of certain elements thereof. These are followed by reports on specific research fields, and on new data types and their potential applications in scientific research – for example, geodata, biodata, and transaction data. Many of these reports highlight recent advances in research methodology, {{such as the use of}} paradata (“data about data”) and, for example, “qualitative methods” that can enrich quantitative data. Others are concerned with questions of data security and research ethics. Further reports deal with specific fields: migration and demography; vocational competencies, education, and research; labor markets and the economy; the state, the family, and health; political and cultural participation; and the role of the media. Since these have been identified as crucial research fields for research infrastructure, key aspects of each are discussed in several <b>advisory</b> <b>reports.</b> (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R
