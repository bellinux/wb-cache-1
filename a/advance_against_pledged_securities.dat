For example, {{a central bank}} may regulate margin lending, whereby individuals or companies may borrow <b>against</b> <b>pledged</b> <b>securities.</b> The margin requirement establishes a minimum ratio {{of the value of}} the securities to the amount borrowed.|$|R

These limits have been revised periodically.|$|R

40|$|The Federal Reserve {{launched}} the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) in 2008 to promote liquidity in the funding markets {{and improve the}} operation of the broader financial markets. The facility increases the ability of dealers to obtain cash in the private market by enabling them to <b>pledge</b> <b>securities</b> temporarily as collateral for Treasuries, which are relatively easy to finance. The TSLF thus reduces the need for dealers to sell assets into illiquid markets as well as lessens the likelihood of a loss of confidence among lenders.
