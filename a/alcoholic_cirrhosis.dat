40|$|Background: <b>Alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis</b> is {{the most}} common {{complication}} of ethanol abuse. Alcoholic fatty liver progresses to <b>alcoholic</b> hepatitis, <b>cirrhosis</b> and liver failure. Lipoproteins are synthesized by the liver and secreted into the circulation. <b>Alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis</b> causes alteration in lipoprotein metabolism producing liver steatosis and necrosis. Paraoxonase- 1 (PON- 1) is an enzyme synthesized in liver and has an esterase activity towards lipid peroxides and circulates in plasma bound to High-Density Lipoproteins-cholesterol (HDL-c). Aim and Objectives: To determine the activity of PON- 1 and levels of HDL-c in alcoholic liver disease and to correlate PON- 1 activity with HDL-c. Materials and Methods: A Cross sectional study done in Department of Biochemistry and Department of Medicine, Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences, Belagavi, Karnataka, India, from 1 st December 2014 to 31 st January 2016 Study included 50 males (age range 25 - 55 years) with <b>alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis</b> and 50 healthy male participants (age range 25 - 55 years). PON- 1 activity was estimated using spectrophotometric method by the hydrolysis of phenylacetate. HDL-c level was measured by cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase method. Results: The serum PON- 1 activity and levels of HDL-c in patients with <b>alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis</b> were significantly reduced (p< 0. 001) compared with controls. Conclusion: A significant decrease in PON- 1 and HDL-c in <b>alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis</b> may contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis in <b>alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis</b> patients...|$|R

In alcohol abuse without cirrhosis, the level of 20 : 3 omega 9 (20 acyl carbon atoms: 3 double bonds, omega, 9 carbon atoms beyond last double bond) was significantly increased, despite adequate levels of linoleic and arachidonic acids.

40|$|Abstract: Background: <b>Alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis</b> is {{a common}} {{indication}} for liver transplantation. Recurrence of alcohol use was retrospectively analyzed after liver transplantation. Methods: From X/ 1995 to II/ 2002, 42 out of 246 patients underwent liver transplantation for <b>alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis.</b> We administered a questionnaire to all patients surviving at least 1 year post liver transplantation for <b>alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis.</b> Liver biopsy was performed annually. The results of the questionnaires of both alcohol use and sobriety group were compared with laboratory parameters, graft histopathology, socioeconomic status and survival rate. Results: Sixteen patients admitted alcohol consumption in the questionnaire. Serious graft damage was diagnosed in 4 recipients, 2 of them died due to graft failure, one for another reason, 12 returned to alcohol use. We have found more steatosis, presence of Mallory hyaline and no difference in fibrosis between alcohol use and sobriety group. The alcohol use and sobriety group differed in body mass index, triacylglycerols, medium corpuscular volume and activity of -glutamyltransferase. Cumulative survival rate [1, 3, 5 years] was significantly lower in alcohol use group than in sobriety group. Conclusion: Patients after liver transplantation for <b>alcoholic</b> liver <b>cirrhosis</b> with alcohol use had lower survival rate as compared with sobriety group. Considering the differences in histopathology and laboratory parameters in patients with and without alcohol use after liver transplantation, administration of questionnaires {{seems to be a}} valid tool for recurrence of alcohol use detection...|$|R
