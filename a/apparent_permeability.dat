40|$|In {{a recent}} paper by Lasseux, Valdés-Parada and Porter (J.

40|$|Shale is a {{fine-grained}} sedimentary rock. Flow simulation in shale {{is challenging}} {{due to its}} multiscale porous structure (consisting of nano- to micropores and fractures) and multi-physics gas flow mechanism (including continuum flow, slip flow, transition flow, Knudsen diffusion and surface diffusion) in these pores. Previous studies have improved {{our understanding of the}} flow processes in shale; however, they fail to capture the multiple flow mechanisms in the complex porous structure. In this thesis, gas flow in the multiscale porous structure of shale matrix was investigated. A multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was presented to simulate the non-continuum gas flow in microchannels. Simulation results show that the proposed LBM successfully mimics the behaviour of rarefied gas with Knudsen number up to 10. This success provides a physical explanation to the semi-analytical B-K equation. B-K equation was then applied to a bundle of tortuous capillaries representing the porous structure of shale matrix. With the aids of fractal dimensions for pores and tortuosity, an analytical equation was developed to estimate the <b>apparent</b> gas <b>permeability</b> of shale. The simulated <b>apparent</b> gas <b>permeability</b> was validated against over 100 laboratory data varying from 100 nano-Darcy to 10 mili-Darcy. The deficiency of the capillary model, however, is that the interconnection of capillaries is not considered. In view of this, a pore network was constructed to represent the porous structure of shale matrix, with the employment of a self-similarity based stochastic method. The simulation results show that the <b>apparent</b> gas <b>permeability</b> increases by a factor of 3. 2, with 36 % contribution arising from surface diffusion. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the <b>apparent</b> gas <b>permeability</b> is influenced by the pore size, shape of voids, gas type, surface diffusivity, adsorption parameters and reservoir conditions. It is concluded that the network modelling method can successfully capture the multiple flow mechanisms in the multiscale porous structure of shale matrix. In order to compare the results with laboratory measurements, it is required to upscale the simulation results from the matrix subset to the core scale. This is computationally exhaustive in consideration of the broad span of scales. This improvement, therefore, is left for the future study...|$|R

The development of an economical SCC with interesting properties in the fresh and hardened state is important for the acceptance of such a concrete.

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the {{ecophysiology}} of the estuarine mud crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus (Milne Edwards, 1837) have been studied. Field {{studies have shown that}} the population of crabs in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary experience a seasonal variation in salinity and temperature, such that the environment is more dilute and colder during the winter than in the summer. Experiments using crabs direct from the field showed that these animals undergo a seasonal acclimatization which results in winter crabs having a greater tolerance to dilute (1 %) sea water than summer crabs. This change in salinity tolerance is accompanied by winter animals having a slower rate of sodium loss, a lower <b>apparent</b> water <b>permeability</b> and a 'stronger' regulation of blood osmotic pressure in 100 % sea water, than summer collected animals. Laboratory studies showed that, compared with crabs acclimated to full strength sea water, animals acclimated (for 5 weeks) to low salinities were more tolerant of 1 % sea water, had a slower sodium loss rate and an osmoregulation curve that was shifted towards the isosmotic line.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{bioavailability}} of kavalactones in vitro {{and the possible}} differences in their bioavailability because of variations in either chemical structure or the method of extraction used. Research design and methods: Caco- 2 cell monolayers {{were used to determine}} the potential bioavailability of kavalactones. Kavalactones were added to the apical layer and basolateral samples were taken over 150 min to examine the concentration diffusing across the cell monolayer. Kavalactone concentrations in these samples were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Results: Kavalactones were found to be potentially bioavailable as they all readily crossed the Caco- 2 monolayers with <b>apparent</b> <b>permeabilities</b> (P-app) increasing from 42 x 10 (- 6) cm/s and most exhibiting more than 70 % crossing within 90 min. Not all differences in their bioavailability can be related to kavalactone structural differences as it appears that bioavailability may also be affected by co-extracted compounds. For example, the P-app for kawain from ethanol extracts was higher than the values obtained for the same compound from water extracts or for the kavalactone alone. Conclusions: While the extraction method used (ethanol or water) influences the total (but not the relative) concentrations of kavalactones, it does not markedly affect their bioavailability.

Methods: Rat principal cells of kidney collecting duct fragments underwent hypoosmotic challenge applied apically or basolaterally and the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) was measured by the calcein quenching method. The AQP - 2, - 3 and - 4 content of the plasma membrane fraction was quantified by Western blotting.

An identical successive shock after 15 - 20 sec causes significantly lower swelling rate with 3 -fold reduction in <b>apparent</b> water <b>permeability.</b> This reaction is accompanied by AQP 2 decrease in the plasma membrane while AQP 3 and AQP 4 are unaffected. The contribution of the basolateral cell surface to RVD is significantly lower than the apical.
