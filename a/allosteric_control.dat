When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the Krebs cycle and produce energy.|$|E

40|$|Kirromycin, a new {{inhibitor}} {{of protein}} synthesis, {{is shown to}} interfere with the peptide transfer reaction by acting on elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). All the reactions associated with this elongation factor are affected. Formation of the EF-Tu·GTP complex is strongly stimulated. Peptide bond formation is prevented only when Phe-tRNAPhe is bound enzymatically to ribosomes, presumably because GTP hydrolysis associated with enzymatic binding of Phe-tRNAPhe is not followed by release of EF-Tu·GDP from the ribosome. This antibiotic also enables EF-Tu to catalyze the binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to the poly(U) ·ribosome complex {{even in the absence of}} GTP. EF-Tu activity in the GTPase reaction is dramatically affected by kirromycin: GTP hydrolysis, which normally requires ribosomes and aminoacyl-tRNA, takes place with the elongation factor alone. This GTPase shows the same Km for GTP as the one dependent on Phe-tRNAPhe and ribosomes in the absence of the antibiotic. Ribosomes and Phe-tRNAPhe, but not tRNAPhe or Ac-Phe-tRNAPhe, stimulate the kirromycin-induced EF-Tu GTPase. These results indicate that the catalytic center of EF-Tu GTPase that is dependent upon aminoacyl-tRNA and ribosomes is primarily located on the elongation factor. In conclusion, kirromycin can substitute for GTP, aminoacyl-tRNA, or ribosomes in various reactions involving EF-Tu, apparently by affecting the <b>allosteric</b> <b>controls</b> between the sites on the EF-Tu molecule interacting with these components...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of chaperonin GroEL and co-chaperonin GroES, {{there has been a}} deluge of literature investigating many aspects of the system. Substrate proteins are protected from aggregation through a cycle of capture, encapsulation, and release made possible through rigid body motions of the GroE system driven by a combination of <b>allosteric</b> <b>controls</b> influenced by nucleotide, potassium and denatured protein termed substrate protein (SP). This dissertation first explores the sequential transition of GroEL that maintains the rings operating in an alternating fashion. To do this, an intra-subunit, inter-domain mutant, GroEL D 83 A T state. Steady state ATPase assays, stopped-flow fluorescence, and gel filtration chromatography were all used to demonstrate that the trans ring must access the T state before ligands can be discharged from the cis ring. The dual-heptameric ring structure of GroEL and the post-translational assembly of the protein make creating mutants with a mutation within a single subunit of a ring almost impossible, however the ability to do so opens the opportunity for a myriad of experiments that explore the allosteric transitions of GroEL. Two potential recombination methods, acetone treatment and heat treatment, were investigated. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) were used to study recombination facilitated by such treatments. Recombination using the acetone method resulted in a one-in-one-out subunit exchange, however aggregation complicated the exchange. Heat treatment resulted in exchange of rings. Finally, dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to investigate stability and aggregation on the chaperonin. It was observed that the chaperonin is stable for over 30 days while incubated continuously at 37 °C in sterile buffered solution, however interesting aggregation kinetics are observed upon addition of acetone, the solvent used to strip SP from GroEL during the standard lab purification procedure.

While the interaction properties of its specific domains are well characterized, {{little is known}} about the regulation of these functionalities. We show that UHRF 1 exists in distinct active states, binding either unmodified H 3 or the H 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H 3 K 9 me 3) modification. A polybasic region (PBR) in the C terminus blocks interaction of a tandem tudor domain (TTD) with H 3 K 9 me 3 by occupying an essential peptide-binding groove. In this state the plant homeodomain (PHD) mediates interaction with the extreme N terminus of the unmodified H 3 tail. Binding of the phosphatidylinositol phosphate PI 5 P to the PBR of UHRF 1 results in a conformational rearrangement of the domains, allowing the TTD to bind H 3 K 9 me 3.

40|$|Steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) act in cell type- and gene-specific manner through {{interactions}} with coregulatory proteins to regulate numerous physiological and pathological processes {{at the level}} of gene regulation. Binding of steroid receptor modulator (SRM) ligand leads to allosteric changes in SHR to exert positive or negative effects on the expression of target genes. Due, in part, to the fact that current SRMs generally target ligand binding domain (LBD) /AF 2 and neglect intrinsically disordered (ID) N-terminal domain (NTD) /AF 1, clinically relevant SRMs lack selectivity and are also prone to the development of resistance over time. Therefore, to maximize the efficacy of SHR-based therapeutics, the possibility of developing unique modulators that act to control AF 1 activity must be considered.

Apart from this purely structural role, {{they can also}} be chemically active, participating in redox reactions, and they may even potentially act as <b>allosteric</b> switches <b>controlling</b> protein functions. Specific types of disulfide bonds have been identified in static protein structures from their distinctive pattern of dihedral bond angles, and the allosteric function of such bonds is purported {{to be related to the}} torsional strain they store. Using all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations for ∼ 700 disulfide bonded proteins, we analyzed the intramolecular mechanical forces in 20 classes of disulfide bonds. We found that two particular classes, the −RHStaple and the −/+RHHook disulfides, are indeed more stressed than other disulfide bonds, but the stress is carried primarily by stretching of the S-S bond and bending of the neighboring bond angles, rather than by dihedral torsion. This stress corresponds to a tension force of magnitude ∼ 200 pN, which is balanced by repulsive van der Waals interactions between the cysteine Cα atoms. We confirm stretching of the S-S bond to be a general feature of the −RHStaples and the −/+RHHooks by analyzing ∼ 20, 000 static protein structures.

We find that a perturbation theory of thermal elastic solids and nonperturbative approach (by super-coarse-graining elasticity into internal bending modes) have opposite signatures in their structure of correlated pathways. We illustrate the effect from analysis of previous results from GlxR of Corynebacterium glutamicum, an example of the CRP/FNR transcription family of allosteric homodimers.

Here we present evidence that adjacent γ subunit pairs of CBS repeat sequences (after Cystathionine Beta Synthase) form an AMP binding site related to, but distinct from the classical AMP binding site in phosphorylase, that can also bind ATP. The AMP binding site of the γ 1 CBS 1 /CBS 2 pair, modeled on the structures of the CBS sequences present in the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase crystal structure, contains three arginine residues 70, 152, and 171 and His 151.

40|$|The {{survival}} of the any living organism depends on its availability to communicate, and a breakdown of cellular signaling can have dire consequences such as uncontrolled cellular proliferations or even cell death. Environmental cues or ligands are perceived by cognate receptors, expressed primarily on the cell surface, and transmitted to {{the interior of the}} cell to elicit a response. This universal phenomenon is termed as signal transduction. During this process, second messengers such as cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, are produced which serve to amplify the signal. Cyclic GMP is emerging as a universal second messenger, and is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is synthesized from GTP by the action of guanylyl cyclases. Vertebrate guanylyl cyclases are of two forms, soluble and membrane-associated. Soluble guanylyl cyclases are heterodimeric enzymes which are activated by nitic oxide. Membrane-associated guanylyl cyclases on the other hand are homodimeric enzymes that act as receptors for divers polypeptide ligands. In mammals, there are seven isoforms of receptors guanylyl cyclase, GC-A through GC-G. These recptors have a highly conseved modular domin organization with an N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain and a C- terminal intra cellular regions. The intracellular region contains a juxtamembrane domain followed by a protein-kinase domain, a linker region and a catalytic guanylyl cyclase domain. The coordinated actions of these domains ensure fine tuned-regulations of the catalytic domain. Guanylyl cyclase-C (GC-C) {{is a member of the}} membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases. GC-C is predominantely present in the intestine, on the apical surface of epithelial cells, but has also been detected in the rat epididymis. In the intestine it serves as the guanylin, uroguanylin and lymphoguanylin which are the endogenous peptide ligands, while heat- stable entrotoxins (ST) peptides secreted by enterotoxigenic E. coil, are exogenic ligands. Activation of GC-C by these ligands results in an increase in intracellular cGMP levels, which then activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase and cross-activates protein kinase A. In turn, these activated kinases phosphorylate and active the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), resulting in chloride and water secretion into the intestine lumen, thus regulating salt and water homeostasis in the intestine. ST peptide has a greater affinity for GC-C than the endogenous ligands and activation of GC-C by ST results in masiive fluid and ion efflux from the intestine cells from which manifests as Travelers’ Diarrhea. The GC-C mediated cGMP signal transduction pathway also maintains intestinal crypt-villus axis homeostatis by exerting a cytostatic effect on the epithelial cells, there by regulating their turn over. Over the years multiple mechanisms of regulation of GC-C activity has been identified including <b>allosteric</b> <b>controlled</b> by various domains in the receptor and phosphorylation-mediated regulation of guanylyl cyclase activity. The current study describes aspects of the regulation of GC-C by gycosylation, and also reports the molecular phenotypes of a naturally occurring mutation in GC-C causes sever diarrhea in affected individuals. GC-C is expressed as a differentially glycosylated protein (130 k Da and 145 kDa). While both forms bind with equal affinity, only one the 145 kDa form is activated by its ligands. It is this higher glycosylated form which is selectively downregulated in the process of decensitization of GC-C in colomn carcinoma cells (Caco 2). Give the critical role gycosylation plays in protein folding, trafficking, receptor activity and mediating protein inter actions, its influence on GC-C was analysed...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{diversification of}} the vertebrate globin gene superfamily provides an especially vivid {{illustration of the}} role of gene duplication and whole-genome duplication in promoting evolutionary innovation. For example, key globin proteins that evolved specialized functions in various aspects of oxidative metabolism and oxygen signaling pathways (hemoglobin [Hb], myoglobin [Mb], and cytoglobin [Cygb]) trace their origins to two whole-genome duplication events in the stem lineage of vertebrates. The retention of the proto-Hb and Mb genes in the ancestor of jawed vertebrates permitted a physiological division of labor between the oxygen-carrier function of Hb and the oxygen-storage function of Mb. In the Hb gene lineage, a subsequent tandem gene duplication gave rise to the proto α- and β-globin genes, which permitted the formation of multimeric Hbs composed of unlike subunits (α 2 β 2). The evolution of this heteromeric quaternary structure was central to the emergence of Hb as a specialized oxygen-transport protein because it provided a mechanism for cooperative oxygen-binding and <b>allosteric</b> regulatory <b>control.</b> Subsequent rounds of duplication and divergence have produced diverse repertoires of α- and β-like globin genes that are ontogenetically regulated such that functionally distinct Hb isoforms are expressed during different stages of prenatal development and postnatal life. In the ancestor of jawless fishes, the proto Mb and Hb genes appear to have been secondarily lost, and the Cygb homolog evolved a specialized respiratory function in blood-oxygen transport. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses of the vertebrate globin gene superfamily have revealed numerous instances in which paralogous globins have convergently evolved similar expression patterns and/or similar functional specializations in different organismal lineages...|$|R
40|$|Hsp 70 and Hsp 110 chaperones play an {{important}} role in regulating cellular processes that involve protein folding and stabilization, which are essential for the integrity of signaling net-works. Althoughmany aspects of allosteric regulatory mechanisms in Hsp 70 and Hsp 110 chaperones have been extensively studied and significantly advanced in recent experimental studies, the atomistic picture of signal propagation and energetics of dynamics-based com-munication still remain unresolved. In this work, we have combinedmolecular dynamics simu-lations and protein stability analysis of the chaperone structures with the network modeling of residue interaction networks to characterize molecular determinants of allosteric mecha-nisms. We have shown that allosteric mechanisms of Hsp 70 and Hsp 110 chaperones may be primarily determined by nucleotide-induced redistribution of local conformational ensem-bles in the inter-domain regions and the substrate binding domain. Conformational dynamics and energetics of the peptide substrate binding with the Hsp 70 structures has been analyzed using free energy calculations, revealing <b>allosteric</b> hotspots that <b>control</b> negative cooperativity between regulatory sites. The results have indicated that cooperative interactions may pro...|$|R
