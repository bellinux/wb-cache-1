25|$|Large-scale {{campaign}} staff downsizing {{took place}} in early July, with 50 to 100 staffers let go and others taking pay cuts or switching to no pay. McCain's <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> the campaign was considering taking public matching funds, and would focus its efforts on the early primary and caucus states. McCain however {{said he was not}} considering dropping out of the race.|$|E
25|$|McCain's second-quarter {{fundraising}} totals were worse, with intake {{falling to}} $11.2 million and expenses continuing such that only $2 million cash was on hand. McCain's <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> {{the campaign was}} considering taking public matching funds There are some indications that although the campaign has $2 million cash on hand {{at the end of}} Q2, a 7-figure debt will make the monetary situation even more dire.|$|E

25|$|Sierra Dominion charged Doolittle's {{campaign}} and his Superior California Political Action Committee a 15 percent commission on any contribution that Julie Doolittle helped bring in. Federal and state campaign records show that, since late 2001, {{she had received}} nearly $180,000 in commissions from for such fundraising. This meant that Doolittle {{and his family had}} personally made money off his political fundraising. Doolittle <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> even though the PAC had made payments to other fundraisers, Julie Doolittle was entitled to 15 percent of all money the PAC brought in because those donations were raised at events she helped organize.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{had been}} outspoken in his {{opposition}} to the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and other trade agreements that he argues would hurt his district, which has suffered from the closing of textile, furniture, and other plants when production has been moved abroad where labor costs are cheaper. However, he failed to register a vote during final approval of the agreement by the House, which passed 217–215. According to GOP aides, Taylor cast a no vote with a deactivated voting card. The glitch registered with the House Clerk's office, but Taylor had left the House floor and <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> attempts to locate him during the 62-minute vote were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|The 1981 ceiling {{collapse}} deeply alarmed {{members of}} Congress and {{officials in the}} new Reagan administration. On April 3, despite a budget austerity push, administration officials proposed a plan to appropriate $7 million to allow the Department of the Interior to finish its authorized $8 million roof repair program. In addition, {{the government of the}} District of Columbia would be permitted to reprogram up to $40 million in federal highway money to finish the parking garage at Union Station. On October 19, administration officials and members of the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation agreed on additional aspects of the plan. Up to $1 million would be authorized and appropriated to fund a study on needed repairs at the station and a second study on the feasibility of turning Union Station into a retail complex. The Department of Transportation (DOT) was authorized to sign contracts with any willing corporation to construct a retail complex in and around Union Station. DOT was also authorized to spend up to $29 million in already-appropriated money from its Northeast Corridor rail capital building program on Union Station repairs. The revised bill also required DOT to take control of Union Station from the Department of the Interior, and for DOT to buy out its lease with the station's private-sector owners. The buy-out would be spread over six years, for which $275,000 a year was authorized and appropriated. The bill required DOT to operate Union Station as a train station once more, complete with ticketing, waiting areas, baggage areas, and boarding. Although no statement was made in the bill, Senate <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> the intent was to have Amtrak tear down its 1960s-era station at the rear of Union Station and move its operations back inside. The Senate passed the bill unanimously on November 23. The House approved the bill on December 16. President Ronald Reagan signed the Union Station Redevelopment Act into law on December 29.|$|E

500|$|FBI Special Agent Robert Sawyer {{initially}} {{said there}} was probable cause to believe the trio were conspiring to kill Obama, based on searches of their hotel rooms and cars. However, United States Attorney Troy Eid said the racist statements the suspects made following their arrests had not risen to the legal standard {{that would have allowed}} the filing of federal charges for threatening a presidential candidate, an offense that falls under the same statute as threatening the President of the United States. Prosecutors also said they had insufficient evidence that they had the means to carry out a plot to kill Obama. Eid said the searches of the suspects' rooms and computers turned up no evidence of a plot or conspiracy. Eid and his <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> the decision not to press charges of threatening a presidential candidate was at least in part because they did not believe a jury would convict them based on the reliability of Johnson's testimony. Jeffrey Dorschner, Eid's spokesman, said a defense attorney “would tear him apart”. Although Eid would be accused of racism and political posturing for not seeking the charge, Eid said, [...] "The 'political' thing to have done in this case, of course, would have been to charge all three defendants with making a threat against Obama and then quietly drop those charges later — expedient, Machiavellian and self-serving, but also illegal, unethical and immoral." ...|$|E
2500|$|Democrats {{and leaders}} of the Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), a Teamster reform group, demanded that Reagan remove Presser from the {{transition}} team. [...] But Reagan <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> that the transition team had completed its task and the issue was now moot.|$|E

2500|$|After his {{election}} as attorney general, it was speculated that Cuccinelli {{was a potential}} candidate for governor in the 2013 election or for the United States Senate in 2014. Cuccinelli himself stated that he was considering running for the Senate. Two days later, one of his <b>aides</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We haven't ruled out anything. He's not actively considering a run for any particular office at the moment. Ken is operating {{under the assumption that}} he will run for reelection [...] He hasn't ruled out any option besides running for president, which he has no desire to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Worried Republicans waited {{throughout}} {{the spring and}} summer for a Teamster endorsement, but it was not forthcoming. [...] In early August, Presser finally told White House aides that Teamster support for Reagan hinged on whether Reagan would remove Donald Dotson as chairman of the National Labor Relations Board. The Dotson-led labor board had issued a string of decisions which the Teamsters considered anti-labor. On the eve of the Republican National Convention, Presser told the press that Dotson's removal was a [...] "do-or-die situation" [...] for the Teamsters—which held more NLRB-supervised organizing elections than any other union. Reagan refused to fire Dotson, although presidential <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> that a compromise would be reached over the NLRB's actions.|$|E

2500|$|In Japan, the Mayor of Nagano Shoichi Washizawa {{said that}} it has become a [...] "great nuisance" [...] for the city to host the torch relay prior to the Nagano leg. Washizawa's <b>aides</b> <b>said</b> the mayor's remark was not {{criticism}} about the relay itself but about the potential disruptions and confusion surrounding it.　A city employee of the Nagano City Office ridiculed the protests in Europe, saying [...] "they are doing something foolish" [...] in a televised interview. The City Office officially apologized later and explained what he had wanted to say was [...] "such violent protests were not easy to accept". Also citing concerns about protests as well as the recent violence in Tibet, a major Buddhist temple in Nagano cancelled its plans to host the opening stage of the Olympic torch relay. This temple was vandalised by an unidentified person the day after in apparent revenge.|$|E
2500|$|Neighbors {{said they}} saw LaRouche guards in {{camouflage}} clothes carrying semi-automatic weapons, and the Post wrote that the house had [...] sandbag-buttressed guard posts nearby, along with metal spikes in the driveway and concrete barriers on the road.

[...] LaRouche said his new home meant a shorter commute to Washington. A former associate said the move also meant his members would be more isolated {{from friends and family}} than they had been in New York. According to the Post in 2004, local people who opposed him for any reason were accused in LaRouche publications of being commies, homosexual, drug pushers, and terrorists. He reportedly accused the Leesburg Garden Club of being a nest of Soviet sympathizers, and a local lawyer who opposed LaRouche on a zoning matter went into hiding after threatening phone calls and a death threat. In leaflets supporting his application of concealed weapons permits for his bodyguards in Leesburg, Virginia, he wrote: ...|$|E
