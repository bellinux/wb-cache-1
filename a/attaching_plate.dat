40|$|Heat {{transfer}} enhancement {{devices are}} widely used in various industrial, transportation, or domestic applications such as thermal power plants, means of transport, {{heating and air conditioning}} systems, electronic equipments and space vehicles. In all these applications, improvements in the efficiency of heat exchangers can lead to substantial cost, space and materials savings. The research work summarized in this paper presents an experimental investigation on the effect of fin pitch on the fin performance using plate type fins. The experiments were carried out in the laboratory using a test rig having provisions for <b>attaching</b> <b>plate</b> type fins to a flat base plate. The experiments were conducted for different fin pitch settings. Three plate type fins were used in this study. Three fin pitch settings 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm were employed under free and forced heat transfer conditions. The heat transfer area was kept the same. The fin performance parameters heat transfer coefficient, base temperature and temperature profile {{along the length of the}} fin were studied and compared for different cases. Experimental results show that the effect of fin pitch on fin performance is significant. The effect is more pronounced at higher air flow velocities over the fin surface. The maximum increase in convection heat transfer coefficient value obtained is about 20 percent. The increase in heat transfer coefficient value is also manifested by a correspondin...|$|E

50|$|The Cooper vane is a {{very simple}} device {{consisting}} of a spring-loaded paddle connected to a plate. When the aircraft is on the ramp, the spring keeps the paddle perpendicular to the fuselage, and the <b>attached</b> <b>plate</b> does not block the stairway. As the aircraft takes off, the airflow pushes the paddle parallel to the fuselage and the plate is moved underneath the stairway, preventing it from being lowered. Once the airflow decreases on landing, the spring-loaded paddle returns to its initial position, thereby allowing the stairs to be lowered again. Although this device was intended to prevent hijackings aboard the 727 and other aircraft with a ventral airstair, many airlines sealed the airstair entirely, never to use it again.|$|R

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{behavior of}} fixed and elastically moored floating breakwaters is {{studied in the}} present thesis, using a finite-difference, mathematical model based on the Boussinesq type equations. The flow under the floating breakwater is treated as confined flow separately. The pressure field beneath the floating structure is determined by solving implicitly the Laplace equation for the potential Φ of the confined flow using the appropriate boundary conditions. The dynamic equations of motion are solved with the consequent adjustments of the continuity equation {{in the case of}} elastically moored floating breakwaters. Numerical results, concerning the efficiency of fixed, heave motion and elastically moored floating breakwaters are compared to experimental results satisfactorily. The ability of the numerical model to predict the pressure field beneath the floating structure, the vertical force acting on it and the dynamic response of the breakwater is thoroughly examined by making comparisons of the numerical results with experimental data. The experimental part of the thesis was conducted in the CIEM flume of the Catalonia University of Technology, Barcelona. The influence of the incident wave characteristics (regular and irregular waves) and certain geometric characteristics such as the width and the draught of the structure on its efficiency are examined. Four different floating breakwaters configurations are examined: (a) fixed single floating breakwater, (b) heave motion floating breakwater, (c) fixed floating breakwater with <b>attached</b> front <b>plate</b> (impermeable and permeable) and (d) fixed double floating breakwater. Results related to transmission, reflection and energy dissipation of the incident (regular and irregular) waves on the structure are presented. A comparison of numerical and experimental results is also presented. For the single floating breakwater the efficiency of the structure is proportional to the width/wavelength and draught/water depth ratios. The fixed single floating breakwater operates in a highly reflective manner. On the other hand the heave motion floating breakwater operates in a dissipative manner with much lower reflection. The <b>attached</b> <b>plate</b> in the front part of the floating breakwater enhances significantly the efficiency of the structure. No great differences are observed between the impermeable and the permeable plate cases. Generally the most efficient configuration has been proven to be the double floating breakwater. However, with regard to cost effectiveness the configuration of the floating breakwater with the <b>attached</b> <b>plate</b> should be considered the most efficient for design purposes. The final goal is to study the hydrodynamics of floating breakwaters in shallow and intermediate waters. ...|$|R

After fracture reduction, internal, external, or intramedullary fixation devices may be used to provide stability and maintain the alignment of bone fragments during the healing improves. They must be strong and secure enough to allow early mobilization of the injured part, as well as the entire patient. Compression is used whenever possible to increase the contact area and the stability between fragments and to decrease the stress on the implant. Screws are used primarily to provide interfragmental compression or to <b>attach</b> <b>plates,</b> which can then provide compression, prevent displacement, and support the fragments during healing. Pins and wires can be used for fixation of small fragments or fractures in small bones and for attachment of the external fixation device and traction.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the suppression of the flow-induced vibration of a rectangular prism with impinging leading-edge vortices. The rectangular prism having width-to-height B/H of 3 in which vortices are formed at the leading edge is adopted. The vibration characteristics of the rectangular prism are investigated on the free and forced vibration test. The suppression of the flow-induced vibrations is established by a T-shape <b>plate</b> <b>attached</b> to the upstream and a splitter <b>plate</b> <b>attached</b> to the downstream of rectangular prism. Important results from the present study are that (i) there exists three types of flow-induced vibration, i. e. low-speed flutter, vortex excitation and high-speed flutter, (ii) the flow-induced vibration of the rectangular prism are strongly dependent on the impinging leading-edge vortices rather than the wake vortices, (iii) the suppression of the flow-induced vibrations of the rectangular prism is done with the most effectiveness when the impinging leading-edge vortices are suppressed with the T-shape <b>plate</b> <b>attached</b> to upstream of it...|$|R
