5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American alligator was listed as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} large whales, the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century and is <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> species. Over 725,000 fin whales were {{reportedly}} {{taken from the}} Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived. Recovery of the overall population size of southern species is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.|$|E

5|$|The Agnes Banks Woodland {{in western}} Sydney has been {{recognised}} by the New South Wales Government as <b>an</b> <b>Endangered</b> Ecological Community. Here Banksia aemula is an understory plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla), narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) and B. serrata as canopy trees, and B. oblongifolia, Conospermum taxifolium, Ricinocarpus pinifolius, Dillwynia sericea and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other understory species.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of B.nothofagi {{was published in}} 2012 by Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard. DNA studies of the fungus {{suggest that it is}} a somewhat basal member of the genus Boletopsis. The fungus is most likely a native species of New Zealand and was present there before the arrival of Europeans. As it is very rare and possibly threatened, B.nothofagi is listed in the Red List of Threatened Species as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> species.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Kadazan-Dusun {{speakers}} {{is thought to}} have dropped significantly throughout Sabah, especially in larger towns or cities like Kota Kinabalu.

5|$|A. m. croceum:The Santa Cruz long-toed {{salamander}} (A. m. croceum) is most {{closely related to}} the 'coastal' or 'western' subspecies. This conclusion is the most parsimonious biogeographic explanation with nearest populations of A. m. macrodactylum separated by approximately 300km across the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California. The isolated endemic populations are listed as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> subspecies. Based on the biogeography and molecular clock calibrations, this subspecies may have been separated from the remainder of the distribution since the Miocene, molecular clock calibrations estimating 13.9 million years of separation.|$|E
