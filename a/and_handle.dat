5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store <b>and</b> <b>handle,</b> and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|C. V. Sridhar and Sadagopan, who {{was known}} by his screen name Chitralaya Gopu, had been friends since their tenure at St. Joseph's High School, Chengalpattu. At school both were playwrights; Sridhar wrote stage plays and portrayed the lead roles. Gopu wrote the humour-oriented plays and portrayed comic roles. Later, when Sridhar had the {{opportunity}} to direct a film, he asked Gopu to join him <b>and</b> <b>handle</b> the humour content. The success of Kalyana Parisu (1959) led to Sridhar establishing his own production house, Chitralaya Pictures.|$|E

5|$|In September 1994, Weisman {{died from}} {{pancreatic}} cancer in Los Angeles, and his relatives {{took over the}} racetrack. Although attendance <b>and</b> <b>handle</b> were increasing, the owners were losing money. Reports by independent auditors stated Rosecroft and Ocean Downs combined to lose $1.1 million in fiscal year (FY) 1992, $1.4 million in FY 1993, and $6.2 million in FY 1994. According to Rosecroft's racing official Allan Levey, Weisman's relatives {{did not want to}} operate the track and their only goal was to sell it. For the 1995 season, Rosecroft could not afford the payment to host five stake races—including the Messenger Stakes—and dropped them from the racing schedule.|$|E
5|$|In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York {{attorney}} Charles F. Peck. The two {{men were}} experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially <b>and</b> <b>handle</b> his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1/3 to Tesla, 1/3 to Peck and Brown, and 1/3 to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.|$|E

40|$|Toe-clipping, {{the removal}} {{of one or more}} toes, is a common method used to {{individually}} mark free-living animals. Whilst this method is widely used in studies of amphibians, the appropriateness of the method, and its potential detrimental effects {{have been the subject of}} debate. Here, we provide for the first time, evidence that toe-clipping is a stressor in a wild amphibian. We measured urinary corticosterone responses of male cane toads (Rhinella marina) to capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, <b>and</b> to toe-clipping under field conditions. Urinary testosterone concentrations and white blood cell proportions were also measured. Urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations increased 6 h after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only <b>and</b> remained high for 24 h; corticosterone returned to baseline levels after 48 h and remained low at 72 h post capture <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Corticosterone concentrations in toads subjected to toe-clipping increased at 6 h to significantly higher concentrations than after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, then decreased more slowly than after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>and</b> were still elevated (approximately double basal level) 72 h after toe-clipping. Testosterone did not change significantly after capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only, whereas after toe-clipping testosterone decreased at 6 h and remained low at 72 h. There were weak short-term effects of toe-clipping compared with capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> only on white blood cell proportions. We have clearly shown that toe-clipping is a distinctly stronger stressor than capture <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> alone. This indicates that there is an ethical cost of toe-clipping, and this should be considered when planning studies of amphibians. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses <b>and</b> <b>handle</b> (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, <b>and</b> <b>handle</b> a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on an {{occupational}} therapist’s experience of teaching moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> skills {{as part of his}} role of ‘key trainer’ in a primary care NHS trust. Time constraints on the staff involved require effective teaching and communication methods to be used in order to ensure the best possible outcomes in terms of patient and staff safety. Potential obstacles to effective moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> education are investigated and existing learning techniques used are reflected upon. Educational theory is then evaluated and integrated into future teaching sessions, resulting in a proposed framework for moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> education. The term ‘moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> educator’ (as opposed to trainer) is therefore suggested as more accurately reflecting the nature of this role. This article may therefore be of particular value to moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> ‘key trainers’ working within primary and intermediate care, with the aim of increasing the ability of all groups of clinicians to effectively use these manual handling skills in practice...|$|R

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} indicates that in clinical practice diploma student nurses encounter M&H practices that do not always reflect those taught in training and that these influence their own practice. There is little available research evidence that identifies {{the factors that influence}} students moving <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> The aim {{of the study was to}} explore the factors influencing the moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> practice of student nurses in the practice setting. 24 diploma in nursing students from one centre of a school of nursing participated in the qualitative study. Data was obtained using semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation. The students moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> practice was subject to a large number of influences of which the most influential were those of service staff and the associated M&H norms of the clinical area. In the face of experienced staff students felt inferior and powerless and in order to 'fit in' failed to confront established moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> norms. Students felt their moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> training unrepresentative of clinical practice and were little influenced by it. The predominant influence was the clinical staff's practice of moving <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Pre- <b>and</b> post-registration moving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> training needs to be standardised, integrated and for students should be taught in a way that enables them to apply their learning in the practice setting.
