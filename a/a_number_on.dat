Passenger numbers remained low: when the station was one of <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the network considered for closure in 1929, its annual usage was 1,069,650 and takings were £4,500. The branch was again considered for closure in 1933, but remained open.|$|E

It maintained <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the chart until February 2, 1992, {{giving it a}} total of three weeks on the chart.|$|E
5|$|Psychological {{studies found}} that {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E

25|$|A {{fair number}} are present, {{often on the}} higher reaches of the rivers. Some are named, such as Lizzie's Linn at Caven Mill, Montgreenan, on the Lugton Water. The Cessnock Water has <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> its course through the woods at the Carnell estate near Fiveways outside Kilmarnock. A series of low waterfalls occur at Cunnighamhead on the Annick Water, these being, like many others, dykes that are more {{resistant}} to erosion than the surrounding rocks. Other notable waterfalls are on the Polbaith burn, Fenwick Water (near Rigghill), Glen water (Darvel) and Burn Anne.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of a year, special “season” event cards are {{randomly}} chosen from a deck. All players learn the modifiers these cards may have on the game. These four cards are then shuffled and placed face down on the season track. The first three seasons, a card is revealed and its modifiers applied to the game. During the last season (Winter), the modifiers are ignored, but <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the card reveals the extent of grain shortage for that year. This element allows players a certain level of planning, but an uncertainty of when (or even if) the season event will happen.|$|E
25|$|While bassoons {{are usually}} {{critically}} tuned at the factory, the player nonetheless {{has a great}} degree of flexibility of pitch control {{through the use of}} breath support, embouchure, and reed profile. Players can also use alternate fingerings to adjust the pitch of many notes. Similar to other woodwind instruments, the length of the bassoon can be increased to lower pitch or decreased to raise pitch. On the bassoon, this is done preferably by changing the bocal to one of a different length, (lengths are denoted by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the bocal, usually starting at 0 for the shortest length, and 3 for the longest, but there are some manufacturers who will use other numbers) but it is possible to push the bocal in or out to adjust the pitch.|$|E

25|$|The philatelic {{literature}} has long stated that {{seven of the}} stamps have been lost or destroyed through theft or mishandling. However, in 2007 a copy came to light {{that had not been}} seen since Eugene Klein broke up the sheet, and was offered for auction that June. The number of lost stamps then became six. Several others have been damaged, including one that was sucked into a vacuum cleaner. Apparently Green's wife mailed one which, while recovered, is the only cancelled sample. Indeed, no Jenny invert is in pristine condition, because Klein lightly penciled <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the back of each stamp (from 1 through 10 in the top row to 91 through 100 in the bottom row) so that its original position on the sheet could be identified. Only five examples survive, in fact, in never hinged condition. One of these is the locket copy, which, however has another condition problem: a corner crease at the bottom right probably inflicted while it was being enclosed behind glass.|$|E

These buttons are rare or non-existent. However, the officer's regulation button, consisting of the [...] "block I" [...] button, for Infantry, the A for Artillery, etc.; was very common amongst soldiers, and replaced the efforts to produce the different, numbered buttons for each regiment in service.|$|E

Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you try to create that, then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality.

He also attacked the Lords for [...] "thinking of nothing but the rights of foreigners" [...] and [...] " [...] after the foreigners and not the British", as Theresa May had hoped to leave this amendment out of the bill in order to secure the rights of British citizens living in EU countries post-Brexit. His comments produced [...] "loud gasps" [...] from the majority of peers (but gained audible support by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> the Conservative benches), adding that [...] "Of course we don't have the power to look after our citizens overseas, not in these days when we don't have many gunboats".|$|E
2500|$|During Pro mode {{play for}} guitar and bass, single notes are {{represented}} by a number, representing the fret on the guitar, over a single string. Chords {{are represented by}} solid bars that mimic waveforms. The base position for the player's hand on the fretboard is given by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> a specific string. The shape of the bar over the other strings provide relative fret positions for the player's hand on the controller. The instrument controllers provide feedback to the player by sensing the player's current fingering, which is then shown as a waveform drawn {{at the base of}} the note track, in the same style as the chord representation, allowing the player to match their waveform to the chord's shape. Chord names are shown at the side of the track, and players can optionally enable a feature that numbers every fret position for a chord, [...] closely resembling the appearance of guitar tablature. In addition, Pro Guitar and Bass include legato-style playing through hammer-ons and pull-offs, as well as slides on sustained notes along the strings represented by sustained note gems with slanted tails. Pro Guitar also includes open chords, arpeggios where the player holds a chord and plucks specific strings for it, and left-hand muting of notes.|$|E
