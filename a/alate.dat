5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into <b>alate</b> nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce <b>alate</b> offspring.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling <b>alate</b> forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not {{large enough to be}} reproductive ants. However, it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E
30|$|Since the hexane {{fractions}} {{were more}} attractive against the <b>alates,</b> it {{was subjected to}} column chromatography in order to separate attractive fractions. Eight fractions were obtained and labeled as 4042 /WR/ 1 / 1 – 4042 /WR/ 1 / 8 and Table  5 presents the weights of the sub-fractions and responses of the <b>alates</b> to each sub-fraction. The results revealed that the responses of <b>alates</b> to sub-fractions were significantly different from untreated control (F =  32, df =  7, P <  0.0001) and mean comparison among sub fractions showed that response of <b>alates</b> was significantly attractive to two fractions 4042 /WR/ 1 / 3 (50  ±  0.56) and 4042 /WR/ 1 / 7 (66  ±  1.2) suggesting that these two fractions contain semiochemicals that attract <b>alates.</b>|$|R
30|$|Responses of <b>alates</b> to the hexane {{fractions}} of rotted stem extracts of tolerant cultivars, TRI 2027 (84  %) and TRI 4042 (84  %) {{were not significantly}} different (F =  0.07, df =  1, P =  0.9747) from that of susceptible cultivars, TRI 2023 (65  %) and TRI 4049 (40  %) indicating rotted tea stem extracts of four tea cultivars attract the <b>alates.</b> Mean comparison of response of <b>alates</b> to {{fractions of}} hexane, chloroform and methanol of the four cultivars showed that response of <b>alates</b> to hexane fraction was significantly higher (TRI 2023  =  65  ±  3.5, TRI 2027  =  84  ±  3.6, TRI 4042  =  84  ±  3.8 and TRI 2027  =  40  ±  4.1) than that of chloroform and methanol fractions (P <  0.05). Although response of <b>alates</b> to chloroform faction also significantly higher than that of untreated control and it is not significantly different from methanol fraction (P >  0.05) (Table  3). These results suggest that hexane fraction contains chemical constituents that attract <b>alates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Swarming is the sudden, {{dramatic}} {{appearance of}} R. flavipes <b>alates</b> {{in the daytime}} from February to April. After this behavior male and female <b>alates</b> lose their wings, pair up, and form new colonies.|$|R
5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. <b>Alate</b> {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land {{in search of a}} suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.|$|E

40|$|Thelohania solenopsae Knell, Allen and Hazard, is a microsporidian {{pathogen}} that infects the red imported {{fire ant}} Solenopsis invicta Buren. This four part {{study examined the}} effects that T. solenopsae had on fire ant queens as they matured for their mating flights. For the first study, a total of 878 <b>alates</b> were collected at two timed intervals during a nuptial flight and after to determine if T. solenopsae affected their ability to initiate a mating flight. Infection rates in <b>alates</b> that left the colony early during a flight were 23. 75 % while <b>alates</b> that did not leave the colony were 66. 16 %. Two other studies examined whether T. solenopsae affected protein and lipid stores in future queens. Protein stores {{were not significantly different}} in infected and uninfected ants, while lipid stores were significantly less in <b>alates</b> that were infected with T. solenopsae (10. 69 % in infected versus 13. 98 % in uninfected). The final analysis was done with all of the combined data, which showed that <b>alates</b> infected with T. solenopsae were significantly smaller than uninfected <b>alates...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{pavement}} ant is {{dark brown}} to blackish, and 2.5-4 mm long. Like other ants {{there are the}} workers, <b>alates,</b> and a queen. <b>Alates,</b> or new queen ants and drones, have wings, and are {{at least twice as}} large as the workers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alates</b> always develop from nymphs, {{with the}} last nymphal stage characterised by {{particularly}} long wing buds. After leaving their nests and swarming, male and female <b>alates</b> pair, shed their wings, begin excavating a new nest, and mate. From this point onward, they are called kings and queens, dealates, or primary reproductives.|$|R
25|$|Dispersal {{creates a}} {{relatively}} high mortality rate for sugarbeet root aphids. Additionally, <b>alate</b> aphids incur other disadvantages: if aphids fly then they may incur an additional cost in that their potential fecundity is further reduced {{and there is a}} further delay in the onset of reproduction. The combined effect is a marked reduction in reproductive potential and rate of increase. Although dispersal results in the colonization of suitable plants, it is not always clear what advantages there are in dispersing except from annual plants that are about to die. As dispersal can be costly in terms of fecundity or survival, or both, then sugarbeet root aphids are likely to delay departure until host quality falls below the average expectation for the habitat.|$|E
25|$|Colony size varies, {{depending}} on the location and age of the colony, from 440 to 2300 adult ants. Little {{is known about the}} reproduction of M. analis. The <b>alate</b> males of M. analis are often observed leaving and entering the nests of established colonies by using pheromone trails from previous raids as guides to the nest. Since M. analis colonies are obligate termite hunters, it is impossible for a queen to establish a nest on her own, since she could not conduct a raid against termites without a standing army of worker ants. It is therefore assumed that when a new colony is created, it occurs through colony fission, with the new queen taking a number of the workers of the old colony with her to create a new colony.|$|E
25|$|In the spring, {{a female}} nymph (also {{known as a}} stem mother) emerges from an {{overwintering}} egg and initiates a gall {{on one of the}} leaves of the Populus tree. The gall forms around the stem mother, who begins to reproduce parthenogenically while feeding on the leaf's phloem sap. Each stem mother is capable of creating up to 300 progeny per gall. The gall occupants develop wings {{in the middle of the}} summer and disperse from the gall to deposit their larvae in the ground. These larvae colonize and feed on the roots of nearby Chenopodiaceae plants for the rest of the summer. In the summer, they form <b>alate</b> migrants that fly back to the Populus tree and asexually produce sexual males and females whose sole purpose is to mate, as they lack mouthparts to feed. The product of sexual reproduction is a single egg in each female which is deposited in the tree's bark and left to overwinter.|$|E

Therefore hexane, chloroform and aqueous methanol fractions of the extracts of rotted stems were tested against <b>alates</b> using orientation bioassays. Results revealed that the hexane fraction of rotted stem of each cultivar was more attractive {{than that of the}} chloroform and methanol fractions. The results of bioassay guided fractionation of the hexane fraction using column chromatography revealed the presence of two bioactive sub-fractions suggesting non-polar compounds in rotted tea wood are more {{attractive to}} G. dilatatus than other sub-fractions. These two fractions can be used to develop a trapping mechanism to strengthen present IPM program of LCLWT.|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} fertile {{individuals}} produced by colonies of N. corniger varies widely. Mature colonies with between 50,000 and 400,000 infertile workers generally produce between 5,000 and 25,000 alates. In some years large colonies {{do not produce}} a fertile brood. <b>Alate</b> nymphs develop through five instars and spend between 5 and 8 months within the colony before leaving to mate. When the alates are mature they typically account for 35% of the colony's biomass. More males than females are produced from each colony but because females are heavier (by between 20 and 40%) the energy investment in each sex is similar. Newly formed colonies tend to have multiple queens and kings all {{living in the same}} royal chamber. Slightly older colonies tend to consist of multiple queens (up to 33) but only one king, in these cases the species can be considered polygynous. Over several years the species turns to being monogamous, having only one queen and one king. Being polygynous {{in the early stages of}} the colony is advantageous as it allows the colony to produce many workers in a short period of time and allows the production of female alates more quickly than if they were monogamous from the start.|$|E
500|$|Mayflies are {{hemimetabolous}} (they have [...] "incomplete metamorphosis").

Mayflies at the subimago stage are a favourite food of many fish, and many fishing flies are modelled to resemble them. The subimago stage does not survive for long, rarely for more than 24 hours. In some species, it may last for just a few minutes, while the mayflies in the family Palingeniidae have sexually mature subimagos and no true adult form at all.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The epicuticular and {{internal}} hydrocarbons (HC) from different castes of the dampwood termite Zootermopsis nevadensis {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The epicuticular HC profiles of workers and <b>alates</b> contained large proportions of n-heneicosane (n-C 21), 5 -methylheneicosane (5 -MeC 21), and 5, 17 - and 5, 15 -dimethylheneicosane (5, 17 -, 5, 15 -diMeC 21). Sixty-three HC peaks were identified as normal-, monomethyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethylalkanes up to 41 carbons long.

50|$|Observations inside nests {{showed that}} the workers, queen, <b>alates</b> and brood took up {{stations}} on the fibrous roots which formed a sort of scaffolding in their nests. The size of the nest varied {{with the size of}} the root system of the plant above. During the summer, above some of the nests, workers chewed bits of plant material to produce a papery felt or thatch. However, it was not clear why this was done for some nests and not others. During the winter, the average nest housed about 75,000 workers and 12 to 59 queens. In the summer, the number of workers ranged from 13,000 to 19,000 while there were about 180 queens per nest. <b>Alates</b> first appeared in April but the majority were found in July. Nuptial flights took place early in the morning after heavy rains with thousands of male <b>alates</b> taking to the wing in search of other nests or colonies.

2500|$|Nuptial {{flight in}} red {{imported}} fire ants begins during the warmer seasons {{of the year}} (spring and summer), usually two days after [...] rain. The time alates emerge and mate is between noon and 3:00pm. Nuptial flights recorded in North Florida have, on average, 690 female and male alates participating in a single flight. Males {{are the first to}} leave the nest, and both sexes readily undertake flight with little to no preflight activity. However, workers swarm the mound excitedly stimulated by mandibular glands within the head of the alates. As mounds do not have holes, workers form holes during nuptial flight as a way for the alates to emerge. This behaviour in workers, elicited by the pheromones, includes rapid running and back-and-forth movements, and increased aggression. Workers also cluster themselves around the alates as they climb up on vegetation, and in some cases, attempt to pull them back down before they take flight. Chemical cues from males and females during nuptial flight attract workers, but chemical cues released by workers do not attract other nestmates. It also induces alarm-recruitment behaviour in workers which results in a higher rate of <b>alate</b> retrieval.|$|E
2500|$|The prince's journey {{begins with}} an act of pity: upon {{preparing}} to cross a bridge, the hero notes that {{it is home to}} an ant colony, and, fearful of destroying it, opts instead to cross through the riverbed. An <b>alate</b> ant visits him and rewards his deed with one of its wings, guaranteeing that, should he ever need assistance, burning the item would instantly summon the entire colony to his aid. A similar encounter takes place after Harap Alb fashions his hat into a hive, to be used by a homeless swarm of bees: the grateful queen bee presents him with another wing, with which to summon her and her subjects. Further down on his path, Harap Alb gradually collects a band of followers. The first among them is Gerilă (from ger, [...] "frost", and the diminutive suffix -ilă), a man who shivers in summer, and whose cold breath, reaching the fury of a strong wind, can turn things into ice. Confronted with astonishment and some irony by the prince, Gerilă answers: [...] "Laugh if you will, Harap Alb, but you'll not be able to accomplish anything without me where you're going." [...] The reply prompts its recipient to change his mind, and creates a bond between the two characters. They are joined by Flămânzilă (from flămând, [...] "hungry"; translated as [...] "Eat-All"), who can consume huge amounts without satisfying his appetite. Next comes Setilă (from sete, [...] "thirst"; also [...] "Drink-All"), Flămânzilă's counterpart among drinkers. These in turn are followed by Ochilă (from ochi, [...] "eye"), whose sight covers immense distances, and Păsări-Lăți-Lungilă (from pasăre, [...] "bird", a se lăți, [...] "to widen oneself" [...] and a se lungi, [...] "to lengthen oneself"), who can will himself to grow in any direction and reach heights only accessible to birds. They all persuade Harap Alb to discard his reticence by issuing forecasts closely resembling Gerilă's reply. The first effect of this reunion is however disastrous: the respective traits of the characters result in burning down entire forests, depleting the soil, draining the water, exposing all secrets and exterminating birds, with Harap Alb himself being the only one who [...] "did not cause any disruption." ...|$|E
50|$|A single {{colony of}} C. formosanus may produce over 70,000 <b>alates.</b> After a brief flight, <b>alates</b> shed their wings.
