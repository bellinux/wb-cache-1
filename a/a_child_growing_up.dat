He cites one of his older sisters, Tragil, as the individual most responsible for his childhood upbringing and for steering him in the proper direction. As <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the Chicago area, Wade idolized Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan, and has said he patterns his game after him.|$|E

As <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> on a farm he used to run ten kilometres to school every morning, and the same back every evening. This led to a distinctive running posture, with his left arm crooked as if still holding his school books.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, Arlosoroff {{directed}} his focus {{to the plight of}} German Jewry. The Germany Arlosoroff coveted as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> changed quickly and drastically upon Hitler's ascension to rule. In April 1933, the Nazi regime implemented the first of many anti-Semitic ordinances by terminating all Jewish employees from German government positions. Also at that time, Nazi officials decreed Jewish people would not be permitted to flee Germany without a specially issued exit visa. Jewish groups responded worldwide to Hitler's dictatorship through protests and boycotts of German products.|$|E

On the day of the NFL Draft, Jones wore a T-shirt that featured his grandmother's picture.|$|E
500|$|Stead drew {{inspiration}} from many sources {{in order to create}} the novel. As <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in a big city, she was interested in the small towns which made her think [...] "that in smaller places, everybody, even the kids, had special identities, where as in a city people are pretty anonymous". An idea began to form for a hidden society that also served as a small town.|$|E
50|$|Some {{epilepsy}} ends after childhood. Some {{forms of}} epilepsy are associated only with conditions of childhood that cease once <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>grows</b> <b>up.</b> Approximately 70% {{of children who}} have epilepsy during their childhood eventually outgrow it. There are also some seizures, such as febrile seizures, that are one-time occurrences during childhood, {{and they do not}} result in permanent epilepsy.|$|R

500|$|Coghill cites drummers Keith Moon and Mitch Mitchell {{as major}} {{influences}} on his playing, while boxer Mohammad Ali as a non-musical inspiration. He notes that multi-instrumentalist Stevie Wonder is his favourite. During his university years, Coghill began listening to technical drummers such as Dennis Chambers. Others {{have noted that}} Coghill is influenced by The Dead Kennedys and The Fugees. In 1997, Coghill stated [...] "I’m really interested in groove", and explained that he enjoyed the lyrical elements of Hip Hop and bands such as Spearhead. Coghill has also stated that as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in Nambour, he had aspired to be [...] "a star like Michael Jackson". He says this ambition was sparked by a breakdancing teacher in his home town, and by his sister's love of Jackson's Thriller.|$|E

50|$|For black {{high school}} students, the African American family {{structure}} does affect their educational goals and expectations also. Studies {{on the topic}} have indicated that <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in single-parent homes faces disturbances in young childhood, adolescence and young adulthood as well. Although these effects are sometimes minimal and contradictory, it is generally agreed that the family structure <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>grows</b> <b>up</b> in is important for their success in the educational sphere.|$|R
500|$|Families {{vary widely}} {{in terms of}} how {{household}} chores are divided. Some retired males who marry a younger woman decide to become stay-at-home dads while their wives work because they want a [...] "second chance" [...] to watch <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> in <b>a</b> second or third marriage. Additionally, more career and lifestyle options are accepted and prevalent in Western society. There are also fewer restrictions on what constitutes a family.|$|R
500|$|Kenny Roberts' {{parents were}} Alice and Melton [...] "Buster" [...] Roberts. As <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> {{in the rural}} {{agriculture}} area just off highway 132 near the West side vineyards of E & J Gallo Winery of Modesto, Roberts was originally interested in horseback riding. He rode his first motorcycle {{at the age of}} 12 when a friend dared him to ride a mini bike. Roberts accepted the challenge and the experience thrilled him. He built his own motorcycle by attaching his father's lawn mower engine to a bicycle frame. Roberts began his career in dirt track racing after attending a local race in Modesto and deciding that he wanted to compete himself. His father purchased a Tohatsu bike for him, but once it proved itself uncompetitive as a race bike, he moved up to a more powerful Hodaka motorcycle.|$|E
500|$|As <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in Paddington, McCool {{attended}} Crown Street State School—earlier students included Victor Trumper and Monty Noble. He {{played his}} childhood cricket on concrete wickets in Moore Park and learnt to bowl from reading Clarrie Grimmett's instructional book, Getting Wickets. McCool played his early grade cricket with Paddington Cricket Club {{before coming to}} the notice of the New South Wales selectors. [...] He made his first-class début for New South Wales against [...] "Rest of Australia" [...] in March 1940, making 19 and 15 and taking one wicket. While the Australian Cricket Board suspended the Sheffield Shield competition {{at the end of the}} 1939–40 season, at the request of the Australian government, a series of matches were arranged to raise money for wartime charities in the following 1940–41 season. [...] McCool played in six of these matches for New South Wales, scoring 416 runs at average of 52.00 and taking 24 wickets at an average of 23.50.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1980s, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Wills played or observed an Aboriginal football game, Marngrook, as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the Grampians among the Djab wurrung, and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football. The theory has provoked intense debate, amounting to a controversy dubbed [...] "football's history wars". In her essay [...] "A Seductive Myth", published in the AFL's The Australian Game of Football Since 1858 (2008), Hibbins calls the proposed link an [...] "emotional belief" [...] lacking [...] "any intellectual credibility". She points out that neither Wills nor any of his fellow football founders mention Aboriginal games in existing documents, and states that there is no evidence of Marngrook being played in the vicinity where Wills grew up. Since then, among the personal papers of ethnographer Alfred William Howitt, an interview has been found with a Mukjarrawaint man who recalls playing Marngrook in the Grampians. Also, in his first-hand account of Aboriginal games, James Dawson, an Aboriginal rights activist, records the Djab wurrung word for football as [...] "Min'gorm". De Moore therefore argues that Marngrook was likely played around where Wills lived as a boy, [...] "or, at the very least, that the local Aboriginal people knew of such a game". That Wills knew of Marngrook, he adds, is speculative at best.|$|E

500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> during World War II. That {{was supposed to be}} the one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
