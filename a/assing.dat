40|$|Generally, {{aggregation}} of the amyloid-ß peptide {{is considered}} the cause of neuronal death in Alzheimer disease. The heterogenous <b>Aß</b> peptide occurs in various lengths in vivo: <b>Aß</b> 40 and <b>Aß</b> 42 are the predominant forms while both shorter and longer peptides exist. <b>Aß</b> 40 and shorter isoforms are less aggregation-prone and hence considered less dangerous than <b>Aß</b> 42 and longer isoforms, which are more aggregation-prone. Up to now research mainly focussed on the predominant <b>Aß</b> peptides and their individual characterization. This work emphasizes {{on the behavior of}} various isoforms in mixtures, as to mimick the in vivo situation. The results indicate that subtle differences in the ratio of <b>Aß</b> 40 to <b>Aß</b> 42 can induces strong differences in aggregation behavior and toxicity. This observation is not limited to these isoforms: {{a small fraction of the}} shorter <b>Aß</b> 38 or the longer <b>Aß</b> 43 affects the aggregation behavior of the predominant <b>Aß</b> isoforms. Additionally these minor peptides can enhance the toxic effects of <b>Aß</b> 40 on neurons while damping that of <b>Aß</b> 42. This is crucial for the development of new therapeutics as current strategies aim to decrease the production of <b>Aß</b> 42 while increasing <b>Aß</b> 38 levels at the same time. The strategy is based on the assumption that the presence of less aggregating <b>Aß</b> 38 is less hazardous than that of <b>Aß</b> 42. The results presented here however suggest that the situation is more nuanced. A detailed understanding of the agggregation behavior of less predominant <b>Aß</b> isoforms, in isolation but certainly in mixtures, will lead to better insight in the mechanisms leading to Alzheimer disease and as such contribute to improved therapeutic approaches...|$|R

40|$|Amyloid ß-peptide (<b>Aß),</b> <b>Aß</b> {{precursor}} protein (APP), apolipoprotein E (apoE), and elevated cholesterol levels {{have been linked}} to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. High cholesterol levels increase APP and apoE expression in human NT 2 neuron progenitor cells. A cholesterolrich environment also induces processing of APP, leading to the formation of <b>Aß</b> and <b>Aß</b> peptide fragments. Using a novel method, we determined that 1) cholesterol binds to <b>Aß</b> at α-secretase cleavage site; 2) <b>Aß</b> 17 – 40 rather than <b>Aß</b> 1 – 40 prevents cholesterol from binding to apoE; 3) <b>Aß</b> 1 – 40 inhibits cholesterol from binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), leading to decrease cholesterol influx and intracellular cholesterol levels; 4) the binding of cholesterol to apoE or LDL was abolished completely in presence of <b>Aß</b> 1 – 42. Increased extracellular free cholesterol levels are toxic to neurons; this toxicity is prevented by specific lipoproteins, such as highdensity lipoproteins, which maintain their ability to bind cholesterol in the presence of <b>Aß.</b> We propose that one of the physiological functions of <b>Aß</b> and APP is to control cholesterol transport. AD is associated with increased <b>Aß</b> production. High cholesterol levels also lead to overproduction of <b>Aß.</b> <b>Aß</b> blocks cholesterol trafficking and changes cholesterol homeostasis leading to neurodegeneration and the onset and/or progression of AD pathology.

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease, mostly affectingelderly. The invariable deposition of protease-resistant fibrils of Alzheimer amyloidß-peptide (<b>Aß)</b> in the parenchyma and blood vessels of the brain is a centralevent. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether <b>Aß</b> develops proteaseresistance upon polymerization and whether <b>Aß</b> may be generated through non specificproteolysis of a polymerized precursor, to identify Aß-Aß binding and fibrilforming sequences in <b>Aß</b> and define the molecular basis of <b>Aß</b> polymerization,and to find inhibitors of fibril formation. To investigate if <b>Aß</b> fibril formation is sufficient to acquire protease resistance,non-polymerized and polymerized <b>Aß</b> were treated with an array of proteases. Non-polymerized <b>Aß</b> was degraded whereas fibrils were resistant to proteolysis. The proteases generating <b>Aß</b> from its precursor, APP, have not been identified. We show that <b>Aß</b> can be generated through nonspecific proteolysis of a polymerizedprecursor. A C-terminal fragment of APP was purified and allowed to polymerize. Fibrilsremained after digestion with proteinase K, an enzyme capable of cleaving most peptidebonds. The fibrils were dissolved and subjected to gel electrophoresis, showing anAß immunoreactive band comigrating with synthetic <b>Aß.</b> A sequence critical for Aß-Aß binding was identified by incubating decapeptidescorresponding to various <b>Aß</b> sequences with labeled <b>Aß</b> By systematicallytruncating binding peptides, the shortest sequence mediating intact <b>Aß</b> bindingwas found to be <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 o Short peptides containing this sequence inhibited fibrilformation. Further studies showed that <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 o bound to the homologous regionin <b>Aß.</b> The <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 O sequence was used as a labeled probe to search for bindersin a combinatorial library consisting of pentapeptides composed of D-amino acids. The most efficient binders were incubated with <b>Aß</b> and found capable of inhibitingfibril formation. Hence, short <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 o containing peptides can be used to identifyinhibitors of <b>Aß</b> fibril formation in combinatorial libraries. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to follow the polymerizationof <b>Aß</b> in solution. Initially, only monomers/dimers were observed and polymerizationwas found to proceed over large aggregates, via small aggregates into mature fibrils. The amounts of aggregates were reduced in the presence of an inhibitor and formedaggregates were partly dissolved after addition of an inhibitor. Labeled inhibitorbound to monomeric/dimeric <b>Aß</b> as well as aggregates and was displaced by unlabeledinhibitor. The shortest fibril forming sequence containing the Aß-Aß binding motifwas identified by systematically elongating and truncating sequences containing <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 o. The shortest sequence forming Aß-like fibrils was <b>Aß</b> 14 - 23. Substitutionsand truncations in this peptide yielded ultrastructurally different aggregates, noneresembling <b>Aß</b> fibrils. A model with favorable hydrophobic and ionic interactionsbetween two <b>Aß</b> 14 - 23 peptides in an antiparalell ß-sheet configurationwere subjected to molecular modeling. Two dimers were aligned to form a tetramer,which could be the smallest repeating unit in fibrils. It is suggested that theseinteractions are present also in <b>Aß</b> fibrils.

Through coordinated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling, we have shown that <b>ASS</b> 1 -deficient cells have decreased levels of acetylated polyamine metabolites, together with a compensatory increase in the expression of polyamine biosynthetic enzymes.

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by the intracellular deposition of ubiquitinated tau and by the extracellular accumulation of soluble, insoluble, and fibrillary <b>Aß.</b> Previous studies suggest that <b>Aß</b> is normally eliminated from the brain along perivascular pathways that may become blocked in the aging brain, resulting in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. As age is a major risk factor for AD and for cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we test the hypothesis that CVD inhibits the elimination of <b>Aß</b> from the aging human brain. Sections from 100 aged and AD brains were stained for <b>Aß</b> by immunohistochemistry and by reticulin and Masson trichrome techniques. Early deposition of <b>Aß</b> in brain parenchyma was related to individual arterial territories in the cortex. In areas of more extensive accumulation of <b>Aß,</b> there was an inverse relationship between capillary amyloid angiopathy and plaques of <b>Aß.</b> Thus, arterial territories with extensive capillary amyloid angiopathy were devoid of <b>Aß</b> plaques, whereas in areas with abundant diffuse plaques there was no capillary amyloid angiopathy. Serial sections showed that cortical arteries feeding capillary beds with <b>Aß</b> angiopathy were occluded by thrombus. We conclude that CVD inhibits the elimination of <b>Aß</b> along capillary walls and changes the distribution of <b>Aß</b> in the cerebral cortex. Loss of pulsations in thrombosed or arteriosclerotic arteries may thus abolish the motive force necessary for the drainage of <b>Aß</b> and inhibit the elimination of <b>Aß.</b> Therapies to increase elimination of <b>Aß</b> in AD need to consider the effects of CVD on the elimination of <b>Aß</b> from the aging human brain...|$|R
