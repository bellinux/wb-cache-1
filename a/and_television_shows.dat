5|$|Lesbians {{portrayed in}} literature, film, and {{television}} often shape contemporary thought about women's sexuality. The majority of media about lesbians {{is produced by}} men; women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s, <b>and</b> <b>television</b> <b>shows</b> portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.|$|E

5|$|The charismatic and {{sophisticated}} vampire of modern fiction {{was born in}} 1819 {{with the publication of}} The Vampyre by John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.
