25|$|In response, AET {{once again}} criticsed OFSTED, {{saying that the}} Ofsted judgements were unfairly {{negative}} and that many of its schools {{had a history of}} poor performance and would require time to turn round. Ian Comfort the CEO also directly queried the professionalism of OFSTED by claiming that OFSTED had unfairly turned the 'generally positive oral feedback' given at the time of inspections, into 'far more negative statements' in the final OFSTED letter which criticised standards at AET. In comments to the Parliamentary Select Committee Ian Comfort also queried the appropriateness of having both OFSTED and the DfE involved in inspecting school standards as it put 'unnecessary pressure' on AET schools. In contrast to Ian Comfort other CEO's of Multi Academy Trusts, such as Dame Rachel de Souza have publicly stated that they <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with how the DfE and OFSTED work together to hold schools accountable.|$|E

To score three goals is not easy. I can say that we <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> now with this trophy. Now is the time to enjoy our victory."

500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> to win, but we do not want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E
500|$|Carson {{returned}} to Liverpool {{at the end}} of the season and in June 2007, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez confirmed that he would be part of the first-team squad for the 2007–08 season, saying [...] "He must fight with Pepe Reina now for a starting place." [...] Carson remained second choice to Reina, however, and faced further competition following the signing of Charles Itandje in August 2007; as a result, Carson was loaned out again, this time to Aston Villa at a cost to Villa of £2million. Benitez said of the deal, [...] "We do not want to sell him, we <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with Scott. But he needs to play to keep up his England place." [...] Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill preferred Carson to Thomas Sørensen and Stuart Taylor, and Carson played in all but three of Villa's 38 league matches, missing the two matches against Liverpool as he was ineligible to play, and kept 11 clean sheets during the 2007–08 season. He received the first red card of his career when he fouled Carlos Tevez in Villa's 4–1 Premier League defeat to Manchester United.|$|E

Lewis and Audrey spend the night together and decide to keep their relationship a secret, especially from Audrey's family, as his [...] "past indiscretions still loom over them like a dark cloud".

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 16, 1910. It states: [...] "A shot that found a fortune! Jack Hunt, {{the son of a}} wealthy woman, falls in love with Nell Horsley, who is in the chorus of a musical comedy. They are married, but when Jack's mother is informed she declares she'll {{have nothing to do with}} Nell, although she is willing to forgive her son. But Jack sticks to his wife, and for a time they <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy.</b> Then Jack, who is in the militia, is called out on strike duty, and meets his death during a fight with strikers. The widow takes the news to her mother-in-law, who nevertheless retains her hatred for Nell, despite the tragedy. As time passes, Mrs. Hunt becomes a miser. She disposes of all of her property, receiving in exchange money and jewels which she hides in a secret place in her room. In the meantime Nell has a hard time to get along and keep a roof over her head and that of her little boy. So desperate are her circumstances that she finally sinks her pride and appeals to her mother-in-law. The old woman repulses her again; her fit of rage brings on a stroke of apoplexy and she drops dead after Nell leaves. All her property goes to little George, as the woman left no will, but search fails to locate anything except the family homestead. Nell is about to sell that, when she makes a discovery. Playing 'Indian' with her boy, she shoots arrows aimlessly about the room. One of them hits the secret spring of the treasure vault, and the accident puts the boy and his mother beyond want for the rest of their lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Life {{satisfaction}} and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently. [...] Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An {{example of a}} measurement of affective balance is the PANAS (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule). [...] The issue with the current measurements of life {{satisfaction and}} affective balance {{is that they are}} self-reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on the questionnaires. Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one’s SWB. Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports. [...] Informant reports are given to the participant’s closest friends and family and they are asked to fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy,</b> however that participant’s friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. Another method of gaining {{a better understanding of the}} true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method. [...] In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors. A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method. [...] In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days’ activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB.|$|E
