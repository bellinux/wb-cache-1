Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth." [...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has." ...|$|E
500|$|Motley {{thought he}} could come back and play a ninth season in 1954, and showed up to {{training}} camp to prove it. Paul Brown, however, thought otherwise. Dogged by injuries and 34 years old, Motley quit before the season began, after Brown said he would otherwise be cut from the team. [...] "Marion realized that his knee was weak and {{did not feel that}} it was coming around," [...] Brown said at the time. [...] "He was one of the truly fine fullbacks in his prime, the type that comes along once in a lifetime. I certainly never will forget some of his runs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> Cleveland football fans feel the same." ...|$|E

Also at CES, Samsung revealed a selection of hardware inspired by the Avengers films, {{as well as a}} simulation of Avengers Tower via its Gear VR virtual reality device. A second trailer premiered on ESPN on January 12, 2015 during the broadcast of the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship. Mendelson enjoyed the trailer, but wished it did not reveal as many story elements as it did. However, he added, [...] "the marketing thus far [...] has been far superior to much of what sold The Avengers three years ago, both in terms of the specific footage and the artistic choices being made… I'm sold, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> most of the general moviegoers are already onboard too." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 1950, the {{government}} called for Second World War veterans {{to serve in}} the Korea War as part of the specially raised 'K' Force. Saunders volunteered and returned to the Army as a lieutenant. After training at Puckapunyal, Victoria, and in Japan, he arrived in Korea in November 1950. He served with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR), initially as a platoon commander in A Company. In February 1951, he took charge of ACompany when its commander was wounded; he was subsequently given command of CCompany. Promoted to captain, Saunders led CCompany during the Battle of Kapyong in April, when 3RAR and a Canadian battalion held off a Chinese division north-east of the South Korean capital Seoul. [...] Frustrated by the conduct of the war prior to Kapyong, he afterwards recorded that, [...] "At last I felt like an Anzac <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> there were 600 others like me". The 3rd Battalion was awarded a US Presidential Unit Citation for its part in the action. Saunders himself was recommended for a decoration but turned it down. Leading a Vickers machine gun platoon at the Battle of Maryang San in October, he reportedly shared the following exchange with a fellow 3RAR officer: as they surveyed the forbidding mountain before them, Saunders' companion remarked, [...] "No country for white men", to which Saunders replied, [...] "It's no country for black men, either". He returned to Australia in November 1951.|$|E

[...] He said Australia recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet but called for dialogue between the two sides when he was giving speech in Peking University on April 9, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Plimpton {{appeared}} in the 2008 Entertainment Weekly photo issue spread as one of [...] "The Hardest Working Actors In Showbiz". She appears in the spread with Lance Reddick, Celia Weston, John Slattery, Bobby Cannavale, James Rebhorn, Lynn Cohen, Matt Servitto and Bob Balaban. Plimpton said in the write-up, [...] "I went to jury duty the other day, and somebody said, 'You always play drug addicts!' I've played a few on TV, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> because the shows get replayed, it seems like more. But yeah, people tend to see me as this pregnant teenage heroin addict." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dick later {{explained}} {{where the}} inspiration for the story came from: [...] "I got the idea when a fly buzzed by my head one day <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> (paranoia indeed!) that it was laughing at me." ...|$|R

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality {{and its role in}} his work: [...] "I'd say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, saying [...] "its audience, which takes these films very seriously indeed, will drink deeply of its blood. The sensational closing {{sequence}} cannot be accused of leaving a single loophole, not even some of those we didn't know were there". However, he concluded by saying, [...] ""Breaking Dawn, Part 2" [...] must be one of the more serious entries in any major movie franchise... it bit the bullet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> fans will be pleased." [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire gave the film a mixed review and said, [...] "Fans will be left on a high; other viewers will be confused but generally entertained by a saga whose romance is matched only by its weirdness".|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E

60|$|Shortly {{after breakfast}} a message {{was brought to}} me that Mr Abney {{would like to see}} me in his study. I went without any sense of {{disaster}} to come.
