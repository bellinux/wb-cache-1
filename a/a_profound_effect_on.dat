5|$|In the 16th-century German alchemist Andreas Libavius {{described}} {{the production of}} acetone from the dry distillation of lead acetate, ketonic decarboxylation. The presence of water in vinegar has such <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> acetic acid's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances. French chemist Pierre Adet proved them identical.|$|E

5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> both on population and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E
5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> {{the evolution}} of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war was encouraging in that it had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would have <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E
50|$|From {{an early}} age, Réti was preoccupied by {{contemporary}} questions of artistic theory, which he {{also tried to}} explore as a professor. After 1920, particularly, he wrote more articles on these subjects.

Many theorists through the years have postulated that if Jackson had lived, Lee might have prevailed at Gettysburg. Certainly Jackson's discipline and tactical sense were sorely missed.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to the virus. In 1999, the World Health Organization approved {{the use of the}} TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E
5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> contemporary theology, particularly {{in the way people}} perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals {{in the thirteenth century}} generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E
50|$|D'Ornano's {{book had}} <b>an</b> equally <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the {{historian}} circles in France. In 1950s Jean Savant, a renowned historian and writer, {{wrote a book}} about Walewska in which he attempted to recreate a scientific biography of Maria Walewska. Before publishing the book, he printed certain extracts from it in Elle, a popular woman's magazine, which resulted in a famous lawsuit from count d'Ornano and his descendants.|$|R

The two most important works from this period are his ballet Lackschmi (1922) and the orchestral suite Skovvandring (Forest Journey), along with almost 100 Lieder.|$|R
5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} {{daughter}}. The {{loss of his}} wife had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{two and a half}} centuries, Io {{remained}} an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, including early methods to determine longitude, validating Kepler's third law of planetary motion, and determining the time required for light to travel between Jupiter and Earth. Based on ephemerides produced by astronomer Giovanni Cassini and others, Pierre-Simon Laplace created a mathematical theory to explain the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede. This resonance was later found to have <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the geologies of the three moons.|$|E
5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home {{in case of an}} accident. This had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to have <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E
5|$|The 1960s saw several {{important}} changes in popular music, especially rock. Many {{of these changes}} took place through the British Invasion where bands such as The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, became immensely popular and had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> American culture and music.These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer-songwriter, and the understanding of popular music as an art, rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment. These changes led {{to the rise of}} musical movements connected to political goals, such as the American Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to the Vietnam War. Rock was at the forefront of this change.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlandish {{painters}} {{were largely}} {{forgotten in the}} 18th century. When Musée du Louvre was converted to an art gallery during the French Revolution, Gerard David's Marriage at Cana – then attributed to van Eyck – was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels {{were added to the}} collection after the French conquered the Low Countries. These works had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> German literary critic and philosopher Karl Schlegel, who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, sending it to Ludwig Tieck, who had the piece published in 1805.|$|E
