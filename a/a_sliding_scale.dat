5|$|The Hurricane Severity Index (HSI) {{is another}} scale used and rates the {{severity}} {{of all types of}} tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields. The HSI is a 0 to 50 point scale, allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size. Points are awarded on <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale,</b> with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields.|$|E
5|$|Those ransomed were valued on <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale,</b> {{ranging from}} around 1,875DM for a manual worker to around 11,250DM for a doctor. The justification, {{according}} to East Germany, {{was that this}} was compensation for the money invested by the state in the prisoner's training. For a while, payments were made in kind using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee and medical drugs. The average prisoner was worth around 4,000DM worth of goods.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale,</b> ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E

5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E
5|$|The school runs on {{a shoestring}} budget as a {{tradeoff}} for its financial independence and accessibility to low-income students. Tuition is billed on <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> based on what parents can afford. Revenue from rental properties and fundraising supplements tuition income. The Free School started a high school program in 2006. It later spun off as the Harriet Tubman Democratic High School and enrolls about 20 students in both self-directed and traditional classes. Alumni of the school have attended a variety of colleges. Journalists have noted the school's similarity to unschooling and homeschooling, and its work to that of prefigurative politics. The Albany Free School {{is one of the}} few schools remaining from the 1960s and 1970s free school movement. It inspired the program of the Brooklyn Free School.|$|E

Its bridge works on <b>a</b> <b>slide</b> <b>scale</b> invented by Edwards. The HitchHiker can simulate an acoustic guitar, and provides 15 different sound selections.

25|$|Many private Waldorf schools {{experience}} {{a tension between}} these social goals and the way tuition fees act {{as a barrier to}} access to the education by less well-off families. Schools have attempted to improve access for a wider range of income groups by charging lower fees than comparable independent schools, by offering <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> of fees, and/or by seeking state support.|$|E
25|$|The fees charged were on <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> {{according}} to assets. The physicians {{of the rich}} were themselves rich. For example, Antonius Musa treated Augustus' nervous symptoms with cold baths and drugs. He was not only set free but he became Augustus' physician. He received a salary of 300,000 sesterces. There {{is no evidence that}} he was other than a private physician; that is, he was not working for the Roman government.|$|E

25|$|McNabb died in 1802 but it {{took another}} sixteen years before the school opened it doors after much debate about {{how to use the}} bequest. It was in 1815 that the Rev. Andrew Mylne, Minister of Dollar, along with fellow Trustees {{conceived}} of a great academy to educate the boys and girls of the parish, and also pupils from outside Dollar, who would board with teachers. Full fees would be charged to ‘non-residenters’, while parish pupils would pay fees on <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale,</b> with some receiving free education. To attract pupils from outside the parish, excellent teachers would be appointed.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> of green transport {{depending on the}} sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more fuel-efficient, but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronised public transport networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles. Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and electric buses combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are cycling and other human-powered vehicles, and animal powered transport. The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is walking.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to allow for Minority education rights (according to legal decisions based on Article 23) along <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> had already been nascent in Manitoba and was foreshadowed by the Laurier-Greenway compromise of 1896. This compromise came in response to what was argued to be unconstitutional provincial school legislation (Schools Act 1890) {{in relation to the}} constitutionally entrenched Manitoba Act of 1870. In Manitoba where the Public Schools Act had been reformed along the lines of minority vs majority language rights and a changing population proportion of English to French (where English speakers out-numbered French by the 1890s), the Laurier-Greenway compromise allowed for a school district in a community by community basis to offer French language instruction if the French population was large enough and requested such instruction.|$|E

25|$|Like most {{industrialists}} of his era, Roach was staunchly anti-union, {{and insisted}} his employees negotiate {{on an individual}} basis for their wages. Roach however, took the concept of individual negotiation much further than most of his contemporaries. Instead of paying a set wage to workers based on their qualifications or skill, he organized <b>a</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> of wages for each group, based on a set of criteria Roach himself deemed important. A worker who met all the criteria would receive the top rate, while those who did not would have their wages progressively reduced, depending on the number of criteria they failed. Criteria for payment included not only a worker's skill level, but his punctuality, dependability, eagerness and quality of work, in addition to which his moral character was subject to assessment. Workers who spent too much on alcohol, who paid their rent erratically, whose families were poorly clothed, or whose children did not attend church or school, could expect to have their wages reduced still further.|$|E
