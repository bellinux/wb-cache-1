5|$|At only 5,000 {{years of}} age, the Everglades {{is a young}} region in {{geological}} terms.

5|$|Optical imaging {{inside the}} crater {{was done for}} the first time by the Japanese lunar orbiter {{spacecraft}} Kaguya in 2007. It did not have any evidence of significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> ice, down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame.

5000|$|Large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> ice exist {{below the}} Martian surface, {{as well as}} on the surface at the poles, where it is mixed with dry ice, frozen [...] Significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> are located at the south pole of Mars, which, if melted, would {{correspond}} to a planetwide ocean 5-11 meters deep. Frozen carbon dioxide (...) at the poles sublimes into the atmosphere during the Martian summers, and small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> residue are left behind, which fast winds sweep off the poles at speeds approaching 400 km/h. This seasonal occurrence transports large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> dust and <b>water</b> vapor into the atmosphere, forming Earth-like clouds.|$|R

5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a substantial <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{constitutes}} a food source which, although not rich in easily absorbed carbohydrates or fat, contains vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre.

5|$|One of the surprises of {{the impacts}} was the small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{revealed}} compared to prior predictions. Before the impact, models of Jupiter's atmosphere had {{indicated that the}} break-up of the largest fragments would occur at atmospheric pressures of anywhere from 30 kilopascals to a few tens of megapascals (from 0.3 to a few hundred bar), with some predictions that the comet would penetrate a layer of water and create a bluish shroud over that region of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In {{moist air}} or moist argon, the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If the metal is exposed long enough to a limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E
5|$|The Rivers Agency {{concluded}} that the flooding was an extreme event, caused by weather that resulted in widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in the rivers exceeded {{the capacity of the}} flood defences and the natural river banks. They further {{concluded that}} the flooding was a result of overflow of the Shimna River into the Burren River catchment area through Islands Park, rather than from the Burren River itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{geologic}} temperature record can be reconstructed from sedimentary evidence. Perhaps {{the most}} useful indicator of past climate is the fractionation of oxygen isotopes, denoted '18O. This fractionation is controlled mainly by the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> locked up in ice and the absolute temperature of the planet, and has allowed a timescale of marine isotope stages to be constructed.|$|E
40|$|The DIROM (Daily Irrigation Reservoir Operation Model) was {{modified}} to estimate <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> release from reservoirs, considering customary {{irrigation water management}} practices, such as water supply for puddling and transplanting paddy rice from seeding beds and mid-season drainage. The applicability of the modified model was investigated by simulating <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> release from three study reservoirs: Hwamae, Ogi, and Doya Reservoirs. In terms <b>of</b> annual <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> release, the relative errors between the observed and simulated values in 2012 and 2013 ranged- 26. 20 % to 10. 28 % and 4. 90 % to 30. 06 %, respectively; in case <b>of</b> reservoir <b>water</b> levels, the RMSE values ranged 0. 45 m to 1. 34 m and 0. 40 m to 1. 27 m, respectively. Also, {{it was revealed that}} the model provided better simulation results for monthly water releases than the original model. In addition, the model presented better performance in simulating 10 -day <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> release from April to June. However, the model had still significant errors in the simulation results from July to September because the reservoirs were practically operated to adapt to water management circumstances. Finally, it is concluded that the modified DIROM can estimate the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> release from reservoirs, reflecting irrigation water management customs i...|$|R

5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, {{which can lead to}} death.|$|E

5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has the least <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of}} the Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E
5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before the digital age. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground.

5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater {{as the only}} source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E
