40|$|Introduction <b>Alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> {{belongs to}} the group of benign {{epithelial}} tumors. Histogenesis of <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> is a combination of proliferation of alveolar pneumocytes and fibrous tissue originating from septal mesenchyma. Case outline A sixty-nine-year old female patient was hospitalized for clinical examination and surgery of well defined and homogenous timorous lesion in the right middle lobe causing pleural pain. Bronchoscopic examination with biopsy did not resolve etiology of the disease. Tumorectomy was performed. Timorous nodule had a multicystic appearance and histologically, histochemically and immunohistochemically, an <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> was estimated. Five years after surgery, the patient feels well, without respiratory symptoms and signs of recurrence or malignant alteration, respectively. Conclusion <b>Alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> is a rare benign lung tumor, most frequently presented as a solitary pulmonary nodule. After complete surgery, the tumor neither relapses nor malignantly alters. Surgical excision is curative. It is necessary to take into consideration <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenoma,</b> too, when a solitary pulmonary nodule is diagnosed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Alveolar adenomas are {{extremely}} rare, benign, primary lung tumors of unknown histogenesis that {{are characterized by}} proliferative type II alveolar epithelium and septal mesenchyma. Mostly incidental, they are clinically important as they can imitate benign primary and secondary malignant tumors and at times are difficult to differentiate from early-stage lung cancer. We describe {{the case of a}} 59 -year-old man with an incidental microscopic <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> coexisting with poorly differentiated lung carcinoma. Case presentation A 59 -year-old Caucasian man with a medical history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was incidentally found to have a right upper lobe mass while undergoing a computed tomographic chest scan as part of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinical trial. Our patient underwent a right upper lobectomy after a bronchoscopic biopsy of the mass revealed the mass to be a carcinoma. A pathological examination revealed an incidental, small, 0. 2 cm, well circumscribed lesion on the staple line margin of the lobectomy in addition to the carcinoma. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed the lesion to be an <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenoma.</b> Conclusions We report the rare presentation of a microscopic <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> coexisting with lung carcinoma. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> is an entirely benign incidental neoplasm that can be precisely diagnosed using immunohistochemical analysis in addition to its unique histopathological characteristics. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{localization}} of surfactant protein (SP), A, B, C, and D mRNAs {{was examined}} in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice {{in the normal}} lung, and {{in a range of}} spontaneous proliferative lung lesions using nonisotopic in situ hybridization (ISH). The aim was to develop diagnostic markers, and if possible, throw further light on the histogenesis of these lesions. Tissues from 21 animals were examined, the lesions studied were: 4 alveolar epithelial hyperplasias, 12 alveolar/bronchiolar (A/B) adenomas, and 5 A/B carcinomas. Lung metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were used as controls. In the nonneoplastic lung, staining for SP A, B, and C mRNA was observed in normal and hyperplastic type II cells but not in the bronchiolar epithelium. SP mRNAs were present in all lung tumors, with SPs A, B, and C being coexpressed in 10 / 12 (83 %) of adenomas and 4 / 5 (80 %) of carcinomas in both solid and tubulopapillary areas. No signals for SP D mRNA were noted in normal or neoplastic lung. Additionally, no staining for any SP transcript was observed in the HCC metastases examined. In summary, ISH for SP A, B, or C mRNA was a helpful aid in the diagnosis of proliferative lesions of the murine lung, enabling differentiation from hepatocellular metastases. Furthermore, this work provides strong support for the proposal that spontaneous lung tumors in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice are of alveolar, not bronchiolar origin, and consistently show type II cell differentiation. We suggest that such tumors should be referred to as <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenomas</b> and carcinomas...|$|R

40|$|Mouse lung adenomas {{have two}} {{characteristic}} histologic patterns, alveolar and bronchiolar or papillary. Differences in biologic behavior {{have been noted}} in tumors of different histologic form, in that papillary tumors were said to grow faster and become larger and possibly malignant. Progressive development from the alveolar to the papillary tumors has been proposed, involving a step-wise transformation from benign to malignant tumors. The author recently presented evidence from ultrastructural studies that the different histologic patterns {{were related to the}} cell of origin; the bronchiolar tumors consisted of Clara cells, while the alveolar tumors were made up of Type II alveolar epithelium. In the present study, designed to evaluate the histologic patterns of tumors during their development, multiple lung adenomas were induced in fetal Bagg-Webster mice on the sixteenth day of gestation by a single transplacental exposure to ethyl-nitrosourea. The animals were killed from the seventh postnatal day to 185 days of age; their tumors were counted and categorized histologically. Analysis of serial-step sections of the right lower lobes of young postnatal mice showed tumors with either an alveolar (37 %) or a bronchiolar pattern (63 %). Two forms of the latter were recognized, tubular and papillary. Between Day 80 and Day 186 papillary adenomas increased, tubular tumors decreased, and <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenomas</b> remained relatively constant in number. At the end of the 6 -month observation period the overall proportion of alveolar and Clara cell tumors was similar to that found in the first 3 weeks of life. These data support the concept that alveolar and papillary tumors arise from different cell lines, the papillary tumors exclusively from Clara cells...|$|R

40|$|The Tg. rasH 2 mouse is a {{hemizygous}} transgenic mouse, {{approved by}} regulatory agencies for carcinogenicity assessment. However, {{the absence of}} a historical database for the incidence of spontaneous neoplasms has subsequently led to reluctance by some pharmaceutical companies to adopt the use of this short-term carcinogenicity assay. Our laboratory has generated a database summarizing the mortality, body weights, and the incidence of spontaneous tumors in 1420 male and female mice assigned to 26 studies conducted at our facility. In addition, we present the incidence of tumors in positive control mice treated with urethane from these studies. Mortality in the vehicle-treated Tg. rasH 2 mouse was low (average of 1 % in each study). The most common spontaneous tumors in the Tg. rasH 2 mice were <b>alveolar</b> bronchiolar <b>adenoma</b> of the lungs (10. 14 % in males and 5. 77 % in females) and hemangiosarcoma of the spleen (3. 66 % in both males and females). The incidence of all other tumors was generally very low. In the positive control, urethane-treated animals, the incidence of <b>alveolar</b> bronchiolar <b>adenomas</b> and <b>alveolar</b> bronchiolar carcinomas in the lungs was 93. 69 % and 42. 88 % in males and 92. 43 % and 72. 79 % in females, respectively. In addition, the incidence of splenic hemangiosarcomas in urethane-treated males was 89. 18 % and 92. 25 % in females. The 6 -month Tg. rasH 2 assay is more precise, faster, and more economical than the conventional 2 -year mouse assays because of the low incidence of background tumors, very high survival, shorter duration, and the lower number of animals used...|$|R

40|$|Background - Although the {{relationship}} between allergic inflammation and lung carcinogenesis is not clearly defined, several reports suggest an increased incidence of lung cancer in patients with asthma. We aimed at determining the functional impact of allergic inflammation on chemical carcinogenesis in the lungs of mice. Methods - Balb/c mice received single-dose urethane (1 g/kg at day 0) and two-stage ovalbumin during tumor initiation (sensitization: days - 14 and 0; challenge: daily at days 6 - 12), tumor progression (sensitization: days 70 and 84; challenge: daily at days 90 - 96), or chronically (sensitization: days - 14 and 0; challenge: daily at days 6 - 12 and thrice weekly thereafter). In addition, interleukin (IL) - 5 deficient and wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice received ten weekly urethane injections. All mice were sacrificed after four months. Primary end-points were number, size, and histology of lung tumors. Secondary end-points were inflammatory cells and mediators in the airspace compartment. Results - Ovalbumin provoked acute allergic inflammation and chronic remodeling of murine airways, evident by airspace eosinophilia, IL- 5 up-regulation, and airspace enlargement. Urethane resulted in formation of atypical <b>alveolar</b> hyperplasias, <b>adenomas,</b> and adenocarcinomas in mouse lungs. Ovalbumin-induced allergic inflammation during tumor initiation, progression, or continuously did not impact the number, size, or histologic distribution of urethane-induced pulmonary neoplastic lesions. In addition, genetic deficiency in IL- 5 {{had no effect on}} urethane-induced lung tumorigenesis. Conclusions - Allergic inflammation does not impact chemical-induced carcinogenesis of the airways. These findings suggest that not all types of airway inflammation influence lung carcinogenesis and cast doubt on the idea of a mechanistic link between asthma and lung cancer...|$|R

40|$|<b>Alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> {{is a rare}} {{pulmonary}} lesion, {{fewer than}} 30 examples {{of which have been}} re-ported in the literature to date [1, 2]. It typically pre-sents in asymptomatic middle-aged patients as a pe-ripheral, well-circumscribed nodule. The clinical course is favorable and surgical excision is curative. Microscopically, it is well demarcated and composed of multiple cystic spaces lined by plump to flattened pneumocytes. The interstitium between the cysts contains bland mesenchymal cells embedded in an edematous stroma. The histogenesis of alveolar ade-noma is poorly understood: in particular, it is not known whether both the epithelial and mesenchy-mal components are neoplastic [2]. We describe an <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> with some pre-viously unreported findings, and we provide a mol-ecular analysis of multiple chromosomal loci in or-der to better clarify the nature of this unusual lesion.

40|$|THE {{demonstration}} that isoniazid (INH) is carcinogenic for the lungs of mice (Juhasz, Balo and Kendrey, 1957) raised {{a new type}} of cancer problem. Most known carcinogens are avoidable as human hazards and many are subject to restrictive legislation. However, INH is a valuable life-saving drug in the control of tuberculosis, and the assessment of it as a potential carcinogenic hazard for man is therefore a matter of unusual concern. Moreover, {{it must be noted that}} the induction of pulmonary <b>alveolar</b> <b>adenoma</b> or adenocarcinoma in mice by a variety of chemically dissimilar carcinogens (e. g. urethane and 4 -nitro-quinoline-N-oxide) is most striking in those strains, such as A and BALB/c, which have a high spontaneous incidence of such tumours. Tumours of similar histogenesis can be induced experimentally in rats but they very rarely occur spontaneously. In terms of initiators and promoters, mice of different strains behave as though they have variable amounts of some inborn initiator which determines the response of their alveolar cells to a variety of carcinogenic promoters.
