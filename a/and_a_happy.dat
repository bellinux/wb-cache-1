She advocated an ordered life <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> atmosphere for everyone.|$|E
25|$|I must own, I cannot {{conceive}} what {{ideas of}} art and dramatic connexion those persons have who suppose that we can at pleasure tack a double conclusion to a tragedy; a melancholy one for hard-hearted spectators, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> one for souls of a softer mould. After surviving so many sufferings, Lear can only die, and what more truly tragic end for him than to die from grief {{for the death of}} Cordelia? and if he is also to be saved and to pass the remainder of his days in happiness, the whole loses its signification.|$|E

500|$|In a {{directive}} letter dated 30 July 1942, Ostojić urged all Chetnik commanders to [...] "develop the strongest possible {{oral and written}} propaganda". He stated that, [...] "the people must be persuaded that the Chetniks are their only friends {{and that it is}} from them that they can expect freedom <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> life" [...] and instructed the Chetniks to [...] "work day and night and maintain the spirit of the people". He wrote, [...] "the hour of freedom is near. Allied aid for the Chetniks is assured, and the whole world is admiring them." [...] In August, he launched a counterattack against Ustaše troops returning to Foča as the Italians withdrew their garrisons from the hinterland. The Chetniks feared the Ustaše were about to unleash another round of genocidal violence on the Serb population in the area. At least 2,000 local Muslims were subsequently killed in Foča by forces under Ostojić's command.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Monfette of IGN gave Solid State Society an [...] "Impressive" [...] {{score of}} 8.0 out of 10, stating {{that it was}} [...] "A {{worthwhile}} watch". Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating, calling it a [...] "swift-moving futuristic crime film with some clever science-fiction twists and solid action" [...] but criticizing it was [...] "wordy, confusing and somewhat bloodless." [...] The film earned a 1.4% rating when it aired in NTV on October 15, 2012. Marcus Doidge of DVD Active gave it a 6/10 stating, [...] "Solid State Society isn't {{as strong as the}} first and second season of the anime show but being one feature length story as opposed to lots of very cool and largely great individual episodes offers a more in depth and focused story for the most part <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> return to the world of Ghost in the Shell". The film was awarded the Juri Prize at the 21st Digital Content Grand Prix. The film was featured in the [...] "Late Night Manga to Anime Film Season" [...] hosted by The British Museum.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred Kinsey {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the first and among the most influential figures in American sexology; his research is cited as having paved the way for a deeper exploration into sexuality among sexologists and the general public, and as having liberated female sexuality. According to Alfred Kinsey sexual ignorance led to real suffering in society and that sexual liberation, as opposed to sexual abstinence, was the key to both a strong marriage <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> life. Kinsey believed that abstinence was a sexual dysfunction: [...] "The only kinds of sexual dysfunction are abstinence, celibacy and delayed marriage." ...|$|E
2500|$|At MGM Loos happily {{turned out}} scripts; however, she {{frequently}} {{had to use}} Emerson as a conduit to communicate with directors and other executives who balked at dealing with a woman on equal footing.

She bought a modest house in Beverly Hills in 1934, where she could write in the garden when weather permitted. There {{seemed to be no}} world or life outside of Hollywood; during the day it was work, and at night parties given by other MGM folk, like the Thalbergs, the Selznicks and the Goldwyns. Loos was a frequent attendee at George Cukor's Sunday brunches, which was the closest Hollywood had to a literary salon.|$|E
2500|$|Fanny Holland {{starred in}} many of the entertainments, along with Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, their son Alfred, Holland's husband Arthur Law, Corney Grain, Arthur Cecil (all of whom also wrote for the hall) Carlotta Carrington and Leonora Braham, who made her {{professional}} stage debut in 1870 at the hall in a revival of Gilbert and Clay's Ages Ago, which was revived again there in 1874. [...] Except for a brief stint at the Criterion Theatre in 1874 and at the Savoy Theatre in 1879-80, Holland starred at St. George's until 1895 in entertainments too numerous to name. [...] Many of the entertainments were written by Law, including A Night Surprise (1877), Nobody's Fault, composed by Hamilton Clarke (1882), <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>Happy</b> Bungalow, with music by Charles King Hall.

2500|$|... is {{too hard}} and stony; it must have love-scenes, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending. It is not enough that Cordelia is a daughter, she must shine as a lover too. Tate has put his hook in the {{nostrils}} of this Leviathan, for Garrick and his followers, the showmen of scene, to draw the mighty beast about more easily. A happy ending!—as if the living martyrdom that Lear had gone through,—the flaying of his feelings alive, {{did not make a}} fair dismissal from the stage of life the only decorous thing for him. If he is to live and be happy after, if he could sustain this world's burden after, why all this pudder and preparation,—why torment us with all this unnecessary sympathy? As if the childish pleasure of getting his gilt-robes and sceptre again could tempt him to act over again his misused station,—as if at his years, and with his experience, anything was left but to die.|$|E

I had my first pizza at a joint I recall as Jimmy's, on a corner lost to time a few blocks from home.

2500|$|Hart in 1857 stated:-"The {{quality of}} mind {{which is most}} {{apparent}} in Miss Sedgwick's writings is that of strength. The reader feels at every step {{that he has to}} do with a vigorous and active intellect. Another quality, resulting from this possession of power, is the entire absence of affectation of every kind. There is no straining for effect, no mere verbal prettinesses. The discourse proceeds with the utmost simplicity and directness, as though the author were more intent upon what she is saying than how she says it. As a novelist, Sedgwick has for the most part wisely chosen American subjects. The local traditions, scenery, manners, and costume, being thus entirely familiar, she has had greater freedom in the exercise of the creative faculty, on which, after all, real eminence in the art mainly depends. Her characters are conceived with distinctness, and are minutely individual and consistent, while her plot always shows a mind fertile in resources <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> adaptation of means to ends." ...|$|E
