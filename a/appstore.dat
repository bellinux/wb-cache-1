5000|$|Along with smart phones, <b>appstores</b> have emerged. A user finds {{themselves}} {{facing a}} {{huge range of}} applications. This {{is especially true for}} providers who manage <b>appstores</b> because they are tasked with examining the apps provided, from different points of view (e.g. security, content). The security audit should be particularly cautious, because if a fault is not detected, the application can spread very quickly within a few days, and infect a significant number of devices.|$|R

Examples include Amazon opting for Amazon <b>Appstore</b> instead of Google Play for its Kindle Fire tablet computers, and Samsung adding Galaxy Apps for its line of Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the open}} nature of Android, a number of {{third-party}} application marketplaces also exist for Android, either to provide a substitute for devices that {{are not allowed to}} ship with Google Play Store, provide applications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations, or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included the Amazon <b>Appstore,</b> GetJar, and SlideMe.

Iceland is not available in any map package sold by TomTom at the moment, but they are working on it (and a few other countries too). Also most likely there will be a new iOS app available, based on the NavKit, which might cure the issue with the size limit (also Apple increased the app size limit to 4GB).|$|R
25|$|The Priv is {{the first}} BlackBerry-branded {{smartphone}} that does not run the company's proprietary BlackBerry OS or BlackBerry 10 (BB10) platforms. It instead uses Android, customized with features inspired by those on BlackBerry phones, and security enhancements. With its use of Android—one of two smartphone platforms that significantly impacted BlackBerry's early dominance in the smartphone industry—the company sought to leverage access to the larger ecosystem of software available through the Google Play Store (as opposed to BlackBerry 10 devices, which were limited to native BB10 apps from BlackBerry World and Android apps from the third-party Amazon <b>Appstore</b> running in a compatibility subsystem), in combination with a slide-out physical keyboard and privacy-focused features.|$|E
25|$|Despite Android's popularity, {{including}} an activation rate {{three times that}} of iOS, {{there have been reports}} that Google {{has not been able to}} leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected. The Verge suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services Amazon's Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS, a heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google's proprietary components, and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon <b>Appstore</b> instead of Play Store. In 2014, in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand, Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo on the boot screen.|$|E
25|$|While BlackBerry was {{dominant}} in the early smartphone market, partially due to a large market share within the enterprise and governmental markets, the company had struggled in recent years due to the dominance of Apple Inc. and its iPhone line, and Android devices—primarily by Samsung Electronics. By June 2015, the company's market share in the U.S. consumer market had fallen to 1.2%. Facing a struggling ecosystem for native, third-party software on BlackBerry 10, BlackBerry added a compatibility layer for Android software to the OS, and allowed developers to repackage their Android apps for distribution on BlackBerry World. Later versions added the ability for users to manually install Android app packages. Beginning with the BlackBerry Passport, Amazon <b>Appstore</b> was bundled with BlackBerry 10 to provide an additional source of third-party Android software. BlackBerry CEO John S. Chen hoped that Amazon's own smartphone, the Fire Phone, would bolster {{the adoption of the}} Amazon store and attract more major developers to it, and in turn, BlackBerry's ecosystem. However, the Fire Phone was a commercial failure, which led to BlackBerry's decision to develop an Android phone of its own.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSmartphones {{have become}} an {{important}} component of everyday's life. They store a large amount of users' private and sensitive information like contacts, GPS location, messages and interests. Privacy issues are a growing concern for the phone users. However, despite an existing rich literature in privacy leakage on mobile network measurement, our empirical knowledge of users' private leakage is relatively limited. In this work, we present a large scale and comprehensive investigation spanning over 9 months of users' private information leakage that consisted of monitoring 180 K popular apps coming from 50 + Chinese <b>AppStores.</b> In order to do this, we used a customized platform that can monitor the execution of applications running over Android system to observe in vivo privacy leakage of applications. Our key findings are that: (1) Accessing users' private information is very common among mobile apps, i. e. over 90 % of apps accesses some kind of user private information, and to our surprise, almost 95 % apps claimed access to private information without concretely accessing them (2) We analyzed different category of Apps and observed slight differences in the pattern of access to private information among different categories (3) Downloading apps from big <b>Appstores</b> does not necessarily mean safer and more private apps. We observe that local Chinese shop and Google Play generate similar observations...|$|R
40|$|Smartphones, {{the devices}} we carry {{everywhere}} with us, are being heavily tracked and have undoubtedly {{become a major}} threat to our privacy. As " Tracking the trackers " has become a necessity, various static and dynamic analysis tools have been developed in the past. However, today, we still lack suitable tools to detect, measure and compare the ongoing tracking across mobile OSs. To this end, we propose MobileAppScrutinator, based on a simple yet efficient dynamic analysis approach, that works on both Android and iOS (the two most popular OSs today). To demonstrate the current trend in tracking, we select 140 most representative Apps available on both Android and iOS <b>AppStores</b> and test them with MobileAppScrutinator. In fact, choosing the same set of apps on both Android and iOS also enables us to compare the ongoing tracking on these two OSs. Finally, we also discuss the effectiveness of privacy safeguards available on Android and iOS. We show that neither Android nor iOS privacy safeguards in their present state are completely satisfying...|$|R
40|$|The next {{generation}} of SOA needs to scale for flexible service consumption, beyond organizational boundaries and current B 2 B applications, into communities, eco-systems, and business networks. In the wider and, ultimately, global settings, new capabilities are needed so that business partners can efficiently and reliably enable, adapt, and expose services {{where they can be}} discovered, ordered, consumed, metered, and paid for, through new applications and opportunities, driven by third parties in the global "village". This trend is already underway, in different ways, through various early adopter market segments. For the small medium enterprises segment, Google, Intuit-Microsoft, and others have launched <b>appstores,</b> through which an open-ended array of hosted applications are sourced from the development community and procured as maketplace commondities. In the corporate sector, the marketplace model and business network hubs are being put in place on top of connectivity and network orchestration investments for capitalizing services as tradable assets, seen in banking/finance (e. g. American Express Intelligent Marketplace), logistics (e. g., the E 2 open hub), and the public sector (e. g., UK DirectGov whole-of-government citizen services delivery) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the first population-level, city-scale {{analysis}} of application usage on smartphones. Using deep packet inspection {{at the network}} operator level, we obtained a geo-tagged dataset with more than 6 million unique devices that launched more than 10, 000 unique applications across the city of Shanghai over one week. We develop a technique that leverages transfer learning to predict which applications are most popular and estimate the whole usage distribution based on the Point of Interest (POI) information of that particular location. We demonstrate that our technique has an 83. 0 % hitrate in successfully identifying the top five popular applications, and a 0. 15 RMSE when estimating usage with just 10 % sampled sparse data. It outperforms by about 25. 7 % over the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings {{pave the way for}} predicting which apps are relevant to a user given their current location, and which applications are popular where.

30|$|Overall, {{existing}} {{related works}} {{do not address}} the idea of deploying Pervasive Apps much {{in the same way}} that currently Apps for mobile phones can be downloaded from various <b>AppStores.</b> However, these related works support our efforts. The SENSEI framework shows that there is ongoing effort to the inclusion of physical devices in a unified infrastructure, which also benefits our work. SPINE shows that using mobile device as the main point of a user-centric experience is a valid approach. The opportunity framework shows that a number of machine learning techniques are being developed to support the efficient use of unpredictably available run-time resources for activity recognition. Work in dynamic reprogramming, virtual machines, and task-based streaming data processing led us to select an appropriate abstraction level for the Titan framework, where we avoid the too low-level (and hence slow) binary reprogramming in favor of a higher level representation of activity recognition as a set of interconnected tasks performing functions of signal processing and machine learning. To our knowledge, the introduction of the concept of Pervasive Apps, downloadable to the user's mobile phone and running using the available sensor nodes in the user's PAN, together with the supporting implementation, is a specificity of our work.|$|R
30|$|Our vision with Titan is {{to enable}} Pervasive Apps—activity-aware {{applications}} {{that can easily}} be downloaded from Pervasive <b>Appstores,</b> much like the current trend with software Apps for mobile phones. The additional complexity of Pervasive Apps is that a hardware component is needed; sensor nodes on the body, in objects, and in the environment must all be recruited to support activity and context awareness. In a true pervasive experience, nodes may also provide feedback to the user (e.g., by vibrating on the body when playing a sports game or highlighting objects in the environment). While in our work we used custom sensor nodes based on the commercial TmoteSky motes, in the future, we envision {{that many of these}} nodes are likely to come from manufacturers of components of ambient intelligence environments. The services provided by these nodes will be related to the function of the element of the ambient intelligence environment in which they are integrated. The service-oriented programming model of Titan supports interoperability across various hardware; it hides the underlying implementation and allows interoperability among heterogeneous resources as long as the services are compliant. Thus, the application developer can focus on designing the Pervasive Apps service graph, rather than developing lower level services. This is a further element that may democratize the development of Pervasive Apps.|$|R

2500|$|Several {{games in}} the Humble Indie Bundles have been {{released}} as open-source software {{as a result of}} the Bundles reaching certain sales levels. [...] One such game was Wolfire's own Lugaru HD, where they released the engine under the GNU General Public License, and also included the various art assets, level designs, and other creative elements under a freely redistributable license for personal use. Their intent was to allow programmers to experiment and improve the game's engine using the associated assets. [...] Wolfire later began selling the title Lugaru HD on the Mac App Store for $9.99. A company called iCoder used the open-source resources to recreate the same game for the App Store, charging only $0.99 for their version of Lugaru. iCoder claims they have the right to recreate and charge for the game under the GNU license, but Jeffery Rosen notes that this did not apply to the art assets. Also, the GPL license is not compatible with Apple's <b>AppStore.</b> The iCoder version was taken down from the App Store after about a week since Wolfire notified Apple of the issue, though so far no explanation has been given by Apple. As the iCoder version of the application was popular, being the 60th most downloaded game application prior to its removal, Wolfire offered those who purchased the iCoder version a free copy of their version and codes to unlock the game from within Steam. Rosen notes that the incident may discourage developers from releasing their source in the future.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} Amazon <b>Appstore</b> launch, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) {{published}} {{an open letter}} expressing concerns that were primarily aimed at Amazon's distribution terms.
