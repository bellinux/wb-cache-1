5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's {{head would}} have been shaved after four weeks, with a small tuft of hair left on the crown and {{at the nape of}} the neck; it was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the child {{would have been}} officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors probably would have gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In Vienna Brand {{was given}} a German {{passport}} {{in the name of}} Eugen Band. He cabled the Jewish Agency in Istanbul to say he was on his way, and arrived by German diplomatic plane on 19 May. Paul Rose writes that Brand had no idea <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the deportations to Auschwitz had already begun.|$|E
60|$|Scheherazade, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> seeing <b>that</b> it was day, {{and knowing}} that the Sultan always rose very early to attend the council, stopped speaking.|$|R
6000|$|A {{number of}} {{emphatic}} nods and [...] "waughs" [...] <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> showed <b>that</b> Okematan {{had at last}} touched a key-note with which his braves could shout in harmony.|$|R
5000|$|David Drummond, {{senior vice}} {{president}} for corporate development, said [...] "Pulling out of China, shutting down Google.cn, is just not {{the right thing to do}} <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point...</b> but <b>that's</b> exactly what this proposal would do." ...|$|R
5|$|It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the Non-Intervention Committee {{was created}} to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed {{the need for a}} {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E
5|$|Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa {{first met}} at the 2006 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California, after which they jammed {{together}} at Hughes's studio in Hollywood with the idea to make music together in the future. Bonamassa also worked with Jason Bonham that year, when the drummer performed on the guitarist's fifth studio album You & Me {{on the recommendation of}} producer and mutual friend Kevin Shirley. Hughes and Bonamassa reunited three years later in November 2009, performing together at the House of Blues in Los Angeles for Guitar Center. It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the two decided to form a band. The idea of enlisting Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian to complete the band's lineup was suggested by Shirley, after a second guitarist was briefly considered instead of a keyboardist.|$|E
5|$|In May 1098, Kerbogha of Mosul {{approached}} Antioch {{to relieve}} the siege. Bohemond bribed an Armenian guard named Firouz to surrender his tower, and in June the crusaders entered the city and killed most of the inhabitants. However, {{only a few days}} later the Muslims arrived, laying siege to the former besiegers. According to Raymond D'Aguilers, it was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> a monk named Peter Bartholomew claimed to have discovered the Holy Lance in the city, and although some were skeptical, this was seen as a sign that they would be victorious.|$|E
6000|$|It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> too, <b>that</b> {{the council}} of which we write was held, in order to settle who should have the {{undesirable}} privilege of constituting the [...] "forlorn hope" [...] in their subterranean assault.|$|R
50|$|The story ends <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> without stating <b>that</b> Peter {{caught the}} fish as Jesus predicted.|$|R
50|$|The {{campaign}} concludes <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> Given <b>that</b> {{the players}} will have likely reached {{the attention of}} Rand himself {{by the end of}} the campaign, it falls to the gamemaster to decide what adventures follow through the remainder of the novels.|$|R
5|$|It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{the team}} had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, {{who had worked with}} Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|The War Office and the Army were concluding, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>that</b> light {{tanks were}} a {{liability}} and too vulnerable {{for use in}} further combat, and the Tetrarch {{was considered to be}} obsolete. This decision may have marked the end for the Tetrarch in active service; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It is <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because {{of the need for}} a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of the motte relative to the river at Inverugie suggests it was built to protect the ford <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> and <b>that</b> the bailey ditch (moat) would have been filled with water from the Ugie for additional defence.|$|R

5000|$|Because it is {{so poorly}} known, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> all <b>that</b> {{can be said about}} the habits and life of Stegopelta is that it was a slow quadrupedal {{herbivore}} that fed low to the ground and relied on its armor for defense.|$|R
5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the blast occurred.|$|E
5|$|Transfer {{speculation}} linked Kisnorbo to Wigan Athletic {{at the end}} of the 2005–06 season, but {{he decided}} to extend his stay with Leicester by signing a new three-year contract, less than 12 months after joining the club. Kisnorbo began the 2006–07 season well, scoring two goals and putting in fine rear-guard displays against Coventry City and Southend United, helping the club survive relegation yet again. He was linked with a move to Fulham during the January transfer window. His performance in the 2006–07 season earned him the players' player of the season award from his teammates. It was also <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he became a fan favourite.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{novel of the}} series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (published in America and other {{countries}} as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) opens, {{it is apparent that}} some significant event has taken place in the Wizarding World – an event so very remarkable, even Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> his magical background begins to be revealed.|$|E

30|$|An {{empirical}} {{cross-cultural study}} of this kind would be costly, but social psychology models are advanced enough <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> so <b>that</b> we can examine the issue through computer simulations. In particular, a program called Interact associated with affect control theory can be applied.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Charlotte in her haste--then {{adding that}} she was not quite sure if they had progressed so rapidly as before; blushingly {{correcting}} herself <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> and <b>that,</b> in the tinkering manner of a nervous organization aiming at nicety where it was not required.|$|R
5|$|After {{losing the}} 2004 season opener, the Giants, behind Warner, {{went on to}} win five of their next six games to stand at 5–2. The Giants then lost two close games, to the Bears and Cardinals, to drop to 5–4. It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Coughlin {{announced}} that Eli Manning would become the starter {{for the rest of the}} season. Manning struggled in his first four starts, and the Giants did not score more than 14 points in any game. However, they played better in narrow losses to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals. The Giants won their final game of the year against rival Dallas, to finish the season 6–10. Top performers on the season included Tiki Barber, who established a personal career high in rushing yardage with 1,518yards, and also contributed 52 catches and 15 touchdowns. Following the season Ron Dayne was released. Dayne had experienced several mediocre seasons while Shaun Alexander, who the Giants bypassed to draft Dayne, had developed into a consistent Pro Bowler.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Far more to Mao's liking {{were the}} {{accounts}} of war and banditry found in the Four Great Classical Novels, including Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and Water Margin; while also steeped in Confucian morality, they emphasised the need to fight for justice in society, {{and it is possible}} that these texts inspired his interest in history. According to his later account, it was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he attained a strong belief in justice; he began to divide his lunch in two to share with a poorer boy who could not afford food. On another occasion, he got into a physical fight with an older classmate; this greatly upset his mother, who held pacifist beliefs. According to his later account, at one point he rebelled when the teacher tried to punish him for disobedience; rather than permitting himself to be beaten with a rod, he marched out of the school and into the wooded mountains. He remained there for three days, until being discovered by a family member and brought home.|$|E
60|$|The {{tremendous}} cheer which broke forth <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> showed <b>that</b> {{the conception}} of the movement had widened {{in the minds of}} the people themselves; it was no longer a class movement. It stirred Bradley as if some swift electric wind had blown upon him.|$|R

5000|$|The {{greatest}} acclaim, however, {{came from}} how Gail Simone handled and wrote Diana, {{in comparison to}} previous writers. Dan Philips of IGN reviews: [...] "Far too many writers have wavered randomly between depicting Wonder Woman as a bloodthirsty warrior one minute, a peaceful and compassionate Ambassador the next, and an antiquated and naïve Goddess the next. Simone seems to have struck the perfect balance between the first two and finally put the third to bed, and most importantly, she's molded Diana into a very relatable and sympathetic character. And as any Wonder Woman fan knows all too well <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>that's</b> exactly what the character's been {{in dire need of}} for so long." ...|$|R
5|$|Leo VI died in May 912 and was {{succeeded by}} his brother Alexander (r. 912–913), who reigned for {{little over a year}} before dying in June 913. Leo's empress, Zoe Karbonopsina, and his son and titular co-emperor, Constantine VII (r. 913–959), were sidelined during the reign of Alexander, who also {{restored}} Zoe's old adversary, Nicholas Mystikos, as Patriarch of Constantinople. Thus, at the death of Alexander (6 June 913), with Constantine VII not even eight years old, a power struggle ensued between Zoe and Patriarch Nicholas, who headed the regency council. It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Constantine Doukas launched a rebellion aiming for the throne. The Life of Euthymius hagiography, a source hostile to Patriarch Nicholas, reports that the Patriarch was also involved, although the other Byzantine sources include this as a widespread rumour rather than a fact. According to these sources, unaware that he would be appointed regent (Alexander named him to the regency council on his deathbed), fearful of losing his pre-eminent position, and anxious about the military threat posed by the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, which required a more experienced hand {{at the helm of the}} state, the Patriarch summoned Doukas to assume the throne.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee had {{a three-game}} road trip up next, {{starting}} with the Bulldogs in Athens. Tennessee started the game strong, grabbing the lead, and finished the half on a 13–0 run. However, Georgia came back, cutting the lead down to nine with seven minutes remaining in the game. It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Semeka Randall scored thirteen points, sealing a 96–71 victory. This is the largest margin of victory in the Lady Bulldogs-Lady Vols series. Tennessee had 19 steals in the game, while shooting over 50%, and Holdsclaw and Catchings both scored over 20. The next game, against Kentucky, also had Tennessee making a late first half run, giving them a 19-point lead at the break. This lead was never given up, as the Lady Vols won by twenty-eight. The {{final game of the}} road trip was against DePaul, a good team who was, however, missing their two best players. Without these players, it was not much of a game, as Summitt's team started the game with twenty-one straight points and ended the game with a 125–46 victory, giving the team a 20–0 record. The team's 125 points were the second most {{in the history of the}} program.|$|E
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> all <b>that</b> {{remained}} of the original Caldwell Township was {{a large piece of}} undeveloped land in the northwestern-most part of Essex County; eventually, in the early 1960s, Caldwell Township changed its name to Fairfield in order to avoid being confused with Caldwell Borough.|$|R
5000|$|The Reisner III Papyrus: The Records of a Building Project in the Early Twelfth Dynasty was {{published}} by W. K. Simpson in 1969 for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

60|$|It was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> {{critical}} <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Grummidge came {{in sight}} of the combatants, and ran at full speed to the rescue. But he was still at a considerable distance, and had to cross the tongue of ice before he could reach the floe.|$|R
