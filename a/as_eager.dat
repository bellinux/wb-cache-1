After appearing briefly as Chrissie's one-night stand, Bob Barrett became a main cast member playing locum consultant Sacha Levy. Meanwhile, having made a one off appearance as surgeon Greg Douglas in February 2010, Edward MacLiam joined the cast on a permamanet basis from June 2010. Olga Fedori was promoted to the main cast as Frieda Petrenko, while La Charné Jolly was cast <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> new nurse Elizabeth Tait (Holby City). Actors are given the opportunity to shadow real doctors as preparation for their roles. MacLiam spent time with one of Holby City medical advisors, and observed laparoscopic surgery being performed.|$|E

25|$|Turks {{generally}} support {{parties on}} the left (PvdA, D66, GroenLinks, and SP) over parties on the right (CDA, VVD and SGP). In the past, migrants were not <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> to vote. However, they are now aware that they can become a decisive factor in the Dutch political system. There has been some criticisms that certain parties (such as the Social Democrats) are becoming the parties of migrants because of the votes they receive from migrants {{and the increase in}} the number of elected Turkish candidates. During the Dutch general election (2002), there were fourteen candidates of Turkish origin spread out over six party lists which encouraged fifty-five percent of Turks to vote, which was a much higher turnout than any other ethnic minorities.|$|E

Thus she {{had the opportunity to}} learn Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and many other subjects generally deemed unsuitable for women at the time. Barbauld's penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism; the two were never as close as Barbauld and her father. Yet Barbauld's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter: [...] "I once indeed knew a little girl who was <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall." ...|$|E

Planer praises the recording as [...] "a testament to the artist's ability to deliver the goods , with searing albeit brief interaction with saxophonist Jim Horn" [...] and similarly compliments the playing of Starr and Hopkins. While opining that Material World [...] "suffers from a more anonymous tract" [...] next to All Things Must Pass, Zeth Lundy of PopMatters pairs [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] with [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)" [...] as the album's [...] "most uptempo rock songs", which [...] "fare much better [...] <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> bids for secession from this life, or {{at least from the}} clutches of its material concerns".|$|E

500|$|Dieter Bohn of The Verge {{praised the}} Xbox One S's revised design as being [...] "svelte and good-looking", noting its smaller form factor {{and the lack}} of power brick. The Xbox One S was also praised for being the {{cheapest}} 4K-compatible Blu-ray Disc player on the market, but it was argued that consumers were [...] " [...] <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> to upgrade to 4K Blu-rays as they were to DVDs back in the day. Especially when 4K streaming boxes can be purchased for much less." [...] The lack of HDR-compatible games available on-launch was panned, as well as Microsoft's choice of the standard over Dolby Vision (which was the only HDR standard supported by the reviewer's 4K television). Bohn concluded that the Xbox One S would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its HDR and 4K support, but recommended that existing owners hold off until the release of Xbox One X in 2017.|$|E
500|$|Among Harrison's biographers, Simon Leng views All Things Must Pass as a [...] "paradox of an album": <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> as Harrison was {{to break}} free from his {{identity}} as a Beatle, Leng suggests, many of the songs document the [...] "Kafkaesque chain of events" [...] of life within the band and so added to the [...] "mythologized history" [...] he was looking to escape. Ian Inglis notes 1970's place in an era marking [...] "the new supremacy of the singer-songwriter", through such memorable albums as Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water, Neil Young's After the Gold Rush, Van Morrison's Moondance and Joni Mitchell's Ladies of the Canyon, but {{that none of these}} [...] "possessed the startling impact" [...] of All Things Must Pass. Harrison's triple album, Inglis writes, [...] " [...] elevate 'the third Beatle' into a position that, for a time at least, comfortably eclipsed that of his former bandmates".|$|E
500|$|... "Landcruisin {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

[...] Similarly, Collin Brennan, of Consequence of Sound, said it was [...] "totally worth all the buzz", and Stereogum writer James Rettig dubbed the track: [...] "more than good enough on its own, an enticing and theatrical piece of futuristic pop music". Fact published a review of [...] "Landcruisin, to which five journalists contributed with commentary, and their score out of 10 points. Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy and Tayyab Amin awarded it a rating of 9– the latter deemed it [...] "wonderfully complete", whereas Montesinos-Donaghy stated: [...] " [...] has a Technicolour ambition held within its blog-cycle frame, and Paul sounds <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> as possible to outgrow his frame as soon as possible." [...] Aurora Mitchell of the same publication explained her score of 8 by saying she was [...] "definitely here for it". With respective ratings of 5 and 6, Chris Kelly and Son Raw were more critical of the song– both negatively compared A.K. Paul's artistry to that of Jai, as Kelly called the single [...] "fun but forgettable" [...] and Raw quipped: [...] "this is not the Paul you are looking for, move along."

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger commented {{that he had not}} really liked any of Elaine Stritch's appearances as Jack's mother on the series, writing that [...] "Jack's fear and loathing of his mother just feels claustrophobic and uncomfortable instead of funny, and I'm <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> to see the end of her visits as [...] usually is." [...] Sepinwall said that [...] "very little" [...] of [...] "Christmas Special" [...] worked. [...] "I {{want to be in the}} holiday spirit, but this is two Christmas duds in a row from 30 Rock, and we can't even blame the looming writers strike this time around." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning believed the show could have delivered a Christmas episode, but noted that their attempt at it [...] "was a little less than satisfying. The ideas were there, but the rhythm of the episode was off." [...] Nonetheless, Canning said the episode was not terrible. He enjoyed all the plots except for Liz's, writing that it did not quite fit, and that [...] "the overall result of Liz's plot just wasn't all that funny." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Jeremy Medina for Paste found that there was nothing [...] "special" [...] about this episode. In his opinion, Liz should be featured in [...] "new and exciting plot line" [...] rather than helping Jack endure his troubles with his mother.|$|E
2500|$|David Ardia of the Citizen Media Law Project opined that, [...] "there is {{some good}} news in the opinion for fair use advocates. First, the court {{concluded}} that reference guides such as the Lexicon are transformative in character {{and in order to}} fulfill their purpose they must be able to [...] "make considerable use of the original works... Second, reference works don't lose their transformative nature just because they lack analysis or commentary. The court rejected Rowling's argument that the Lexicon is not transformative because it fails to add these elements... Third, copyright holders cannot exert exclusive control over the market for reference works.

[...] Her claims regarding Cixi’s importance seem to be minted from her own musings, and {{have little to do}} with what we know was actually going in China. I am <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> as anyone to see more attention paid to women of historical significance. But rewriting Cixi as Catherine the Great or Margaret Thatcher is a poor bargain: the gain of an illusory icon at the expense of historical sense." [...] In the New York Times, Orville Schell called the biography “a truly authoritative account of Cixi’s rule,” [...] and the paper named it one of its 'Notable Books of the Year' ...|$|E

In October 1945, the Society organised a [...] "people's congress" [...] on national liberation in Cairo and seven other cities. [...] The Brotherhood and the Wafd were now the two main opposition parties; now that the Wafd was no longer in power, it was just <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> to champion the nationalist cause, and was supported on this issue by the communists. [...] The Brothers therefore found themselves in direct competition with the Wafd for leadership of the nationalist movement. [...] Despite their deep mutual distrust, the two groups joined in the same mass demonstrations on occasion. [...] However, the Brotherhood's refusal to cooperate with communists led to the breakdown of a united front, and to accusations that the Brothers were tools of {{the government and}} of the ruling class. [...] The Society strongly rebutted these charges, and indeed organised strikes of its own; this deeply strained its already poor relations with the government, and the Brotherhood ...|$|E
2500|$|Already on Sunday morning Grandi {{transmitted}} {{an account}} of the meeting to the foreign press representative, but later that day he knew that this had been blocked. [...] Understanding that the new government wanted to let fall into oblivion the Fascist contribution to the fall of Mussolini, Grandi convoked in his office in Montecitorio the ambassadors of Spain and Switzerland, who were <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> as everyone to get first-hand accounts, laying down as his only condition the publication of his account in the press. After the publication of the meeting in the Swiss press on the next day, he met with Duke d'Acquarone, with whom he had a harsh quarrel. Grandi later met the King, Badoglio and the Pope, proposing to be secretly sent to Madrid, where he could meet his old friend Samuel Hoare, British ambassador in Spain. There he hoped to start talks about Italy's surrender. Anyway, the Germans were informed about his visit to Pius XII, and the Gestapo was tracing him. On 31 July he finally met the new foreign minister, Guariglia, but Guariglia showed no hurry to send him to Madrid, so more days were lost.|$|E
2500|$|After Love Never Dies {{opened on}} 9 March 2010 in London, it {{received}} mostly negative critical reviews. Perhaps {{the most positive}} review was Paul Taylor's in The Independent giving the show five stars, and writing, [...] "What is in no doubt is the technical excellence of Jack O'Brien's seamlessly fluent, sumptuous (and sometimes subtle) production, or the splendour of the orchestra which pours forth Lloyd Webber's dark-hued, yearning melodies as if its life depended on them. Special praise {{should go to the}} lyrical lavishness of Bob Crowley and Jon Driscoll's designs, with their gilt interiors where the vegetation-imitating contours and giant peacock-plumage of Art Nouveau run rampant, and their ghostly external locations where a brilliantly deployed combination of flowing projection (timed to perfection with emotional/ rhythmic shifts in the music) and solidly presented stage-effects create a dizzying Coney Island of the mind". In stark contrast, Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave it zero stars, calling the production [...] "a big, gaudy new show. And {{he might as well have}} a [...] "kick me" [...] sign pasted to his backside. ... This poor sap of a show feels <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> to be walloped as a clown in a carnival dunking booth.

2500|$|Korean {{scholars}} have generally regarded Balhae {{as an extension}} of or successor to the Korean Goguryeo kingdom (37 B.C. - 668 A.D.) ever since the publication of Jewang ungi in the 1290s. The 18th century, during the Joseon, was a period in which Korean scholars began a renewed interest in Balhae. The Qing and Joseon dynasties negotiated and demarcated the Sino-Korean border along the Yalu and Tumen rivers in 1712. Jang Ji-yeon (1762–1836), journalist, writer of nationalist tracts, and organizer of nationalist societies, published articles arguing that had Joseon officials considered Balhae as part of their historical territory, they would not have been <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> to [...] "give up" [...] lands north of the rivers. Yu Deuk-gong in his 18th-century work Balhaego, an investigation of Balhae, argued that Balhae should be included as part of Korean history, and that doing so would justify territorial claims on Manchuria. Korean historian Shin Chae-ho, writing about Jiandao in the early 20th century, bemoaned that for centuries, Korean people in their [...] "hearts and eyes considered only the land south of the Yalu River as their home" [...] and that [...] "half of our ancestor Dangun's ancient lands have been lost for over nine hundred years." [...] Sin criticized Kim Busik, author of the Samguk Sagi, for excluding Balhae from his historical work and claiming that Silla had achieved unification of Korea. Inspired by ideas of Social Darwinism, Sin wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|After Gia Định fell to French troops, many {{resistance}} movements {{broke out}} in occupied areas, some led by former court officers, such as Trương Định, some by peasants, such as Nguyễn Trung Trực, who sank the French gunship L'Esperance using guerilla tactics. In the north, most movements were led by former court officers and lasted decades, with Phan Đình Phùng fighting in central Vietnam until 1895. In the northern mountains, former bandit leader Hoàng Hoa Thám fought until 1911. Even the teenage Nguyễn Emperor Hàm Nghi left the Imperial Palace of Huế in 1885 with regent Tôn Thất Thuyết and started the Cần Vương ("Save the King") movement, trying to rally the people to resist the French. He was captured in 1888 and exiled to French Algeria. Guerrillas of the Cần Vương movement murdered around a third of Vietnam's Christian population during the rebellion. Decades later, two more Nguyễn kings, Thành Thái and Duy Tân were also exiled to Africa for having anti-French tendencies. The former was deposed on the pretext of insanity and Duy Tân {{was caught in a}} conspiracy with the mandarin Trần Cao Vân trying to start an uprising. However, lack of modern weapons and equipment prevented these resistance movements from being able to engage the French in open combat. The various anti-French revolts started by mandarins were carried out with the primary goal of restoring the old feudal society. However, by 1900 a new generation of Vietnamese were coming of age who had never lived in precolonial Vietnam. These young activists were <b>as</b> <b>eager</b> as their grandparents to see independence restored, but they realized that returning to the feudal order was not feasible and that modern technology and governmental systems were needed. Having been exposed to Western philosophy, they aimed to establish a republic upon independence, departing from the royalist sentiments of the Cần Vương movements. Some of them set up Vietnamese independence societies in Japan, which many viewed as a model society (i.e. an Asian nation that had modernized, but retained its own culture and institutions).|$|E
