5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the MTA {{proposed}} a rail line connecting LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport. The line would have operated over the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway. There would be stations at Shea Stadium and Jamaica. The system was proposed to cost $2billion. The MTA {{estimated that the}} rail link would take 30minutes from Kennedy to LaGuardia, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> service would initially be every 15minutes. There would be a two-track alignment with one track for each direction, {{as well as at}} least two trains heading in each direction at all times. If the link were built, the average travel time from Manhattan to Kennedy would have been about 45minutes using the Long Island Rail Road, including transfers. To LaGuardia, the average travel time from the Grand Central station using the IRT Flushing Line would be 47minutes.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} little {{opportunity}} to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species {{do not appear to}} compete for food or habitat.

5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast anywhere else in the world. Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright and flashing lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
