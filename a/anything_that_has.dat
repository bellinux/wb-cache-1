5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> evolved afterward.|$|E

The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well - not all particles have rest mass, such as the photon. Matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.|$|E

It attempts to hybridise or meld the nanomachines and nanotechnological cybernetics that are commonly present in the bodies of humans with the biological structure of their tissues at a subcellular level. This results in horrific, uncontrolled, and invariably fatal modifications to the infected body.|$|E

In August 2007 the palace was recognized as a landmark of modern history by the Seven Wonders of Ukraine project. Ukrainian pop singer Sofia Rotaru, who celebrated her 60th birthday at the palace in the company of the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Moldavia – the second such meeting since the Yalta Conference – funded the restoration of Livadia Palace in 2008.|$|E

I was disappointed because I felt that we've only ever seen the caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been written about her in the past.

500|$|Anime News Network's Carlo Santos {{said that}} the series walks [...] "the line between serious sleuth drama and supernatural spell-fest", [...] "balancing all that with the {{occasional}} joke". He said the graphic violence is {{the best part of}} the series, praised the Madhouse animation and described it as [...] "Case Closed with spirit powers". Serdar Yegulalp from About.com said it has [...] "n interesting concept", is [...] "competent enough", and [...] "has a few fun twists", but that apart from the supernatural elements it does not bring <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> not already been done in Case Closed. Writing for Mania.com, Chris Beveridge said the anime operates principally around the two main characters; he said that it is [...] "more interesting to watch how Neuro and Yako operate, to understand methods and personalities, more than the actual event. And that weakens the episode because it never feels like we're really drawn into the mystery itself." [...] Beveridge added it [...] "has some good production values", but criticized Neuro's appearance, [...] "which is bordering on comical" [...] as it makes it difficult for the series [...] "to go a darker route".|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} critic in the Monthly Magazine disparaged the [...] "writhings and twinings" [...] of the painting's subjects, describing them as [...] "as {{close to}} the unpardonable limits as <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> lately appealed to the public eye". This same writer disapproved of the dark skin tones {{of some of the}} figures, arguing that [...] "the brown visage of the [...] gives but a dingy image of the roses and lilies that, from time immemorial, have made the charm of British beauty". The correspondent for The London Magazine felt that although the painting was [...] "in many respects worthy of admiration... is a spirit, a boldness, and a startling effect", the work was poorly executed overall. Its depiction of women drew particular ire: [...] "the expression of the faces is vapid; the features rather homely; the limbs, though not ill-drawn, have not that finish and play of the muscles, which alone give lightness and elasticity. They seem lifted up with difficulty, and ready to fall." [...] The review upbraided Etty as an artist who had [...] "advanced half way on his road to classic excellence; and there, when he should have proceeded with increased ardour and more careful exactness from being in view of his object, he has stopped short." [...] Etty's fellow artist John Constable privately described the work as [...] "a revel rout of Satyrs and lady bums as usual".|$|E
500|$|The Beatles: Rock Band {{was first}} {{revealed}} on 30 October 2008 when Harmonix, MTV Games, and Viacom announced an exclusive agreement with Apple Corps, Ltd. {{to produce the}} standalone title. Prior to this announcement, industry rumours reported that both Harmonix/MTV Games and Activision were vying for The Beatles songs, the latter for the Guitar Hero franchise. The agreement {{was the result of}} 17 months of discussions. John Drake, PR spokesperson for Harmonix, stated that Apple Corps [...] "respected and appreciated what Harmonix does creatively for rhythm games" [...] as part {{of the success of the}} deal. Eversheds, the legal firm working for Apple Corps. for both The Beatles: Rock Band and the abandoned remake of Yellow Submarine by Disney, stated that it took six months to complete the complex agreements and paperwork over the copyrights, trademarks, and publishing issues. Viacom's deal with The Beatles' property owners includes royalties with a guaranteed minimum of $10million and upwards of $40million based on initial sales projections, an amount that chairman Martin Bendier of Sony/ATV Publishing has stated to be [...] "not even comparable to <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been done before". The licensing of the Beatles' work for the game was considered a critical step in the later negotiations and availability of the band's songs on iTunes about a year after the game's release. A further complication arose about a year after the game's release; Chrysalis Group legally challenged EMI over a previous 1965 agreement whereby EMI would pay Chrysalis up to 1.5% of royalties on sales of the Beatles' records, and claimed that they are owned ₤500,000 for the two million units sold of The Beatles: Rock Band. [...] EMI asserts that the video game format would not be covered under the concept of a [...] "record" [...] from the 1965 agreement.|$|E
