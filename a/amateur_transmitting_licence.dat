5000|$|Mitchell {{was born}} in Hammersmith, the son and only child of Horace Richard Mitchell, a civil servant, and his wife Amy Lily Staple. In his youth, his father's job - {{managing}} labour exchanges - meant that he was moved round the country, with the family eventually settling in Reading, where Mitchell joined the Sea Scouts. He joined the Royal Navy during WWII, serving as a Navy radio mechanic posted in the United States and Australia; {{in both of these}} postings he volunteered as a Scout leader. where he remained active in Scouting. Upon returning to England at the end of World War II, he used the radio skills learned during the war to apply for an <b>amateur</b> <b>transmitting</b> <b>licence.</b> In 1961, he married Eileen Phillippa Hawkins, the daughter of a Welsh-born doctor; their only child, daughter Rosemary, {{was born in}} 1967. [...] Mitchell's Scouting work was voluntary; after the War, he had joined the civil service, and he worked for many years at government science research facilities at Winfrith in Dorset and Datchet in Berkshire, managing transport arrangements.|$|E
50|$|PCGGs licence was {{revoked on}} 11 November 1924 due to Idzerdas {{financial}} difficulties, {{and his company}} was declared bankrupt a month later. There {{were a couple of}} later reports that he had resumed broadcasting, but this appears to have been limited to a few experimental transmissions. A 1926 report stated that Netherland Association Idzerda-Radio had received a new PCGG <b>transmitting</b> <b>licence,</b> but there was no additional information about station activites. In 1930, a second report stated that a new authorization, wth the call letters PF1IDZ, had been issued to the Idzerda Radio Works, for experimental transmissions every Saturday night between 11:40 p.m. and 1:40 a.m. on 299 metres (1000 kHz), but again this was at best a very limited effort.|$|R
50|$|In 1924 Ernest Fisk (later Sir Ernest) of AWA - Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) {{suggested}} the introduction the sealed unit system (or, more commonly sealed set or sealed receiver) where radio sets could only receive the transmitting service (or services) {{to which they}} were licensed. Under this model, the Government would issue a <b>licence</b> to <b>transmit</b> on a given wavelength (or frequency in modern terminology) and oversee the manufacture of receivers locked on that wavelength. The owner of the <b>transmitting</b> <b>licence</b> could then charge the receiver's owner a recurrent fee that would be used to run the station. This was seen as preferable to the British situation where the Government backed a monopolistic service (the British Broadcasting Company as it was then) and collected a single licence fee from each household with a receiver. There appears to have been little attention at the time to a third possible model; that of the licensee charging for advertisements, as was done in the United States.|$|R

50|$|At {{commencement}} {{the station}} was owned by the Commonwealth of Australia and under the legislation of the day required no licence. The Postmaster-General's Department maintained the transmission system and the station's studios, while the Australian Broadcasting Commission (subsequently Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1 July 1983) created the programme content to be <b>transmitted.</b> A <b>licence</b> was issued {{for the first time}} in 1992 in accordance with the newly legislated Broadcasting Services Act.|$|R
50|$|The 9600 port {{can be used}} {{to connect}} a digital voice adapter, or dongle, which allows analog <b>amateur</b> radios to <b>transmit</b> and receive ICOM's D-Star digital voice {{protocol}} (AMBE2020).|$|R
50|$|In addition, <b>amateur</b> {{stations}} <b>transmitting</b> in {{the following}} segments must not cause harmful interference to stations in the Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) or the space research service (passive): 275-277 GHz, 294-306 GHz, 316-334 GHz, 342-349 GHz, 363-365 GHz, 371-389 GHz, 416-434 GHz, 442-444 GHz, 496-506 GHz, 546-568 GHz, 624-629 GHz, 634-654 GHz, 659-661 GHz, 684-692 GHz, 730-732 GHz, 851-853 GHz, or 951-956 GHz.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, {{radio control}} link {{frequencies}} must be above 144.5 MHz. 97.201(b) However, {{the base station}} being controlled may operate on any amateur frequency. The FCC says that if a radio link is used, the station where the control commands are performed is an auxiliary station, 97.213(a) and an auxiliary station is [...] "an <b>amateur</b> station <b>transmitting</b> communications point-to-point within a system of cooperating amateur stations" [...] 97.3(a)(7) ...|$|R
5000|$|Isotron is {{the trade}} {{name for a}} shortwave antenna marketed by Bilal Co. for use as an <b>amateur</b> radio <b>transmitting</b> antenna for {{restricted}} spaces. [...] It is physically short as compared to a dipole antenna for a given frequency. It consists of a coil placed between two angled sheet metal plates. The bandwidth of the Isotron is quite narrow as compared with a dipole antenna. This is most pronounced on the lower frequency bands.|$|R
50|$|Seymour FM is a {{regional}} community radio station, operating from {{the centre of}} the Seymour township in North Central Victoria, part of the state of Victoria, Australia. The radio station operates on a Temporary Community Broadcasting <b>Licence,</b> <b>transmitting</b> from studios at the Kings Park complex in Seymour.|$|R
50|$|The Hong Kong <b>Amateur</b> Radio <b>Transmitting</b> Society (HARTS) (in {{traditional}} Chinese, 香港業餘電台聯會) is {{an organization}} representing {{a majority of the}} amateur radio operators in Hong Kong, China. HARTS is a charitable institution recognized by the Inland Revenue Department since early 2008. HARTS was established in the 1930s, when the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong was a dependent territory of the United Kingdom. HARTS is the member society representing Hong Kong in the International Amateur Radio Union.|$|R
5000|$|The Singapore <b>Amateur</b> Radio <b>Transmitting</b> Society (SARTS) is a {{non-profit}} organization for amateur radio enthusiasts in Singapore. The organization's primary mission is to popularize and promote amateur radio in Singapore. SARTS sponsors amateur radio operating awards and operates special event stations on a regular basis. One membership benefit of the organization is a QSL bureau for members who regularly make communications with amateur radio operators in other countries. [...] SARTS is the member society representing Singapore in the International Amateur Radio Union.|$|R
5000|$|Most amateur {{transceivers}} {{are capable}} of transmitting approximately 100 watts, but {{in some parts of}} the world, such as the U.S., <b>amateurs</b> can <b>transmit</b> up to 1,500 watts. QRP enthusiasts contend that this is not always necessary, and doing so wastes power, increases the likelihood of causing interference to nearby televisions, radios, and telephones and, for United States' amateurs, is incompatible with FCC Part 97 rule, which states that one must use [...] "the minimum power necessary to carry out the desired communications".|$|R
2500|$|A trivial form of AM {{which can}} be used for {{transmitting}} binary data is on-off keying, the simplest form of amplitude-shift keying, in which ones and zeros are represented by {{the presence or absence of}} a carrier. On-off keying is likewise used by radio <b>amateurs</b> to <b>transmit</b> Morse code where it is known as continuous wave (CW) operation, even though the transmission is not strictly [...] "continuous." [...] A more complex form of AM, Quadrature amplitude modulation is now more commonly used with digital data, while making more efficient use of the available bandwidth.|$|R
25|$|Demonstrating a {{proficiency}} in Morse code was {{for many years}} a requirement to obtain an <b>amateur</b> license to <b>transmit</b> on frequencies below 30MHz. Following changes in international regulations in 2003, countries are no longer required to demand proficiency. The United States Federal Communications Commission, for example, phased out this requirement for all license classes on 23 February 2007.|$|R
50|$|An amateur {{radio band}} known as 160 meters or 'top-band' is between 1800 and 2000 kHz (allocation depends on country and starts at 1810 kHz outside the Americas). <b>Amateur</b> {{operators}} <b>transmit</b> CW morse code, digital signals and SSB voice signals on this band. Following World Radiocommunication Conference 2012 (WRC-2012), the amateur service received a new allocation between 472 and 479 kHz for narrow band modes and secondary service, after extensive propagation and compatibility studies {{made by the}} ARRL 600 meters Experiment Group and their partners around the world. In recent years, some limited amateur radio operation has also been allowed {{in the region of}} 500 kHz in the US, UK, Germany and Sweden.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{long after}} this {{activity}} began in Canada, amateurs in the US {{became interested in}} packet radio. In 1980, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted authorization for United States <b>amateurs</b> to <b>transmit</b> ASCII codes via amateur radio. Repeaters may be designed for amateur packet radio, these are dubbed [...] "digipeaters". The first known amateur packet radio activity in the US occurred in San Francisco during December 1980, when a packet repeater was put into operation on 2 meters by Hank Magnuski KA6M, and the Pacific Packet Radio Society (PPRS). [...] In keeping with the dominance of DARPA and ARPANET at the time, the nascent amateur packet radio network was dubbed the AMPRNet in DARPA style. Magnuski obtained IP address allocations in the 44.0.0.0 network for amateur radio use worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Radio {{spectrum}} licences {{are generally}} specified {{in terms of}} the power a holder is allowed to <b>transmit.</b> However, if <b>licences</b> become flexible, allowing change of use and technology, then this licensing approach could result in significant interference between users. A new approach is proposed termed "spectrum usage rights" (SURs) which restricts the interference a licence holder is allowed to cause rather than the power they are allowed to transmit. This approach is shown to protect users against interference while providing the maximum flexibility possible and its implementation is discussed.

50|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Radio Act of 1912, most amateur stations were restricted to operating on a wavelength of 200 meters (1500 KHz), which effectively limited their transmitting range to about 25 miles (40 kilometers). In the spring of 1914, Hiram Percy Maxim began promoting the idea of a national organization of <b>amateurs</b> that would <b>transmit</b> messages over greater distances by organizing relays. This resulted in Maxim's incorporation of the American Radio Relay League, with Maxim as president, and Tuska the organization's secretary. At this time Tuska also resigned from the Hartford Radio Club.|$|R
50|$|Folk music, in the {{original}} {{sense of the term}} as coined in the 18th century by Johann Gottfried Herder, is music produced by communal composition and possessing dignity, though by the late 19th century the concept of ‘folk’ had become a synonym for ‘nation’, usually identified as peasants and rural artisans, as in the Merrie England movement and the Irish and Scottish Gaelic Revivals of the 1880s. Folk music was normally shared and performed by the entire community (not by a special class of expert or professional performers, possibly excluding the idea of <b>amateurs),</b> and was <b>transmitted</b> by word of mouth (oral tradition).|$|R
50|$|To send a {{television}} picture in colour across a radio link requires {{at least a}} camera, a transmitter, a receiver, a suitable antenna (aerial) and a monitor (TV). The camera provides the picture and the transmitter sends the picture. The transmitter must produce adequate power at microwave frequencies. The receiver must be sensitive at the frequency in use and decode the vision and sound signals. Things that {{can be added to}} these basic “blocks” are: multiple cameras, vision captions and effects. The expansion of {{a television}} system is almost boundless, a fully equipped ATV studio (and some amateurs do have these) can come later. In the UK all bands from 70 cm upwards are available for ATV. In the 23 cm band and above the standard mode of transmission for ATV is frequency modulation of the vision carrier with a 6 MHz FM audio sub-carrier. The UK ATV calling and talkback frequency is 144.75 MHz FM. Listen or put out a “CQ ATV” call to make initial contact. A licence issued by your national authority is required to operate a television <b>transmitting</b> station, <b>licence</b> conditions will vary in different counties — in the UK this is administered by OFCOM.|$|R
40|$|An {{inventory}} of available {{information on the}} exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields has revealed insufficient knowledge on two items: i. e., 1) if and how exposure to these electromagnetic fields can lead to complaints like headaches, and 2) {{the lack of a}} good-quality overview of all sources in the Netherlands and their contribution to total exposure. The government and other professional stakeholders are responsible {{for the protection of the}} population against possible adverse health effects from exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. There is concern about and ignorance of these fields amongst the Dutch population. Therefore, one needs to know, on the one hand, whether exposure to these fields can actually lead to effects and, on the other hand, whether exposure in reality can be so high that effects can actually occur. The available information on health effects has been collected by the RIVM and analysed for presentation in a recent report. The first part deals with international knowledge on fields and effects, while the second part overviews the situation in the Netherlands for three groups of sources: communication equipment, domestic appliances and consumer articles, and detection equipment. At the moment a European recommendation forms the basis for policy making and regulations in the Netherlands. If the exposure remains below specific levels, particular short-term effects do not occur. These well-understood effects, caused by heating of and induced electric currents in the body, include an increase in body temperature and involuntary muscle contraction. Other effects are those for which it is not clear whether, and if so, how the effects are caused by exposure to radio-frequency fields. Effects claimed by some are, for example, headaches and sleeping disorders. These effects do not always lend themselves for easy and objective establishment. Sleeping disorders are reported for exposures found below the limits in the European recommendation. An overview of the sources is necessary for making good exposure estimates in the Netherlands and for informing the population. In this way, the field strength caused by a single source, but also the field strength caused by multiple sources can be estimated. The field strengths depend mainly on the transmitted power and the distance to the source. It is particularly important to further investigate the situation around AM-broadcasting transmitters and radio amateurs, considering that AM-broadcasting transmitters are capable of transmission at high power levels. Radio <b>amateurs</b> may be <b>transmitting</b> at varying power levels. New sources such as UMTS base stations and equipment transmitting highly pulsed signals should also be further investigated. A licence for use of frequency space is not always required, for example, for applications for wireless communications, such as computers equipped with WiFi transmitters. In general, this equipment transmits at low power levels, but may be located close to the body. Other licence-free transmitters are being used in anti-theft devices and for reading electronic bar codes. Even though these systems are capable of transmitting at high peak power levels, exposure is generally for a short period of time. Het is onbekend of en zo ja hoe blootstelling aan radiofrequente velden tot subjectieve gezondheidseffecten zoals hoofdpijn kan leiden. Ook ontbreekt er een systematisch overzicht van alle bronnen in Nederland en hun bijdragen aan de totale blootstelling. Radiofrequente velden worden bijvoorbeeld veroorzaakt door diverse communicatiezenders zoals gebruikt voor mobiele telefonie en omroep. Er bestaat bezorgdheid onder de bevolking over mogelijke gezondheidseffecten en onbekendheid met dergelijke velden. Het eerste deel van het rapport gaat over wat er internationaal over radiofrequente velden en gezondheidseffecten bekend is. Het tweede deel geeft een overzicht van de Nederlandse situatie voor drie groepen bronnen: communicatie-apparatuur, huishoudelijke apparatuur en gebruiks-artikelen en ten slotte detectie-apparatuur. Als de blootstelling beneden de grenzen in de Europese aanbeveling blijft, dan komen bepaalde kortetermijneffecten niet voor. Het gaat dan om effecten zoals verhoging van de lichaamstemperatuur en het onwillekeurig samentrekken van spieren, die het gevolg zijn van opwarming en in het lichaam opgewekte stromen. Sommige mensen claimen aspecifieke effecten zoals slaapstoornissen en een gevoel van malaise of subjectieve effecten zoals hoofdpijn. Om de blootstelling in te schatten en de bevolking te informeren, is een openbaar overzicht van de locaties en kenmerken van radiofrequente bronnen nodig. Het is aan te bevelen om bronnen die met hoog vermogen kunnen zenden, zoals AM-zenders en apparatuur van zendamateurs, in de gaten te houden. Dat geldt ook voor nieuwe bronnen zoals UMTS-basisstations en WiFi-zenders en bronnen met hoge piekvermogens zoals anti-diefstalpoortjes en elektronische streepjescodelezers. Zenders met sterk gepulste signalen verdienen aandacht vanwege de mogelijkheid dat hier mechanismen een rol spelen die niet met opwarming te maken hebben...|$|R
