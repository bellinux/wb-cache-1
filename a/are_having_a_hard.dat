Among the reasons for this, small towns adjacent to New Glasgow <b>are</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time coping financially on their own due to the declining economy. Also, Pictou County has the most politicians per capita in Canada. With the Government of Nova Scotia having already amalgamated Halifax County, Cape Breton County, and Queens County into regional municipalities, Pictou County residents feel {{it is only a}} matter of time before that concept is introduced in Pictou County. The two most often suggested scenarios involve amalgamating the entire county (six municipalities) into a single regional municipality, or amalgamating the upper East River towns (New Glasgow, Stellarton, Trenton, Westville) into a single larger town. [...] After several months of public backlash a vote was held and the public spoke against amalgamation, effectively killing any possibility of a future merger.|$|E

50|$|Grace and Cohen (2005, 200) {{describe}} cultural relativism as {{the extent}} to which different societies and cultures have different values and ethical standards in the fields of business and organisational life. Those who embrace cultural relativism believe that all beliefs (religious, ethical, aesthetic, and political) are relative to the individual within a culture. Types of relativism include moral (where ethics depend on the social assembly), situational (where right or wrong is dependent on the situation), and cognitive (where truth itself has no objective standard).
