5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> and death.|$|E

Since, because of her independent means, she was not constrained to make her living by selling art, she was free to use exhibitions and her many contacts with artists and collectors to advance appreciation and understanding of works which did not conform to the still-conservative norm of the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of LCA.

Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E

25|$|Grierson was {{an active}} {{supporter}} of the Argentine Freethinkers Association (AALP), which advocated rationalism, anticlericalism, a scientific <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>life,</b> and full equality for women. The AALP sought to join the CNM, but were rejected on account of their anticlerical views. This provoked a new confrontation between Grierson and {{the membership of the}} CNM, upon which she joined the Women’s Socialist Centre. Grierson chaired the First International Feminist Conference of Argentina organized by the Association of University Women during the Argentine Centennial, in 1910. This provoked her departure from the CNM, which, with official support, had organized the rightist First Patriotic Women’s Congress. Grierson articulated her opposition to a turn to the right on the part of Argentine feminists in her 1910 treatise Decadencia del Consejo Nacional de Mujeres de la República Argentina (Degeneration of the Argentine National Women’s Council).|$|E
25|$|In 1903 {{she moved}} to London, where she {{attended}} Queen's College along with her sisters. Mansfield recommenced playing the cello, an occupation that she believed she would take up professionally, but she also began contributing to the college newspaper with such dedication that she eventually became its editor. She was {{particularly interested in the}} works of the French Symbolists and Oscar Wilde, and she was appreciated among her peers for her vivacious and charismatic <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> and work. She met fellow writer Ida Baker (also known as Lesley Moore), a South African, at the college, and they became lifelong friends. Mansfield did not become involved in much political activity when she lived in London. For example, she did not actively support the suffragette movement in the UK (women in New Zealand had gained the right to vote in 1893).|$|E
25|$|Ellis {{was careful}} to state that REBT was {{independent}} of his atheism, noting that many skilled REBT practitioners are religious, including some who are ordained ministers. In his later days, he significantly toned down his opposition to religion. While Ellis maintained his firm atheistic stance, proposing that thoughtful, probabilistic atheism was likely the most emotionally healthy <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>life,</b> he acknowledged and agreed with survey evidence suggesting that belief in a loving God can also be psychologically healthy. Based on this later approach to religion, he reformulated his professional and personal view {{in one of his}} last books The Road to Tolerance, and he also co-authored a book, Counseling and Psychotherapy with Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach, with two religious psychologists, Stevan Lars Nielsen and W. Brad Johnson, describing principles for integrating religious material and beliefs with REBT during treatment of religious clients.|$|E

25|$|The Doctor's {{clothing}} {{has been}} equally distinctive, from the distinguished Edwardian suits of the First Doctor to the Second Doctor's rumpled, clown-like Chaplinesque attire to the dandyish frills and velvet of the Third Doctor's era. The Fourth Doctor's long frock coat, loose fitting trousers, occasionally worn wide-brimmed hat and trailing, multi-striped scarf {{added to his}} somewhat shambolic and bohemian image; the Fifth's Edwardian cricketer's outfit suited his youthful, aristocratic air {{as well as his}} love of the sport (with a stick of celery on the lapel for an eccentric touch, though in The Caves of Androzani it is revealed to turn purple when exposed to gases the Doctor is allergic to); and the Sixth's multicoloured jacket, with its cat-shaped lapel pins, reflected the excesses of 1980s fashion. The Seventh Doctor's outfit – a straw hat, a coat with two scarves, a tie, checked trousers and brogues/wing-tips – was more subdued and suggestive of a showman, reflecting his whimsical <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>life.</b> In later seasons, as his personality grew more mysterious, his jacket, tie and hatband all grew darker.|$|E
25|$|Thomas bowled over 63,000 balls for Northamptonshire, and {{opposing}} batsmen scored {{off of the}} Welsh medium-pacer at {{an average}} of just under two runs an over. It was his control that was a significant feature of the clubs bowling attack following the First World War. Furthermore, his <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> mirrored his approach to cricket; sound, level-headed and a calming influence on some of his more temperamental colleagues. Billeted in Northampton during the war years, Thomas had attracted the attention of groundsman Alf Stockwin when he came to bowl in the nets at Wantage Road. His debut, against the Australian Imperial Forces side in 1919, was not a great success, but Northampton Grammar School took him on as groundsman and coach, giving Northamptonshire the opportunity to keep tabs on him. They decided to take another look and he justified their interest with 9-30 against Yorkshire at Bradford in 1920 with the last seven wickets only costing him six runs, and one lifting ball hit wicketkeeper Walter Buswell in the eye and put him out of the match. Only 'Bumper' Wells' dismissal of Roy Kilner prevented the county's first 'all-ten'.|$|E
