500|$|Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, {{writers of}} Anderson's {{official}} biography, describe Mayne as the film's [...] "saving grace". However, they consider Gray's music overbearing and unsuited {{to the subject}} matter, commenting, [...] "Its innovative combination of booming brass and twangy electric guitar was possibly intended to evoke the contemporary sounds of Stanley Black or John Barry, but fell {{wide of the mark}} on both counts." [...] Crossroads to Crime is summed up as [...] "irredeemably compromised by its prosaic settings, convoluted screenplay and minuscule budget". Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, notes that it is [...] "remembered with dread", describing the [...] "wafer-thin" [...] story is a [...] "tedious affair" [...] before criticising the editing for producing a finished version that is [...] "more than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> around the edges". He suggests that what little attention Crossroads to Crime receives is attributable {{to the fact that the}} Andersons would go on to produce the highly successful Thunderbirds.|$|E
500|$|As {{the show}} progresses, Alex and Ryan's romance evolves into a {{relationship}}. When Alex confesses that her only motive {{to join the}} Academy was {{to find out the}} truth about her father and was about to leave, Ryan makes her realize that she is meant to be an agent. Alex's on-again off-again relationship with Ryan has been described by Chopra as star-crossed. She said [...] "Alex and Ryan are star-crossed lovers. You love them and they fight and have this intense passionate bond. But Alex is also a little self-destructive. She's a solitary person and she's not vulnerable enough, whereas Ryan really is. She's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> around the edges and whatever's happened in the past, she has trust issues. So that leads to issues in their relationship." [...] Fans have dubbed Alex and Ryan [...] "Ralex". On being asked about the possibility of having to choose between Ryan and saving the world, Chopra said [...] "I'm pretty sure she'd pick saving the world, because she's that kind of person." ...|$|E
500|$|Ellie is {{characterized}} as [...] "trong, witty, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> around the edges". Her emotional trauma is accentuated after her encounter with David. Having lost {{many people in}} her life, she suffers from severe monophobia and survivor's guilt. This results in her becoming a very hardened person; she uses violence without hesitation and frequently swears. Ellie also feels worthless, believing her life is a burden, and that her death would be beneficial for others. While she shows initiative, she is not as adept at survival as Joel, being somewhat impulsive and naïve, and unable to swim. Despite this, she displays great physical resilience, emotional strength and complete fearlessness, as demonstrated by her ability to look after both herself and Joel when he is severely injured. She constantly perseveres {{in the face of}} the many often dire situations that her travels put her through. There is a scene where Ellie kisses her friend Riley. After the game was released, Druckmann said that he wrote Ellie as a gay character, though he preferred to leave the subject of her sexuality up to players to decide.|$|E

Ethel seems quite {{convinced}} that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>roughing</b> it will prove beneficial. I might, however, stop out and try farming, which is one reason why you can have my services for nothing for a time. Considering what local wages are, don't you think you're lucky?" ...|$|R

500|$|Roper {{said that}} {{there were a couple of}} puzzles [...] "that seemed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> around the edges and whose {{otherwise}} straightforward solution suffered a bit from imperfect implementation." [...] He also criticized the difficulty of unlocking some of the bonus content, as some requirements are [...] "punishingly hard for most everyone." [...] Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, they are based on [...] "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, [...] "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." [...] Navarro said that at times, the combat is [...] "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," [...] and said that it was [...] "a bit disappointing" [...] that more was not done to the combat system. He criticized the cliffhanger ending and said a few of the bonus challenges [...] "aren't all that great." [...] GameTrailers criticized the invisible walls, stating that [...] "There are places you should be able to go that you simply can't." [...] They also cited inconsistency issues in regards to navigation. Leone said his [...] "only real" [...] disappointment is that he did not feel the game was evolving the series.|$|E
500|$|While playing junior hockey, Hextall's coaches {{advised him}} that he would not reach the NHL if he {{continued}} to move the puck. Not everyone agreed; NHL goaltender Darren Pang described feeling as if [...] "he had just witnessed Superman flying out of a phone booth" [...] when he saw Hextall's puckhandling ability in a minor league game. Former NHL goaltender Johnny Bower, when scouting for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Brandon, remarked that Hextall would at times let in soft goals, and doubted if he would reach the NHL; Hextall retained a tendency to let in occasional weak goals throughout his career. Hextall claims his adventurous style stemmed from his youth, when he played on outdoor ice rinks with a skater's stick, rather than the heftier goaltender's stick. Martin Brodeur modelled his own play on that of Hextall, saying [...] "I love {{the fact that he was}} playing the puck. He was one of the first goalies that came out and played the puck. He was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> for my liking, but it was entertaining. The playing of the puck was the big thing." [...] Hextall's mobility provided extra passing opportunities for his defencemen: when killing a penalty they would frequently pass the puck back to him, relieving some of the pressure on his team. He is described on the Hockey Hall of Fame's Legends of Hockey website as being [...] "perhaps the game's most mobile goalie of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing {{how to get out of}} it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1993, the University of Nevada System Computing Services group {{developed}} Veronica. It {{was created}} {{as a type of}} searching device similar to Archie but for Gopher files. Another Gopher search service, called Jughead, appeared <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later, probably {{for the sole purpose of}} rounding out the comic-strip triumvirate. Jughead is an acronym for Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation and Display, although, like Veronica, it is probably safe to assume that the creator backed into the acronym. Jughead's functionality was pretty much identical to Veronica's, although it appears to be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rougher</b> around the edges.|$|R

2500|$|On April 11, the Queen theme night, Bennett sang [...] "The Show Must Go On". Brian May {{said that}} he loved {{everything}} about Bennett. Jackson told {{her that it was}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> in the beginning and middle, but she worked it out in the end. Abdul told Bennett to keep on rocking. Cowell found it a little weird. Bennett was safe. Cowell revealed on April 14 that Bennett was his personal favorite.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{was also}} an ardent {{supporter}} of drug legalization and became known for his detailed accounts of his own drug use. He was an early supporter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and served on the group's advisory board for over 30 years, until his death. He told an interviewer in 1997 that drugs should be legalized [...] "cross the board. It might be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> on some people for a while, but I think it's {{the only way to}} deal with drugs. Look at Prohibition: all it did was make a lot of criminals rich." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 10, 1755 British and American forces left Fort Cumberland, heading west. [...] On the 16th {{they arrived}} at Little Meadows, where Sir John St. Clair had made a {{temporary}} camp. [...] General Braddock, the overall British commander, was unaccustomed to frontier warfare and so asked Washington for advice, who made preparations to march on Fort Duquesne. [...] While in camp the famous Captain Jack and his forest rangers, men who dressed in leather and cloth and operated as Indians offered their services to Braddock for intelligence and harassing enemy Indians. [...] Braddock detested unconventional warfare and rebuffed their offer. [...] On the 19th of June, Washington and 1,200 troops moved out, accompanied by their Indian allies, towards Fort Duquesne. [...] General Braddock could not abandon the tactics of Europe, making slow progress on their march, only 12 miles in 4 days. [...] As Washington put it, “instead of pushing on with vigor, without regarding <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rough</b> road, they were halting to level every mole hill, and to erect bridges over every brook.” [...] Nine miles from Fort Duquesne, French and Indian forces attacked, eventually defeating the British and mortally wounding Braddock in {{what came to be}} known as the Battle of the Monongahela.|$|E

It was shown that elongation at break of treated AF was not decreased, and break strength was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> increased, first increases and then decreases as the concentration of NaOH solution raising.

It's harmless flirting." [...] Idolator praised the song, stating [...] "Victoria might be perplexed about the awkward sitch with her bestie, but we’re banging our heads to this fist-pumping tune. It’s <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rougher</b> and tougher than Victoria’s last jam, “Beggin’ On Your Knees”. In fact, it reminds us of something Pink might record if she was a lovelorn teen." ...|$|R
6000|$|Seeing no road, {{we took a}} tall hill to {{the left}} of the distant Acropolis for a mark, and steered {{straight}} for it over all obstructions, and over <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>rougher</b> piece of country than exists any where else outside of the State of Nevada, perhaps. Part of the way it was covered with small, loose stones--we trod on six at a time, and they all rolled. Another part of it was dry, loose, newly-ploughed ground. Still another part of it was a long stretch of low grape-vines, which were tanglesome and troublesome, and which we took to be brambles. The Attic Plain, barring the grape-vines, was a barren, desolate, unpoetical waste--I wonder what it was in Greece's Age of Glory, five hundred years before Christ? ...|$|R

He {{belonged to a}} good family, his father being a Magistrate for Monmouthshire; {{but there had been}} no doing anything with young Tom from the very first. At fifteen he ran away from school at Clifton, and with everything belonging to him tied up in a pocket-handkerchief made his way to Bristol Docks. There he shipped as boy on board an American schooner, the Cap'n not pressing for any particulars, being short-handed, and the boy himself not volunteering much. Whether his folks made much of an effort to get him back, or whether they didn't, I can't tell you. Maybe, they thought <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>roughing</b> it would knock some sense into him. Anyhow, the fact remains that for the next seven or eight years, until the sudden death of his father made him a country gentleman, a more or less jolly sailor-man he continued to be. And it was during that period--to be exact, three years after he ran away and four years before he returned--that, as I have said, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he married, after ten days' courtship, Mary Godselle, only daughter of Jean Godselle, saloon keeper of that town." ...|$|R
