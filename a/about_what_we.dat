25|$|It is {{generally}} difficult for any scholar {{to construct a}} portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond {{the basic elements of}} his life. On the other hand, scholars such as N. T. Wright and Luke Timothy Johnson argue that the image of Jesus presented in the gospels is largely accurate, and that dissenting scholars are simply too cautious <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can claim to know about the ancient era.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.|$|E

25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how {{likely it is that}} a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> actually hear is based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E
500|$|Luke Butcher {{noted that}} Ingels taps into metamodern sensibility, {{adopting}} a metamodern attitude; but he [...] "seems to oscillate between modern positions and postmodern ones, a certain out-of-this-worldness and a definite down-to-earthness, naivety and knowingness, idealism and the practical." [...] Sustainable development {{and renewable energy}} are important to Ingels, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "hedonistic sustainability". He has said that [...] "It's not <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> give up to be sustainable, it's <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> get.

500|$|Kemp was a {{voracious}} reader, and {{his political}} beliefs were founded in early readings of Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, Ayn Rand's libertarian novels, such as The Fountainhead, and Friedrich von Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty. He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality, which came from playing football with black teammates: Kemp said, [...] "I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here now, and I am going to yell from the rooftops <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> need to do." [...] Kemp's football colleagues confirmed this influence: John Mackey explained that [...] "the huddle is colorblind." ...|$|E

[...] "We know a lot more <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have to do than he did," [...] Kraft said. [...] "And we know where we're going."

500|$|New York Times {{reviewer}} George Stade {{said that}} Shikasta [...] "forces {{us to think}} <b>about...</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are, how we got that way and where we are going", but complained that the book is filled with [...] "false hopes", and that the fate of humankind relies on [...] "theosophical emanations, cosmic influences, occult powers, spiritual visitations and stellar vibrations". When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing [...] "both indicts and exculpates" [...] them, implying that humanity is bad, {{but it is not}} their fault. While Stade complemented Lessing on the book's satire, and her depictions of Zone 6, which he said [...] "have the eerie beauty of ancient Gnostic texts", he [...] "disapprove" [...] of the novel as a whole, but added, [...] "that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading it".|$|E

500|$|Radiohead {{tried to}} work quickly and spontaneously, {{avoiding}} procrastination and over-analysis. Yorke was forced to write lyrics differently, as {{he did not have}} time to rewrite them in the studio; for some songs, he returned to the method of cutting up words and arranging them randomly he had employed for Kid A and Amnesiac. Greenwood said: [...] "We didn't really have time to be stressed <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did. We got {{to the end of the}} second week before we even heard what we did on the first two days, and didn't even remember recording it or who was playing things.

We're going to be really careful <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do next". Asmussen mentioned the possibility of downloadable content; the game would be shipped with the regular challenge mode, and new challenge modes might be released as downloadable content to maintain the series. In March 2009, it was {{reported that}} Sony was seeking opinions about a collector's edition from PlayStation 3 owners. In October, an Ultimate Edition was unveiled for North America, and an Ultimate Trilogy Edition was announced soon afterwards for a limited European, Australian, and New Zealand release. A Trilogy Edition was announced for Japan, where the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) gave the game an adults-only Z rating after the previous two versions were considered suitable for players 17 and older.|$|E
500|$|Mother Night, {{published}} in 1961, received little {{attention at the}} time of its publication. Howard W. Campbell Jr., Vonnegut's protagonist, is an American who goes to Nazi Germany during the war as a double agent for the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, and rises to the regime's highest ranks as a radio propagandist. After the war, the spy agency refuses to clear his name and he is eventually imprisoned by the Israelis in the same cell block as Adolf Eichmann, and later commits suicide. Vonnegut wrote in a foreword to a later edition, [...] "we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> pretend to be". Literary critic Lawrence Berkove considered the novel, like Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, to illustrate the tendency for [...] "impersonators to get carried away by their impersonations, to become what they impersonate and therefore to live in a world of illusion".|$|E

500|$|Ned Block {{proposed}} {{a distinction between}} two types of consciousness that he called phenomenal (P-consciousness) and access (A-consciousness). [...] P-consciousness, according to Block, is simply raw experience: [...] it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies' and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called qualia. [...] A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we perceive, information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> perceive is access conscious; when we introspect, information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we remember, information about the past is access conscious, and so on. [...] Although some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have disputed the validity of this distinction, others have broadly accepted it. [...] David Chalmers has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging: [...] he calls this the hard problem of consciousness.|$|E
500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are doing. I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E
500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We {{tend to focus on}} what we can control and not worry <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had a pretty good idea we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator.
