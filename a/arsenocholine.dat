40|$|Several biologically {{important}} {{arsenic compounds}} including methylarsonate, trimethylarsine oxide, tetramethylarsonium ion, arsenobetaine and <b>arsenocholine</b> were prepared, in good yields, from sodium arsenite, or dimethylarsinic acid.

Arsenobetaine, <b>arsenocholine</b> and tetramethylarsonium ion were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line detection by thermochemical hydride generation (THG) -AAS. The analytes were eluted from the cyanopropyl bonded phase HPLC column with a 1 % acetic acid methanolic mobile phase which also contained diethyl ether triethylamine, and trimethylsulfonium iodide or picrylsulfonic acid. A surface response methodology and a univariate optimization procedure were used to determine the optimum concentration of solvent modifiers in the methanolic mobile phase. Limits of detection in the range 4 - 5 ng (as As) were obtained for the arsonium analytes under optimum chromatographic conditions. A simple phenol extraction procedure was developed to isolate arsonium analytes from edible marine tissues (lobster tail muscle, peeled and deveined shrimp, and cod fillet), cod liver oil and human urine. The crude extracts were separated on the cyanopropyl column using a methanolic mobile phase and detected on-line by THG-AAS.

An improved HPLC-AAS interface which was compatible with either aqueous or organic mobile phases was also developed. The interface provided approximately equivalent responses to different arsenic oxidation states which resulted in low to subnanogram chromatographic limits of detection for arsenic oxyanions and arsonium cations in an aqueous or methanolic mobile phase. Nascent As anions and As cations were conveniently coextracted from aqueous solution or from fish muscle by phenol extraction and quantified in the same chromatographic run.

40|$|Co-elution of {{cationic}} methylated arsenic, e. g. arsenobetaine {{may interfere}} with the determination of arsenite on the Hamilton PRP-X 100 anion-exchange column using a phosphate buffer isocratically. Therefore, a sample pre-treatment method with self-packed AG MP- 50 cation-exchange cartridges was proposed, which enables the arsenite determination in samples containing arsenobetaine on a PRP-X 100 column using a phosphate buffer (pH 5. 6) isocratically. Methylated arsenic, including dimethylarsinic acid, trimethylarsine oxide, tetramethylarsonium ion, arsenobetaine and <b>arsenocholine,</b> with concentrations below 1000 μg As L− 1, may be completely retained in the AG MP- 50 cartridge without any changes of arsenite, arsenate and monomethylarsonic acid speciation.

40|$|The {{toxicological}} effects {{and the environmental}} behaviour of arsenic are tightly linked to the chemical form in which this element appears. The inorganic species, arsenite and arsenate are more toxic than the simple methylated forms monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid; the more complex compounds like arsenobetaine, <b>arsenocholine,</b> tetramethylarsonium ion and arsenosugars are, however, considered non-toxic for living organisms. The determination of the total arsenic content in a sample therefore {{turn out to be}} not very adequate for evaluating its impact upon the organisms. The quantification of the different species can, however, provide information about the toxicological risk and about the transformations and the metabolism of arsenic in the environment. The cycle of arsenic in the marine environment is complex and many aspects regarding the processes of accumulation and biotransformation are not yet fully known and require further investigation. To this end, {{it is important to be}} able to make use of methodologies of analysis which permit the identification and quantification of the different species of arsenic in the various environmental matrixes. This research forms part of a study concerning the characterisation of As pollution in the Venice lagoon, in relation to the metabolic processes which occur in the lagoon itself. The preliminary results are reported regarding the development of an arsenic speciation procedure in biological matrices and its subsequent application to samples of bivalve molluscs (Mytilus galloprovincialis). Mytilus galloprovincialis collected from the Venice lagoon (Italy) were investigated for total arsenic concentrations by ICP-MS, ICP-AES, AAS and for arsenic compounds by HPLC-ICP-MS. For this purpose, analytical procedures for the sensitive and efficient speciation of the arsenic species As(III), As(V), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenobetaine and <b>arsenocholine</b> were optimised.

The inorganic species were isolated from the matrix by microwave-assisted distillation and determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS). The microwave and chemical parameters were optimized {{in order to obtain}} quantitative inorganic arsenic recoveries. The analytical features of the method are as follows: detection limit 10 ng g(- 1) (dry mass) or 2 ng g(- 1) (fresh mass); precision (RSD) 4 %; recoveries 106 +/- 3 % for As(iii) and 113 +/- 4 % for As(v). Under the optimized conditions, arsenobetaine, <b>arsenocholine</b> and tetramethylarsonium ion added to samples of seafood were not distilled; however, minor species were distilled and were detected in various percentages: 109 % monomethylarsonic acid; 11 % dimethylarsinic acid; 0. 2 % trimethylarsine oxide. The concentrations expressed as arsenic contributed by these species would imply a mean overestimate of inorganic arsenic of about 24 ng g(- 1) dry mass (dm). The concentrations of inorganic arsenic found in natural seafood samples ranged between 0. 053 and 1. 145 mu g g(- 1) (dm) (mean moisture content 78 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Interpretation of urinary arsenic {{measurements}} {{is sometimes}} {{difficult because of}} the absorption of seafood that contains trimethylated arsenic forms (arsenobetaine and <b>arsenocholine).</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a rapid and robust technique for the measurement of the sum of inorganic arsenic metabolites. METHODS: Measurement of arsenic was performed in urine after hydride generation in acid medium. Using atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) as the detection system, we developed a rapid (one determination in less than 2 min) technique using 50 microl urine without pre-treatment. Standardisation was done externally with a mixed standard solution containing inorganic trivalent arsenic (As(i) (III)), inorganic pentavalent arsenic (As(i) (V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) (15 / 15 / 12. 5 / 57. 5). RESULTS: Samples distributed in the frame of an international comparison programme were used to assess accuracy of the AFS procedure, which gives a linear response up to 50 microg/l and proves more precise [coefficient of variation (CV) < 4 % at 5 microg/l] and sensitive than the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) technique using a quartz cell. An additional adaptation that allows the detection of non-directly reducible arsenic forms has also been validated for samples with high arsenic concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the superiority of AFS over atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) in arsenic determination and the interest of online mineralisation prior AFS detection for the determination of arsenic concentration in urine...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{speciation}} in foodstuffs is of uttermost importance {{since it}} is nowadays recognized that both toxicity and bioavailability of an element depend on the chemical form in which the element is present. Regarding arsenic, inorganic species are classified as carcinogenic while organic arsenic, such as arsenobetaine (AsB) or <b>arsenocholine</b> (AsC), is considered less toxic or even non-toxic. Fish samples, from 3 different species (gilthead sea bream, meagre and salmon), were subjected to three different cooking methods: boiling, grilling and roasting. Arsenic content was determined on both raw and cooked samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Speciation {{studies were carried out}} by coupling a High Performance Liquid Chromatographer (HPLC) to an ICP-MS. To guaranty the quality of results samples were analyzed in duplicates and a reference material was used for total concentration determination and for speciation studies complying with metrological requirements. The obtained results for total arsenic were between 265 µg. kg- 1 and 7585 µg. kg- 1. The lowest value was observed in the samples from boiled meagre and the highest in grilled gilthead sea bream. The speciation studies revealed that, even though fish samples presented a high content of arsenic, more than 90 % of the arsenic present was in the form of arsenobetaine. Apparently, the culinary treatment does not enhance the interconversion of species. FCT PTDC/SAU-ESA/ 103825 / 2008 e ORQUE SUDOE Ref. SOE 3 /P 2 /F 59...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic is a known {{environmental}} toxicant and {{it occurs}} in the environment from natural and anthropogenic sources. Arsenic {{is one of the}} important environmental issues because of its occurrence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and trophic transfer in the freshwater food chain. Aquatic organisms accumulate, retain, and transform arsenic when exposed to it through water, their diet, and other routes. Since arsenic toxicity mostly depends on its chemical forms, measurement of arsenic speciation in aquatic organisms is particularly important in assessing the ecological risks of the element. Arsenate (As(V)) comprises the major part of total arsenic in oxic waters. Phytoplankton take up As(V) and subsequently convert it to arsenite (As(III)) and then to less toxic dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA), and higher order organoarsenicals. Phytoplankton are thought to convert inorganic arsenic species to methylarsenicals and to other organoarsenic compounds (lipids and arsenosugars) to reduce the toxic effects of inorganic arsenicals. Since phytoplankton are a major food source for the organisms of higher trophic levels in the aquatic systems, arsenic is biotransferred from lower to higher trophic levels; while biomagnification of the element in aquatic food chain is not consistent. Other important arsenic forms found in aquatic organisms include <b>arsenocholine</b> (AsC), arsenobetaine (AsB) and arsenosugars (AsS). This review discusses the bioaccumulation, biotransformation, and trophic transfer (biomagnification or diminution) of arsenic in the aquatic food chains in relation to its ecotoxicological risks in the freshwater environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{selective}} quantitative determination of inorganic arsenic [As(III) + As(v) ] in seafood was developed. In {{order to do}} so, various procedures for the solubilization and extraction of inorganic arsenic quoted in the literature were tested. None provided satisfactory recoveries for As(III) and As(v) in real samples. Consequently, a methodology was developed which included solubilization with HCl and subsequent extraction with chloroform. The arsenic was solubilized in 9 mol 1 (- 1) hydrochloric acid. After reduction by hydrobromic acid and hydrazine sulfate, the inorganic arsenic was extracted into chloroform, back-extracted into 1 mol 1 (- 1) HCl, dry-ashed, and quantified by hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-AAS). The analytical features of the method are as follows: detection limit, 3. 07 ng g(- 1) As (fresh mass); precision (RSD), 4. 0 %; recovery, As(III) 99 %, As(v) 96 %. In the optimized conditions, other arsenic species-dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenobetaine (AB), <b>arsenocholine</b> (AC) and tetramethylarsonium-ion (TMA(+)) -were not co-extracted. However, different percentages of minor species were extracted with chloroform: monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) 100 %, and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO) 3 - 10 %. Real samples and reference materials of seafood (DORM- 1, DORM- 2, TORT- 2, CRM- 278 and SRM- 1566 a) were analyzed. The analysis of DORM- 1 provided an inorganic arsenic value of 124 +/- 4 ng g(- 1) As, dry mass (dm), which {{is very close to}} the value obtained by other authors using high performance liquid chromatography -inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) and ionic chromatography-hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (IC-HG -AAS) ...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{capillary}} electrophoresis (CE) coupled with {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) system was developed for the simultaneous determination of ten arsenic compounds including arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, arsenobetaine, <b>arsenocholine,</b> 3 -nitro- 4 -hydroxyphenylarsonic acid, o-Arsanilic acid, p-ureidophenylarsonic acid, and 4 -nitrophenylarsonic acid. The CE-ICP-MS system was hyphenated by a novel and high efficient interface which was directly used as the nebulizer. The separation was achieved on a 100 cm length x 50 mu m ID fused-silic{{a capillary}}. Analytical conditions such as electrophoretic buffer composition, concentration and pH value, separation voltage, methanol concentration in the sheath flow liquid and sample injection time were optimized. Baseline separation of the ten arsenic species was achieved using an electrophoretic buffer consisting of 12 mM NaH 2 PO 4 and 8 mM HBO 3 at pH 9. 20 with an applied voltage of + 30 kV. The detection limits of the ten arsenic compounds ranged from 0. 9 to 3. 0 ng As g(- 1), corresponding to absolute detection limits {{in the range of}} 19 - 65 fg As and the relative standard deviations (RSD, n = 5) were below 1. 5 %, 5. 7 % and 4. 8 % for migration time, peak height and peak area, respectively. This method was successfully applied to determine various arsenicals in two certified reference materials (TORT- 2 and DORM- 3) and environmental samples such as ground water samples, herbal plants and chicken meat.

40|$|The {{relatively}} {{high concentrations of}} arsenic found in shellfish {{in recent years have}} contributed to raise the threshold of attention of European Union, in terms of food security. Among the various factors that influence the toxicity of arsenic, the chemical form is of particular significance, given the high toxicity of the inorganic form in respect of the organic that frequently contaminates fishery products. The Expert Committee of FAO / WHO defined a provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 15 mg/kg b. w. only for the inorganic form and, in view of definition of residual limits for arsenic in fish, it becomes necessary to have analytical methods able to differentiate inorganic form from the organic ones (e. g. monomethyland dimethylarsenic acid, arsenobetaine, <b>arsenocholine).</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to optimize and validate an analytical method for the speciation of arsenic in fishery products, that could identify and quantify the organic forms of arsenic. Screening of organic forms of arsenic was carried out using HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) coupled to a tandem mass spectrometry detector, while determination of total arsenic was carried out using the atomic absorption spectroscopy. The validation procedure was conducted according to the requirements of the European Community to allow the use of the present method by the Official Control laboratories. The matrices considered for method optimization and validation have been fish, molluscs and crustaceans from the coasts of southern Italy.

The {{assessment}} {{of environmental issues}} is generally performed {{by the use of}} bioindicators that provide the biological response to contaminants. Mammals and invertebrates have been frequently proposed for this aim, and the study of conventional biomarkers supplied a deeper knowledge about the toxicological mechanisms. The great number of substances and metabolites involved in these complex mechanisms has driven the use of omics, which are the new tool to evaluate the global biological response to contamination. Metallomics is the most recent omic focused in the study of metal-binding biomolecules using instrumental couplings, generally based on the use of SEC-ICP-MS and organic mass spectrometry. In the present study we apply this approach to compare the biological response of Scrobicularia plana collected from polluted and non-polluted areas from the south-west of Spain and Portugal. Digestive gland of the clam was extracted to obtain the cytosolic fraction and the chromatographic profiles of the extracts reveal the presence of low molecular mass Cu and Zn molecules about 300 Da that can be related to the Cu- and Zn-glutathiones and As metabolites such as arsenobetaine and <b>arsenocholine.</b> The up-regulation of Cu-biomolecules is higher in Cadiz area against Portugal zone while Zn-biomolecules present an opposite behaviour. In several samples has been observed the presence of a remarkable Cu-peak with molecular mass of about 67 kDa.

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{forms of}} arsenic (arsenic species) which {{are present in}} the environment vary significantly with respect to toxicity, bioavailability, stability and transport behaviour. Therefore, it is necessary for an assessment of the toxic potential to humans and the environment to investigate not only the total arsenic concentrations but also to differentiate the single species. By that the knowledge about ecological correlations and pathways will be increased. The present thesis reports the results of a Ph. D. study on the development and optimisation of analytical methods for arsenic speciation and their application to biological samples from different aquatic ecosystems in Germany. The method development included separation of 12 naturally occurring arsenic species by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by an arsenic selective detection by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The arsenic species As (III), As (V), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenobetaine (AB), <b>arsenocholine</b> (AC), trimethylarsine oxid (TMAO) and tetramethylarsonium (Tetra) were separated with ion-exchange chromatography, whereas reversed-phase chromatography was used for the separation of four arsenosugars. Because of the partly low arsenic concentration in biological samples a very good detection power was required. Therefore, an HPLC-ICP-MS system was tested with different nebulizers. Using the high efficiency nebulizer HHPN (Hydraulic High Pressure Nebulizer), detection limits in the low pg-range could be achieved. The developed analytical methods were applied to arsenic speciation in four marine matrices, which are representative of different trophic levels in the food chain.
