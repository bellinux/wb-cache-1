However, cost estimates may be biased due to survey nonresponse and questionnaire framing effects. This paper investigates {{the impact of}} both aspects on the estimated cost burden. I do not find significant evidence for a non-response bias. By contrast, my results indicate that framing effects regarding the temporal dimension of cost measurement (temporal framing effects) might alter cost estimates by up to 68 percent downwards (respectively 211 percent upwards). There is also evidence that temporal framing effects are more relevant for small self-employed businesses with limited information capacities and <b>accounting</b> <b>obligations</b> {{as well as for}} internal cost burdens...|$|E
40|$|Sen and Nussbaum {{generate}} {{very different}} degrees of obligation for the affluent under their theories of justice, despite each of them deriving their theory of justice from capability as a metric for quality of life. On one hand, Sen’s <b>account</b> of <b>obligation</b> seems very weak, while Nussbaum’s seems overwhelmingly robust. I argue that the sufficient/decisivereasons framework as put forth by philosopher Derek Parfit captures the nuances of their extremely different <b>accounts</b> of <b>obligation.</b> Further, I argue that this framework convincingly demonstrates that the <b>accounts</b> of <b>obligation</b> that Sen and Nussbaum offer in each of their versions of the capability approach are unsatisfying, as each approach occupies such extremes that they are unreasonable. In spite of this, supplementing the capability approach with a different and perhaps more centrist <b>account</b> of <b>obligation</b> can make the capability approach a more consistent and appealing theory of justice.

40|$|In this article, we analyze {{regulatory}} {{competition in}} company {{law in the}} European Union (EU). By examining the empirical evidence, we conclude that regulatory competition, which is triggered by legal arbitrage and the competitive pressure exerted by national lawmakers, has run out of steam in the EU. Unlike in the United States, both language barriers and double <b>accounting</b> <b>obligations</b> for branches have hampered entrepreneurs from engaging in legal arbitrage. As a result, a necessary precondition for horizontal regulatory competition is absent. Furthermore, vertical regulatory competition {{is not on the}} agenda of national legislators, as the Statute for a European Company is largely based on national company laws. Revising the national company law therefore improves the supranational competitor as well and destroys the incentives for national legislators to engage in vertical regulatory competition...|$|E

The land use sector comprises land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) as well as agriculture, jointly referred to as agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU).

One of the most promising datasets to meet LULUCF reporting obligations is the “Integrated Administration and Control System” (IACS) that has been set up by all member states to manage the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy, and its GIS, “the Land Parcel Identification System” (LPIS). The data the LPIS holds are geo-referenced polygons of land parcels (units of management or production), and information on the type of land cover, as a minimum in terms of broad categories such as arable land, grassland, permanent crops, and broad families of crops, with their area (eligible hectares). The LPIS is a pan-EU database that provides very detailed and accurate information on the status of agricultural land cover at any given time since 2005. The potential of the LPIS to efficiently track land use changes is derived from its pan-European semantic definition of agricultural land cover types, and the mandatory adequate update cycle of the dataset. This study assessed other potential datasets, including Eurostat “Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey” (LUCAS); the Farm Structure Surveys (FSS); the Farm Accountancy Data Network; CORINE Land Cover.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the liability hedging characteristics of both {{direct and indirect}} real estate {{with the advent of}} fair value <b>accounting</b> <b>obligations</b> for pension funds. We explicitly model pension obligations as being subject to interest and inflation risk to analyze the ability of real estate investments in hedging the fair value of pension liabilities and to quantify its role in an asset liability management (ALM) portfolio. We find that the portfolio composition differs depending on the definition of liability return. When liability returns solely follow actuarial changes, the mean-variance efficient portfolio allocations toward direct real estate and fixed income decrease compared to the asset‐only optimization. When accounting for nominal liability obligations, real estate offers hedging benefits against interest rates for short holding periods but not for long‐term institutional portfolios. The inclusion of inflation risk renders a limited role for direct real estate in an ALM portfolio, while indirect real estate obtains no allocation. Inflation {{is at the heart of}} the discrepancy between reported and predicted pension plan allocations. Once accounting for inflation, the projected allocations come close to reported ones. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{contrasts}} {{the emergence}} of two specific incorporated structures for non-profit organizations which came into being {{more than a century}} apart. We compare the ability for charities to form as “incorporated societies” under the New Zealand Incorporated Societies Act 1908 (effective from 1909), and to form as “charitable incorporated organizations” (CIOs), which were enacted in England and Wales under the Charities Act 2006 (effective from 2013). The article emphasizes the need for charitable non-profit organizations to incorporate for effective operation. This issue is rarely discussed, but the chosen legal form brings specific financial <b>accounting</b> <b>obligations,</b> affecting organizations’ accountability to third parties. Taking a comparative international history approach and drawing on a range of sources, we explore the socio-legal processes which led to the relevant legislation in each country. In particular, this diffusion study investigates why a specific corporate form for charitable non-profit organizations came into effect more than 100 years later in England as compared to New Zealand, with “place” emerging as the most significant comparative dimension...|$|E
40|$|State-owned {{enterprises}} (SOEs) {{are legally}} private entities {{used in many}} jurisdictions to satisfy public needs, mostly through extensive consumption of public funds. While the nature of purposes pursued and of resources employed affects their accountability in a public sense, their financial reporting requirements are set {{on the basis of}} their legal form and this may end up generating a misalignment between accountability and reporting. Such a misalignment significantly impairs the effectiveness of financial reporting and limits the relevant public authorities’ ability to control. The case of Italian SOEs is a fine example. These were created as incorporated entities fully or partially owned by local governments willing to dislocate the production of public services, especially utilities. Such companies have benefitted, thanks to the chosen legal form, from a private style financial reporting model that has significantly eased the controls normally existing on public administrations, and which has favoured massive misuse of public funds and largely illegal management conducts. This paper advocates for significant amendments to the financial reporting model they inherit from the legal form, in order to realign their private-style <b>accounting</b> <b>obligations</b> with their public-style accountability...|$|E
40|$|The {{boundaries}} between accounting and law are contingent on time-space intersections. Here, these margins are explored {{in the realm}} of international relations by focusing on the Asiento, an 18 th century treaty granting Britain the monopoly to trade slaves with the Spanish American colonies. Although a relatively minor concern of treaty-makers, noncompliance with provisions of the Asiento by the South Sea Company placed accounting centre stage in conflicts between Britain and Spain. In combination with geo-strategic and domestic political circumstances, reporting failures exacerbated the commercial dispute between the two nations which culminated in war in 1739. The accounting provisions of the Asiento are examined by drawing on managerialist and realist theories of treaty compliance. It is shown that British noncompliance with <b>accounting</b> <b>obligations</b> under the treaty was driven by realist self-interest and the maximisation of material gain. Given that such motivations dominated behaviour attempts to manage noncompliance through the routine processes and structures of international politics proved unsuccessful. Managerial devices such as diplomatic exchanges over treaty ambiguity and securing greater informational transparency merely provided further opportunities for the pursuit of self-interest. It is suggested that divergent perceptions of the role of accounting in international relations stem from the unique political, legal, social and cultural configurations of nation states. The study highlights the limitations of accounting as an instrument of treaty verification. Its effectiveness in that capacity is diminished where there is no shared understanding of the significance, purpose, content and interpretation of accounting information. ...|$|E
