5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line was connected to the old Rodeløkka Line with <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>triangular</b> banner {{appearing}} to depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|An {{airport at}} Lakselv was first {{proposed}} out of military considerations. Despite a Norwegian neutrality policy, {{there was a}} fear that Norway could be occupied by foreign powers {{to take advantage of}} the country's strategic position. The military therefore wanted to construct airfields throughout the country to increase the air force's mobility. Especially Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the Kola Peninsula. Increased military funding was granted from 1937, and the following year, <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> runway was built at Banak.|$|E

50|$|The LU {{decomposition}} {{is basically}} a modified form of Gaussian elimination. We transform the matrix A into <b>an</b> upper <b>triangular</b> matrix U by eliminating the entries below the main diagonal. The Doolittle algorithm does the elimination column by column starting from the left, by multiplying A to the left with atomic lower triangular matrices. It results in <b>a</b> unit lower <b>triangular</b> matrix and <b>an</b> upper <b>triangular</b> matrix. The Crout algorithm is slightly different and constructs <b>a</b> lower <b>triangular</b> matrix and <b>a</b> unit upper <b>triangular</b> matrix.|$|R
5|$|Finally {{the project}} moved to Columbia Point, near the University of Massachusetts Boston. The new site {{was less than}} ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's {{architectural}} team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> tower and a circular walkway.|$|E
5|$|In {{each corner}} of the chapel is <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> pendentive filling {{the space between the}} walls and the arch of the vault and forming the {{spandrel}} above the windows nearest the corners. On these curving shapes Michelangelo has painted four scenes from Biblical stories that are associated with the salvation of Israel by four great male and female heroes of the Jews: Moses, Esther, David and Judith.|$|E
5|$|The Light Aircraft Trials {{included}} a speed section over <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> course of Lympne-Postling-Brabourne-Lympne.

5|$|The land {{on which}} Zion Square and the Downtown Triangle lies was {{purchased}} by the Jewish Colonization Association from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which began selling off some of its holdings in Jerusalem after World War I. Mandate officials developed the field into <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> district bordered by Jaffa Road, Ben Yehuda Street (constructed by the British in 1922) and King George Street (constructed by the British in 1924). Zion Square was also designed by the British as a roundabout.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} at the {{anterior}} end, and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.|$|E
5|$|The present château, {{designed}} on <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> plan, {{has five}} conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung in the master bedroom, were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.|$|E
5000|$|All {{these results}} hold if [...] "upper triangular" [...] is {{replaced}} by [...] "lower triangular" [...] throughout; in particular the lower triangular matrices also form a Lie algebra. However, operations mixing upper and lower triangular matrices do not in general produce triangular matrices. For instance, the sum of an upper and <b>a</b> lower <b>triangular</b> matrix can be any matrix; the product of <b>a</b> lower <b>triangular</b> with <b>an</b> upper <b>triangular</b> matrix is not necessarily triangular either.|$|R

In 2003, Pod was included in a walking tour by the Americans for the Arts Public Art Conference. It was cleaned and underwent maintenance for approximately two weeks in August 2010. Dual Pendulum (2000), Beeman's kinetic prototype of Pod, was installed at Oregon State University for Da Vinci Days in 2007.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} were further magnified in late 2006, when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs {{in the first}} two matches of <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> ODI tournament in Malaysia. Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies, Pathan was dropped {{for the rest of the}} tournament. He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
40|$|Most {{efficient}} algorithms for rotating 2 D {{images are}} based on the succession of three translations, following the lines, then the columns and the lines of the image again (LCL). These translations result from the decomposition of the rotation matrix into a product of <b>an</b> upper <b>triangular</b> matrix, <b>a</b> lower <b>triangular</b> matrix and <b>an</b> upper <b>triangular</b> matrix (ULU). We have shown in this paper that the decomposition of the rotation matrix is not unique and have separated it into a product of <b>a</b> lower <b>triangular</b> matrix, <b>an</b> upper <b>triangular</b> matrix and <b>a</b> lower <b>triangular</b> matrix (LUL). This new decomposition led to a new algorithm based on a succession of three translations following the columns, then the lines and the columns of the images again (CLC). Statistical analysis of experimental results showed that the computational complexity of images rotation does not depend significantly (p> 0. 05) on the factorization ULU or LUL, whereas the precision depends on it significantly (p< 0. 05). Each of the two algorithms of rotation is more precise for certain images and for certain angles. The method can be generalized in a case of 3 D image rotation using the Euler angles...|$|R

5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, a {{cut and cover}} railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground City street level to create <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{siege of}} Copenhagen in 1807, the mansion served as {{headquarters}} of General Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. Built in the Baroque style with yellow-rendered masonry and red tile roofing, the four-winged complex {{consists of a}} two-storey main wing, two one-storey lateral wings and a curved gate wing opening onto the Stændertorvet. The four wings are connected by curving galleries. Facing the courtyard, the façade of the main wing has pilasters and a median risalit tipped by <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> pediment decorated with the royal coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the foramen magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles <b>a</b> <b>triangular</b> hatchet in shape when viewed from the side.|$|E
