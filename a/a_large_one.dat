5|$|The genus was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one</b> with well over 100 species. However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences showed that the most species belonged in the family Psathyrellaceae, distinct from the type species {{that belonged to the}} Agaricaceae. It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result, as this and other species were moved to the new genus Coprinopsis.|$|E
5|$|An {{economic}} downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because {{of tax cuts}} instituted the previous year, the budget presented by the government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one,</b> $648million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led {{to an increase in}} the money supply, which in future years would hamper the government's efforts to respond to unemployment.|$|E
5|$|The Corded Ware culture, in {{existence}} in central Europe between 3000 and 2000 BCE, originated most likely from Proto-Indo-European nomadic {{people of the}} Black Sea steppes. It was a pastoral culture at least in its early stages, {{for the most part}} lacking permanent settlements and known primarily from the burial grounds (<b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one</b> with many richly furnished graves was discovered in Złota near Sandomierz). They moved together with their herds of cattle, sheep, goats and horses along the river valleys of southern Poland, but also engaged in flint mining and manufacturing of tools and weapons for their own use and trade.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} by first {{introducing}} the central character. Three contestants are then introduced, each accompanied by three pieces of baggage: a small one, a medium one, and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one,</b> with each one containing a corresponding secret. The central contestant also has a piece of baggage {{of his or her}} own, which is only revealed {{at the end of the}} show. During the show, three possible secrets about the central contestant are given, one of which is the actual secret contained in their baggage. These secrets can include bad habits, strange relationship preferences, issues with one's past, or strange hobbies. After the three other contestants are introduced, they each open the smallest piece of baggage, and explain the secrets they contain.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1282, the Mongol command made {{preparations}} for the upcoming invasions of Champa and northern Burma. The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further; the emperor did not sanction an attack on Pagan itself. At least one army consisted of 14,000 men of the erstwhile Persian Khwarezmid Empire {{under the command of}} Yalu Beg was sent to Yunnan to reinforce the Burma invasion force, which again was made up of Turks and other central Asians. On the Burmese side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals, he probably could not have raised <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one.</b> By mid-1283, a Burmese army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Boyd {{returned}} to Georgia Tech's physics department and its Engineering Experiment Station, {{where he worked}} as Assistant Project Director under Frank Lawrence (and, after Lawrence's departure, as Project Director) on an Army Air Corps-sponsored project studying microwave propagation. As part of the project, he conducted long-range line-of-sight experiments between Georgia Tech and Mount Oglethorpe in North Georgia. In 1947, Boyd co-authored a study entitled Propagation Studies of Electromagnetic Waves, {{which resulted in a}} series of related research contracts, including <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one</b> obtained from the Navy Bureau of Ordnance on radar-directed fire control. Boyd was promoted to professor of physics in 1948. Around 1950, under the authority of his rank of commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, Boyd created a U.S. Navy Research Reserve Unit at Georgia Tech that included officers from both Georgia Tech and the Atlanta metropolitan area. In the 1950s, Boyd was promoted to captain and ran this unit until his departure from Georgia Tech.|$|E

25|$|In 1305, {{the newly}} elected Pope Clement V asked {{the leaders of the}} {{military}} orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders. Molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues, which he did during the summer of 1306. Molay was opposed to the merger, believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position, as the missions of each order were somewhat different. He was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade, it needed to be <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one,</b> as the smaller attempts were not effective.|$|E

25|$|Some {{structures}} are inherently {{more or less}} {{at risk of being}} struck by lightning. The risk for a structure {{is a function of the}} size (area) of a structure, the height, and the number of lightning strikes per year per mi² for the region. For example, a small building will be less likely to be struck than <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one,</b> and a building in an area with a high density of lightning strikes will be more likely to be struck than one in an area with a low density of lightning strikes. The National Fire Protection Agency provides a risk assessment worksheet in their lightning protection standard.|$|E
25|$|Known {{mechanisms}} {{for the production}} of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis. Once established, chirality would be selected for. A small enantiomeric excess can be amplified into <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one</b> by asymmetric autocatalysis, such as in the Soai reaction. In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production.

25|$|During late 2015, {{work being}} done on St Peter's Burial Ground in advance of road {{construction}} involved the disinterment of the remains of nearly 2,000 individuals who had been buried there during the cemetery's period of operation (1821-1945). The burial ground had been connected with the former St Peter's Church, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one</b> which seated some 1,500 people, which was demolished in 1976. Archaeologists found that {{nearly half of the}} bodies were those of young children, who appeared to have died quickly during the mid-19th century from illnesses affected the lungs and gastrointestinal system. The numbers are taken as reflecting the massive increase in the city's population during that period due to its booming textile industry, which led to unhealthy living situations among the working classes.|$|E

25|$|Buxtehude's last post, from 1668, {{was at the}} Marienkirche, Lübeck {{which had}} two organs, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one</b> for big {{services}} and a small one for devotionals and funerals. There he succeeded Franz Tunder and followed {{in many of the}} footsteps of his predecessor. He married Tunder's daughter Anna Margarethe in 1668 – it was not uncommon practice that a man marry the daughter of his predecessor in his occupation. Buxtehude and Anna Margarethe had seven daughters who were baptized at the Marienkirche; however, his first daughter died as an infant. After his retirement as organist at St Olaf's Church, his father joined the family in Lübeck in 1673. Johannes died a year later, and Dieterich composed his funeral music.

Depending on weather conditions, the park's beaches may be temporarily closed {{in order to maintain}} the safety of the park's visitors. Gilson Park also hosts a public theater, the Wallace Bowl, which provides a variety of performances throughout the summer. Tennis courts are open from sunrise to after sunset, and there is space for people to play beach volleyball and soccer. Gillson Park also has a marina (Wilmette Harbor) and built-in grills for barbecuing located throughout the park.|$|E
25|$|Beerus has superhuman strength, {{durability}} and reflexes. Some of Beerus' unique attacks include , where he creates two flaming energy spheres and merges them into <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>one</b> before launching it, and , where he surrounds himself in an aura resembling a sun prior to releasing an energy wave. Beerus is introduced as stronger than prior antagonists, {{being able to}} dominate Goku {{in all of his}} Super Saiyan forms; after his battle with Super Saiyan God Goku, it is revealed he may be weaker than Whis. Due to his tremendous strength, he is initially feared by the protagonists. Beerus notably acts a similar manner when {{in the presence of the}} Omni-King. After Freeza's defeat, Whis speculates Goku and Vegeta may be able to defeat Beerus with their combined power. Similarly to other Gods of Destructions and Kaiō-shins, Beerus is life linked to the East Kaiō-shin, where if one dies then so will the other. This amounts to a weakness given East Kaiō-shin's vast inferiority in strength to Beerus. Due to the East Kaiō-shin being killed in the alternate timeline, while assisting Trunks in facing Dabura, the version of Beerus that exists there dies during his sleep.|$|E
