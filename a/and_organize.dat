40|$|Key words: teaching, vocabulary, English Young Learner, {{grouping}} <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> strategy Vocabulary {{is considered}} one of the foundations for the students as young learners of English as a foreign language. To be able to learn English well, a learner should master English skills and components. Vocabulary is also taken into account as underlying basic for learning English skills and other English component, namely pronunciation and grammar. Therefore, teaching vocabulary effectively needed to be considered, and one of the ways in teaching vocabulary is using strategy such as grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary. Accordingly, the researcher uses grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary as strategy to teach vocabulary which is intended to improve the student’s vocabulary achievement. The formulation of the research problems are: 1) How is the student’s vocabulary achievement taught before using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary? 2) How is the student’s vocabulary achievement taught after using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary? 3) Are there any significant different scores taught before and after using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary? The objectives of this study are: 1) To know the student’s vocabulary achievement taught before using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary, 2) To know the student’s vocabulary achievement taught after using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary, 3) To know whether there are any significant different scores taught before and after using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary. The research design of this study is experimental design with quantitative approach. The population of this study was the fifth grade students of SDN I Wonorejo Sumbergempol Tulungagung. The sample is used population sampling, the fifth grade students of SDN I Wonorejo Sumbergempol that consist 44 as population sampling. The data analysis is done by using T-test.

After developing, the cyclone moved northeastward in advance of an approaching cold front. It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Bill, and briefly threatened to pass near Bermuda. As a result, a tropical storm warning was issued, although it was quickly dropped; there was {{no impact on the}} island from Bill.|$|E

It guaranteed many political rights, {{including the right to}} form political parties <b>and</b> <b>organize</b> convocations. This decree formed the legal basis for the assembly in Vilnius. The October Manifesto also announced the intent to hold elections to the Russian Parliament (Duma), and the Lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for the Seimas: they claimed that the Lithuanians needed to prepare themselves for this election.|$|E

The assassination of Hunchakian members Mihran Aghazarian and S. Dekhrouhi followed in 1929 and 1931 respectively. In 1956, when Bishop Zareh was consecrated Catholicos of Cilicia, the Catholicos of Echmiadzin refused to recognize his authority. This controversy polarized the Armenian community of Lebanon.

While not specifically mentioning netball, it did acknowledge the importance of the sport in terms of international prestige.

5|$|Within {{eukaryotic}} cells DNA {{is organized}} into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated {{in the process}} of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact <b>and</b> <b>organize</b> DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.|$|E
