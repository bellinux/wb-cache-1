25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a dynamic loudspeaker, uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a voice coil to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, a magnetic field is created by the electric current in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the <b>attached</b> <b>cone)</b> to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied electrical signal coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to determine the ability of three pharmaceutical polymers (hydroxypropylcellulose, polyethylene oxide, Carbopol 940) to maintain a high viscosity in hydroalcoholic solutions under different rates of mixing. Background. Abuse-deterrent formulations often contain materials which form a gel or highly viscous liquid when in contact with water or hydroalcoholic solutions. Increase in viscosity and gelling is done to prevent the drug from rapidly being released (dose dumping) and also prevent the product from being dissolved and drawn-up into a syringe. Evaluation of polymers for this purpose have not been extensively tested over a range of alcoholic concentrations and mixing (shear rates). Methods. Continuous shear rheometry was performed using a Wells-Brookfield cone-and-plate rheometer. Measurements were taken with an <b>attached</b> <b>cone</b> of radius 2. 4 cm, and cone angle of 0. 8 at a constant temperature. Polymer solutions (2...|$|E
40|$|Remains of the extinct sphenophyte (horsetail) Neocalamites {{are most}} {{widespread}} in the Middle–Upper Triassic and are typically represented by stem and leaf fragments. Here we report on spectacular new finds of Neocalamites from the Late Triassic Yangcaogou Formation in Liaoning Province, China that include bedding surfaces dominated by nearly complete aerial stems with attached leaf whorls and rare bractless cones. They reveal a monopodial growth habit for the stems, which are covered with downward projecting prickles that probably provided protection against herbivores. These features {{provide the basis for}} a new proposed species, Neocalamites horridus. The nodes bear whorls of very long leaves mainly free to their bases, and one specimen bears an <b>attached</b> <b>cone</b> on a long peduncle. Identical dispersed cones have also been recovered. The leaves of adjacent monopodial stems most likely interlocked to support growth in large stands akin to the role now played by branches in large modern Equisetum species.

40|$|A 2 D cone shape {{has been}} added to the normal {{circular}} tubes of heat exchangers to minimize the area of stagnation and to stream line the air flow around the heat exchanger tubes. An experimental setup has been developed to study the influence of the apex angle of the cone shaped tubes on particulate fouling of heat exchangers. Fouling experiments have been performed in which calcium carbonate particles are injected during the experiments and the depositions of particles on the tubes of the heat exchanger is monitored. Four sets of experiments have been performed, in which normal cylindrical tubes and coned tubes with an apex angle of 60, 90 and 120 dgrs are examined. It was found that particulate fouling ceased if the apex angle of the cone shaped tubes is smaller than 90 dgrs. The attached cones enhance the flow around the tubes of the heat exchanger, i. e. by minimizing the stagnation area and keeping the flow attached to the tubes starting from the tip of the <b>attached</b> <b>cone</b> until separation, such that particles which deposit {{on the top of the}} tubes of the heat exchanger can be removed by the air flow...|$|E

40|$|If F is a {{collection}} of topological spaces, then a homotopy class α in [X,Y] is called F-trivial if α_* = 0 : [A,X] [...] > [A,Y] for all A in F. In this paper we study the collection Z_F(X,Y) of all F-trivial homotopy classes in [X,Y] when F = S, the collection of spheres, F = M, the collection of Moore spaces, and F = Σ, the collection of suspensions. Clearly Z_Σ (X,Y) ⊂ Z_M(X,Y) ⊂ Z_S(X,Y), and we find examples of finite complexes X and Y for which these inclusions are strict. We are also interested in Z_F(X) = Z_F(X,X), which under composition has the structure of a semigroup with zero. We show that if X is a finite dimensional complex and F = S, M or Σ, then the semigroup Z_F(X) is nilpotent. More precisely, the nilpotency of Z_F(X) is bounded above by the F-killing length of X, a new numerical invariant which equals the number of steps it takes to make X contractible by successively <b>attaching</b> <b>cones</b> on wedges of spaces in F, and this in turn is bounded above by the F-cone length of X. We then calculate or estimate the nilpotency of Z_F(X) when F = S, M or Σ for the following classes of spaces: (1) projective spaces (2) certain Lie groups such as SU(n) and Sp(n).

New studies include a 10 -year-old stand in Southland, a 9 - and a 19 -year-old stand in Canterbury, a 21 -year-old stand in Southern Kaingaroa, a 28 -year-old stand in Northern Kaingaroa, and a 31 -year-old stand in Whakarewarewa forest near Rotorua. Stand attributes were measured in temporary sample plots installed at each site. Measurements were taken of stocking rate, basal area, mean top height, dry weight of biomass components (foliage, branches, stem wood, stem bark), stem volume (over- and under-bark), the mass of dead wood and litter, as well as outerwood basic density at breast height (1.4 [*]m aboveground). The number of annually produced needle-age classes retained in the lower third of the green crown of a sample tree was counted and the mean needle retention of sample trees calculated for each plot. Most cones had been shed, and these were weighed {{as part of the}} forest floor. <b>Attached</b> <b>cones,</b> if present, were weighed with the branches. Root biomass was measured at one site in northern Kaingaroa. The forest floor (LFH, ash free) was measured at most sites, although negligible litter was present in young stands. The mass was assumed to be zero in such cases. For example, at the 10 -year-old stand at Gowan Hill and the 9 -year-old stand at Forest Creek, Douglas-fir litter was mostly absent, which was to be expected because needle retention was reasonably high in these stands (4 – 5 [*]years of retained material). Deadwood at the Northern Kaingaroa (thinned to 800 trees ha− 1 at age 16) and Whakarewarewa (thinned to 750 trees ha− 1 at age 18) sites was measured 12 and 13 [*]years, respectively following thinning.
