500|$|Slashdot was {{preceded by}} Rob Malda's {{personal}} website [...] "Chips & Dips", which, launched in October 1997, featured a single [...] "rant" [...] each day <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> interested its author [...] typically {{something to do with}} Linux or open source software. At the time, Malda was a student at Hope College in Holland, Michigan, majoring in computer science. The site became [...] "Slashdot" [...] in September 1997 under the slogan [...] "News for Nerds.

500|$|Franklin {{maintains}} that {{the core of the}} strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. [...] "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," [...] she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, [...] "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had just entered your mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence {{is probably one of the}} most powerful spiritual forces." [...] Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.|$|E
500|$|Of his {{decision}} not to show the heist itself, Tarantino {{has said that the}} reason was initially budgetary but that he had always liked the idea of not showing it and stuck with that idea {{in order to make the}} details of the heist ambiguous. He has said that the technique allows for the realization that the film is [...] "about other things", a similar plot outline that appears in the stage play Glengarry Glen Ross and its film adaptation in which the mentioned robbery is never shown on camera. Tarantino has compared this to the work of a novelist, and has said that he wanted the film to be <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is not seen and that he wanted it to [...] "play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking".|$|E

500|$|Stephen Colbert, portraying his {{character}} Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, chose the word truthiness just moments before taping the premiere episode of The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – [...] "truth" [...] – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: [...] "We're {{not talking about}} truth, we're talking <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> seems like truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained. He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: [...] "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Black Beauty was {{originally}} released only in Japan in 1973. It contained four side-long tracks spread across a double album, grouping the songs as medleys titled [...] "Black Beauty Part I", [...] "Black Beauty Part II", and so on, {{all of which}} credited Davis as the composer. He {{did not want the}} actual segments specified on the track listing out of a distaste for critics and listeners who arduously analyzed his music; according to DeJohnette's wife Lydia, [...] "Miles really felt that critics and people spent too much time in their mental mind, analyzing and talking for hours <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> really just is." [...] Columbia spent several years identifying some of the individual compositions to ensure royalty payment for the actual composers. The Japanese release also mistakenly credited Michael Henderson—Davis' other bassist during this period—rather than Holland in the liner notes.|$|E
500|$|Another popular Farkism {{involves}} KABC-TV Consumer Specialist Ric Romero, {{which began}} on October 19, 2005, {{when he wrote}} a news story on the [...] "new" [...] Internet phenomenon of blogging. The story was then picked up by Fark, where he was ridiculed for posting a story <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> many people did not consider [...] "news" [...] and was actually quite obvious. Over {{the course of the}} next several years, he became somewhat of a meme on the site, as Farkers would post links to his stories, along with his photo, and a brief caption stating something obvious that everyone already knew. On December 7, 2009, Drew Curtis discovered his Facebook fan page, which led Romero to ask the Farkers that joined his new Facebook page to donate to the Spark of Love Toy Drive, which subsequently resulted in 582 online donations totaling $13,659.20 by December 16, 2009. Romero thanked the Fark community on the news for their donations, and recognized his status as a Farkism, also reporting the [...] "breaking news" [...] that [...] "Water is Wet." ...|$|E

500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tradition}} of making decorated gingerbread houses started in Germany {{in the early}} 1800s.

After this book was published, German bakers began baking ornamented fairy-tale houses of lebkuchen (gingerbread).

2500|$|The Stugotz Pregame Show — {{beginning}} the TV simulcast, Stugotz gets {{a minute or}} so to vent <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> might or might not be brought up during the main show. During football season on Fridays, Stugotz uses the pregame show to make his weekend picks.

Previously, when the show's final hour aired on ESPN2, a segment titled ESPN Dos Minutos would air, where Stugotz and Mike Ryan would review the show, but Dos Minutos ended when ESPNU re-gained the final hour of the show. Because of a difference in commercial lengths between the TV simulcast and radio show, the TV simulcast typically airs flashback moments or highlights from the local hour at the return from commercials.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson began {{production}} on his film without securing outside funding or distribution. In 2002, he explained why {{he could not}} get backing from the Hollywood studios: [...] "This is a film <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> nobody wants to touch, shot in two dead languages. In Los Angeles they think I am insane, and maybe I am." [...] Gibson and his Icon Productions company provided the film's sole backing, spending about $30 million on production costs and an estimated $15 million on marketing. After early accusations of anti-Semitism, it became difficult for Gibson to find an American distribution company. 20th Century Fox had a first-look deal with Icon and passed on the film in response to public protests. In order to avoid the spectacle of other studios turning down the film and to avoid subjecting the distributor to the same intense public criticism he had received, Gibson decided to distribute the movie in the United States himself, with Newmarket Films.|$|E

2500|$|Producer Andrew Macdonald read Irvine Welsh's book on a {{plane in}} December 1993 and felt {{that it could be}} made into a film. He turned it on to {{director}} Danny Boyle and writer John Hodge in February 1994. Boyle was excited by its potential to be the [...] "most energetic film you've ever seen – <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> ultimately ends up in purgatory or worse". Hodge read it and made it his goal to [...] "produce a screenplay which would seem to have a beginning, a middle and an end, would last 90 minutes and would convey {{at least some of the}} spirit and the content of the book". Boyle convinced Welsh to let them option the rights to his book by writing him a letter stating that Hodge and Macdonald were [...] "the two most important Scotsmen since Kenny Dalglish and Alex Ferguson". Welsh remembered that originally the people wanting to option his book [...] "wanted to make a po-faced piece of social realism like Christiane F or The Basketball Diaries". He was impressed that Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald wanted everyone to see the film and [...] "not just the arthouse audience". In October 1994, Hodge, Boyle and Macdonald spent a lot of time discussing which chapters of the book would and would not translate into film. Hodge finished the first draft by December. Macdonald secured financing from Channel 4, a British television station known for funding independent films.|$|E
2500|$|Described by Gomez as [...] "a {{beautiful}} {{start to}} the album", [...] "Good for You" [...] was the third song she received since signing with her new label Interscope Records, as well the second track to be recorded for the album. It was uninterruptedly recorded in 45 minutes at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California; during the process, Gomez's vocals featured cracks as the song [...] "took on this emotion [...] didn't realize [...] could tap into", and {{at the beginning of}} the session she was exhausted from pressurizing herself for a sound and concept for the album. According to her, this recording had no beat and was [...] "just a skeleton of a song". There was also no specific sound planned for the song at the time although it was suggested that its soft melodies be made more pop-indebted which Gomez disagreed with, believing it would take away from her vocal. She was entirely involved in the song's creative direction, providing additional songwriting, and helped to develop it to represent her process of self-realization, her confidence as a young woman, and feelings of vulnerability. The song also formed part of a process in which she wanted to portray her story as an artist and as part of a transitional album over which she would take full control. In an interview for MTV, she said this was her time [...] "to embrace who I am, and I'm not going to sit down in a chair and talk <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> doesn't mean anything to me anymore" [...] and spoke about her involvement in the track: [...] "This is the most I've been creatively involved from the writing process ... every single thing I'm even remotely singing about is something I've related to and something I'm hitting the nail on, and I had to pick what was going to represent the album and who I am as a whole".|$|E
