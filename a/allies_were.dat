5|$|Despite {{the losses}} {{that had brought}} the Allies to the border of their homeland, German morale was {{surprisingly}} strong. The men knew the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> demanding an unconditional surrender. They were now fighting for the fatherland, defending the soil of their country, not just fighting for Hitler.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{gradually}} map the area the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> obliged {{to resort to}} mangrullos (improvised watch towers) or (a first in South American warfare) captive observation balloons, but the Paraguayans obscured the terrain by lighting fires of damp grass.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Spartans {{had sent}} Dorkis to Byzantium {{with a small}} force, to take command of the Allied force. However, {{he found that the}} rest of the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> no longer {{prepared}} to accept Spartan leadership, and therefore returned home.|$|E

5|$|The Latvian city of Mitau (Jelgava) fell to Polish-Lithuanian forces {{commanded}} by Aleksander Hilary Połubiński in January 1660 and the <b>allies</b> <b>were</b> preparing {{an invasion of}} Zeeland; the outlook was {{not good for the}} Swedes. Fortunately for them, the war would soon end.|$|E
5|$|The {{landings}} were overwhelmingly successful. On Delta and Alpha beaches, German {{resistance was}} low. The Osttruppen surrendered quickly, {{and the biggest}} threat to the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> the mines. A single German gun as well as a mortar position were silenced by destroyer fire. The Allied units in this sector were able to secure a bridgehead and quickly linked up with the paratroopers, capturing Saint-Tropez as well LeMuy. The most serious fighting was on Camel Beach near the town of Saint-Raphaël. This beach was secured by several well-emplaced coastal guns as well as flak batteries. Through heavy German fire the Allies attempted to land at the shore. However, at sector Red of the Camel Beach landing zone the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> not able to succeed. A bombing run of 90Allied B-24 bombers was called in against a German strongpoint here. Even with the assistance of naval fire, the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> not able to bring the landing ships close to the shore. They decided to avoid Camel Red and land only at the sectors of Camel Blue and Camel Green, which was successful.|$|E
5|$|With no secure bridges {{over the}} Nederrijn, the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> unable to advance further {{and the front}} line stabilised south of Arnhem. The British 1st Airborne Division had lost nearly three-quarters of its {{strength}} and did not see combat again.|$|E

5|$|Despite Sakonju's fears, the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> not {{immediately}} {{aware of the}} attack on Behar. Her distress signal had been picked up by only a single Allied merchant ship, which did not report it until she arrived at Fremantle on 17March. In the meantime, Somerville had decided on 16March that surface raiders no longer posed a threat to shipping in the Indian Ocean and allowed Allied vessels to resume their normal routing.|$|E
5|$|Due to the episodic {{nature of}} the Axis attacks and the {{relatively}} small number of ships and submarines committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping. While the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> forced to deploy substantial assets to defend shipping in Australian waters, this did not {{have a significant impact on}} the Australian war effort or American-led operations in the South West Pacific Area.|$|E
5|$|Following Operation Paravane, the German Navy's {{commander}} {{decided to}} use Tirpitz as a static artillery battery to protect the town of Tromsø. The <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> unable to confirm {{the extent of the}} battleship's damage, and conducted two further heavy bomber raids against her in late 1944. Tirpitz was sunk with considerable loss of life on 12 November during the second of these attacks.|$|E

5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of a new line in Western New Guinea. The Admiralties operation also indicated the <b>Allies</b> <b>were</b> becoming more ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E

5|$|A quick {{peace was}} {{essential}} to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the Main River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its <b>allies,</b> <b>were</b> excluded from the North German Confederation.|$|E
