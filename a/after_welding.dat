5|$|<b>After</b> <b>welding,</b> {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away <b>after</b> <b>welding.</b> Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up <b>after</b> <b>welding</b> and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon <b>after.</b> <b>Welding</b> technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E

500|$|The use of {{high-strength}} steel caused problems {{as it was}} necessary to heat the steel to [...] before and <b>after</b> <b>welding,</b> and Kværner had problems finding an adequate process during late 1992. In January 1993, an appropriate process had been found, although experimentation with various methods continued for another six months. Kværner felt that the Public Roads Administration should bear the extra costs, demanding NOK 108 million in compensation, but the administration denied this, resulting in a lawsuit. On 26 January 1996, Nordhordland District Court supported the administration, but gave the plaintiff partial support, claiming the administration should take part of the costs through improper choice of material. The Public Roads Administration was sentenced to pay NOK 34 million to Kværner. Both sides appealed to Gulating Court of Appeal, which on 18 February 1998 refuted all of Kværner's claim regarding the steel boxes, and sentenced the administration to pay NOK 7.5 million. In addition, Kværner had to pay the administration NOK 19.5 million in penalties for overrunning the contract date. However, the court's decision was not unanimous. The plaintiff appealed to case to the Supreme Court, who unanimously confirmed the ruling of Gulating Court of Appeal. In addition, the plaintiff was sentenced to pay the defendants legal costs of NOK 910,000.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW), which is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMAW) or stick welding. [...] An electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and a consumable electrode rod or stick. [...] The electrode rod is made of a material that is compatible with the base material being welded and is covered with a flux that gives off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and provide a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination. [...] The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary. [...] The process is very versatile, requiring little operator training and inexpensive equipment. [...] However, weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away <b>after</b> <b>welding.</b> [...] Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though specialty electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminium, copper and other metals. The versatility of the method makes it popular in a number of applications including repair work and construction.|$|E
