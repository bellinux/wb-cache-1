40|$|The {{prestressing}} and pre-casting {{of concrete}} are inter-related {{features of the}} modern building industry and it is increasingly popular nowadays. This research investigates the material properties, the development length and ultimate strength of the pre-stressed bar using different cutting methods. The experiment conducted in the Mono-jack Calibration Frame for tensioning of the pre-stressed bar specimens. Three bar diameters have been studied. They include 26 mm, 29 mm and 36 mm. The experiment involved two cutting methods, <b>abrasive</b> <b>blade</b> cut and flame cut. The results analysed the factors such as ultimate load, ductility, ultimate strain and Young’s Modulus. The experiment results indicated the Young 2 ̆ 7 s Modulus increased according to the bar diameter. However, when compared with two cutting methods, the flame cut illustrated higher loss in ultimate load, ductility, ultimate strain and Young’s Modulus when compared to <b>abrasive</b> <b>blade</b> cut. It was also observed that the flame cut is four times faster than abrasive cut. Through this study, a series of design graphs were proposed. These design graphs are useful for the practice design engineers to choose {{the best and most}} practical cutting method on site...|$|E
40|$|A {{concentration}} cell electrode {{was installed in}} a fritted glass surface and {{was used to measure}} the surface KCl concentration while water was being transpired through the surface into a mixed tank of 0. 1 M KCl. The results from the first Fluorox run made with crude UF/sub 4 / showed that 85. 3 % of the theoretical amount of UF/sub 6 / was accounted for, with 17. 9 % being collected in cold traps and the remainder being consumed in various side reactions. Installation was completed of apparatus to study the electrolytic removal of nickel on an engineering scale from concentrated HRT fuel solution. An extremely low yield stress of 0. 02 lb/sq ft was measured for a thoria-urania slurry containing 2. 5 wt. % Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / and spherical particles of 1. 7 micron mean diameter. Preliminary data on the rate of uranium sorption on Dowex 21 K from sulfate solutions were correlated with a simple spherical diffusion model. Laboratory scale studies to determine the effect of reflux time, HNO/sub 3 / concentration, and air sparge on chloride removal from APPR-type Darex dissolver product showed that an air sparge is definitely beneficial in chloride removal. Preliminary cyclic cleaning tests showed that boiling 25 % caustic solution was adequate for cleaning type F (20 micron) porous metal filter elements fouled in the absence of filter aid with siliceous sludge from Darex solvent extraction feed solutions. Sections of unirradiated stainless steel-clad UO/sub 2 /, sheared into lengths of 1 / 2 in., 1 in., 2 in., and 2 3 / 4 in., were leached free of UO/sub 2 / with 10 M HNO/sub 3 / in 30, 45, 60, and 75 min, respectively. The <b>abrasive</b> <b>blade</b> cost for the removal of inert end adapters from selected reactor assemblies ranges from 12 for the Gas-Cooled Reactor to 19 for Consolidated Edison. A zirconium dissolution was carried to completion at 600 ction prod- C in a NaF-LiF salt mixture containing initially 23 mol per cent ZrF/sub 4 / at an average rate of 1. 3 mg/(cm/sup 2 /) (min) with an HF feed rate of 2 lb/hr. The thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity at the center of an 8 -in. diameter cake of Darex waste calcined at about 900 ction prod- C were determined as a function of temperature. (For preceding period see CF- 59 - 3 - 61.) (auth...|$|E

40|$|Mexico is {{the largest}} cactus {{exporter}} {{of the world and}} 40 % of the production cost is provide d from the harvest operation. Many workers are required to operate daily and suffer wrist pain after two weeks of collecting pears with mechanical pruners. A motor driven tool supplied from a photovoltaic system was employed for harvesting; different blades were tested at different cutting speeds. It was found that toothed blades sliced the pears with efficiencies over 90 %. <b>Abrasive</b> <b>blades</b> were finally selected as the current required per cut was minimum, permitting a longer battery lifetime before requiring recharging. </p...|$|R
50|$|Blades are {{available}} {{for a variety of}} materials and uses. Common types include metal cutting blades, wood cutting blades, blades for composites, for drywall, and other materials. Many of these blade types have a variety of tooth designs intended for special purposes, such as tree-limb cutting, demolition work, clean cutting, or contaminated materials. <b>Abrasive</b> coated <b>blades</b> are also available for hard materials like tile and stone.|$|R
40|$|A plasma sprayed graded layered ceramic/metallic (ZrO 2 /CoCrAlY) seal was {{evaluated}} for JT 9 D turbine application by rig and engine tests. Four cyclic thermal shock rig {{tests were conducted}} during the program. Three completed 1000 simulated engine thermal cycle tests and the fourth completed 500 cycles without severe cracking or spalling. Three ceramic seals were installed in a JT 9 D experimental engine to evaluate {{the effect of the}} engine thermal environment on the seals. All three seals completed the test successfully without severe cracking or spalling. The three seals did have slight laminar cracks at the 85 / 15 - 40 / 60 ZrO 2 /CoCrAlY interface. The second engine test evaluated the rub capabilities of the seal. Six ceramic seals were installed in the engine with fourteen <b>abrasive</b> tip <b>blades.</b> Three of the six seals rubbed to a depth of 24 mils. Eight of the fourteen <b>abrasive</b> tip <b>blades</b> showed evidence of wear. Three of the eight blades wore a maximum of five mils. Engine rub test results demonstrated the potential of reducing turbine clearances and thereby improving engine performance by use of sprayed ceramic seals...|$|R
40|$|Paring {{is useful}} for both {{diagnosis}} and treatment of plantar warts. Paring techniques generally involve scalpel <b>blades,</b> <b>abrasive</b> tools, or curettes. However, these tools do not permit the use of an “awl-like” carving technique of the wart afforded by using a punch biopsy tool. We have found this technique to be associated with greater precision and safety, as well as potentially increased efficacy compared to traditional methods...|$|R
50|$|Angle {{grinders}} may be {{used for}} removing excess material from a piece. There are many different kinds of discs that are used for various materials and tasks, such as cut-off discs (diamond <b>blade),</b> <b>abrasive</b> grinding discs, grinding stones, sanding discs, wire brush wheels and polishing pads. The angle grinder has large bearings to counter side forces generated during cutting, unlike a power drill, where the force is axial.|$|R

50|$|A {{circular}} saw is a power-saw using a toothed or <b>abrasive</b> disc or <b>blade</b> to cut different materials using {{a rotary motion}} spinning around an arbor. A hole saw and ring saw also use a rotary motion but are different from a {{circular saw}}. Circular saws may also be loosely used for the blade itself. Circular saws were invented in the late 18th century and were in common use in sawmills in the United States {{by the middle of}} the 19th century.|$|R
40|$|Cost benefit {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on six advanced materials and processes technologies applicable to commercial engines planned for production in the 1985 to 1990 time frame. These technologies consisted of thermal barrier coatings for combustor and high pressure turbine airfoils, directionally solidified eutectic high pressure turbine blades, (both cast and fabricated), and mixers, tail cones, and piping made of titanium-aluminum alloys. A fabricated titanium fan blisk, an advanced turbine disk alloy with improved low cycle fatigue life, and a long-life high pressure turbine <b>blade</b> <b>abrasive</b> tip and ceramic shroud system were also analyzed. Technologies showing considerable promise as to benefits, low development costs, and high probability of success were thermal barrier coating, directionally solidified eutectic turbine blades, and abrasive-tip blades/ceramic-shroud turbine systems...|$|R
50|$|Wet or dry cutting. Though {{diamond saw}} blades for {{concrete}} are usually laser welded, they are normally designed for wet cutting because the concrete {{to be cut}} is often very hard or <b>abrasive.</b> If the <b>blades</b> are used without adequate water, the diamond segment itself may break or the steel core below the segment may wear and break, and then the segment may fly out and may hurt the operator or people nearby. If you have to perform dry cutting for some reason (e.g. there is no water source near your work area), you can choose sharper diamond blades, and the dry cutting should be intermittent and shallow (you can do several passes of shallow cuttings to gain a deep cut) to keep the diamond blade cool.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{rotary tiller}} is a {{mechanized}} agricultural implement popularly used to save time, human effort and fuel in preparation of soil bed. However, under complex <b>abrasive</b> environments, tiller <b>blades</b> {{are subjected to}} extreme surface wear, particularly in dry sand, which considerably affects its service life. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the service life of the tiller blade in order to cut the idle time required to replace the blade periodically during cultivation. The aim was carried out by means of hardfacing, where the effect of the hard facings on the extent of wear and the wear characteristics of the tiller blades were examined. The influence of Cr is studied by hard facing of leading edge of tiller blades made of high tensile steel by gas tungsten arc welding using four different electrodes. The comparison of hard faced blades with un-hard faced (standard) blade was made through field and laboratory test. A field test was conducted on a 50 acre area of rice field after combine harvesting. During field test, rice stubbles were present and the condition of soil was dry and sandy. Different positions were selected for the test blades in the tiller to collect the meaningful data. The average wear rate of the un-hard faced blade was found as 7. 08 gm/acre, while those of 5 HCr, 7. 5 HCr, 12 HCr and 8 HCr hard facings were 5. 02, 4. 3 2. 84 and 4. 22 gm/acre respectively as indicated by field test results. A significant improvement was observed in the wear protection provided by hard facings over the un-hard faced blade...|$|R
