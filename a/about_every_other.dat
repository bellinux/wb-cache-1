The Portuguese SuperGamePower magazine also gave it a positive contemporary review, noting it as having {{some of the best}} graphics of any game on the SNES. Critics have also rated the game highly in retrospective reviews, published mostly after the release of the fan translation patch in 2000. The graphics were praised; a review from 1UP.com called the game [...] "absolutely gorgeous", which they attributed to its position {{towards the end of the}} era of 2D SNES games, but before developers tried to start working with prerendered 3D graphics. A review by Chris Parsons of RPGamer agreed, terming the graphics [...] "awesome" [...] and positively comparing some of the effects to PlayStation RPGs, which the Cubed3 review by Adam Riley did as well. A preview by Next Generation written after the release of the game in Japan stated that the detailed graphics [...] "puts just <b>about</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> recent 32-bit RPG to shame", while the review by Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life also noted the game as one of the best graphically on the SNES and called out the unique visual styles of each area in the game as of particular note. The game's music was also generally praised; Nintendo Lifes Dillard called it [...] "spectacular from start to finish", while Cubed3s Riley said it was [...] "one of the most sonically pleasing out of the whole SNES lifetime" [...] and RPGamers Parsons said that [...] "a wonderful job was done in the composition of the music".
