As a main field of U-healthcare, Telehealth has been developed as an enhancement of Telemedicine. This system includes two-way interactive web-video communications, sensor technology, and health informatics. With these components, it will assist patients to receive their first initial diagnosis. Futhermore, Telehealth will help doctors diagnose patient's diseases at early stages and recommend treatments to patients. However, this system has a few limitations such as privacy issues, interruption of real-time service and a wrong ordering from remote diagnosis. To deal with those flaws, security procedures such as <b>authorised</b> <b>access</b> should be applied to as an indispensible component in medical environment.

Though intrusion detection is complex process, while checking the ability to detect intrusive behaviour within the internal environment, it has to take care of suppressing the false alarm rate. Some strong approach is required on the basis of which decisions can be taken fast.

40|$|The major {{concerns}} for most cloud implementers {{particularly in the}} health care industry have remained data security and privacy. A prominent and major threat that constitutes a hurdle for practitioners within the health industry from exploiting and benefiting from the gains of cloud computing is the fear of theft of patients health data in the cloud. Investigations and surveys have revealed that most practitioners {{in the health care}} industry are concerned about the risk of health data mix-up amongst the various cloud providers, hacking to comprise the cloud platform and theft of vital patients’ health data. An overview of the diverse issues relating to health data privacy and overall security in the cloud are presented in this technical report.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in bio-, nano-, and digital technology {{have changed the}} way modern healthcare systems operate. The provision of healthcare servicing remotely and exploitation of monitoring and assistive technology within and outside medical institutions mean that medical staff and patients constantly interact with various electronic devices. It also means that sensitive patient data are stored on and being transmitted between these devices. To ensure safe and secure use of medical equipment, as well as <b>authorised</b> <b>access</b> to data, appropriate encryption and debugging infrastructure should {{be integrated into the}} modern healthcare system. This paper introduces a novel concept, ICmetrics, that can serve as a basis for developing such infrastructure. More specifically, the ICmetric technology is based on the idea of generating encryption keys directly from the characteristics of electronic systems ’ behaviour on both hard- and software levels. This may include features extracted from electronic circuits, sensors, machine-machine and machine-human interfaces, as well communication peripherals. While the proposed technology has a number of advantages over the existing security systems, it also poses interesting research challenges. These challenges along with the proposed solutions are discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} behind {{information systems}} in today’s {{world has been}} embedded in nearly {{every aspect of our}} lives. Thus, the idea of securing our information systems and/or computer networks has become very paramount. Owing to the significance of computer networks in transporting the information and knowledge generated by the increased diversity and sophistication of computational machinery, it would be very imperative to engage the services of network security professionals to manage the resources that are passed through the various terminals (end points) of the these network, so as to achieve a maximum reliability of the information passed, making sure that this is achieved without creating a discrepancy between the security and usability of such network. This paper examines the various techniques involved in securely maintaining the safe states of an active computer network, its resources and the information it carries. We examined techniques of compromising an information system by breaking into the system without <b>authorised</b> <b>access</b> (Hacking), we also looked at the various phases of digital analysis of an already compromised system, and then we investigated the tools and techniques for digitally analysing a compromised system in other to bring it back to a safe stat...|$|E

40|$|Organisations are {{experiencing}} an ever-growing concern {{of how to}} identify and defend against insider threats. Those who have <b>authorised</b> <b>access</b> to sensitive organisational data are placed {{in a position of}} power that could well be abused and could cause significant damage to an organisation. This could range from financial theft and intellectual property theft, through to the destruction of property and business reputation. Traditional intrusion detection systems are not designed, nor are capable, of identifying those who act maliciously within an organisation. In this paper, we describe an automated system that is capable of detecting insider threats within an organisation. We define a tree-structure profiling approach that incorporates the details of activities conducted by each user and each job role, and then use this to obtain a consistent representation of features that provide a rich description of the user's behaviour. Deviation can be assessed based on the amount of variance that each user exhibits across multiple attributes, compared against their peers. We have performed experimentation using 10 synthetic data-driven scenarios and found that the system can identify anomalous behaviour that may be indicative of a potential threat. We also show how our detection system can be combined with visual analytics tools to support further investigation by an analyst...|$|E
30|$|Although {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} adoption of cloud computing systems, some aspects related to security and privacy are still in its infancy, such as, the handling of insider threats. Some efforts have been made for dealing with malicious attacks in cloud [14, 16, 30], but these have not considered insider threats. An insider threat can be understood as a user who has or had <b>authorised</b> <b>access</b> to an organisation’s network, system, or data, and exceed or misuse that access in a manner that can negatively affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the organisation’s information or information systems [5]. These insider threats are different from those that are restricted to components of the cloud infrastructure, such as, malicious hypervisors and broker [13]. When an insider threat takes place, the damage to the organization can be catastrophic, sometimes resulting in severe financial losses [10]. A famous example of insider threat took place in July 2010, when an intelligence analyst of the US army had access and published more than 250, 000 secret documents from the US Department of Defence. Apparently, the analyst had access to the system, since he was an authorised user, however, there were insufficient mechanisms to detect abuse. In this case, the abuse was related to the downloading 250, 000 documents {{in a short period of}} time.|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{acceptance and}} uptake of Grid technology {{can only be}} achieved {{if it can be}} ensured that the security mechanisms needed to support Grid based collaborations are at least as strong as local security mechanisms. The predominant way in which security is currently addressed in the Grid community is through Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) to support authentication. Whilst PKIs address user identity issues, authentication does not provide fine grained control over what users are allowed to do on remote resources (authorisation). The Grid community have put forward numerous software proposals for authorisation infrastructures such as AKENTI [1], CAS [2], CARDEA [3], GSI [4], PERMIS [5, 6, 7] and VOMS [8, 9]. It is clear that for the foreseeable future a collection of solutions will be the norm. To address this, the Global Grid Forum (GGF) have proposed a generic SAML based authorisation API which in principle should allow for fine grained control for <b>authorised</b> <b>access</b> to any Grid service. Experiences in applying and stress testing this API from a variety of different application domains are essential to give insight into the practical aspects of large scale usage of authorisation infrastructures. This paper presents experiences from the DTI funded BRIDGES project [10] and the JISC funded DyVOSE project [11] in using this API with Globus version 3. 3 [12] and the PERMIS authorisation infrastructure. 1...|$|E
