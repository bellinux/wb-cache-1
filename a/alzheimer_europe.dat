40|$|Objective Care for demented {{people is}} very {{resource}} demanding, the prevalence is increasing {{and there is}} so far no cure. Cost of illness (CoI) studies are important by identifying the distribution of costs between different payers of care. The European Union (EU) funded the European Collaboration on Dementia (Eurocode) {{as part of the}} EU's 2005 work plan of the Community public health programme. Eurocode was administered by <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>Europe.</b> The aim was to describe the economic impact of dementia in Europe in 2008. Methods Eurocode's new estimates for dementia prevalence were included in a cost model based on published European CoI papers. For countries where no CoI figures were available, imputation was used. Results The total CoI of dementia in the EU 27 in 2008 was estimated to be € 160 billion (€ 22 [*] 000 per demented per year), of which 56...|$|E

As the elderly {{population}} grows worldwide, the number of patients with AD also increases rapidly. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of AD in Europe. Methodology: We conducted a literature search on Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete using the keywords ‘‘Alzheimer’’, ‘‘Alzheimer’s disease’’, and ‘‘AD’’ combined with ‘‘prevalence’’, ‘‘incidence’’, and ‘‘epidemiology’’. A Bayesian random effects model with 95 % credible intervals was used. The I 2 statistic was applied to assess heterogeneity. Results: The prevalence of <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease in <b>Europe</b> was estimated at 5. 05 % (95 % CI, 4. 73 - 5. 39). The prevalence in men was 3. 31 % (95 % CI, 2. 85 - 3. 80) and in women, 7. 13 % (95 % CI, 6. 56 - 7. 72), and increased with age. The incidence of <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease in <b>Europe</b> was 11. 08 per 1000 person-years (95 % CI, 10. 30 - 11. 89). Broken down by sex, it was 7. 02 per 1000 person-years (95 % CI, 6. 06 - 8. 05) in men and 13. 25 per 1000 person-years (95 % CI, 12. 05 - 14. 51) in women; again these rates increased with age. Conclusions: The results of our meta-analysis allow a better grasp of the impact of this disease in Europe...|$|R
30|$|A {{political}} {{ethics of}} migration must start with goals and principles but cannot end there. It must also respond to circumstances. The medical ethics of fighting Ebola in Africa will differ {{from that of}} treating <b>Alzheimer</b> patients in <b>Europe.</b> The context of migration in the Mediterranean is similarly different from that {{in other parts of}} the world. Taking contexts into account is difficult for political theorists who are trained to think non-contextually. The point of doing so is obviously not to become parochial and ignore the rest of the world. It is instead to compare across contexts and to look for both similarities and differences.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDementia is, unfortunately, a {{well-known}} problem of nowadays, {{product of a}} set of generational transformations as a result of better life conditions. Since, we cannot eradicate this problem; we can try to develop means to minimize the effects in population's life. Alzheimer disease is one type of dementia that affects already 7, 3 million people only in <b>Europe.</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> does not only affect the person who is ill but also their families and friends, at different levels such as personal, emotional, social and financial. In this paper, we present a preliminary version of an interactive application that based on a narrative retrospective of the patient's life tries to fight the evolution of the disease and maximize the patients’ cognitive function. With this we aim to minimize the effects of the illness and improve the life not only of the patient but also of his/her caring ones...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{we examine}} how European patients' {{organizations}} (EPOs) contribute to moving patient advocacy beyond national level organizing and acting. In contrast to Europeanization studies, our contention is that EPOs are not content merely to bring national claims {{up to the}} European level nor simply enrich national debates with European issues. Rather, we argue that EPOs engage in a compounded multilevel construction of patients as 'European individuals' and of their conditions as matters of concern for Europe. Based on {{an analysis of the}} projects, pronouncements, and politics of three EPOs - European Organization on Rare Diseases, <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>Europe,</b> and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Europe - we explore how they form European communities of patients and give shape to health issues they deem important to address at European level. We show that EPOs' involvement in the ongoing construction of Europe relies on their capacities to collect, format, and circulate comparative facts, figures, and data on the functioning of domestic health systems, drawn notably on their members' experiences. This helps them to raise discussions on the need for European health-care policies which articulate a 'Europe of markets' and a 'social Europe' to the, benefit of the patients. We discuss the form of politics that this EPOs' 'evidence-based activism', as we all it, entails, and conclude with a few thoughts on their influence on the making of European health-care policies...|$|E
40|$|Cost {{assessment}} of Alzheimer’s {{disease is a}} difficult task, {{all the more so}} when making a European comparison. How can costs be defined and measured when systems for taking charge of patients or reimbursements differ and when data in some countries are non-existent? The European Commission within the public health community action programme of 2003 - 2008 finances the European Collaboration on Dementia Socio-Economic Group. The programme was set up and coordinated by <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>Europe</b> and supported by the Alzheimer Médéric Foundation. The Group has created an economic model of the costs of the disease, making various assumptions, approximations and options based on identified economic data available in international literature. The total cost of Alzheimer’s disease or diseases of the same type within Europe (UE 27) is estimated at 160. 3 billion euros in 2008 (1. 3 % of the 2008 gross domestic product of UE 27), of which 71. 7 billion in direct costs (45 %) and 88. 6 billion (55 %) in indirect costs. The annual costs per person suffering from Alzheimer’s disease are estimated at 22, 194 euros of which 9, 925 euros in direct costs and 12, 270 euros in indirect costs. For the UE 27 zone, the disease’s load is estimated at 2. 12 million years of DALY-disability adjusted life years (441 of DALY-disability adjusted life years for 100. 000 people). This load is heavier than that of diabetes...|$|E
40|$|YesObjectives: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) {{are crucial}} to improving timely diagnosis, but little is reported about how they perceive dementia, and whether their perceptions display any elements of stigma. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore how GPs’ perceptions of dementia map onto current conceptualizations of stigma and whether GPs feel that stigma affects timely diagnosis. Methods: Twenty-three GPs from England were interviewed by telephone. Data were analyzed by means of content analysis. This involved open coding followed by the application of a coding framework derived from the literature to explore how and to what extent their perceptions relate to stigma as well as the unique nature of their perceptions. Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis: (1) ‘making sense of dementia’, (2) ‘relating perceptions of dementia to oneself’ and (3) ‘considering the consequences of dementia’. GPs’ perceptions of dementia mapped onto current conceptualizations of stigma. Perceptions about dementia that were linked to their own existential anxiety and to a perceived similarity between people with dementia and themselves were particularly salient. GPs perceived dementia as a stigma which was gradually being overcome but that stigma still hindered timely diagnosis. They provided examples of structural discrimination within the health service, including lack of time for patients and shortcomings in training that were to the detriment of people with dementia. Conclusion: Measures to involve GPs in tackling stigma should include training and opportunities to explore how they perceive dementia, as well as support to address structural discrimination.

40|$|Adult-child {{caregiver}} · <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease · <b>Europe</b> · Observational study · Spousal caregiver Background/Aims: To examine {{factors influencing}} the caregiver burden in adult-child and spousal caregivers of community-dwelling patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Methods: Baseline {{data from the}} 18 -month, prospective, observational GERAS study of 1, 497 patients with AD in France, Germany, and the UK were used. Analyses were performed on two groups of caregivers: spouses (n = 985) and adult children (n = 405). General linear models estimated patient and caregiver factors associated with subjective caregiver burden assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview. Results: The caregiver burden increased with AD severity. Adult-child caregivers experienced a higher burden than spousal caregivers despite spending less time caring. Worse patient functional ability and more caregiver distress were independently as-sociated with a greater burden in both adult-child and spousal caregivers. Additional factors were differentially associated with a greater caregiver burden in both groups. In adult-child caregivers these were: living with the patient, patient living in an urban location, and patient with a fall in the past 3 months; in spouses the factors were: caregiver gender (female) an...|$|R
40|$|Aims To {{ensure that}} all <b>Alzheimer</b> centres across <b>Europe</b> are capable of using a similar method of data collection. Information about the patient {{assessment}} tools used by each participating centre was obtained and normal clinical practice in each EADC centre was documented by collecting data from routine new patient consultation. Methods Twenty new consecutive patients with objective memory impairment were recruited in each Alzheimer centre over 6 months. Each patient consultation was carried out according to routine clinical practice. Patient data were recorded using the anonymous patient protocol (demographic, diagnosis, MMSE score, patient assessment scales, and most prominent behavioural problem). Information about neuropsychological assessment tools used in each centre was take to account to harmonise research practice for future multicentre collaboration. Results Seven hundred and four patients from 36 memory clinics in 13 countries across Europe participated in the study. [M:F ratio 0. 67. Mean age 75. 4 SD 9. 3 (51 - 102) Mean MMSE 21 SD 6 (0 - 30) ] Five hundred and fifty-five patients had a clinical diagnosis of dementia [Alzheimer's disease (68. 5 %), vascular dementia (10. 3 %), frontal lobe dementia (5. 6 %), Lewy body dementia (4. 1 %), mixed dementia (5. 6 %) ]. Duration of symptoms: 0 - 6 months 6. 5 %; 6 - 12 months 16. 1 %; 1 - 2 years 30. 5 %; 2 - 5 years 46. 9 %. Assessment scales used: Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 48. 9 %, Reisberg's Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) 38. 6 %, ADL/IADL (Lawton and Brody, 1969) 37. 5 %, Neuropsychological Inventory (NPI) 28. 6 %, Geriatric Depression Scale 22 %, ADL (Katz et al., 1963) 19. 2 %, ADAS-Cog 14. 9 %, Cornell Scale for Depression 12. 9 %, Grober and Bushke Selective Reminding Test 11. 5 %, ADCS/ADL 7. 7 %. 64. 8 % of the patients experienced behavioural symptoms: apathy 13. 6 %; anxiety 12. 8 %; dysphoria 9. 9 %; irritability 7. 8 %; agitation 5. 5 %; hallucinations 3. 6 %; delusions 3. 6 %, sleep disorder 2. 4 %; desinhibition 2 %. Conclusions The {{most common type of}} cognitive decline was Alzheimer's disease followed by mild cognitive impairment and vascular dementia. CDR, GDS Reisberg, and ADL/IADL were used widely (40 - 50 %). The NPI, geriatric depression scale and ADL (Katz, 1963) were only used in 20 % of the centres. We verified large differences in the tools use in the EADC centres to evaluate patients with dementia across Europe.

40|$|Introduction: The {{incidence}} and prevalence of global dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increase with age, almost doubling {{every five years}} after the sixth decade of life. Demographic aging is a reality in Portugal, being expectable that the number of dementia cases also increases. Even so, dementia-epidemiological data in Portugal is scarce and cost-of-illness studies are almost inexistent. Our aims were to obtain up-to-date information about the prevalence of dementia/ Alzheimer’s disease in Portugal, to estimate the number of cases effectively diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease and to determine illness-costs with specific dementia treatment. Material and Methods: The numbers of age-adjusted prevalence of dementia obtained for Occidental <b>Europe</b> (<b>Alzheimer’s</b> Disease International study), where applied to the resident population in Portugal (2013). Estimations related to diagnosis and treatment-costs were based in data provided by the Intercontinental Marketing Services Health (IMSH) – 2013. Results: The estimated number of Portuguese people with dementia among those aged ≥ 60 years, is 160287, representing 5. 91 % of this population-stratum. Knowing Alzheimer’s disease is responsible for 50 - 70 % of all cases, we might conclude there are between 80144 and 112201 patients. According to IMSH-data, 76250 receive anti-dementia drugs and the costs of this kind of medication is 37 M€/year. Conclusions: As a consequence of the demographic aging, also the number of dementia cases increases. Aparentely, not all Alzheimer’s disease patients receive the recommended medication, suggesting this condition is still under-diagnosed. However, figures indicate a positive progression with an increment of treated cases and a reduction of medication-costs...|$|R
