5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down.

Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, <b>and</b> <b>overnight</b> developed pneumonia and heart failure.

5|$|After a brief stay in Sydney {{where the}} battalion's {{equipment}} deficiencies were made good and some reinforcements were received from local recruit training depots, they embarked again on 10 January in company with HMAS Canberra, and proceeded through the Bass Strait. As {{they were under}} way, the troops were kept occupied with training on the Bren light machine gun and the Thompson sub-machine gun, quantities of which were hastily added to the battalion's equipment scale. They reached Fremantle, Western Australia, on 15 January <b>and</b> <b>overnight,</b> {{a large number of}} 2/4th men defied orders to stay aboard ship and went ashore to spend time with their families; when the Aquitania sailed the next day, 94 men were left behind. The situation in Malaya was grave as the Japanese were steadily pushing the British and Commonwealth defenders south down the peninsula and as the gravity of the situation dawned upon the Australian government, a knee-jerk reaction saw the dispatch of 150 partially trained reinforcements from Northam. They arrived just as the Aquitania departed, being ferried out to Rottnest Island where they joined the ship's company late in the afternoon of 16 January. Although the reinforcements made good the men that had been left behind, they were only partially trained and ill-prepared for the fighting that would follow.|$|E

5|$|On occasion, the {{convection}} of {{the system}} would flare up, {{and in the early}} morning hours of November 3, the Naval Air Station at Boca Chica, Florida reported winds of 50mph (80km/h), which would mean the depression may have attained tropical storm status. A similar report was filed at the Air Force Station at Cudjoe Key. After another reconnaissance flight was sent out to study the system, and recorded that surface area temperatures had dropped, the flight-level winds had reached 92mph (147km/h) and the surface area pressure had reached 998millibars (29.47 inHg). In the evening <b>and</b> <b>overnight</b> hours of November 3, the tropical depression continued to the northeast, making landfall in Florida at a location near Tampa Bay. The depression crossed Florida, weakening significantly, and becoming extratropical.
