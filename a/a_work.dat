We show that an increasing uncertainty of the workforce be-cause of an organisational shock increases the probability of an establishment which indicate that the risk insurance function of <b>a</b> <b>works</b> council partly determines the trigger to establish <b>a</b> <b>works</b> council. The organisational shock is prevalent in around 40 percent of the companies establishing <b>a</b> <b>works</b> council.

5|$|Constantine was a {{ruler of}} major importance, {{and he has}} always been a {{controversial}} figure. The fluctuations in Constantine's reputation reflect the nature of the ancient sources for his reign. These are abundant and detailed, but have been strongly influenced by the official propaganda of the period, and are often one-sided. There are no surviving histories or biographies dealing with Constantine's life and rule. The nearest replacement is Eusebius's Vita Constantini, <b>a</b> <b>work</b> that is a mixture of eulogy and hagiography. Written between 335AD and circa 339AD, the Vita extols Constantine's moral and religious virtues. The Vita creates a contentiously positive image of Constantine, and modern historians have frequently challenged its reliability. The fullest secular life of Constantine is the anonymous Origo Constantini. <b>A</b> <b>work</b> of uncertain date, the Origo focuses on military and political events, to the neglect of cultural and religious matters.|$|E

5|$|Greek epigrams {{contribute}} {{their share}} in Pliny's descriptions of pictures and statues. One {{of the minor}} authorities for books XXXIV–XXXV is Heliodorus of Athens, the author of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> on the monuments of Athens. In the indices to XXXIII–XXXVI, an important place is assigned to Pasiteles of Naples, the author of <b>a</b> <b>work</b> in five volumes on famous works of art (XXXVI:40), probably incorporating {{the substance of the}} earlier Greek treatises; but Pliny's indebtedness to Pasiteles is denied by Kalkmann, who holds that Pliny used the chronological work of Apollodorus of Athens, as well as a current catalogue of artists. Pliny's knowledge of the Greek authorities was probably mainly due to Varro, whom he often quotes (e.g. XXXIV:56, XXXV:173, 156, XXXVI:17, 39, 41).|$|E
