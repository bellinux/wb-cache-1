40|$|Alternative dispute {{resolution}} (<b>ADR)</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as mediation and arbitration, {{are becoming increasingly}} used to help resolve disputes {{in a variety of}} areas. Among <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures,</b> mediation is the most utilized yet least analyzed procedure. This article examines negotiations and {{dispute resolution}} using the tools of general equilibrium theory. Specifically, mediators function as the Walrasian auctioneers of exchange theory by altering trade-off rates among bargaining issues. In this way, mediators facilitate a process leading towards voluntary settlements. This idea of Walrasian mediation is supported by the literature on mediation and mediator techniques, and so this insight opens up mediation to much more rigorous economic analysis. Among the implications of this approach are: (1) successful mediation leads to Pareto efficient settlements; (2) non-neutral mediators can guide negotiators towards preferred outcomes by introducing resources into mediation; (3) mediation Pareto dominates arbitration for resolving disputes. mediation, dispute resolution, exchange economy...|$|E

40|$|My task is {{to assess}} {{the ways in which}} {{alternative}} dispute resolution procedures may be adapted to deal with international labor disputes. ADR refers to various methods by which neutral third parties assist persons engaged in a conflict to settle their differences without involving the decision-making power of the state or other sanction-imposing body. Both mediation and arbitration are included. In mediation the neutral seeks to get the parties to agree on a mutually acceptable solution. In arbitration the neutral imposes a solution after presentations by the contending parties. A third term, conciliation, is sometimes used and generally connotes a milder form of intervention than mediation. A conciliator may simply get the parties talking and do little to direct the course of their exchanges. A mediator usually aims at a more structured dialogue. In each instance, the <b>ADR</b> <b>procedure</b> is a substitute for a more formal adversarial action before a court or administrative agency. At their best, mediation and arbitration have the advantages of speed, cost savings, and informality over court or administrative proceedings...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] A major {{development}} in {{systems for the}} enforcement of individual employment rights {{is the use of}} alternative dispute resolution (<b>ADR)</b> <b>procedures</b> to resolve claims by employees. At their best, <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures</b> may hold the potential for greater accessibility by employees to enforcement of substantive employment rights, while avoiding burdens of excessive costs for the public and employers in processing claims. On the other hand, <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures,</b> particularly mandatory employment arbitration procedures, have also been criticized for producing the privatization of justice and denial of effective enforcement of employee rights. In this paper, we present the results of a new empirical study of employment arbitration. Despite the growing importance of employment arbitration in the workplace, empirical research on this phenomenon remains in its infancy and views on arbitration are often characterized by assumptions and anecdotal impressions. In the analysis presented here we attempt to systematically examine some of the common assumptions about the decision-making of employment arbitrators. In particular, we examine three propositions that are often injected into discussions of arbitral decision-making: 1) Arbitrators will tend to favor compromise decisions, proverbially “splitting the baby” between the two parties. 2) Arbitrators will be less inclined to award very large damage claims of the type more sometimes seen in jury decisions. 3) Arbitrators will prefer to award at least some small, token amount of damages to a party bringing a case rather than deny any recovery. We analyze these propositions using a unique dataset developed from analysis of employment arbitration case files of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), arguably the leading provider of employment arbitration services in the country...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is threefold: 1) compare the labor {{arbitration}} procedures of the U.

It is generally accepted that American labor arbitration is not a perfect process, but it is a reasonable Alternate Dispute Resolution (<b>ADR)</b> <b>Procedure.</b> More importantly, it is less expensive than litigation, and it provides finality to workplace disputes. In the volatile industrial economy of China, one could reasonably expect that there is the potential for future labor disputes that may seriously affect its economic growth and prosperity. Therefore, a proactive strategy for managing the concerted activities of the workers and the subsequent labor disputes is of utmost importance to the economic welfare of China and to foreign investors. The massive workforce and the steady flow of rural workers to highly industrialized urban areas not only provide cheap labor but also the potential for labor unrest. To assure its future in the global economy, China must prepare a sound labor relations strategy that minimizes workplace disputes and keeps labor unrest at a minimum. Accordingly, this paper will posit how the present Chinese laws and regulations may best be utilized to meet that objective...|$|R

40|$|Anthropologists of law {{have long}} studied {{reconciliation}} {{to understand how}} people resolve disputes. Studies on conflict resolution and on reconciliation examine a general process of reconciliation deployed to restore harmony and prevent retaliation. This role of reconciliation often becomes {{a significant part of}} the Alternative Dispute Resolution (<b>ADR)</b> <b>procedure</b> that seeks to include local actors and local institutions in dispute resolutions. Studies of ADR often assume that reconciliation takes place between individuals or groups of individual over issues related to, among others, property, domestic violence or inheritance. &# 13; &# 13; My research wants to bring the state back into the analysis of reconciliation by introducing the state, or those representing the interests of the state, as a party to the reconciliation process. The research sheds light on reconciliation as a discursive imagination, while still maintaining a general perspective that reconciliation is a method people use in or outside the courts to resolve disputes. The research investigates proliferations of reconciliation discourse as it enters national political space. The analysis of transnational proliferation of discourse relies on the notion of ‘critical disjuncture’ (Appadurai, 1996) to examine discursive shifts that produce a specific political and legal constellation to come to terms with the legacy of New Order violence. The research maintains that ‘critical disjuncture’ emerges when state apparatuses, human rights activists, public intellectuals and victims of violence resort to the transnational discourse of reconciliation to negotiate their engagement with the legacy or the memory of violence. This ‘critical disjuncture’ constitutes the social life of reconciliation that is the focus of my research. My interest rests less on analysing different forms of reconciliation than on following the processes that make reconciliation what it is, whatever form it takes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of nonbinding {{recommendations}} on bargaining outcomes. Recommendations are theorized to have two effects: they can create a focal point for final bargaining positions, and they can decrease outcome uncertainty should dispute persist. While the focal point effect may help lower dispute rates, the uncertainty reduction effect is predicted to do the opposite for risk-averse bargainers. Which of these effects dominates is of critical importance in the optimal design of alternative dispute resolution (<b>ADR)</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are becoming increasingly utilized to help resolve disputes in a variety of settings. We theoretically examine the effects of recommendations on the bargaining contract zone. Our theoretical framework, which allows bargainers ’ final positions to influence a binding outcome should negotiations fail, provides for a more stringent test of focal points than previously considered. We also present data from controlled laboratory bargaining experiments that are consistent with our model of recommendation effects. Recommendations are empirically shown to influence final bargaining positions and negotiated settlement values. Furthermore, dispute rates are significantly lower when one includes recommendations, even where the recommendation is completely ignored in final-stage arbitration. This highlights a potentially significant role for the use of nonbinding procedures, such as mediation, as a preliminary stage in developing more efficient <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are {{threat to}} the patient’s safety {{and the quality of}} life, and they increase the cost of health care. Spontaneous ADR reporting system mainly relies on physicians, but also pharmacists, nurses, and even patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore attitudes, barriers, and possible improvements to ADR reporting practices in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was developed to collect data on the perception of pharmacovigilance practice and ADR reporting. The survey was conducted in the period between September, 2014 and October, 2014. Results: The response rate was 73 % (44 of 60) and 93 % (148 of 160) among the pharmacist and family medicine physician groups, respectively. Regarding the attitudes to pharmacovigilance practice and reporting, both the pharmacists and physicians found the practices important. The majority of pharmacists and physicians in year 2014 did not report any ADR, while 18 % of the pharmacists and 12 % of the physicians, who participated in this study, reported one <b>ADR.</b> Reporting <b>procedure,</b> uncertainty, and their exposure were the main barriers to reporting ADRs for the pharmacists. The physicians claimed lack of knowledge to whom to report an ADR as the main barrier. A significant number of the respondents thought that additional education in ADR reporting would have a positive impact, and would increase the ADR reporting rate. Conclusions: Despite the overall positive attitude towards ADR reporting, the reporting rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still low. Different barriers to the ADR reporting have been identified, and there is also the need for improvements in the traditional education in this field. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{the purpose}} of the study Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are important public health problem with significant morbidity, mortality and financial burden on the society. Nurses play important role in medication safety surveillance through the spontaneous reporting of ADRs. Nurses' knowledge, attitude and practice towards ADR reporting and factors affecting reporting was assessed in the study. MethodsAll nurses working in a tertiary care hospital, Ajman, UAE participated in this cross-sectional survey. A self administered questionnaire of four domains (knowledge, attitude, practice, factors affecting reporting) was distributed among nurses after obtaining informed consent. The knowledge and attitude components were assigned score of one for correct response. Data was analyzed using SPSS (version 19). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare knowledge and attitude scores between subgroups; Spearman's correlation for any relationship between knowledge and attitude. ResultsOf the total participants, females constituted 92. 3 %; average duration of clinical experience 6. 5 +/- 3. 3 years; mean age 28. 9 +/- 4. 1 years. Median score for knowledge components of ADR reporting was 11 (total score: 17) and for attitude components was 4 (total score: 8). No difference noted in knowledge and attitude scores between gender, age group, educational qualification. A positive correlation between knowledge and attitude components was observed(r = 0. 38). ADRs are important cause for morbidity and mortality was reported by (54. 9 %). 49. 5 % were aware of Pharmacovigilance centers' whereas, only (8. 8 %) reported. Uncertainty of ADRs (49. 5 %); concern that the report may be wrong (46. 2 %) and inadequate knowledge of <b>ADR</b> reporting <b>procedure</b> were the major barriers to reporting. Training in ADR reporting as the key measure to improve reporting was suggested by (86. 8 %).

40|$|Traditionally, {{academics}} {{specializing in}} <b>ADR</b> and civil <b>procedure</b> have not tended {{to deal with}} each other 2 ̆ 7 s issues. The typical civil procedure course focuses on litigation, and at best throws in a few classes on mediation and negotiation. Similarly, the typical ADR course devotes little or no attention to litigation, law, courts, or administrative institutions. Thus, the two disciplines are taught quite separately. Further, this separation is not equal. While {{students are required to}} learn about litigation, and are also offered many additional litigation electives, the ADR curriculum is almost always purely elective, and the classes are much smaller.

40|$|Continuing {{a survey}} of contractors' {{perceptions}} about alternative dispute resolution (ADR) this paper seeks to report {{an investigation of the}} level of involvement of legal advisors to the construction industry in the dispute resolution process and the perceptions that legal professionals have about the use of ADR in construction disputes. The research findings are that contractors are likely to involve lawyers in the dispute resolution procedure, particularly when disputes concern a legal issue, when the parties to the dispute are entrenched in their argument, or when the other party insists on using legal professional assistance. In these defined circumstances, legal advisors will be influential in determining the potential use of ADR. The paper concludes that lawyers are unlikely to recommend ADR for most disputes between contractors, particularly if the dispute resolution process is perceived to involve the use of delay by main contractors, if the parties are fixed in their arguments or if they are exhibiting adversarial behaviour in their approach to the dispute. In these circumstances lawyers and their clients prefer the force of the formal systems over conciliatory <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures.</b> Alternative Dispute Resolution, Contractors, Dispute Resolution, Lawyers,...|$|E
40|$|When {{different}} legal controversies arise, parties frequently employ alternative {{dispute resolution}} procedures to resolve them. Yet {{some members of}} ethnic minority groups and women may seek judicial proceedings out of a concern that their ethnicity or gender may undermine their ability to achieve beneficial bargaining outcomes through ADR. This article addresses the real and perceived challenges of ethnic minorities and women in ADR. It draws upon decades of research into dispute resolution bargaining processes to illustrate that most traits associated with ethnicity and gender are irrelevant today with respect to ADR. When persons are taught even minimally about the bargaining process and how it operates, such information greatly enhances their likelihood of interacting effectively. Well-prepared minorities and women should thus be able to seek advantageous terms for themselves in ADR, even when dealing with white-male counterparts. Conversely, {{there is no guarantee}} that members of ethnic groups or women would achieve more advantageous outcomes in judicial proceedings.

40|$|Alternative dispute {{resolution}} (ADR) {{refers to a}} set of practices and techniques aimed at permitting the resolution of legal disputes outside the courts. It is normally thought to encompass mediation, arbitration, and a variety of “hybrid ” processes by which a neutral facilitates the resolution of legal disputes without formal adjudication. These alternatives to adjudication are advocated on a variety of grounds. Potential benefits are said to include the reduction of the transaction costs of {{dispute resolution}} because ADR processes may be cheaper and faster than ordinary judicial proceedings; the creation of resolutions that are better suited to the parties ’ underlying interests and needs; and improved ex post compliance with the terms of the resolution.

Part I provides essential background for understanding ADR by focusing on arbitration and mediation. By comparing these processes with adjudication and negotiation – the two procedures conventionally used to resolve legal disputes – the potential advantages and disadvantages of arbitration and mediation are exposed and briefly analyzed.

Successful resolutions of protests depends on a number of factors, including government and private sector protest management and litigation strategies; Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) policies of federal agencies; legal and regulatory requirements; and remedies available to contractors. Our research identifies and analyzes best ADR practices and other remedies and preventions for resolving bid protests. Areas examined include processes and remedies utilized by selected federal agencies and obstacles to fomenting improved cooperation between industry and government, which may preclude win-win resolutions to bid protests. Insights regarding the validity of our entering hypotheses about ADR are obtained from a survey of acquisition and legal professionals regarding their perceptions, opinions, and recommendations on bid protest practices and the use of <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures.</b> Our objectives are to identify ADR and other process improvement recommendations that are crucial to effective contracting and support the government's efforts to improve adjudicative forums for resolution of contract disputes and bid protests. Our research suggests that agencies can mitigate protest expenses and interruptions by managing the protest process in a systematic, business-like way. At the present time, agencies rarely use most procedural tools that are required or authorized under Federal laws and regulations to reduce time delays and costs from bid protests. Among other things, we recommend energetic agency approaches to preventing disputes (e. g., quality debriefings), and dealing with disputes (e. g., formal cost-benefit analysis of agency defense strategies, strong defense of agency actions, and full use of ADR methods).

40|$|As {{everything}} else in life has become more global, so has the practice of law. Lawyers commonly have clients and conduct work in states other than the ones in which they reside and are licensed. Transactional lawyers commonly work for clients in different states or put together deals that close in states other than the ones {{in which they are}} licensed. Litigators, too, often have clients in other states, participate in court proceedings in other states, and engage in both formal and informal discovery in other states. The work of the litigator poses even more questions if that litigator is engaged in alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) as opposed to traditional litigation. Questions involving ADR and the unauthorized practice of law abound because of some fundamental distinctions between ADR and traditional litigation. For example, parties to <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures</b> may purposefully choose to conduct their dispute-resolution procedure in a neutral location, while in traditional litigation the location of the suit must be in a location upon which jurisdiction and venue are established. 2 In the case of a neutral-site ADR procedure, questions may arise as to where exactly the lawyers are practicing and whether the principles surrounding the rules relating to the unauthorized practice of law (“UPL”) —such as familiarity with local rules and customs—have any application to the situation. Even assuming the ADR procedure is related to the foreign jurisdiction (i. e., {{at least one of the}} parties is located in the foreign jurisdiction or the proceeding involves a claim under the law of the foreign jurisdiction), questions arise as to whether or not a lawyer could even receive temporary admission in another jurisdiction if the ADR procedure is not connected to a trial or administrative proceeding. In other words, despite the fact that the practice of law has become a national—and international—practice, state law and ethical rules governing lawyers generally limits a lawyer’s practice to the states in which the lawyer is licensed. Although some strides have been made in the recognition of the global practice of law, the statutes and rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, particularly as they relate to multijurisdictional practice, remain inconsistent. Because of the lingering inconsistencies, lawyers still need to be aware of whether their activities constitute the practice of law, where their activities are taking place, and what, if anything, the lawyers should do if they are practicing law in a jurisdiction in which they are not licensed. This article attempts to give an overview of the problem facing litigators in their increasingly global practice, as well as the steps that litigators can take to act in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines. Accordingly, this article is divided into two broad areas. First, this article will discuss what activities constitute the practice of law and which jurisdiction’s law should govern, focusing on whether ADR practices constitute the practice of law. Second, if the litigator is engaged in the practice of law, this article considers what actions the litigator should take in order to comply with the applicable ethical rules. In 2002, the ABA proposed Model Rule of Professional Conduct 5. 5 in an attempt to answer many of these questions relating to the unauthorized practice of law, including the questions related to multijurisdictional ADR practice. The proposed Model Rule would largely exempt ADR practice from the realm of the unauthorized practice of law. Nearly five years later, however, the states have not uniformly adopted Model Rule 5. 5, particularly as that rule relates to <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures.</b> 8 Because Model Rule 5. 5 would answer many, if not all, of these questions, these authors recommend that the remaining states consider this rule and adopt the rule, or a similar rule, in order to create a more uniform national practice...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{absence of}} {{appropriate}} and effective mechanisms for consumer disputes {{in a legal}} system {{can result in a}} denial of access to justice. Consumers struggle to have their disputes settled because most of their claims are of small value and some consumers are low-income earners. Costs of litigating a claim in the formal court system are very high and the procedural formalities involved hinder consumers‟access to justice. As a result, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) seems to address that challenge as an appropriate approach to consumer disputes because it promises cost effective, efficient and fast mechanisms of resolving disputes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the role of alternative dispute resolution in Lesotho in consumer protection. This is achieved by examining the available dispute resolution processes and how they function. Also, this study makes a comparison with the South African law regulating consumer protection in particular dispute resolution. It discusses ADR in consumer protection at international level as contained in the OECD report and EU Directives. The problem that exists in the market place is that bargaining power favours the sellers. As a result there are laws in place that protect consumers against manipulative or fraudulent sellers, but those laws do not mean anything to consumers if they cannot be enforced through proper channels for their benefit. Therefore, there have been various ADR mechanisms adopted by different legal systems in order to assist consumers to fully realise their rights. Some of these ADR mechanisms might be appropriate for consumer disputes but are very advanced and are not appropriate for a country like Lesotho due to the nature of consumers there and the country‟s economy. Despite South Africa being more economically developed compared to Lesotho it has introduced some of the <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures</b> which are easy to establish and seem to be working well to address consumers‟ claims. As a result, this study would recommend Lesotho to amend its laws in relation to consumer dispute resolution and revise Consumer policy which has been adopted recently...|$|E
40|$|On August 1, 2005, {{significant}} {{amendments to}} the Washington Condominium Act (WCA) became effective. These amendments were intended to substantially reduce water infiltration in multiunit residential buildings and to simplify the condominium construction dispute resolution process. The heart of the amendments is the implementation of alternative dispute resolution (<b>ADR)</b> <b>procedures,</b> as well as fee-shiftingprovisions which require the non-prevailing party to pay the attorney fees and costs of the prevailing party. A decade of lawsuits brought under the WCA by condominium owners associations against builders and developers, and in turn by builders against subcontractors, alleging defects {{in the ability of}} the building envelopes to resist water from entering into the structures ultimately led to appointment of a Legislative Study Committee on Water Penetration of Condominiums (Committee) in 2004. The Committee was charged with presenting recommendations to address and hopefully solve water intrusion problems that resulted in a proliferation of lawsuits. The litigation led to a crisis in the construction industry, forcing many developers, builders and contractors out of business because of lack of affordable insurance. Indeed, many insurers left the Washington construction market. To address this crisis and attempt to reverse this trend, the 2005 amendments provide a dual-track approach by (1) improving the quality of multiunit residential construction and (2) reducing litigation costs associated with complex, multi-party lawsuits involving condominiums by implementing innovative ADR processes. Specifically, these amendments are designed to increase the confidence of homeowners, developers, and insurers by: 1. Requiring the submission of detailed building enclosure plans for multiunit residential building enclosures; 2. Requiring course-of-construction building enclosure inspections by qualified independent professionals to verify substantial compliance with the plans; 3. Increasing the role of professionals in the construction and dispute resolution process; 4. Requiring in-place water testing of windows; 5. Promoting early and cost effective settlement of disputes by providing standards for arbitration and mediation as alternatives to litigation; and 6. Promoting earlier settlement of such suits by creating an attorney fee-shifting mechanism. The significance of these amendments can be seen when compared to the previous statute. Thus, Part II of this Article presents background information on Washington condominium law and earlier attempts to address those problems. Part III presents several of the key issues that faced the Committee, and discusses how the final 2005 amendments addressed those issues. Part IV discusses several practical problems and concerns that have arisen in the course of delivering nearly a dozen presentations about the amendments to various groups such as lawyers, insurers, architects, engineers and forensic experts over the eight months since the amendments became effective. Part V concludes that the amendments are a win-win for homeowners and developers...|$|E
40|$|By {{the time}} Professor Richard Delgado {{and his colleagues}} wrote their seminal article on the risk of {{alternative}} dispute resolution (ADR) facilitating prejudice, ADR programs were well-established in the United States, supported by legislative and court mandates, private contracts, and U. S. Supreme Court decisions. Fairness and Formality: Minimizing the Risk of Prejudice in Alternative Dispute Resolution and Delgado’s subsequent review article, ADR and the Dispossessed: Recent Books About the Deformalization Movement, were cited hundreds of times by scholars and practitioners but did little to stop the movement to substitute mediation, arbitration, and other dispute resolution procedures for public adjudication. Conflict resolution theorists and practitioners celebrated mediation for its relationship-preserving and restorative potential, judges celebrated ADR in its various forms for its potential to reduce court workloads, and institutional defendants publicly welcomed the possibility of reducing legal expenses and delay by relying on mediation and arbitration in lieu of litigation. Informal dispute resolution was touted by all {{as an antidote to}} the presumed burdens court procedures imposed on lay litigants. Privately, many corporate defendants hoped that ADR would diminish claiming rates or diminish the settlement value of claims (or both). Delgado et al. hypothesized that because <b>ADR</b> <b>procedures</b> frequently incorporate features that social science research has identified as facilitating prejudice, the procedures would produce biased outcomes. Although framed in normative terms, their hypothesis is subject to empirical testing. In the three decades following the publication of Fairness and Formality, a small cadre of socio-legal scholars took up this challenge. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, we identified thirty-eight efforts to test empirically the hypothesis that mediation and arbitration create systematic differences in dispute resolution outcomes by gender, race, ethnicity or socio-economic stratum. Using a variety of methods, including laboratory and field experiments, surveys, and analyses of reported outcomes, empiricists have produced contrary and ultimately inconclusive results. Small samples and lack of methodological rigor reduce the reliability of the published findings. In sum, {{the answer to the question}} whether informal dispute resolution facilitates prejudice is “we don’t know. ” In an era of increasing economic inequality and ever louder expressions of racial, ethnic, and gender prejudice, we have a responsibility to learn more about how public policies that continue to favor alternative dispute resolution are affecting less powerful groups in U. S. society. At the same time, rather than turning our backs on public adjudication, we should invest in ensuring that our courts truly provide “equal justice for all. ...|$|E
