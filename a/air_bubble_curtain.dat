Information gathered from 51 organizations (33 utilities, seven equipment manufacturers, six research organizations, two private engineering firms, one steel mill, and two government agencies) is provided along with specific summaries of EPRI-sponsored research on behavioral barriers at pumped and hydroelectric facilities. The level of research activity indicated by utilities at pumped intakes has decreased recently, although the interest in potential plant operational impact mitigative techniques remains high. Sixteen of the organizations contacted were actively evaluating one or more intake technologies in 1987 and 1988; eight studies included behavioral barriers similar to those employed under the EPRI-sponsored studies. Two studies sponsored by EPRI at pumped cooling-water intake structures evaluated the individual and combined deterrent capabilities of three devices: an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain,</b> pneumatic guns, and underwater strobe lights. A study conducted during 1985 and 1986 at Ontario Hydro 2 ̆ 7 s nearshore testing facility, located in Lake Ontario off the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station intake, indicated that all three devices and combinations of devices elicited an avoidance response in alewife.

40|$|To prevent salp (jellyfish) from {{entering}} Diablo Canyon Power Plant’s intake pipes, and ultimately having the plant shut {{down as a}} result, an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> is anchored along the ocean floor {{for the duration of}} the salp swarm to create a barrier that prevents the salp and other debris {{from entering}} the intake. The curtain consists of four large air compressors connected to four parallel pipes with holes strategically drilled at various places along the length of the pipe. When the air compressors are turned on, a torrent of bubbles are shot out from the pipes which create a current which deters the salp from floating into the intake. As the ocean floor shifts with the current and tide, the pipes becomes unlevel and do not produce an adequate barrier of bubbles across the length of the pipe. To improve the bubble curtain, our team was tasked with creating a self-leveling anchor system to work with the existing <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> pipes. Over the course of the last academic year, we designed, built, and tested a model sized prototype of an anchoring concept that would keep the bubble curtain pipes level. The final design suspends the bubble curtain pipes from buoys. The concept uses the surface of the water to remain level, while a long tether to a ground anchor keeps it from floating freely. Through testing, we determined this design stays level independent of change in floor elevation. However, the effectiveness is dependent on the tide, and works best at low tide and in water with a low tide greater than 20 feet. We recommend designing this system for deeper sections of the intake bay, and implementing it to allow a constant upward slope in the bubble pipe. Before building a complete system, we recommend constructing and testing a partial system to insure it behaves as expected and withstands full-scale ocean conditions...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{prediction}} of structure borne noise radiation and propagation from offshore impact pile driving {{in shallow water}} environment. Noise generated by offshore impact pile driving radiates into and propagates through the air, water, and sediment medium. Predicting noise levels around the pile structure at sea is required to estimate {{the effects of the}} noise and vibration on marine life. This study used one of the commercial FE (Finite Element) code Abaqus 6. 11 to calculate harmonic and transient response of the offshore wind turbine support structure and associated acoustic pressure amplitudes due to hydraulic hammer impact on top. First of all, the study focuses on long range {{prediction of}} acoustic pressure by utilizing the results from FE model to existing parabolic equation model as its starting field. In addition to numerical approach, a simple analytic solution has been developed based on the theory of free and forced vibration of thin cylindrical shell. It is useful to calculate structural response by inputting basic pile design parameters such as length, radius and material properties instead of developing numerical models. Then the study numerically investigated effects of noise and vibration along the water - ocean bottom interface because many benthic animals live on the seabed. The ocean bottom for this study was considered as elastic medium which supports propagation of shear and interface waves in addition to compressional waves. Finally, it is important how much we can reduce the noise to protect biological damages on marine life.

40|$|Sound {{in water}} tends to travel {{much faster than}} in air. Cetaceans started to use the hearing system as a tool for their {{communication}} and so this system must have been adapted during the evolution. Every species form his specific sound repertoire which is used mainly for food finding, detection of predator or other hazards, communication and reproduction. Ocean ambient noise is created by natural sources of sound and man-made sounds (also called as anthropogenic sounds). Natural sounds are produced by marine organisms and processes like earthquakes, rainfall and so on. Anthropogenic sounds are made by man either intentionally or unintentionally and these sounds mostly disrupt the oceanic environment. Sound frequency and intensity level are the main factors when we determine the intensity of distortion in communication of Cetaceans. The most detrimental sounds are those with low frequency (from 10 to 500 Hz) and long-ranged propagation (hundreds of kilometers). Into this category we can include shipping and seismic surveys. In general, the most of anthropogenic sources of noise belong to this category. Other sources of anthropogenic noise are industrial activities, military sonar and acoustic deterrent and harassment devices (ADDs/AHDs). Responses of Cetaceans to anthropogenic noise {{can be divided into}} three categories: physiological, behavioral and acoustic. The physiological reaction can be increasing metabolism, increasing baseline concentration of glucocorticoids in the blood and ultimately reducing immunity. Behavioral responses include changes in heading patterns and swim speed, changes in diving and breathing. Also included are social activities like food finding or nursing. Every change in vocalization represents acoustic responses. With growing number of studies which prove a negative influence of anthropogenic noise on Cetaceans there is an increasing need to introduce effective measures which could reduce or limit this negative influence. For this purpose there are established marine protected areas and safety zones which avoid exposure to loud noise (circa 120 dB and more) thanks to their regulations. As well there was developed a technology to modify the ship equipment and the using of an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> in the immediate area of the industrial activity shows efficiency in acoustic attenuation...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} research was to investigate the ability of <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> deterrent systems to inhibit the movement of invasive fish. <b>Bubble</b> <b>curtains,</b> which consist of a wall of bubbles (e. g. produced by forcing air through perforated pipes), fall into the category of behavioral deterrent systems that rely on aversive stimuli (e. g. sound and light) to guide fish in taxon specific manners. These systems provide advantages over physical/mechanical screens because they do not restrict fluid flow or negatively impact navigation. <b>Bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> are particularly appealing, because they are less expensive than other electrical or sonic barriers, are easily maintained, safe, and produce complex acoustic and hydrodynamic stimuli which may be optimized to deter fish movement. However, few studies have examined whether or how <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> might work. In three studies, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), a cyprinid responsible for water quality degradation in shallow water ecosystems, was used to investigate how <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> influence fish behavior and might be optimized. First, through a laboratory experiment, two different <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> were shown to reduce passage of common carp by 75 - 80 % in both up- and down-stream directions. These findings also suggested that avoidance behaviors were attributed to fluid motion and sound stimuli. Second, a field test demonstrated that the performance of a <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> under natural conditions was consistent with laboratory results, blocking 57 ± 12 % of downstream swimming carp, versus 75 - 80 % in the laboratory. Third, a fish movement model based on diffusion theory and phonotaxic response was derived. In a novel application, a stability analysis of the fish movement model demonstrated that acoustic stimuli produced by the <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> can be sufficient to disrupt movement (i. e. deter passage) of common carp. Overall, I have shown through rigorous experimental and holistic quantitative analysis that <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> can indeed deter common carp movement, but improvements must be identified in order for <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> to remain a viable management tool in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} fish passage and protection at water intakes {{is an important}} issue confronting industry and resource agency professionals throughout the world. Project owners often are required to install and evaluate protection devices to meet regulatory requirements that are associated with operating licenses and permits. There is a wide array of technologies that currently are available for use at water intakes. The goal of this report was to present information from a comprehensive review of recent studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of existing and emerging fish protection and passage technologies designed for application at water intakes. A literature search and a survey of industry and resource agency professionals were conducted to identify available literature describing the application and evaluation of passage and protection technologies. All relevant reports and publications were reviewed and a summary of project design, study methods, and effectiveness results was prepared. Available fish passage and protection technologies are diverse and vary widely with respect to biological and engineering criteria. Behavioural guidance technologies (e. g., lights and sound systems) continue to be studied extensively. However, the use of high-frequency sound to repel clupeids (shad and herring) is the only behavioural technology that has been accepted as a proven technology. Strobe lights continue to demonstrate potential for successful application based on results from controlled experiments (i. e., cage tests), but systems that have been evaluated at field sites have not demonstrated consistently high levels of effectiveness. Infrasound is an emerging technology that has been tested in controlled experiments and during some field evaluations. The ability of infrasound to repel salmonids has been demonstrated inseveral small-scale studies, but operational constraints and mixed results to date make the future use of infrasound uncertain. <b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> were examined during two field studies at Midwestern hydro sites. A new concept involving the use of turbulent surface water and increased flow velocities has been proposed and limited testing with a current inducer device has been evaluated at small New England hydro projects. Further development of the surface turbulence concept and rigorous laboratory and field testing are required before viability of such technologies are determined. Screening systems used as barriers and/or diversion structures have been widely applied. Available screening technologies continue to be evaluated to improve the effectiveness of installed systems. Relatively new screening technologies that are gaining acceptance are the high-velocity Eicher screen and Modular Inclined Screen (MIS). Modifications to traveling water screens also have been made, resulting in greater survival of impinged fish at cooling water intakes. Bar racks (perpendicular and angled to the flow) have been prescribed at a large number of FERC-licensed projects (especially projects with anadromous species), often in conjunction with surface bypasses. The effectiveness of bar rack and bypass facilities has been mixed, with studies continuing to be conducted at many projects in attempts to improve bypass efficiency. Barrier nets and louvers both have been successfully applied during the last five years at several projects. These systems, however, have stringent biological and engineering requirements that can limit their use. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a two-ring <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> system in reducing underwater sound pressures during marine pile driving was assessed through underwater sound pressure measurements. This was conducted when the three 108 m long, 2. 4 m diameter cast in steel shell piles driven in 2000 {{as part of the}} PIDP, were restruck in December of 2002. During the measurements, the <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> system was turned ON and OFF. The restrike involved driving the piles at refusal with the hammer at maximum energy (1, 600 to 1, 740 kilojoules). This condition is not anticipated during the east span SFOBB new east span construction. The reduction in sound pressures provided by the <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> system ranged considerably. The direct reduction in sound pressures, which is evaluated by comparing <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> ON and OFF measurements, for Piles 1 and 2 was 6 to 17 dB for peak pressures and 3 to 10 dB for RMS sound pressure levels. Piles 1 and 2 were located next to each other. Reductions at Pile 3, which was in shallower water, were over 20 dB for both peak pressures and RMS sound pressure levels on the north side. However, the reductions on the south side for Pile 3 were much less. Close to Pile 3 on the south side, the reductions were on the order of 5 to 7 dB. Further away at about 450 m south, the reductions were only about 2 dB. Uneven bottom topography around Pile 3, which could have compromised the <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> performance near the bay bottom, is suspected to have resulted in the lower reductions to the south.

The increasing rate and scale of benthic habitat loss under global change has magnified the importance of herbivores and highlights the need to study marine herbivory at ecologically relevant scales. Currently, underwater herbivore exclusions (or inclusions) have been restricted to small scale experimental plots, in large part due to the challenges of designing structures that can withstand the physical forces of waves and currents, without drastically altering the physical environment inside the exclusion area. We tested the ability of <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> to deter herbivorous fishes from feeding on seaweeds as an alternative to the use of rigid exclusion cages. Kelps (Ecklonia radiata) were transplanted onto reefs with high browsing herbivore pressure into either unprotected plots, exclusion cages or plots protected by <b>bubble</b> <b>curtains</b> of 0. 785 m 2 and 3. 14 m 2.

However, this method generates noise pollution and damaging shock waves. Mitigation of shocks and noises is made possible by the use of a <b>bubble</b> <b>curtain</b> set around the explosive charge. Physical aspects of shock propagation in bubbly flows have been the subject of numerous investigations in the past decades and theoretical models of aerated liquids now reproduce main shock features with acceptable accuracy in the case of a uniform distribution of bubbles of the same size.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>bubbles</b> were {{observed}} in an ice core form Asgardfonna, Spitsbergen. These were classified into four types by their shape and distribution pattern (uniform distribution type, bubble layer type, cylindrical type and cobwebbed type). Also parts which contained few <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> (clear type) {{were observed}} in the ice core. On {{the basis of this}} classification, distribution of each pattern of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> was investigated through the entire ice core (85. 5 m). Inhomogeneous distribution of each pattern with depth was observed, and was probably a result of differences of formation process or of stress condition in the ice body. From the observation of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and grains, it was found that clear parts which contain few <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are composed of grains 2 to 4 times larger than those of the neighboring parts, and that “cobwebbed <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> type” was observed only at grain boundaries. If this type of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> was affected by solar radiation during the formation process, they probably reflect that a bare ice field existed at that time...|$|R
40|$|Everybody {{has seen}} how <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> ascend in water. An {{interested}} observer remarks that the <b>air</b> <b>bubble’s</b> diameter increases during the ascent, therefore the following questions. Why do <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> ascend and not descend? Why does an <b>air</b> <b>bubble’s</b> diameter increase during ascent? How fast does an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> move? How {{long does it}} take till an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> reaches the surface? Now, we will occupy ourselves with the motion of an air pocket in a liquid. We introduce the following quantities: r = radius of the gas pocket o = surface tension of the liquid p = pressure g = acceleration of gravity (earth’s acceleration) ϕF = density of the liquid ϕG = density of the gas T 0 = depth of the air pocket at the beginning in the liquid h = heigt that the air pocket has ascended see the figure...|$|R
40|$|Detection of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in {{the blood}} is {{important}} for various medical treatments that use Extracorporeal Blood Circuits (ECBC), such as hemodialysis, hemofiltration and cardio-pulmonary bypass. Therefore a reliable <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> detector is needed. In this study designed a fault tolerant <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> detector. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) method is used on the sensor section. A voter circuit of the TMR will choose one of three sensor output to be processed further. Application of TMR will prevent errors in the detection of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles,</b> especially if the sensor fails to wor...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of various}} factors on zeta {{potential}} of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> {{in aqueous solution}} were studied. It {{was found that the}} water pH, surfactants types and concentration, and water temperature had significant roles on the zeta potential of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Increase of the water pH caused a great decrease (more negative) of the zeta potential of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> The types and concentration of surfactants were found not only affecting the intensity of the zeta potential but also determining the nature of bubble surface charges. In addition, the water temperature was also found have an obvious effect on the zeta potential of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Defects such as <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in {{membranes}} {{have been}} shown to arise during manufacturing. These defects can lead to premature degradation or failure in applications such as fuel cells. In this numerical study, a non-isothermal two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is created to investigate the behavior of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> entrained in polyphosphoric acid doped polybenzimi-dazole (PPA/PBI) membrane solution during casting as it progresses through membrane solidification. The enthalpy-porosity method is used in the CFD model to simulate the solidification process. It is shown that initially the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are semi-circular. However, as the PPA/PBI solution solidifies and passes through the mushy zone, the shape of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> change to semi-elliptical. Hence, it is found that the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> will not diffuse but rather remain in the membrane post solidification...|$|R
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> {{entrainment}} {{is defined}} as the exchange of air between the atmosphere and flowing water. Also called self-aeration, the continuous exchange between air and water is most important for the biological and chemical equilibrium on our planet. <b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment is observed in chemical, coastal, hydraulic, mechanical and nuclear engineering applications {{as well as in the}} natural environment such as waterfalls, mountain streams and river rapids, and breaking waves on the ocean surface. The resulting "white waters " provide some spectacular effects. The entrainment of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> may be localised at a flow discontinuity or continuous along an air-water free-surface: i. e., singular and interfacial aeration respectively. At a flow singularity, the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are entrained locally at the impinging perimeter and advected in a region of high turbulent shear stresses. The interfacial aeration is the <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment process along an air-water interface which is parallel to the flow direction. The onset of <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment may be expressed in terms of the tangential Reynolds stress and the fluid properties. Once self-aeration takes place, the distributions of void fraction may be modelled by some analytical solutions of the advective diffusion equation for <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> The microscopic structure of turbulent bubbly flows is complex and a number of examples are discussed. The results reveal the turbulent nature of the complex two-phase flows and the complicated interactions between entrained <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and turbulence...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of textured hydrophobic surfaces to provide substantial drag reduction has {{been attributed to}} the presence of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> trapped on the surface cavities. In this paper, we present results on water flow past a textured hydrophobic surface, while systematically varying the absolute pressure close to the surface. Trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> on the surface are directly visualized, along with simultaneous pressure drop measurements across the surface in a microchannel configuration. We find that varying the absolute pressure within the channel greatly influences the trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> behavior, causing a consequent effect on the pressure drop (drag). When the absolute pressure within the channel is maintained below atmospheric pressure, we find that the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> grow in size, merge and eventually detach from the surface. This growth and subsequent merging of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> leads to a substantial increase in the pressure drop. On the other hand, a pressure above the atmospheric pressure within the channel leads to gradual shrinkage and eventual disappearance of trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> We find that in this case, <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> do cause reduction in the pressure drop with the minimum pressure drop (or maximum drag reduction) occurring when the bubbles are flush with the surface. These results show that the trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> dynamics and the pressure drop across a textured hydrophobic microchannel are very significantly dependent on the absolute pressure within the channel. The results obtained hold important implications toward achieving sustained drag reduction in microfluidic applications...|$|R
