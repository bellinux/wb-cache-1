40|$|A {{preliminary}} design is established {{for a general}} purpose manipulator system {{which can be used}} interchangeably on the shuttle and station and can be transferred back and forth between them. Control of the manipulator is accomplished by hard wiring from internal control stations in the shuttle or station. A variety of shuttle and station manipulator operations are considered including servicing the Large Space Telescope; however, emphasis is placed on unloading modules from the shuttle and assembling the space station. Simulation studies on foveal stereoscopic viewing and manipulator supervisory computer control have been accomplished to investigate the feasibility of their use in the manipulator system. The basic manipulator system consists of a single 18. 3 m long, 7 degree of freedom (DOF), electrically <b>acutated</b> main boom with an auxiliary 3 DOF electrically actuated, extendible 18. 3 m maximum length, lighting, and viewing boom. A 3 DOF orientor assembly is located {{at the tip of the}} viewing boom to provide camera pan, tilt, and roll...|$|E
40|$|Biological systems employ {{compliant}} joints {{to allow}} robust {{contact with the}} surroundings and to increase locomotive efficiency. In this experiment, we designed a three-link robotic leg with a compliant calf tendon that was <b>acutated</b> by a DC motor at the hip and measured the effect of compliance on the force profile and energy consumption for a single jump. The lengths of the femur, tibia, and foot were 150 mm, 210 mm, and 60 mm respectively. Overall vertical leg stiffness was varied from 472 N/m to 3980 N/m. Using a 40 degree angle ramp for the motor acutation profile, adding compliance tended to distribute force over time at a smaller magnitude which resulted in longer contact time with the ground. Total impulse was found to vary and peaked at a value of 3. 42 Ns for a overall leg stiffness of 1180 N/m. The findings suggest that these systems can be optimized for performance by tuning the stiffness of compliant joints. by Albert Duan Wang. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to qualitatively study how the argumentation appears in the museum debate from 2016 in the Swedish {{newspapers}} ”Svenska Dagbladet”, ”Dagens Nyheter”, ”Expressen” and ”Aftonbladet’” from a rhetorical perspective. Research was performed on two to three mounths worth of debate articles from 2016. The thesis has been analysed through both classic rhetorical analysis and from Norman Fairclough’s three- dimensional model in order {{to answer the questions}} as to how the argumentation was done in order to <b>acutate</b> the writers positions, which discources that was managing in the debate and how the writers treats the concepts ”identity policy” and ”standard criticism”. Based on the articles that the thesis analysed, I were able to draw certain conclusions. First, the debate concists of writers who argument from rhetorical style figures to persuade one another. Writers identify with each other alternatively exclude from each other, depending on the discourse they are belonging to. And the view of the museum {{plays a major role in}} debate, that contributes to the discourse belonging...|$|R
