2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the 20th century, two writers, A. C. Bradley and Sigmund Freud, {{developed}} ideas which {{built on}} the past and greatly affected the future of Hamlet criticism. [...] Bradley held the view that Hamlet should be studied as one would study a real person: piecing together his consciousness from the clues given in the play. [...] His explanation of Hamlet's delay {{was one of a}} deep [...] "melancholy" [...] which grew from a growing disappointment in his mother. [...] Freud also viewed Hamlet as a real person: one whose psyche could be analyzed through the text. [...] He took the view that Hamlet's madness merely disguised the truth in the same way dreams disguise unconscious realities. [...] He also famously saw Hamlet's struggles as a representation of the Oedipus complex. In Freud's view, Hamlet is torn largely because he has repressed sexual desire for his mother, which is being acted out by and challenged by Claudius.|$|E
