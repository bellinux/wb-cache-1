500|$|Tropic Thunder {{was criticized}} by the {{disability}} advocacy community. The website for Simple Jack was withdrawn on August 4 amid several groups' concerns over its portrayal of mental retardation. A spokesman for DreamWorks said, [...] "We heard their concerns, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> that taken out of context, the site appeared to be insensitive to people with disabilities." [...] A coalition of more than 20disability advocacy groups, including the Special Olympics and the Arc of the United States, objected to the film's repeated and excessive {{use of the word}} [...] "retard". DreamWorks offered to screen the film for the groups on August 8 to determine if it still offended them. The screening was postponed to the same day of the premiere on August 11. After representatives for the groups attended the private screening and were offended by its content, the groups picketed outside the film's premiere. Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics, stated, [...] "This population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against Hollywood. We're sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable." ...|$|E

Throughout the state, precipitation was generally between , though peaking at more than [...] in Delhi. Elsewhere in Louisiana, about [...] of rainfall was reported in Lake Charles. Street flooding in Lake Charles was severe, though only a few houses suffered flood damage. To the south of Lake Charles, minor damage was reported in Cameron Parish, totaling to about $500,000 (1982USD). However, due to high tides, damage along the coastal areas of that parish was considerable. A Cameron Parish official noted [...] "There's power {{out all over the}} place, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> there was quite a bit of damage at Holly Beach". In Evangeline Parish, an F2 tornado on the Fujita Scale destroyed four buildings and damaged seven other structures. In northeastern Louisiana, wind damage was [...] "spotty" [...] and limited to downed trees and powerlines. As a result of heavy rainfall in that portion of the state, low-lying areas flooded, and bayous overflowed. A tornado, rated at F3, destroyed eleven houses and one church in Clayton. In addition, the tornado knocked down trees and powerlines in the area. Overall, damage in Louisiana was near $1million (1982USD).|$|E

2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W.

[...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. [...] It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." ...|$|E

60|$|A word to {{conclude}} the romantic incident of Loretto and his Indian bride.

We know that Keen found favor in thy eyes. We know that Thom was promised him in the old days when she was yet a child.

They are among the slave- begotten cotton bales of the rebel South." [...] Then comes the whole of the long argument in which it seems so easy to an Englishman to prove that England, in the whole of this sad matter, has been true and loyal to her friend. She could not interfere when the husband and wife would quarrel. She could only grieve, and wish that things might come right and smooth for both parties. But the argument, though so easy, is never effectual.|$|E

6000|$|It {{would not}} be entirely convincing. It would sound a little far-fetched and unreal. But it would sound exactly like our utterances about the Irish, as they sound to all Americans, and rather {{especially}} to Anti-Irish Americans. That is exactly the impression we produce {{on the people of}} the United States when we say, as we do say in substance, something like this: 'We mean no harm to the poor dear Irish, so dreamy, so irresponsible, so incapable of order or organisation. If we were to withdraw from their country they would only fight among themselves; they have no notion of how to rule themselves. There is something charming about their unpracticability, about their very incapacity for the coarse business of politics. But for their own sakes it is impossible to leave these emotional visionaries to ruin themselves in the attempt to rule themselves. They are like children; but they are our own children, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> them. We accept full responsibility for acting as their parents and guardians.' ...|$|E

In 1830 the English found this cancerous organization imbedded in the vitals of the empire, doing its devastating work in secrecy, and assisted, protected, sheltered, and hidden by innumerable confederates --big and little native chiefs, customs officers, village officials, and native police, {{all ready to}} lie for it, and {{the mass of the}} people, through fear, persistently pretending to know nothing about its doings; and this condition of things had existed for generations, and was formidable with the sanctions of age and old custom. If ever there was an unpromising task, {{if ever there was a}} hopeless task in the world, surely it was offered here--the task of conquering Thuggee. But that little handful of English officials in India set their sturdy and confident grip upon it, and ripped it out, root and branch!

6000|$|Alas, {{all these}} endless debates and dialogues lacked the {{inspiration}} and the charm {{with which the}} genius of a Plato could adorn the narrowest quibble between Socrates and a Sophist. [...] "Diderot," [...] said Mademoiselle de Lespinasse, [...] "is an extraordinary man; {{he is out of}} his place in society; he was meant for the chief of a sect, a Greek philosopher, instructing youth. He pleases me greatly, but his manner does not touch my soul."[225] <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> this. People disputed what virtue is, but the dispute failed in that undefined spirit which makes men love and adore virtue. Goodness is surrounded with no spacious beauty, it is clothed with none of the high associations of spontaneous piety. The discussion seems close, stifling, and airless. Yet ages of loftier speech and greater spirituality have not always been so favourable to the affections or to the attachments of life. In amiability that society has never been surpassed; in sincerity of mutual sympathy and kindliness of mutual regard. The common irregularity of morals was seen to be perfectly compatible not merely with a desire to please, but with an honest anxiety to serve.|$|E
