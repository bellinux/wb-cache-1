5|$|The right lung of {{the river}} otter {{is larger than the}} left, having four lobes {{compared}} with two for the left. Reduced lobulation of the lungs is presumed to be adaptive for underwater swimming. In addition, the length of the trachea {{of the river}} otter is intermediate between that of terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals. The mean tracheal length of the river otter is , or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> and increase lung ventilation in diving mammals.|$|E
5|$|The ribs were {{connected}} to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple hinge joint, which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20L for a P.engelhardti individual estimated to have weighed690kg, or 29mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that Plateosaurus probably had an avian-style flow-through lung, although indicators for postcranial pneumaticity (air sacs of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) {{can be found on}} the bones of only a few individuals, and were only recognized in 2010. Combined with evidence from bone histology this indicates that Plateosaurus was endothermic.|$|E
5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood the heart is able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> to occur, at least at first.|$|E

CO_ 2 utilization efficiency of a closed transplant production system, CUE, was defined as the ratio of the amount of CO_ 2 fixed by plants to that supplied into the system. Water utilization efficiency of the system, WUE, was defined {{in the same way as}} CUE. Tomato seeds were sown on plug trays and grown for 20 days in the system. CUE and WUE increased with increasing leaf area index (LAI) and decreasing the number of <b>air</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Maximum CUE (0. 93) and WUE (0. 95) during thepresent study were obtained at maximal LAI of 1. 2 and minimal number of <b>air</b> <b>exchanges</b> of 0. 02 h^. Results suggest that a high LAI and a low number of <b>air</b> <b>exchanges</b> provide high CUE and WUE values...|$|R
25|$|The {{above-ground}} {{physical structure}} of Biosphere 2 {{was made of}} steel tubing and high-performance glass and steel frames. The frame and glazing materials were designed and made to specification by a firm run by a one-time associate of Buckminster Fuller, Peter Jon Pearce (Pearce Structures, Inc.). The window seals and structures had to be designed to be almost perfectly airtight, such that the <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> would be extremely slow, to avoid damage to the experimental results.|$|E
25|$|Houseplants {{together}} with the medium {{in which they are}} grown can reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Plants remove CO2 and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. Most of the effect is attributed to the growing medium alone, but even this effect has finite limits associated with the type and quantity of medium and the flow of air through the medium. The effect of house plants on VOC concentrations was investigated in one study, done in a static chamber, by NASA for possible use in space colonies. The results showed that the removal of the challenge chemicals was roughly equivalent to that provided by the ventilation that occurred in a very energy efficient dwelling with a very low ventilation rate, an <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> rate of about 1/10 per hour. Therefore, air leakage in most homes, and in non-residential buildings too, will generally remove the chemicals faster than the researchers reported for the plants tested by NASA. The most effective household plants reportedly included aloe vera, English ivy, and Boston fern for removing chemicals and biological compounds.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon dioxide {{concentrations}} {{increase as}} a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi [...] "steady state" [...] concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. [...] Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.|$|E

2500|$|Early sauropodomorphs, {{including}} the group traditionally called [...] "prosauropods", {{may also have}} had air sacs. Although possible pneumatic indentations {{have been found in}} Plateosaurus and Thecodontosaurus, the indentations are very small. One study in 2007 concluded that prosauropods likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs, based on the evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present. A further indication for the presence of air sacs and their use in lung ventilation comes from a reconstruction of the <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> volume (the volume of air exchanged with each breath) of Plateosaurus, which when expressed as a ratio of air volume per body weight at 29nbsp&ml/kg is similar to values of geese and other birds, and much higher than typical mammalian values.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} cure time, cure temperature, and air {{circulation}} on {{the release of}} 4 -phenylcyclohexene (4 -PCH) in tufted carpet backed with carboxylated styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) latex were examined in this research project. 4 -PCH is a suspect cause of certain "building-related" illnesses such as headache, upper respiratory and eye irritation, and fatigue. A standardized method for preparing carpet backed with SBR latex and analyzing its 4 -PCH content was developed. The cure parameters investigated included three cure temperatures (225, 250 and 275 Â°F), six cure times (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes), and three air circulation rates (zero, three <b>air</b> <b>exchanges</b> per minute, and ten <b>air</b> <b>exchanges</b> per minute with 1500 linear feet per minute airflow). Increased airflow (1500 linear feet per minute) over the carpet surface produced {{the greatest impact on}} 4 -PCH release from carpet.

50|$|Potential {{behavioral}} {{savings from}} VAV fume hoods are highest when fume hood density (number of fume hoods {{per square foot}} of lab space) is high. This is because fume hoods contribute to the achievement of lab spaces' required <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> rates. Put another way, savings from closing fume hoods can only be achieved when fume hood exhaust rates are greater than the <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> rate needed to achieve the required ventilation rate in the lab room. For example, in a lab room with a required <b>air</b> <b>exchange</b> rate of 2000 cubic feet per minute (CFM), if that room has just one fume hood which vents air {{at a rate of}} 1000 square feet per minute, then closing the sash on the fume hood will simply cause the lab room's air handler to increase from 1000 CFM to 2000 CFM, thus resulting in no net reduction in air exhaust rates, and thus no net reduction in energy consumption.|$|E
