5|$|Cyclone Fanele was {{the first}} cyclone of {{tropical}} cyclone status to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Fame one year prior.

Fanele ultimately turned toward the southwest Madagascar coastline, reaching peak winds of 185km/h (115mph), according to the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR). It weakened before moving ashore in Menabe Region southwest of Morondava, <b>and</b> <b>rapidly</b> weakened over land. Fanele briefly re-intensified after reaching open waters, only to become an extratropical cyclone by January23.|$|E

Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air <b>and</b> <b>rapidly</b> lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms.

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness.

Goats compressed to 6 bar <b>and</b> <b>rapidly</b> decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

The report highlights key growth factors: a young <b>and</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E

5|$|After peak intensity, {{the forward}} speed of Dean {{continued}} to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter, Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph (105km/h). Later that day, Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic <b>and</b> <b>rapidly</b> transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day.|$|E

Initially, Alberto was forecast to continue northeastward and strike Florida, though it turned <b>and</b> <b>rapidly</b> weakened, resulting in minor effects in the state.|$|E
5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 <b>and</b> <b>rapidly</b> weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E

Montgomery had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the 2nd New Zealand Division and wanted them to spearhead the next thrust, but Freyberg was unwilling to do so without reinforcements, as his troops had suffered so many casualties.
