The degree of condensation causing spiral movement, is a degree of condensation also implying masses of flocculi that are larger, and therefore more visible, than those existing in an earlier stage. Moreover, the forms of these spiral nebulæ are quite in harmony with the explanation given. The curves of luminous matter which they exhibit, are not such as would be described by discrete masses starting from a state of rest, and moving through a resisting medium to a common centre of gravity; but they are such as would be described by masses having their movements modified by the rotation of the medium.|$|R

The idea is to improve APSC by applying our proposed approach adaptive genetic algorithm hybrid approach for test case ordering in regression testing. In this research basically we focused on test-case ordering and statement coverage by Applying adaptive genetic algorithm hybrid approach and measure APSC (<b>Average</b> Percentage <b>Statement</b> Coverage) and GA (Genetic Algorithm). In this research we take hundred test-case of apache server and evaluate hundred test-cases. We used java eclipse environment for coding and run the test cases. First we apply APSC (<b>Average</b> Percentage of <b>statement</b> coverage) technique for ordering test-cases as well measure the APSC. We got good results but this technique not sufficient to cover maximum statement. So, we hybrid the adaptive and Genetic Algorithm approach to measure the APSC and run all test-cases until all statement not covered [...] Our approach gives us better results than single APSC adaptive technique...|$|R

40|$|Software is {{difficult}} and costly to modify correctly. Automating tiresome mechanical tasks such as program restructuring is one approach to reducing the burden of software maintenance. Several restructuring tools have been proposed and prototyped, all centered {{on the concept of}} meaning-preserving transformations similar in spirit to compiler optimizations. Like optimizing compilers, these tools rely on static analysis to reason about the correctness of program changes. However, the cost (in both time and space) of static analysis serves as the limiting factor for transformation tools, resulting in slow, complex tool designs that scale poorly for use on large systems. To reduce these costs, this thesis proposes efficient, demand-driven flow analysis techniques as an alternate to traditional, compiler-based methods. These techniques operate directly on the abstract syntax tree (AST), the data structure most appropriate for use in a source-to-source tool architecture. By eliminating the need for other program representations such as the standard control flow graph (CFG) or program dependence graph (PDG), this approach greatly simplifies program modification. A key contribution of this work is the idea of virtual control flow, a method for computing the control successors or predecessors of individual AST expressions on demand. This method handles all types of structured and unstructured jumps found in an imperative programming language such as C. Virtual control flow couples well with demand-driven data flow analysis to minimize the cost of determining semantic information. To conservatively estimate data flow relationships, the effects of aliasing between memory locations can be inexpensively approximated using flow-insensitive points-to analysis based on type inference. These techniques were implemented in a prototype tool called Cstructure to support a simple restructuring transformation for reordering program statements. To check that this transformation does not change the program's behavior requires syntax, control flow and data dependence analysis. Experimental results on three programs ranging in size from 72, 000 to 213, 000 lines of code demonstrate the performance advantages of such aggressive demand-driven approaches. For the largest program, gcc, check times for the <b>average</b> <b>statement</b> were 50 milliseconds on a desktop workstation...|$|E

However, few studies have investigated its effects on performance and pacing in striking combat sports. Additionally, despite the plethora of studies examining the influence of feedback in untrained individuals, {{there is a lack of}} research examining the effects of such feedback in trained participants. Considering the important role of feedback in training and competition, the purpose of this thesis is to examine the effects of three different but inter-dependent methods of augmented feedback on performance of combat, and resistance trained athletes. Study 1 examined the type and frequency of verbal feedback provided by national level coaches to their athletes during important competitions. A microphone was secured on the shirts of 12 coaches and the feedback they provided was recorded, transcribed and categorised into three common feedback themes: attentional focus (internal, external, neutral), autonomy support (controlling, supportive, neutral) and feedback valence (positive, negative, neutral).

In this paper, we present a mechanism for gauging similarity of Arabic documents using fuzzy IR model. Similarity degree of two documents is the <b>averaged</b> similarity among <b>statements</b> treated as equal although they have been restructured or reworded. We introduced some fuzzy similarity sets such as near duplicate, very similar, similar, slightly similar, dissimilar and very dissimilar. These similarity sets can be implemented as a spectrum of values ranges from 1 (duplicate) and 0 (different). Our corpus collection has been built in which all stop words were removed and nonstop words were stemmed using typical Arabic IR techniques. The corpora has 100 documents with 4477 statements and 54346 non-stop-word, stemmed words in total. Another 15 query documents with 303 statements and 1620 words were specifically constructed for our test. Experimental results show that fuzzy IR can be used to define the extent documents are similar or dissimilar, where similarity can be mapped to {{one of the}} proposed fuzzy sets.

40|$|Abstract. Regression {{testing is}} an {{important}} and also a very expensive activity in the software life cycle. To {{reduce the cost of}} regression testing, test cases are prioritized. One goal of test case prioritization technique is to increase a test suite’s rate of fault detection and to reduce the cost of regression testing. In his paper G. Rothermel [9] has provided a metric, Average Percentage of Fault Detected (APFD), for measuring rate of fault detection during prioritization. This metric assumes that all test cases and fault costs are uniform. In practice, test case and fault costs may vary, and in such cases the previous APFD metric can be unsatisfactory. This paper presents a metric for assessing the rate of fault detection of prioritized test cases, APFDc, that incorporates varying test cases and fault costs. We have also calculated other new metrics like <b>Average</b> Percentage of <b>Statement</b> Coverage (APSC), <b>Average</b> Percentage of Branch Coverage (APBC),Average Percentage of Loop Coverage (APLC) and Average Percentage of Condition Coverage (APCC) based on the coverage criterion for the various prioritization techniques performed.

By injecting mutation faults effectiveness of prioritization is measured. Finally, we have implemented all the metrics considering a few standard java programs...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2006. Since {{the birth}} of a new {{democracy}} in the Republic of South Africa in 1994, municipalities across the country have embarked on several service-oriented programmes primarily {{to improve the quality of}} life of ordinary citizens within their areas of jurisdiction. Subsequently, these programmes which include Land Use Management System (LUMS), Integrated Development Planning (IDP), Integrated Sustainable Rural Development, Local Economic Development (LED), Urban Renewal Strategy, Property Rate Implementation and Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG) have been tailored to fast track service delivery in municipalities by building capacity and promoting small, medium and micro enterprises in local communities as a means of alleviating poverty (Local Government Programmes, 2004, paragraph 4). In order to speed up the development planning processes in the Province with regards to Integrated Development Planning, Spatial Development Framework and Land Use Management, Integrated Sustainable Rural Development, Local Economic Development (LED) and Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG), it has been identified that local authorities require a GIS application to integrate spatially related municipal information with other business information (Sarkar, 2004, paragraph 1). In view of this, the Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs (DLGTA) has for the past six years, provided financial and technical support to the ten (10) District Municipalities and about thirty (30) Local Municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal to facilitate the establishment of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in these municipalities (DLGTA Municipal GIS Capacity Building Manual, 2004). It is further noted that although a substantial amount of grant funding and technical support has been provided to the 10 District Municipalities and thirty Local Municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal, the full utilization of GIS as a decision-making support tool has not, as yet, been realised in some of these municipalities. This scenario thus calls for the need to ascertain municipalities' expectation and perception of the quality of GIS support services rendered to them by the Department and also to measure the gap thereof. To do so, the researcher employed SERVQUAL scale methodology to measure the service quality gap between municipalities' expectation and perception of the quality of GIS support services. A selfadministered questionnaire, which covers the five (5) dimensions of service quality, namely; tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy, was compiled and forwarded to the 10 District municipalities and 20 Local Municipalities in the Province to complete and return to the researcher within a specified time period. Fourteen (14) of the thirty (30) questionnaires sent out to these municipalities were returned to the researcher. The data was then analysed and conclusions were drawn. The research discovered that responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangible dimensions are significant to municipalities in that they all had <b>average</b> expectation <b>statement</b> scores above 6 on the Likert 7 -point scale. This means that respondents strongly agree to the expectation statements relating to these dimensions. On the other hand, the <b>average</b> expectation <b>statement</b> score relating to reliability dimension is below 6. The research result has shown that DLGTA is perceived by municipalities for rendering a desirable level of services to municipalities with respect to aspects relating to reliability, assurance, empathy and tangible dimensions. However, DLGTA seems not to provide prompt service to most of these municipalities and not showing signs of readiness to respond to their requests on GIS matters. It is also noted that there is a wide gap between municipalities' perception and expectation for responsiveness (- 1. 19), empathy (- 0. 90) and assurance (- 0. 98), and this seems to confirm the view that responsiveness and assurance dimensions are the most significant variables out of the five determinants of service quality, and thus require service improvement attention. The outcome of the survey reflects that the GIS concept is relatively new to some of these municipalities, and thus municipal officials want to feel safe in their transactions with DLGTA on GIS matters. As a result, they expect DLGTA officials to attend to them promptly and must have the knowledge to answer their GIS related questions. They strongly require DLGTA staff to give them individual attention and possibly have their best interest at heart. In this study, the responsiveness dimension is classified as having a poor service quality whiles the reliability dimension (with a narrow gap) has the superior service quality. To minimise or eliminate these gaps, it has been mentioned that DLGTA should be guided by the eight principles of Batho Pele which seem to take care of the key requirements of the five service quality dimensions as discussed in this dissertation. Based on this outcome, recommendations were made and a future research proposal outlined...|$|R

However, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in their publication of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 38, require that expenditures incurred during R & D should either be expensed in the statement of comprehensive income or capitalized as an intangible asset in the statement of financial position provided certain criteria are fulfilled (IASB, 2012, p. 1045). Therefore, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the impact of expensed R & D and/or capitalized R & D on firm performance METHOD: Data for the study was collected from the audited financial statements of firms listed at the London Stock Exchange as well as from the website of this stock market. Two sampling techniques were utilized in the study; namely stratified sampling and random sampling. Stratified sampling technique was used to stratify the companies into various industries while random sampling was used to randomly select firms that are engaged in R & D from each of these industries. The final sample consisting of 52 firms gave a total of 260 observations for a period of 5 years between December 31 st, 2007 to December 31 st, 2011. Expensed R & D and capitalized R & D were obtained by taking the <b>averages</b> of <b>statement</b> of comprehensive income R & D to Revenue and statement of financial position R & D to revenue respectively. Moreover, firm performance was measured using accounting-based indicators which were Return on Asset (ROA), Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), Dividend Yield (DY), Dividend Cover (DC), Earnings per Share (EPS), Price Earnings Ratio (PE) and Capital Gearing Ratio (CGR). RESULTS: The results of the study show that expensed R & D has a significant positive impact on DC, a significant negative impact on EPS, positively correlated with CGR with no significant impact and negatively correlated with ROA, ROCE, DY and PE but had no significant impact. As concerns capitalized R & D, the results reveal that capitalized R & D has a significant negative impact on ROA, ROCE and EPS, positively correlated with CGR but have no significant impact and negatively correlated with DY, DC and PE as well though no significant impact was found...|$|R

Although improvisational {{expertise is}} considered an important constituent of modern musicianship, {{there is no consensus}} of opinion regarding its definition. As part of a PhD project on improvisation skill learning, we conducted a group concept mapping study to formulate a comprehensive view on improvisational expertise. The research questions of this study were: “What characterizes a good improviser?”, “Which characteristics are regarded important?”, and “Do different groups of experts have different opinions on defining and valuing improvisational expertise?” To answer these questions we invited 26 renowned improvisation experts (musicians, conservatory teachers, and critics/researchers) to participate.

Therefore, the feedback provided by 12 boxing coaches to athletes between rounds of the 2015 Australian Boxing Championships was recorded and transcribed. The feedback statements were then analyzed according to three feedback variables that {{have been shown to}} be critical for optimizing performance: Attentional focus (external, internal, neutral), autonomy support (autonomy-supportive, controlling, neutral), and feedback valence (positive, negative, neutral). Collectively, 445 feedback statements provided during 25 bouts, of which 14 were won and 11 were lost, were analyzed for each of the three categories. Coaches provided on <b>average</b> 8 feedback <b>statements</b> per round. Excluding neutral statements, coaches delivered more internal (15 %) compared with external focus feedback (6 %), more controlling (53 %) compared with autonomy-supportive feedback (6 %), and more positive (29 %) relative to negative feedback (12 %). Furthermore, during winning bouts coaches delivered less internal (12 % vs. 19 %), less controlling (48 % vs. 58 %), and more positive (36 % vs. 18 %) feedback, when compared with losing bouts. These results demonstrate for the first time the type and frequency of feedback delivered during amateur boxing bouts. While these findings may or may not reflect causal relationships, it is interesting that feedback that has been found to enhance motor performance was more often used during winning rather than losing bouts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

To the observer, analog simulations retain a more natural quality. Now as before, models are often constructed during the performance of urban design projects, reducing even further the resource demands of an analog model, which in the end is reflected in the costs. ...|$|R

The classification of NANDA was used as reference. The research questions were: (a) Does NANDA terminology represent patient problems documented by Icelandic nurses? (b) If so, what kind of nursing diagnoses does it represent? (c) What kind of patient problems are not represented by NANDA terminology? (d) What are the most frequent nursing diagnoses used? METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted in a 400 bed acute care hospital in Iceland. The sample was defined as nursing diagnosis statements in charts of patients hospitalized in two 6 -month periods in two separate years. The data were analysed according to a predefined grading system based on the PES format or Problem [...] (A) aetiology [...] Signs and symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 1217 charts were used for the study, which yielded 2171 nursing diagnoses statements for analysis. Charts with at least one nursing diagnosis documented were 60. 1 % and the number of diagnoses per patient ranged from 0 to 10, with 65 % of charts with three diagnoses or less. The number of diagnoses correlated with patients' length of stay, but not with increased age of the patients. The <b>average</b> number of <b>statements</b> per patient was 3. 28.

The 20 most frequently used nursing diagnoses accounted for 80 % of all diagnoses documented. Discrepancy between nurses' documentation on emotional problems and availability of diagnosis in the NANDA taxonomy was evident. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the NANDA taxonomy seems to be culturally relevant for nurses in different cultures...|$|R
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{hospital in}} Barrow is Furness General Hospital, {{operated by the}} University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust and located {{on the outskirts of}} the town. As of July 2010 there were 12 NHS GP practices/doctors' surgeries and 5 NHS dental surgeries in Barrow. The life expectancy for males in Barrow is 76.0 years (compared to the England average of 77.7) and 80.9 years for females (compared to the national average of 81.8). The 2001 UK Census showed that 63.12% of Barrovians were in good health, 23.63% in fairly good health and 13.25% in bad health. This compared to England's averages of 68.76%, 22.21% and 9.03% respectively; thus in general people in Barrow are in a slightly worse state of health than in England as a whole. A 2009 NHS in depth publication on health in Barrow indicated that eight years later the population of Barrow is still in worse health than the national <b>average.</b> The opening <b>statement</b> of the publication read, [...] "The health of people in Barrow-in-Furness is varied. Many indicators are significantly worse than the England average, including violent crime and binge drinking adults (an estimate). However, a number of indicators are similar to the average, such as GCSE achievement and healthy eating adults (an estimate), and a fifth of indicators are significantly better than average, including physically active children and adults." [...] Barrow has the tenth worst rate of Incapacity Benefit claimants for mental illness in the country. The NHS also identified Barrow as having significantly worse figures than the England average in the fields of deprivation, child poverty, violent crime, breast feeding initiation, children's tooth decay, binge drinking adults, over 65s 'not in good health', hospital stays for alcohol-related harm, male and female life expectancy, deaths from smoking and early deaths from cancer. As against this, as stated earlier the proportions of physically active children and adults in Barrow is significantly higher than the England average, whilst the town also has much lower numbers of drug misusers, diabetes sufferers and road accident injuries and deaths. All other aspects of the health of Barrow's population were stated as more or less level with nationwide average.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Kenya has bold {{plans for}} scaling up {{priority}} interventions nationwide, but faces major human resource challenges, {{with a lack}} of skilled workers especially in the most disadvantaged rural areas. Methods We investigated reasons for poor recruitment and retention in rural areas and potential policy interventions through quantitative and qualitative data collection with nursing trainees. We interviewed 345 trainees from four purposively selected Medical Training Colleges (MTCs) (166 pre-service and 179 upgrading trainees with prior work experience). Each interviewee completed a self-administered questionnaire including likert scale responses to statements about rural areas and interventions, and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted at each MTC. Results Likert scale responses indicated mixed perceptions of both living and working in rural areas, with a range of positive, negative and indifferent views expressed on <b>average</b> across different <b>statements.</b> The analysis showed that attitudes to working in rural areas were significantly positively affected by being older, but negatively affected by being an upgrading student. Attitudes to living in rural areas were significantly positively affected by being a student at the MTC furthest from Nairobi. During FGDs trainees raised both positive and negative aspects of rural life. Positive aspects included lower costs of living and more autonomy at work. Negative issues included poor infrastructure, inadequate education facilities and opportunities, higher workloads, and inadequate supplies and supervision. Particular concern was expressed about working in communities dominated by other tribes, reflecting Kenya’s recent election-related violence. Quantitative and qualitative data indicated that students believed several strategies could improve rural recruitment and retention, with particular emphasis on substantial rural allowances and the ability to choose their rural location. Other interventions highlighted included provision of decent housing, and more rapid career advancement. However, recently introduced short term contracts in named locations were not favoured due to their lack of pension plans and job security. Conclusions This study identified a range of potential interventions to increase rural recruitment and retention, with those most favored by nursing students being additional rural allowances, and allowing choice of rural location. Greater investment is needed in information systems to evaluate the impact of such policies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background Attitudes to, and {{practices}} of, scientific authorship vary. We have studied this variation among researchers {{in a university}} hospital and medical school in Norway. Methods We invited all faculty, researchers and PhD students at Oslo University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo (approximately 2700) by e-mail to answer a web-based questionnaire in January 2013. We asked the researchers to report their authorship experiences and to score their agreement with, and ability to practice according to, 13 statements on authorship qualifications and criteria on a five-point Likert scale (1 [*]=[*]completely agree, 5 [*]=[*]completely disagree). The statements {{were taken from the}} International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and other recommendations on authorship. Results 654 questionnaires were returned (response rate 24 %); 25 % of the respondents had published less than five scientific articles, 43 % five to 49, and 32 % more than 50 articles. 97 % reported knowledge of defined authorship criteria, and 68 % regarded breaches of these as scientific misconduct. 36 % had experienced pressure to include undeserved authors in their papers, more in basic science (46 %) than in community medicine (25 %). 29 % reported that they had been denied authorship they believed they deserved. Researchers with less than six years of research experience found authorship decisions more difficult than more experienced researchers (48 % vs 30 %). The respondents’ agreement with the statements on authorship was higher than their self-reported ability to follow them for all <b>statements.</b> <b>Average</b> scores for agreement and practice for all statements combined were 1. 4 vs 2. 3. The discrepancy between attitude and practice declined with publishing experience. For the core ICMJE authorship requirements the average difference between attitude and practice was 1. 2 among those who had published less than 5 articles and 0. 7 among those who had published 50 articles or more (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Conclusions Almost all the responding researchers had knowledge of formal authorship requirements. Most of them agreed with the criteria, but found it harder to put them into practice. More experienced researchers found decisions on authorship and about the order of authors easier than less experienced researchers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code analysis, both asymptotically and for finite block lengths. Since in general {{it is a difficult}} problem to analyze individual code instances, ensemble averages are studied by following Gallager's original idea and results of Luby et al. Often, one can relate the insights gained by studying ensemble <b>averages</b> to <b>statements</b> regarding individual codes by proving that most elements in the ensemble behave "close" to the average. One important such average is the average weight distribution, another is the average pseudo-codeword distribution, where pseudo-codewords play the same role under iterative decoding as codewords do for maximum likelihood decoding. One of the main contributions of this thesis is the calculation of such averages for fully irregular LDPC code ensembles. Much of classical coding theory is aimed at the construction of codes with large minimum distance. This is so since away from capacity accurate bounds on the performance of a code can be given in terms of its minimum distance (or more generally, in terms of its weight distribution). Therefore, it is of interest to investigate what role the minimum distance plays for iteratively decoded LDPC code ensembles. In particular, sequences of capacity-achieving LDPC code ensembles of increasing length when transmission takes place over the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) are investigated. It is shown that, under certain technical conditions, the minimum distance of such ensembles grows sub-linearly in the block length, a result which is somewhat surprising from a classical point of view. Specific attention is also given to the design of LDPC code ensembles, where an inherent trade-off is observed between achieving large minimum distance (which is relevant for the so called error-floor regime) and achieving a large threshold (which in the limit of long block lengths determines the worst channel on which transmission can be accomplished reliably). Most results on iterative coding systems to date address their asymptotic performance, i. e., their performance when the block length tends to infinity. For small and moderate block lengths the behavior of a code can deviate significantly from its asymptotic limit. It is therefore of high practical value to be able to analyze the finite-length performance of LDPC code ensembles. In this thesis, an exact such analysis is presented for iteratively decoded LDPC code ensembles over the BEC. In particular, expressions for the exact average bit and block erasure probabilities are computed by solving a set of recursions. Such an analysis is the starting point for a finite-length optimization, a topic which is slated for future work. The methods used in this thesis include a combinatorial approach (familiar to the coding society) as well as the powerful techniques developed in the statistical physics community, for example, the replica method or the mean-field approximation. Although the statistical physics techniques are ideally suited for the analysis of iterative coding systems, they are to date only accessible to a relatively small community. Therefore, an overview of these techniques is first presented using a language familiar to the coding theory community. Next, in order to highlight the differences and common points between the combinatorial and the statistical physics approaches, both techniques are applied to the weight distribution problem. It turns out that for regular ensembles, both methods yield the same result, while for irregular ensembles, they do differ in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{highlight}} of the TJ Ryan Foundation’s 3 rd anniversary event was a keynote address from Dr Ken Boston, former Director-General of Education in South Australia and New South Wales, {{and member of the}} Gonski Review panel. Dr Boston spoke on the topic of 2 ̆ 7 Gonski Report: Vision or Hallucination? 2 ̆ 7 The key messages from his address are: 	Neither the “last two years of Gonski funding”, nor reducing overall funding to the wealthiest schools, will solve the real problem facing Australia’s schools. Nor will cosmetic changes to Commonwealth/State governance and funding arrangements with regard to education; 	Any long-term solution must be based on the assessment of the needs of individual schools – treating government, Catholic and independent schools in exactly the same way; 	The most recent iteration of the My School website gives detailed information on government recurrent funding for every school in the country. This information is validated by schools and systems, accurate, and available online. No longer need we rely on broad <b>statements,</b> <b>averages</b> or generalisations about school funding, from the Productivity Commission, the Commonwealth Government or other sources. We are now {{in a position to make}} evidence-based statements about the funding of schools, based on publicly available data at the level of the individual school; 	While the existence of Catholic and independent schools might be justified on other grounds, they can no longer be justified on the grounds that they are saving taxpayers’ money. Catholic and independent schools are now receiving virtually the same amount of government funding as government schools serving similar SES communities; 	Five years after Gonski, Australia has two virtually government-funded systems. One is open to all, takes students from all sections of the community, and has several accountabilities to government. The other – state-funded to nearly the same extent – sets and charges fees; has a selective enrolment process; has a statutory exemption from certain anti-discrimination provisions; can borrow money,  and because  the high-level of government funding covers their recurrent teaching costs, can apply their fees to servicing loans on major capital works; 	In suburbs and towns across Australia, adjacent schools receiving similar levels of taxpayer support now operate under quite different conditions, in facilities of sharply differing standards, and with clientele deeply divided on the basis of class, ethnicity and income; 	Both the Rudd/Gillard Government and the Turnbull Government failed to implement Gonski. Radical change - along lines I will discuss – is now urgent...|$|R
40|$|Chemistry {{has been}} {{developed}} greatly throughout the 20 th century. Chemistry {{is included in the}} curriculum of elementary and secondary education. In general, students are not interested in science, and because of this,students tend not to make an effort to learn and understand the meaning of concepts and the chemistry language that are being taught to them. If we consider that there is a little bit analogy between chemistry and foreign languages, we should learn the sym bols of the Periodic Table as symbols of an alphabet. The first knowledge that one needs to know when we are learning a second language is the new symbols of our new alphabet. It is necessary to learn more than 103 symbols, the chemical alphabet. After that, the students are ready to begin the formation of chemical words. In this case, learning the compounds names is easier when only two elements are involved, but when there are more than two, the chemical language is more complex. The proposal of this study is intended to design and implement a teaching strategy for teaching and learning the chemical language, first of all the chemical alphabet, the Periodic Table and then, the language which it is built the chemistry. For this proposal, we will use some m ultimedia application (Information and Communication Technologies (ITC)), which consists in an interactive periodic table. Students will be able to push one element and {{they will be able to}} see the properties of this element and which other element will be able to combine with it, and furthermore, if this element will be able to combine with itself. When they know properly the simple language, they will be able to continue studying more complex words, in this case, the reactions. With this multimedia application, the students will be able to watch how the atoms will change, one atom changes to a new atom during a whole reaction. And finally, they will be able to watch how these new atoms have new properties, and they combine each one. With this Periodic Table, the students learn chemical formulas and equations. 2. Experimental. This study was created as a descriptive study in which the survey technique was used. The study was carried out during the course 2013 / 14. The sample consisted of 35 volunteer studen ts from two different classes, at the first course of Mechanical Engineer degree at University of Málaga. But the vast majority of them were there, they did not love chemistry. Each student made one questionnaire about the utility of our multimedia application. The scale of the test was a five point Likert type scale with a range of five options. The positive items range from 1 = Certainly Agree to 5 = Certainly Disagree. 3. Results and Discussion. Mostly the <b>average</b> of these <b>statements</b> showed an overall positive response statements. The majority of the each student average of the response statements shown are positive, more than 2. 5. After this study, we studied if there was some difference between the two groups studied and it can be seen that the mean an d the standard deviation for the different variables according to the two investigated groups demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the level of interest or utility that they give to the multimedia application. 4. Conclusions. The results of this study are based on a survey purpose after the use of an interactive application in order to improve the learning process of the chemistry language. This information is valuable since students could watch these animations on a computer. This is based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, which assumes that learners process information through a dual coding capability involving a auditory/verbal channel and a visual/pictorial channel. Nevertheless, the vast majority of students recognize that chemistry knowledge is useful to interpret aspect of their everyday life, but not many of them express their wish to continue chemistry studies.
