Among these, Ag nanorods coated with thin metal oxide layers (AgNRs-oxide hybrid <b>array</b> <b>substrates)</b> featuring many outstanding advantages have been proposed as fascinating SERS substrates, and are of particular research interest. The present review provides a systematic overview towards the representative achievements of AgNRs-oxide hybrid <b>array</b> <b>substrates</b> for SERS applications from diverse perspectives, so as to promote the realization of real-world SERS sensors.

30|$|Recently, the nanogap {{structure}} becomes {{attractive to}} researchers {{because it can}} provide enormous Raman enhancement due {{to the existence of}} enormous electromagnetic enhancement in the gap of metal nanostructure, which is called 'hot spot’ [3 – 16]. And the surface plasmonic coupling between neighboring nanounits {{is believed to be the}} main reason for the enormous electromagnetic enhancement. Many investigations on the mechanism of the surface plasmonic coupling and the fabrication of the nanogap-structured SERS substrates for practical application have been presented [3 – 17]. Compared to the nanoparticle substrates, the ordered nanopillar/nanorod <b>array</b> <b>substrates</b> are more uniform and reproducible, which make them more beneficial to practical application and theoretical analysis. But the uniform ordered nanopillar/nanorod <b>array</b> <b>substrates</b> with tunable gap size are usually fabricated by electron-beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion-beam lithography (FIBL), which require a very high fabrication cost [18 – 20]. To circumvent this difficulty, many low-cost methods and techniques have been proposed, like self-assembly [21, 22], indentation lithography [14, 20, 23 – 27], corroding ultra-thin layer [7], femto-second laser fabrication [28 – 31], and so on. But to date, for the existence of many limits of these low-cost techniques, the fabrication of the large-area low-cost high-performance SERS substrate, with tunable gap size, is still critical not only for practical applications of SERS in the chemical/biological sensor, but also in understanding surface plasmonic coupling existing inside the nanogaps.|$|R

40|$|SWI-SNF is an ATP-dependent {{chromatin}} remodeling {{complex that}} disrupts DNA-histone interactions. Several studies of SWI-SNF activity on mononucleosome substrates {{have suggested that}} remodeling leads to novel, accessible nucleosomes which persist {{in the absence of}} continuous ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, we have reported that SWI-SNF-dependent remodeling of nucleosomal arrays is rapidly reversed after removal of ATP. One possibility is that these contrasting results are due to the different assays used; alternatively, the lability of the SWI-SNF-remodeled state might be different on mononucleosomes versus nucleosomal arrays. To investigate these possibilities, we use a coupled SWI-SNF remodeling-restriction enzyme assay to directly compare the remodeling of mononucleosome and nucleosomal <b>array</b> <b>substrates.</b> We find that SWI-SNF action causes a mobilization of histone octamers for both the mononucleosome and nucleosomal <b>array</b> <b>substrates,</b> and these changes in nucleosome positioning persist in the absence of continued ATP hydrolysis or SWI-SNF binding. In the case of mononucleosomes, the histone octamers accumulate at the DNA ends even in the presence of continued ATP hydrolysis. On nucleosomal arrays, SWI-SNF and ATP lead to a more dynamic state where nucleosomes appear to be constantly redistributed and restriction enzyme sites throughout the array have increased accessibility. This random positioning of nucleosomes within the array persists after removal of ATP, but inactivation of SWI-SNF is accompanied by an increased occlusion of many restriction enzyme sites. Our results also indicate that remodeling of mononucleosomes or nucleosomal arrays does not lead to an accumulation of novel nucleosomes that maintain an accessible state in the absence of continuous ATP hydrolysis...|$|R
