5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{underwent}} <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> urban renewal and expansion from the 1890s {{up to the}} 1920s. As downtown Lima had become overcrowded, the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working-class neighborhood. During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores. In the 1920s and 1930s, several buildings of the historic centre were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E

5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The degree of industrialization {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> artificial selection {{as they were}} useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort {{may have been too}} little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E

When de Valera {{achieved}} power, he {{took advantage of the}} Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> insular dwarfism.|$|E
