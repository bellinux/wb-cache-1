2500|$|Mara was {{inspired}} to act by seeing musical theatre and classic movies, like Gone with the Wind (1939), Rebecca (1940), and Bringing Up Baby (1938), with her mother. [...] She also {{wanted to be like}} her sister, Kate Mara, a professional actress. Mara resisted pursuing acting as a child, stating to The Journal News that [...] "it never seemed that honorable to me, and I guess I was always <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might fail." [...] Her first and only role in high school was Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, which she got after being signed up to audition by a friend. [...] Mara acted in a few student films while at NYU, and then began her career in acting, first auditioning at the age of nineteen.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Morley {{wrote to}} Auberon Herbert, an extreme {{opponent}} of state intervention, that [...] "I am <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{do not agree}} with you as to paternal government. I am no partisan of a policy of incessant meddling with individual freedom, but I do strongly believe that in so populous a society as ours now is, you may well have a certain protection thrown over classes {{of men and women who}} are unable to protect themselves". In 1885 Morley spoke out against those Liberals who believed that all state intervention was wrong and proclaimed: [...] "I am not prepared to allow that the Liberty and the Property Defence League are the only people with a real grasp of Liberal principles, that Lord Bramwell and the Earl of Wemyss are the only Abdiels of the Liberal Party". Later that year Morley defined his politics: [...] "I am a cautious Whig by temperament, I am a Liberal by training, and I am a thorough Radical by observation and experience".|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Li Kuo (as Emperor Dezong). [...] Li Kui {{continued}} to serve as minister of rites, but the powerful chancellor Lu Qi was jealous of his reputation and seniority. [...] In 783, after the emissary of the Tibetan Empire Qujiazan (區頰贊) arrived in Chang'an to negotiate a border realignment treaty with Tang and after the treaty was completed, at Lu's instigation, Emperor Dezong made Li Kui emissary to the Tibetan Empire to escort Qujiazan back to the Tibetan Empire. [...] Li Kui, then 72, stated to Emperor Dezong, [...] "I do not fear going that far a distance, but I am <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would die on the way and not complete my task." [...] Emperor Dezong, who was saddened by the remarks, told Lu, [...] "Li Kui is too old." [...] Lu responded, [...] "An emissary to a far-away foreign state {{needs to have a}} good reputation. [...] Further, if Li Kui, who is this old, is sent as an emissary, then in the future, no official younger than Li Kui would dare to refuse such a task." [...] When Li Kui got to the Tibetan Empire, its king Trisong Detsen asked, [...] "I heard that there is a Li Kui who is the most able of officials in Tang. [...] Are you that person, lord?" [...] Li Kui was afraid that this meant that Trisong Detsen intended to detain him, and therefore responded, [...] "That Li Kui would never be willing to come here." [...] On his way of returning from the Tibetan Empire in 784, he died at Feng Prefecture (鳳州, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). [...] He was buried with honor and given the posthumous name Gong (恭, meaning [...] "respectful").|$|E
