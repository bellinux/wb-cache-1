50|$|<b>A</b> <b>test</b> or {{examination}} (informally, exam or evaluation) is {{an assessment}} intended to measure a test-taker's knowledge, skill, aptitude, physical fitness, or classification {{in many other}} topics (e.g., beliefs). <b>A</b> <b>test</b> may be administered verbally, on paper, on a computer, or in a confined area that requires <b>a</b> <b>test</b> taker to physically perform a set of skills. Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. For example, in <b>a</b> closed book <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> taker is often required to rely upon memory to respond to specific items whereas in <b>an</b> open book <b>test,</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> taker may use one or more supplementary tools such as a reference book or calculator when responding to <b>an</b> item. <b>A</b> <b>test</b> may be administered formally or informally. An example of <b>an</b> informal <b>test</b> would be <b>a</b> reading <b>test</b> administered by <b>a</b> parent to a child. An example of <b>a</b> formal <b>test</b> would be <b>a</b> final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or <b>an</b> I.Q. <b>test</b> administered by <b>a</b> psychologist in <b>a</b> clinic. Formal <b>testing</b> often results in a grade or <b>a</b> <b>test</b> score. <b>A</b> <b>test</b> score may be interpreted with regards to a norm or criterion, or occasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis {{of a large number}} of participants.An exam is meant to <b>test</b> <b>a</b> child's knowledge orwillingness to give time to manipulate that subject.|$|R
5|$|A {{competition}} for two channels in MUX B {{was announced in}} July 2010, and HAKOM received offers for the following channels: RTL 2, Doma TV, OBN and KN. Finally, licenses were given to RTL 2 and Doma TV. RTL2 and Doma TV began broadcasting on 2 January 2011. Licences for broadcasting in the national segment of Mux D were given to Croatian Music Channel (CMC), Sportska Televizija (owned by the Croatian Olympic Committee) and KN in December 2010. They started broadcasting in late March and early April 2011. KN was originally broadcast in MUX B; as holder of a license for <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> period, they won an experimental 6-month period license (and later switched to MUX D, which carries both local and nationwide services simultaneously). MUX B also carries two new channelsâ€”HRT 3 and HRT 4. The two are expected to begin broadcasting {{by the end of}} 2012.|$|E
5|$|In May 1958, Britain had {{informed}} that US {{that it would}} be willing to join <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> moratorium on 31 October 1958, by which point it would have finished its hydrogen-bomb testing, conditional on the US providing Britain with nuclear information following amendment of the McMahon Act. The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June. Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year moratorium, the three countries conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary moratorium (the Soviet Union joined the moratorium shortly after this date). The moratorium would last for close to three years.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season of 1928, Hammond scored 2,825 runs (average 65.69) with three double centuries, took 84 wickets (average 23.10), his highest total in a season, and held 79 catches, a single season record. These performances helped Gloucestershire {{to mount a}} rare but unsuccessful challenge for the County Championship. At the Cheltenham festival, in six days, Hammond scored 362 runs, took 11 wickets and held 11 catches. Against Surrey, he scored a century in both innings and held ten catches, including six in the second innings, which remains a first-class record as of 2015. In {{the following}} match, against Worcestershire, Hammond scored 80. Bowling off-spin on <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> pitch, he then took nine wickets for 23, the best bowling figures of his career. He followed up with six for 105 as Worcestershire followed on. He played in a Test trial and in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's for the second time, before participating in the three Test matches against the West Indies cricket team. While England won the series 3â€“0, Hammond had mixed success. Despite scores of 45 in the first Test and a careful 63 in the second, he made just 111 runs in the series {{at an average of}} 37.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|Starting on 1 May, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a three-day test at the Mugello Circuit in Italy {{ahead of the}} Spanish Grand Prix. The test gave teams the opportunity to assess major aerodynamic upgrades before racing them. HRT elected not {{to take part in}} the test, instead choosing to concentrate on establishing themselves at their new headquarters in Madrid. Both Lotus's trackside operations director Alan Permane and Red Bull Racing driver Mark Webber questioned the value of testing at the Mugello circuit as the characteristics of the circuit were unlike any of the circuits the championship was due to visit after the test, while Caterham driver Vitaly Petrov was critical of the choice of Mugello as <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> venue as he felt it was not safe enough for Formula One. Petrov's comments came shortly after Fernando Alonso crashed on the final morning of the test. Red Bull Racing and Lotus team principals Christian Horner and Ã‰ric Boullier were also critical of the test as they felt that the costs of conducting in-season testing outweighed any benefits, with Horner stating his opposition to continuing mid-season testing in the future.|$|E

5|$|Following {{criticism}} {{over the}} sensitivity of their tyre compounds, tyre supplier Pirelli announced changes to their tyre allocation for the Spanish Grand Prix, making pit strategy {{the focal point of}} the Grand Prix. Pirelli would later diagnose the problems with the tyre compounds as originating from developing them on <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> chassis that was two years out-of-date at the time. Lewis Hamilton took his third pole of the season, edging out Williams driver Pastor Maldonado by half a second, while Maldonado's team-mate Bruno Senna was eliminated early when he spun. Hamilton was later excluded from the qualifying results after his car did not have enough fuel to return to the pits for scrutineering, promoting Maldonado to pole position and moving Hamilton to the back of the grid. Fernando Alonso took the lead of the race at the first corner, but Maldonado reclaimed it during the second round of pit stops, when his team forced Ferrari to pit early while Alonso was held up by the Marussia of Charles Pic. Maldonado maintained a lead of seven seconds over Alonso, but a mistake by his crew during the third pit stop cost him time and left him vulnerable to the Ferrari driver in the final stint of the race. Meanwhile, third-placed Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen moved to an ambitious strategy that would see him attempt to force Maldonado and Alonso to race beyond the life expectancy of their tyres, allowing him to swoop in at the last minute to steal first place. RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen's strategy failed as Maldonado withstood pressure from Alonso for fifteen laps, winning the race by three seconds and becoming the first Venezuelan driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix. It was Williams's first win in one hundred and thirty Grand Prix starts; their previous race win was Juan Pablo Montoya's victory at the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton recovered from twenty-fourth on the grid to finish eighth, while Sebastian Vettel overcame a drive-through penalty and an unscheduled stop for a technical fault that forced his team to replace his front wing to make a late move on Nico Rosberg for sixth place that would preserve his championship lead.|$|E
5|$|Learning that James {{seeks to}} revive the project and {{continue}} his work by acquiring a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), the Lone Wanderer soon tracks him down to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Stanislaus Braun, whom James had sought out for information on a G.E.C.K.. Reunited with their father, the pair soon return to Rivet City and recruit Li and the other project members to resume work at the Jefferson Memorial. Just as they begin testing the project, the Memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from {{the remnants of the}} pre-War United States government, which continues to remain active despite the demise of their brethren on the West Coast thirty years previously (see Fallout 2). Seeking to stop them gaining control of his work, James urges the Lone Wanderer to finish his work and find a G.E.C.K. before flooding the project's control room with massive amounts of radiation, preventing the Enclave's military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it and killing himself in the process, though Autumn survives. Taking the remaining project members to safety, the Lone Wanderer makes contact with the Brotherhood of Steel within the ruins of the Pentagon, now known as the Citadel. With their help, the Lone Wanderer travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K., which had been used as <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> site for the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) and now as a breeding ground for the Super Mutants. The Lone Wanderer recovers the G.E.C.K. from within the Vault. But as they make their way out, the Wanderer is ambushed by Colonel Autumn and the Enclave and is captured.|$|E
5|$|While {{investments}} in consumer goods were below projections, the expansion in output increased the Soviet people's standard of living. Refrigerators, owned by only 32 {{percent of the}} population in the early 1970s, had reached 86% of households by the late 1980s, and the ownership of color televisions increased from 51% in the early 1970s to 74% in the 1980s. On the other hand, though some areas improved during the Brezhnev era, the majority of civilian services deteriorated, with the physical environment for the common Soviet citizen falling apart rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying health care system, and living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the common Soviet person living in 13.4 square metres. At the same time thousands of Moscow inhabitants were homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways and parked trams. Authorities often conducted sweeps of movie theaters, restaurants, and saunas to locate people slacking off from work, particularly during major events like the 1980 Summer Olympics that attracted large numbers of foreign visitors. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, with rationing of staple food products returning to locales such as Sverdlovsk. Environmental damage and pollution became a growing problem due to the Soviet government's policy of development at all costs, and {{some parts of the country}} such as the Kazakh SSR suffered particularly badly due to being used as <b>a</b> <b>testing</b> ground for nuclear weapons. While Soviet citizens in 1962 had enjoyed higher average life expectancy than the United States, by 1982 it had fallen by nearly five years.|$|E
