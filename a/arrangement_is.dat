5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> the opposite in the former. The principal eyes are also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing them to move the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary eyes are immobile.|$|E
5|$|Since the pigeye shark so {{strongly}} resembles the bull shark, morphology-based phylogenetic studies {{have considered the}} two species to be closely related. Neither this nor any other <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> strongly supported by molecular phylogenetic research, which to date has been inconclusive regarding this shark's evolutionary relationship to other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} if the {{fundamental}} groups of the complements of two line arrangements in the complex projective plane are isomorphic to the same direct sum of free groups, then the complements of the <b>arrangements</b> <b>are</b> homotopy equivalent. For any such arrangement, we construct another <b>arrangement</b> that <b>is</b> complexified-real, the intersection lattices of the <b>arrangements</b> <b>are</b> isomorphic, and the complements of the <b>arrangements</b> <b>are</b> diffeomorphic.

5|$|Two rows of {{alternating}} plates. By {{the early}} 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, mainly because some S. stenops fossils {{in which the}} plates are still partially articulated show this arrangement. This <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> chiral and so demands that a specimen be distinguished from its distinct, hypothetical mirror-image form.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|Busoni gave many (but not all) of {{his works}} opus numbers; some numbers apply {{to more than one}} work (after the {{composer}} dropped some of his earlier works from his acknowledged corpus). Nor are the composer's numbers all in temporal order. The musicologist Jürgen Kindermann has prepared a thematic catalogue {{of his works}} and transcriptions which is also used, {{in the form of the}} letters BV (for Busoni Verzeichnis, German:Busoni Index: sometimes the letters KiV for Kindermann Verzeichnis are used) followed by an identifier, to identify his compositions and transcriptions. The identifier B (for Bearbeitung, German: <b>arrangement)</b> <b>is</b> used for Busoni's transcriptions and cadenzas– e.g. BV B 1 refers to Busoni's cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.|$|E

5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics would make {{the arrangement of the}} orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential problem is that the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E

Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders {{were the}} Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). The current <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> to {{separate}} responsibility between Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} NATO forces, and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including Eurocorps, I. German/Dutch Corps, Multinational Corps Northeast, and NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.|$|E

5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are {{colonial and}} consist of multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together by living material. The simplest <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry systems {{involving}} {{only two}} species {{are known as}} bipolar. Only one bipolar <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> possible here: that's where the dupe is itself the model. There are two such variants on this arrangement of mimic imitating its target, in the first case, termed Batesian-Wallacian mimicry after Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, the model is the prey species. In the second case, the model {{is the host of}} a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} forms {{white crystals}} where protactinium ions {{are arranged in}} pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.|$|E

5|$|The {{thoracic}} segments {{have one}} ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> also {{seen in the}} abdomen {{but only in the}} first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 20thcentury, {{there was only}} one {{recognized}} species of fork-marked lemur, although size and coloration differences had been noted previously. After comparing museum specimens, paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall and physical anthropologist Colin Groves recognized three new subspecies in 1991: the Pale fork-marked lemur (P.f.pallescens), Pariente's fork-marked lemur (P.f.parienti), and the Amber Mountain fork-marked lemur (P.f.electromontis). In 2001, Groves elevated all four subspecies to species status based on noticeable color, size, and body proportion differences between the fragmented populations. Although Tattersall disagreed with this promotion, citing inadequate information for the decision, the <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> generally accepted.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ship}} sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack {{encourage}} her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.|$|E

5|$|After {{they drive}} {{together}} and work naturally as a team, Speed begins {{to suspect that}} Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With {{the help of his}} family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours.|$|E
5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the dining room mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the upper balcony of the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the dining room, while the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
