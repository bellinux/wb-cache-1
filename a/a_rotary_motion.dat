25|$|Children's {{clothing}} (mikelnguut aturait) {{was made}} of soft skin of younger animals. Reindeer fawn and dog puppy skin parkas, with the fur inside, were made for babies (irniaq) and small children (mikelnguq). Puppies one and two months old were killed for the purpose. Fawn and puppy skins were turned inside out, scraped, hung out to dry, and then put away. When needed the skins were taken from storage, rubbed between the hands with <b>a</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>motion,</b> and chewed as necessary to soften and loosen tissue that had not previously been removed. For a sealskin parka, one skin was required for a three-year-old, two for a five- or six-year-old, and three for a child of 10 or 12 years. A small child's sealskin parka was often decorated with tassels of the same material stitched to the upper center of the back. A baby's boots were always made with the fur inside but otherwise were similar in construction to adult boots. In former times, babies wore long boots and no pants. When a child was toilet trained, pants separate from boots were put on a boy, while girls were given trouser-boots like those worn by women.|$|E
500|$|The pumping {{engine for}} use in mines was a great success. In 1782 the firm sought to modify Watt's {{invention}} so that the engine had <b>a</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>motion,</b> making it suitable {{for use in}} mills and factories. On a 1781 visit to Wales Boulton had seen a powerful copper-rolling mill driven by water, and when told it was often inoperable in the summer due to drought suggested that a steam engine would remedy that defect. [...] Boulton wrote to Watt urging the modification of the engine, warning that they were reaching {{the limits of the}} pumping engine market: [...] "There is no other Cornwall to be found, and the most likely line for increasing the consumption of our engines is the application of them to mills, which is certainly an extensive field." [...] Watt spent much of 1782 on the modification project, and though he was concerned that few orders would result, completed it {{at the end of the}} year. [...] One order was received in 1782, and several others from mills and breweries soon after. [...] George III toured the Whitbread brewery in London, and was impressed by the engine. [...] As a demonstration, Boulton used two engines to grind wheat at the rate of 150bushels per hour in his new Albion Mill in London. [...] While the mill was not financially successful, according to historian Jenny Uglow it served as a [...] "publicity stunt par excellence" [...] for the firm's latest innovation. [...] Before its 1791 destruction by fire, the mill's fame, according to early historian Samuel Smiles, [...] "spread far and wide", and orders for rotative engines poured in not only from Britain but from the United States and the West Indies.|$|E

60|$|Tomorrow was Monday. Monday, the {{beginning}} of another school-week! Another shameful, barren school-week, mere routine and mechanical activity. Was not the adventure of death infinitely preferable? Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life? A life of barren routine, without inner meaning, without any real significance. How sordid life was, how {{it was a terrible}} shame to the soul, to live now! How much cleaner and more dignified to be dead! One could not bear any more of this shame of sordid routine and mechanical nullity. One might come to fruit in death. She had had enough. For where was life to be found? No flowers grow upon busy machinery, there is no sky to a routine, there is no space to <b>a</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>motion.</b> And all life was <b>a</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>motion,</b> mechanised, cut off from reality.

Now one was not a child, and one knew that the soul was a prisoner within this sordid vast edifice of life, and there was no escape, save in death.|$|E

60|$|I quoted, just now, from Sir John Herschell, the {{following}} words, used {{in reference to}} the clusters:—“On one hand, without <b>a</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>motion</b> and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of progressive collapse.” The fact is, that, in surveying the “nebulæ” with a telescope of high power, we shall find it quite impossible, having once conceived this idea of “collapse,” not to gather, at all points, corroboration of the idea. A nucleus is always apparent, in the direction of which the stars seem to be precipitating themselves; nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective phænomena:—the clusters are really denser near the centre—sparser in the regions more remote from it. In a word, we see every thing as we should see it were a collapse taking place; but, in general, it may be said of these clusters, that we can fairly entertain, while looking at them, the idea of orbitual movement about a centre, only by admitting the possible existence, in the distant domains of space, of dynamical laws with which we are unacquainted.|$|E
60|$|Now, however, {{with the}} terrible {{artillery}} invented in modern times, a single man, {{if he has}} the requisite courage, coolness, and steadiness of nerve, is a match for such a lion. The weapon used is a double-barreled carabine, both barrels being rifled, that is, provided with spiral grooves within, that operate to give the bullets <b>a</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>motion</b> as they issue from the muzzle, by which they bore {{their way through the}} air, as it were, to their destination, with a surprising directness and precision. The bullets discharged by these carabines are not balls, but cylinders, pointed with a cone at the forward end. They are hollow, and are filled with a fulminating composition which is capable of exploding with a force vastly greater than that of gunpowder. The conical point at the end is made separate from the body of the cylinder, and slides into it by a sort of shank, which, when the bullet strikes the body of the lion or other wild beast, acts like a sort of percussion cap to explode the fulminating powder, and thus the instant that the missile enters the animal's body it bursts with a terrible explosion, and scatters the iron fragments of the cylinder among his vitals. Thus, while an ordinary musket ball might lodge in his flesh, or even pass entirely through some parts of his body, without producing any other effect than to arouse him to a phrensy, and redouble the force with which he would spring upon his foe, the bursting of one of these fulminating bullets almost any where within his body brings him down in an instant, and leaves him writhing and rolling upon the ground in the agonies of death.|$|E
