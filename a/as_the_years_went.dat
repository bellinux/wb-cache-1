5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by {{with further}} childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine {{continued to be}} devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E

5|$|Another {{key figure}} in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after {{falling in love with}} her in Paris in 1888. The {{daughter}} of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be {{the most beautiful woman in}} Copenhagen. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.|$|E

5|$|In later life, she {{eventually}} adopted more conventional behaviour, took up pious works and even reformed the convent that became her second {{residence in the}} Paris suburbs. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by she suffered serious setbacks to her health and the sadness of mourning her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando, for whom {{she had had a}} genuine affection.

5|$|The Polish {{architect}} Władysław Horodecki originally {{constructed the}} House with Chimaeras {{for use as}} his own upmarket apartment building {{during the period of}} 1901–1902. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, Horodecki eventually had to sell the building due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times before finally being occupied by an official Communist Party polyclinic until the early 2000s. When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Horodecki original plans.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was said}} by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky body and was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of temper and, on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect. Henry {{was said to have}} understood a wide range of languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E

5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, {{the reputation of}} the models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models and the park fell into disrepair <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> on, and {{recognition}} of Schneerson as being so toweringly unique, a Rebbe of truly unprecedented and universally recognized stature, spread ever further, this Messianic speculation spread to greater numbers and higher volume than in previous generations.

25|$|Yeltsin's {{personal}} and health problems received {{a great deal}} of attention in the global press. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> on, he was often viewed as an increasingly unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure he was once seen as. The possibility that he might die in office was often discussed. Starting in the last years of his presidential term, Yeltsin's primary residence was the Gorki-9 presidential dacha west of Moscow. He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in Barvikha.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, Goldin embellished {{his role}} in the battle more and more. The height of {{embellishment}} is found in a chapter in the book Northwestern fights and fighters by Cyrus Townsend Brady. In addition to his claims of carrying Custer's last dispatch, Goldin claimed he joined the Seventh Cavalry in 1873, witnessed the death of Lt. Benjamin Hodgson, and was present for a discussion of strategy between Captain Myles Keogh and General Custer. When others challenged his claims, Goldin claimed that Brady had distorted his letter.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Battle of White Wolf Mountain {{scattered}} the Wuhuan tribes, with remnants taking refuge in Manchuria, Goguryeo, {{and the western}} borders of Liaodong. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, these remnant Wuhuan tribes were eventually absorbed by the stronger powers nearby — some were assimilated by the Chinese, but most were incorporated into the Xianbei. The decline that began at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain destroyed the Wuhuan identity {{and their ability to}} remain politically independent, and for the most part, the Wuhuan ceased to be viewed as an independent people of the northern frontiers of China.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> by, {{the three}} feudal lords and their {{extensive}} territories became increasingly autonomous. Finally, in 1673, Shang Kexi petitioned Kangxi {{for permission to}} retire to his hometown in Liaodong province and nominated his son as his successor. The young emperor granted his retirement, but denied the heredity of his fief. In reaction, the two other generals decided to petition for their own retirements to test Kangxi's resolve, thinking {{that he would not}} risk offending them. The move backfired as the young emperor called their bluff by accepting their requests and ordering that all three fiefdoms to be reverted to the crown.|$|E

In a double wedding with her sister, Maria Amalia, {{who was the}} {{original}} intended bride, married her much older uncle, Infante Antonio. The marriage between the two different personalities {{turned out to be}} happy, though it was clouded by Louis' ill health: He was frail, suffering chest problems, and since a childhood accident when he hit his head on a marble table, suffered epileptic fits. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> on his health deteriorated and he grew to be increasingly dependent on his wife.

25|$|Two of {{the most}} {{well-known}} societies were the Order of the Red Friars and the Order of the White Duchy. The Order of the Red Friars was founded in 1913 with an initial purpose to promote school spirit. Later, the group declared a change of mission {{to focus more on}} fostering loyalty to Duke University. The Order, as it was colloquially-known, was semi-secret. This is because the selection of new members, known as tapping, was held {{on the steps of the}} Duke Chapel in broad daylight. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> on, the rites of tapping became more elaborate; in the final and most traditional form of the rite, a red-hooded and robed figure publicly tapped new men into membership on the steps of the chapel. Some notable members of the Order were President Richard M. Nixon, William P. Few, and Rex Adams.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, the time-traveller Kang the Conqueror {{arrived in}} Egypt and assumed the {{identity}} of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. Knowing who En Sabah Nur was fated to become and where he was, Rama-Tut sent his General Ozymandias and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal were injured and sought refuge in a cave. Before he died, Baal revealed advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, {{left behind by the}} deity-like aliens known as Celestials. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur entered the Pharaoh's city posing as a slave and drew the romantic attention of Ozymandias's sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant's true appearance, Nephri rejected him and turned to her brother for protection. Heartbroken, En Sabah Nur's rage caused his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renamed himself Apocalypse. Rama-Tut fled and En Sabah Nur used the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>went</b> on, Apocalypse found he no longer aged.|$|E
