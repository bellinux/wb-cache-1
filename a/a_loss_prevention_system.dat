40|$|Part 6 : FORENSIC TOOLSInternational audienceThe {{threat of}} {{insiders}} stealing valuable corporate data continues to escalate. The inadvertent exposure of internal data {{has also become}} a major problem. Data <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>systems</b> are designed to monitor and block attempts at exposing sensitive data to the outside world. They have become very popular, {{to the point where}} forensic investigators have to take these systems into account. This chapter describes the first experimental analysis of data <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>systems</b> that attempts to ascertain their effectiveness at stopping the unauthorized exposure of sensitive data and the ease with which the systems could be circumvented. Four systems are evaluated (three of them in detail). The results point to considerable weaknesses in terms of general effectiveness and the ease with which the systems could be disabled...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Inadvertent data {{disclosure}} by insiders is con-sidered {{as one of}} {{the biggest}} threats for corporate informa-tion security. Data <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>systems</b> typically try to cope with this problem by monitoring access to confidential data and preventing their leakage or improper handling. Current solutions in this area, however, often provide limited means to enforce more complex security policies that for instance specify temporal or cardinal constraints on the execution of events. This paper presents UC 4 Win, <b>a</b> data <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> solution for Microsoft Windows operating systems that is based on the concept of data-driven usage control to allow such a fine-grained policy-based protection. UC 4 Win is capable of detecting and controlling data-loss related events at the level of individual function calls. This is done with function call interposition techniques to intercept application calls to the Windows API in combination with methods to track the flows of confidential data through the system.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate product shrinkage in the retail supply chain, and to consider how radio frequency identification (RFID) could act as a partial solution toward <b>a</b> retailer’s <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> strategy. The research uses semi-structured interviews to collect data, and a qualitative content analysis to present the results. Given that the number of RFID deployments in the retail supply chain is limited, RFID vendors, resellers, and associations are instead used to gather the current value propositions. Representatives from nine Australian RFID vendors and associations were interviewed in August and September of 2006. The results indicate that RFID can be used to minimize losses in the supply chain significantly and particularly address product authentication issues. For RFID to be adopted as <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> mechanism, however, organizations must have some visibility of what constitutes product shrinkage in their retail supply chain, and the resultant monetary losses ensuing. All too often, return on investment (ROI) calculations on the adoption of RFID in retail, is calculated only on known sources of product shrinkage, while unknown sources are unaccounted...|$|R

40|$|In Phase 2 of this {{empirical}} observation study, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} determine whether <b>a</b> designed <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> program can be optimized to minimize the loss-producing incident rate. In Phase 1, a statistically significant mathematical relationship was proposed between the incident rate and interventions implemented to reduce that rate. In this phase, the primary objective {{is to use the}} Phase 1 mathematical function to formulate a mathematical model that calculates a minimized incident rate. Evaluating 81 application rate level combinations of four intervention categories and subjecting them to management constraints accomplished this. The resulting model provides insight into the design of <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> program that will prescribe the appropriate amount of human resource time that should be assigned to specific safety-related intervention activity. The secondary objective of Phase 2 is to use actual verification data in conjunction with Phase 1 data to test the adequacy and accuracy of the optimization model. Findings indicate that the model predicts with reasonable accuracy, intuitively expected results. The verification data show that the model’s “optimum” intervention application rate was within the actual observed lower incident rate range...|$|R

The exploratory study was conducted using a single case study of a hardware retailer stocking 5000 product lines provided by 110 active suppliers. To analyze the present mode of operation, procedural documents, semi-structured interviews and a participant observation was conducted. The basis for the proof of concept was a future mode of operation using a quasi-experimental design.

30|$|Hunt et al. also {{assert that}} Data <b>Loss</b> <b>Prevention</b> (DLP) <b>systems</b> are mature in some regards. However their {{capability}} to link {{back to the}} original events pertaining to breaches with forensics is “largely lacking”. They emphasize that DLPs should integrate better with SIEM systems to improve the “very serious” situation of needing better forensic capabilities. Importantly they realize it is “inevitable” that for both real-time security and forensics the focus needs to shift from network protection to data centric protection (i.e., data leakage from the database). Intuitively, this is a compelling argument given that gaining access to such data is a major motivation for attackers.|$|R
40|$|As the Internet {{grows and}} network {{bandwidth}} continues to increase, administrators {{are faced with}} the task of keeping confidential information from leaving their networks. Today’s network traffic is so voluminous that manual inspection would be unreasonably expensive. In response, researchers have created data <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>systems</b> that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naïve adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data—an impossible task in the general case—our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer. In this paper, we present measurement algorithms for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the main protocol for web browsing. When applied to real web browsing traffic, the algorithms were able to discount 98. 5 % of measured bytes and effectively isolate information leaks. 1...|$|R

The <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> specialist discovered that the credit card was reported stolen and detained Moore.

A jury found him guilty on all counts, and the court adjudicated him as a small habitual criminal. Moore appealed his conviction on all counts. The Nevada Supreme Court upheld the convictions for burglary and possession of a credit card without the cardholder’s consent and the adjudication as a small habitual criminal on those counts, but reversed the conviction for fraudulent use of a credit card. The court determined that a stolen credit card must be processed and charged to constitute fraudulent use. Since Moore’s attempt to obtain goods with a stolen credit card failed, he did not actually “use” the stolen card and could not be convicted...|$|R
