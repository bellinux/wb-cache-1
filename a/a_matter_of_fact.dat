5|$|The {{remaining}} 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is ordinary matter, that is, atoms, ions, {{electrons and}} the objects they form. This matter includes stars, which produce {{nearly all of}} the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media, planets, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.|$|E

25|$|Brazil's {{transmission}} system {{is growing in}} importance since adequate transmission capacity is essential to manage the effects of regional droughts, allowing to move power from areas where rainfall is plentiful. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> the rationing that occurred in Brazil during 2001-2002 (See The 2001-2002 crisis below), could have largely been averted {{if there had been}} adequate transmission capacity between the south (excess supply) and the southeast (severe deficit).|$|E
25|$|Hieroglyphs are {{ubiquitous}} {{and were}} written on every available surface, including the human body. The glyphs themselves are highly detailed, {{and particularly the}} logograms are deceivingly realistic. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> from an art-historical point of view, they should also be viewed as art motifs, and vice versa. Sculptors at Copan and Quirigua have consequently felt free to convert hieroglyphic elements and calendrical signs into animated, dramatic miniature scenes ('full figure glyphs').|$|E

50|$|As {{also found}} {{in a recent survey}} done by RSA, women are {{considered}} to ‘’bring empathy and intuition to leadership”, since they have greater awareness of the motivations and concerns of other people. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> 62 per cent of the respondents of the survey stated that women contribute differently in the boardroom, compared to their male colleagues.|$|R
25|$|Exclusive {{occupation}} – Also <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> although {{legal title}} will often play a part. The courts have laid down that {{where there are}} competing occupations, the facts must be considered to establish where paramount control lies.

25|$|However, in 1884, the {{conflict}} between the Progressives and the Sadaes intensified. When American legation officials, particularly Naval Attaché George C. Foulk, heard about the growing problem, they were outraged and reported directly to the Queen Consort. The Americans attempted to bring the two groups to peace with each other in order to aid the Queen Consort in a peaceful transformation of Joseon into a modern nation. After all, she liked the ideas and plans of both parties. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> she was in support of many of the Progressive's ideas, except for severing relations with China.|$|E
25|$|The {{larger context}} in which Wittgenstein's {{philosophy}} is seen to develop considers his uncompromising opposition to essences, mental entities {{and other forms of}} idealism which were accepted as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in continental philosophy {{at the turn of the}} preceding century. In his view, the main cause for such errors is language and its uncritical use. In the received view, concepts, categories or classes are taken to rely on necessary features common to all items covered by them. Abstraction is the procedure which acknowledges this necessity and derives essences, but in the absence of a single common feature, it is bound to fail.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} unsophisticated and ad-hoc {{nature of}} sessions {{is due to}} the fact they weren't part of the initial design, and had to be developed, with minimal disruption to the main line, by a third party (Citrix Systems) as a prerequisite for their terminal server product for Windows NT, called WinFrame. Starting with Windows Vista, though, sessions finally became a proper aspect of the Windows architecture. No longer a memory manager construct that creeps into user mode indirectly through Win32, they were expanded into a pervasive abstraction affecting most Executive subsystems. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> regular use of Windows Vista always results in a multi-session environment.|$|E
25|$|The ULFA is {{a revolutionary}} {{political}} organisation {{engaged in a}} liberation struggle against state terrorism and economic exploitation by India {{for the establishment of}} a sovereign, independent Assam for the Indigenous Assamese people. It does not consider itself a secessionist organisation, as it claims that Assam was never a part of India and as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> the Treaty of Yandaboo was signed in 1826 by General Sir Archibald Campbell on the British side, and by Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side. With the British army at Yandabo village, only 50 miles from the capital Ava, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms without discussion.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there is}} no {{reference}} in any source prior to this work to this figure named Pharamond, who is placed prior to Chlodio (that is, before ca. 428), scholars consider him a legendary rather than historical figure. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in several sources, for example Gregory of Tours, multiple kings are attested to rule simultaneously in later times. It is thus a dubious matter to assume that, even if Pharamond existed, he was ever recognized as sole king. The first king of the Franks {{who may have been}} close to this position was Clovis I, but after his death his empire was divided again amongst his sons, who ruled again simultaneously.|$|E

Interestingly, examining the ISEE observations during two events, Le and Russell (1992) found that upstream wave properties depend on their location in the foreshock: waves are weak, nearly transversal in the deep foreshock while become stronger and more compressional close to the bow shock.|$|R

25|$|One other {{note about}} ABC {{baseball}} coverage during this period. Despite temporarily losing the Game of the Week package in 1961, ABC still televised several games {{in prime time}} (with Jack Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60. As with all Major League Baseball games in those days, the action was totally blacked out of major league markets. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> as documented in the HBO film 61*, the Maris family was welcomed into ABC's Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KMBC-TV so they could watch the in-house feed of the game, which was blacked out of Kansas City.|$|E
25|$|Easty was {{the lowest}} ranking author of the {{surviving}} journals of the First Fleet. He describes events on the voyage and in the colony in simple, irregular English. Incidents include accidents, crimes and punishments, and encounters with Aboriginal people. In March 1788 he received a flogging for bringing a female convict into the camp. Some of the journal is hearsay or was written later. Most of the events are reported in <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> way, but Easty sometimes expresses his own strong opinions on matters such as {{the administration of the}} colony and religious beliefs. On 22 February 1790, he writes that he and a private in the 53rd Regiment, Thomas Brimage, signed and sealed their lasts wills and testaments to each other.|$|E
25|$|This was not Cornell University's first {{venture into}} forestry. Almost forty years earlier, under the 1862 Morrill Land Grant Act, the Federal land grant scrip for New York state of 989,920 acres {{was given to}} Cornell to the later chagrin of the {{trustees}} of Syracuse and New York Universities. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> Genesee College, the forerunner of Syracuse University, accepted $25,000 from Ezra Cornell to drop its opposition to the proceeds from the Morrill Land grant going to Cornell University. Ezra Cornell, under advice from lumberman trustee Henry W. Sage, wisely parlayed the grant into ownership of Wisconsin pine lands that he held until the wanton logging was diminished and the price for lumber increased, providing a substantial endowment for the university.|$|E

Attackers with such a behavior are impossible to detect as their profile is too similar to normal users. Indeed, the only two such reported attackers were detected thanks to the acquaintance network inferred from logs.|$|R

25|$|The Muslim {{community}} did not lag behind, {{the faith}} spread. The central mosque was built about 1930 and thereafter, {{a number of}} mosques were built in Idemo, Umayo, Isato (Irona), Ogbonado, Okesa, Oke-Ila etc. The Ansar-Ud-Deen emerged in the early 1940s. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> the number of mosques {{and the number of}} Muslims who have performed the Hajj can readily come to hand as indices of expansion. The number of mosques increased substantially with the growing number of well-to-do Muslim who build mosques as annexes to their private homes; by the year 2000, more than forty mosques could be counted in the city. By 1960, only Alhaji Akorede had performed the Hajj but the number of Alhajs increased in the 1970s and steadily increased in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|If the Republic {{had been}} a Monarchy, or if the office of stadtholder had already been {{hereditary}} (as it was to become after the Orangist amendments of 1747) the posthumous child would no doubt have been acclaimed stadtholder automatically, and a Regency would have been put into place, as happened in 1751, when three-year-old William V succeeded his deceased father in office in all seven provinces. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> this was proposed by the Orangist faction in the Republic, and especially by Willem Frederik, who proposed himself {{in the role of}} Lieutenant-Stadtholder in the five provinces in which he was not already stadtholder in his own right, until baby William would come of age. But this proposal elicited little enthusiasm from the Holland regents, who still vividly remembered his role in the recent coup.|$|E
25|$|In the Mediterranean {{a kind of}} {{division}} of labor between the English and Dutch came into being after the war: the English were the main customers for olive oil and currants, and the Navigation Act therefore helped them to monopolize this trade. On the other hand, the Dutch monopolized the trade in spices and fine-cloth (the English being left with the trade in lower-value textiles). The English were the major buyers of Italian raw silk, whereas this trade was for the Dutch marginal in comparison with their Asian and Persian silk trade. Generally, the Dutch had a favorable balance of trade with this area (and the English a negative one), because the Dutch dominated more trades (like that in Baltic naval stores and salt) and more profitable ones. As <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> {{the total value of}} the Mediterranean and Levant trade to the Dutch was about equal to that of the Far-Eastern trade of the VOC, both bringing in about 20 million guilders annually.|$|E
