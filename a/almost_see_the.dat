500|$|One of {{the more}} {{positive}} responses to Chabon's brand of [...] "trickster literature" [...] appeared in Time magazine, whose Lev Grossman wrote that [...] "This is literature in mid-transformation.... he highbrow and the lowbrow, once kept chastely separate, are now hooking up, [...] you can <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> future of literature coming." [...] Grossman classed Chabon with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing, including Jonathan Lethem (with whom Chabon is friends), Margaret Atwood, and Susanna Clarke.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{earliest}} influence on comedy, Chappelle said, [...] "You know who was a big influence on me that is really weird is Bugs Bunny, That's just weird. If you {{watch a lot of}} the stuff I do, you can <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> influence in it, Because these animators would animate these performances that were off the hook, And the guy that, the guy that did the voices was Mel Blanc. This guy was like some kind of savant or genius or something, But they had some kind of real big comedic influence on me, like I liked those cartoons, I think that was my first real big comedy influence, was a rabbit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first {{appeared}} opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner [...] "easy to like and sharp with her timing", {{he was disappointed}} to see her as [...] "the love interest, {{which is not the}} same as a rounded character." [...] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as [...] "less a co-star than a place holder (you can <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> words “enter generic female lead” in [...] screenplay)." [...] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner – [...] "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" [...] – against type. David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she [...] "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an [...] "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance" [...] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she [...] "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before." [...] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey. In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.|$|E
5000|$|The manager {{gets back}} behind his counter and <b>almost</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> {{suitcase}} moving several times (Bean being in it changing). Matthew then {{comes back and}} locks the suitcase, and brings {{it out to the}} car, dropping it on the stairs. Just then, Mr Bean shows up at the counter in a sparkly gown and wig and lipstick, saying [...] "426 please", and the manager replies [...] "certainly, madam".|$|R

60|$|She showed {{wonderful}} courage. I could <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> cry {{for help}} rising to her lips. She repressed it; she had still presence of mind enough to foresee what might happen before she could rouse the sleeping men.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a hill," [...] Rachel replied. There {{could be}} no doubt that Mrs. Flushing had {{represented}} the vigorous and abrupt fling of the earth up into the air; you could <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> clods flying as it whirled.|$|E

60|$|To {{precisely}} describe Captain De Stancy's admiration was impossible. A sun {{seemed to}} rise in his face.

50|$|Some {{accounts}} of the custom state that the watchers must be fasting, or must circle the church before taking up position. The ghosts {{of those who were}} to die soon would be the first observed, while those who would <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> out <b>the</b> year would not be witnessed until almost 1.00 a.m. Other variations of the superstition say that <b>the</b> watchers would <b>see</b> headless or rotting corpses, or coffins approaching. Another tradition holds that a young woman can <b>see</b> <b>the</b> face of her future husband appear on her smock by holding it before the fire on St Mark's Eve.|$|R
50|$|In 1902, the Duchess and {{her husband}} {{travelled}} to Russia, where they dined with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and visited his mother, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna at the Anichkov Palace. During this visit, the Duchess would have <b>almost</b> certainly <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Dowager Empress' large collection of Fabergé items, which perhaps inspired her to order this egg. The egg {{is believed to have}} cost over 5,000 rubles.|$|R
60|$|IN {{the center}} of the valley was a great cluster of palaces that {{appeared}} to be built of crystal and silver and mother-of-pearl, and golden filigree-work. So dainty and beautiful were these fairy dwellings that Twinkle had no doubt for an instant but that she gazed upon fairyland. She could <b>almost</b> <b>see,</b> from <b>the</b> far mountain upon which she stood, the airy, gauze-winged forms of the fairies themselves, floating gently amidst their pretty palaces and moving gracefully along the jeweled streets.|$|R
60|$|In fact, if {{you were}} to mount to the roof of the Mausoleum Club itself on Plutoria Avenue you could <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> slums from there. But why should you?

60|$|And then Milly loomed {{up with a}} {{thousand}} dishes on her bare arm--loomed up big and white and pink and awful as Mount Saint Elias--with a smile like day breaking in a gulch.

60|$|But {{his first}} remarks were quite {{sensible}} in meaning and tone. Apparently {{he had no}} recollection of the night scene. And if he had he didn't betray himself once. Neither did he talk very much. He sat on the skylight looking desperately ill at first, but that strong breeze, before which the last remnant of my crew had wilted down, seemed to blow a fresh stock of vigour into his frame with every gust. One could <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> process.|$|E
5000|$|Frequently, {{derealization}} {{occurs in}} the context of constant worrying or [...] "intrusive thoughts" [...] that one finds hard to switch off. In such cases it can build unnoticed along with the underlying anxiety attached to these disturbing thoughts, and be recognized only {{in the aftermath of a}} realization of crisis, often a panic attack, subsequently seeming difficult or impossible to ignore. This type of anxiety can be crippling to the affected and may lead to avoidant behavior. Those who experience this phenomenon may feel concern over the cause of their derealization. It is often difficult to accept that such a disturbing symptom is simply a result of anxiety, and the individual may often think that the cause must be something more serious. This can, in turn, cause more anxiety and worsen the derealization.Derealization also affects the learning process. Because <b>the</b> individual <b>almost</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> events as if in third person, they cannot properly process information.|$|R
60|$|They {{seemed to}} be getting deeper and deeper into the woods. The trees around them were so dense that it was <b>almost</b> {{impossible}} to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> direction of the sun. Several times they came to a halt to look around.|$|R

"My dear Mrs. Annesley," [...] said Mrs. Crabtree, consoling her in {{that she}} would not be far removed from her child, [...] "you can <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> brewery {{chimneys}} from the church tower." [...] Those who knew the two ladies well were aware that there was some little slur intended by the allusion to brewery chimneys. Mrs. Crabtree's girl had married the third son of Sir Reginald Rattlepate. The Rattlepates were not rich, and the third son was not inclined to earn his bread.|$|E
6000|$|Katharine {{immediately}} dropped {{all that}} she was holding; her strained expression relaxed, and exclaiming, [...] "Of course! Why didn't I think of that!" [...] she seized the telephone receiver and gave her number. Mary looked at her steadily, and then left the room. At length Katharine heard, through all the superimposed weight of London, the mysterious sound of feet in her own house mounting to the little room, where she could <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pictures and the books; she listened with extreme intentness to the preparatory vibrations, and then established her identity.|$|E
6000|$|... "How delicious {{they smell}} {{in the open}} air! I adore them. Who'd think the moon was two hundred and thirty-six {{thousand}} eight hundred and forty-seven miles off?"

60|$|Blacky's {{heart beat}} fast with {{excitement}} {{as he drew}} near that old tumble-down nest. Would those two big white eggs be there? Perhaps there would be three!

60|$|And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl {{passing the}} Stewart institution, {{head in the}} air. Look at me. I have them all on. Must be strange not to see her.

6000|$|At length {{the fatal}} day drew nigh. [...] "To-morrow," [...] said Don Ambrosio, {{as he left}} her one evening, [...] "to-morrow is the auto da fé. To-morrow you will {{hear the sound of}} the bell that tolls your father to his death. You will <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> smoke that rises from the funeral pile. I leave you to yourself. It is yet in my power to save him. Think whether you can stand to-morrow's horrors without shrinking! Think whether you can endure the after-reflection, that you were the cause of his death, and that merely through a perversity in refusing proffered happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall like to go, Shirley," [...] again said Miss Helstone. [...] "I long to {{hear the}} sound of waves--ocean-waves--and to see them as I have {{imagined}} them in dreams, like tossing banks of green light, strewed with vanishing and reappearing wreaths of foam, whiter than lilies. I shall delight to pass the shores of those lone rock-islets where the sea-birds live and breed unmolested. We shall be on the track of the old Scandinavians--of the Norsemen. We shall <b>almost</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> shores of Norway. This is a very vague delight that I feel, communicated by your proposal, but it is a delight." ...|$|E
5000|$|An early {{version of}} the song had [...] "an inexplicable hard-rock {{breakdown}} and a chorus, in which Bruno Mars shouted, [...] "Burn this motherfucker down!".
