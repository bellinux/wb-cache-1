However, these drugs can exert severe side effects (<b>accommodation</b> <b>paralysis,</b> constipation, tachycardia, dry mouth and blurred vision) and some patients are refractory to their actions. Thus {{there is a need for}} new drug therapies with novel mechanisms of action. �-Adrenoceptors are found in the body of the bladder, where they mediate relaxation of the detrusor muscle. It has been reported that � 3 -adrenoceptor subtypes are predominantly present in the smooth muscles of bladder and urethra in the pig and human. Recently, � 3 -adrenoceptors have been reported to predominantly mediate relaxation of the bladder smooth muscle. However, the relaxant effects of � 3 -adrenoceptor agonists are half of those of (±) isoproterenol, a non-selective �-adrenoceptor agonist, and the antagonist affinity of � 3 -adrenoceptor antagonists varies according to the drugs tested. It has also been suggested that both � 2 -, and � 3 -adrenoceptors are involved in relaxation of the human bladder, but the involvement of the � 3 -adrenoceptor may be greater than that of � 2 -adrenoceptor. Another possibility is that other �-adrenoceptors, possibly � 4 -adrenoceptor and/or atypical �-adrenoceptors, may coexist and play a functional role in mediating the relaxation of the bladder.
