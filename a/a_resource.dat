5|$|A URN is a URI that {{identifies}} <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> by {{name in a}} particular namespace. A URN {{may be used to}} talk about <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> without implying its location or how to access it. For example, in the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 identifies a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. To gain access to the book, its location is needed, for which a URL would have to be specified.|$|E
5|$|In {{information}} technology, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is {{a string}} of characters used to identify <b>a</b> <b>resource.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} {{three and a half}} years, as the World Wide Web's core {{technologies}} of HTML, HTTP, and web browsers developed, a need to distinguish a string that provided an address for <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> from a string that merely named <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> emerged. Although not yet formally defined, the term Uniform Resource Locator came to represent the former, and the more contentious Uniform Resource Name came to represent the latter.|$|E

5000|$|In {{computer}} science, <b>a</b> Uniform <b>Resource</b> Characteristic (URC) is {{a string}} of characters representing the metadata of <b>a</b> Uniform <b>Resource</b> Identifier (URI), <b>a</b> string identifying <b>a</b> Web <b>resource).</b> <b>A</b> URC binds a URI's associated Uniform <b>Resource</b> Name (URN), <b>a</b> unique name for <b>a</b> Web <b>resource)</b> to its Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the location at which <b>a</b> Web <b>resource</b> can be found). [...] URCs were proposed as a specification in the mid-1990s, but were never adopted.|$|R

5|$|A URI {{reference}} {{may take}} the form of a full URI, the scheme-specific portion of a full URI, a trailing component of a full URI, or the empty string. An optional fragment identifier, preceded by #, may be present at the end of a URI reference. The part of the reference before the # indirectly identifies <b>a</b> <b>resource,</b> and the fragment identifier identifies some portion of that resource.|$|E
5|$|A URL is a URI that, in {{addition}} to identifying a web resource, specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation of it, i.e. specifying both its primary access mechanism and network location. For example, the URL http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page refers to <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> identified as /wiki/Main_Page whose representation, {{in the form of}} HTML and related code, is obtainable via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http:) from a network host whose domain name is example.org.|$|E

5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also note}} Flagg’s penchant for evil. Tony Magistrale, author of Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre to The Dark Half sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain {{comparing}} him to Iago, Edmund and Richard III, contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg’s evil {{is based on}} his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, it is merely <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> to achieve a greater level of destruction.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves mimicry of <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested that}} females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E

5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> {{represented}} by a lug nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation provides {{a different type of}} cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the book}} has {{influenced}} a number of non-fiction books including The Song of the Dodo by David Quammen (1997), which discussed Wallace's contributions {{to the field of}} island biogeography; The Spice Islands Voyage by Tim Severin (1997) that retraced Wallace's travels; and Archipelago: The Islands of Indonesia, by Gavan Daws (1999), which compared the environment described by Wallace with the modern state of the archipelago. The Malay Archipelago is considered {{to be one of the}} most influential books ever written about the Indonesian islands. It remains <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> for modern authors of works about the region such as the 2014 book Indonesia Etc, which contains multiple quotations from Wallace's book as well as recommending it as further reading on the geography of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} lignotuber, which stores energy and {{nutrients}} as <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> for rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the plant community becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire {{as the rest of}} the plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{provides}} {{background on}} the development of the term brainwashing, from its use in 1950 by journalist Edward Hunter and its later usage as applied to the spheres of cults, marketing, influence, thought reform, torture, and reeducation. She references psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton's work Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism as <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> throughout the book. Lifton based his research on interviews he conducted with prisoners of war who had been subjected to indoctrination and torture during the Korean War. Taylor argues that the term brainwashing is useful to when used to refer to a more coercive form of persuasion.|$|E
5|$|Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic-{{flowering}} species, {{relying on}} post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds {{to take advantage}} of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, {{it is one of the}} slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as <b>a</b> <b>resource</b> for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (Banksia) and wattles (Acacia). Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.|$|E
