The overall effort for closing tank and <b>ancillary</b> <b>systems</b> is very large and is in the initial stages of being addressed in a systematic manner. It was recognized in doing this effort, that gaps in both technology and material application for characterization and removal of residual waste and closure of <b>ancillary</b> <b>systems</b> would be identified. Great efficiencies are to be gained by defining the technology need areas early in the closure process and providing recommendations for technical programs to improve the closure strategies.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} linear {{quadratic}} Gaussian (LQG) feedback control strategy for a class of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. The feedback control law is designed based on the estimated states of a whitening quantum filter for an augmented Markovian model of the non-Markovian open quantum systems. In this augmented Markovian model, an <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> {{plays the role of}} internal modes of the environment converting white noise into Lorentzian noise and a principal system obeys non-Markovian dynamics due to the direct interaction with the <b>ancillary</b> <b>system.</b> The simulation results show the LQG controller with the whitening filter obtains a better control performance than that with a Markovian filter in the problem of minimizing the photon numbers of the principal system when the <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> is disturbed by thermal noise.

40|$|Squeezed {{states of}} spin systems are an {{important}} entangled resource for quantum technologies, particularly quantum metrology and sensing. Here we consider the generation of spin squeezed states by interacting the spins with a dissipative <b>ancillary</b> <b>system.</b> We show that spin squeezing can be generated in this model by two different mechanisms: one-axis twisting and driven collective relaxation. We can interpolate between the two mechanisms by simply adjusting the detuning between the dissipative <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> and the spin system. Interestingly, we find that for both mechanisms, <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> dissipation need not be considered an imperfection in our model, but plays a positive role in spin squeezing. To assess the feasibility of spin squeezing we consider two different implementations with superconducting circuits. We conclude that it is experimentally feasible to generate a squeezed state of hundreds of spins either by one-axis twisting or by driven collective relaxation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} Markovian {{representation}} approach to constructing quantum filters for a class of non-Markovian quantum systems disturbed by Lorenztian noise. An <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> is introduced to convert white noise into Lorentzian noise which is injected into a principal system via a direct interaction. The resulting dynamics of the principal system are non-Markovian, which are driven by the Lorentzian noise. By probing the principal system, a quantum filter for the augmented system {{can be derived from}} standard theory, where the conditional state of the principal system can be obtained by tracing out the <b>ancillary</b> <b>system.</b> An example is provided to illustrate the non-Markovian dynamics of the principal system.

30|$|However, the {{physical}} implementation {{of these models}} requires direct interactions between arbitrary pairs of register qubits and, often, direct application of single-qubit rotations and measurements. This is a huge practical challenge and most experimentally implemented or proposed schemes mediate the required multi-qubit interactions using some <b>ancillary</b> <b>system.</b> An example of such an ancilla-mediated scheme is the original Cirac-Zoller ion-trap gate [6], where the ancilla {{in this case is}} the collective quantized motion of the ions. Further examples include superconducting qubits coupled to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres [7 – 10] or transmission line resonators [11, 12], spin qubits coupled via ancillary photonic qubits [13, 14] and the coupling of a Cooper-pair box to a micro-mechanical resonator [15]. It is therefore of both practical and theoretical interest to study the effect of incorporating the <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> into the computational model. Indeed, those gates that {{have been shown to be}} universal in a direct implementation of the circuit model cannot in general be utilised to implement quantum computations entirely mediated via an ancilla. We will refer to schemes in which all the multi-qubit interactions are mediated via some <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> as ancilla-mediated quantum computation (AMQC).|$|E

We extend previous results for an <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> comprising a single spin to bigger ancillary systems and the interaction strength is enhanced by a factor of the number of ancillary spins.

The results are not general since only a limited amount of <b>ancillary</b> <b>systems</b> have been modeled, only two different drive cycles have been evaluated and simplified mathematical component models for a specific test truck have been used in the optimization problem.

40|$|Models of {{universal}} quantum computation {{in which the}} required interactions between register (computational) qubits are mediated by some <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> are highly relevant to experimental realisations of a quantum computer. We introduce such a universal model that employs a $d$-dimensional ancillary qudit. The ancilla-register interactions {{take the form of}} controlled displacements operators, with a displacement operator defined on the periodic and discrete lattice phase space of a qudit. We show that these interactions can implement controlled phase gates on the register by utilising geometric phases that are created when closed loops are traversed in this phase space. The extra degrees of freedom of the ancilla can be harnessed {{to reduce the number of}} operations required for certain gate sequences. In particular, we see that the computational advantages of the quantum bus (qubus) architecture, which employs a field-mode ancilla, are also applicable to this model. We then explore an alternative ancilla-mediated model which employs a spin-ensemble as the <b>ancillary</b> <b>system</b> and again the interactions with the register qubits are via controlled displacement operators, with a displacement operator defined on the Bloch sphere phase space of the spin coherent states of the ensemble. We discuss the computational advantages of this model and its relationship with the qubus architecture. Comment: Minor typos and errors correcte...|$|E
