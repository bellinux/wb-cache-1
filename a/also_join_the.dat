5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to <b>also</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they {{saw no reason}} to join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} roost communally {{on large}} trees, buildings or on cliffs. Roost sites are usually chosen {{close to a}} dump site or other suitable foraging area. In Spain and Morocco, summer roosts are formed mainly by immature birds. The favourite roost trees tended to be large dead pines. The number of adults at the roost increases towards June. It is thought that breeding adults {{may be able to}} forage more efficiently by joining the roost and following others to the best feeding areas. Breeding birds that failed to raise young may <b>also</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> non-breeding birds at the roost during June.|$|E

5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss by Germany with Austria, Yugoslavia {{shared a}} border with the Third Reich and came under {{increasing}} pro-Axis political pressure as her neighbours fell {{into line with}} the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with the Kingdom of Italy when that country invaded Albania. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, Italy invaded Greece, and Romania also joined the Pact. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their client states, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, Adolf Hitler invited the Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and his foreign minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković to Berchtesgaden and requested that Yugoslavia <b>also</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Pact. Two weeks later, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{struggled}} to assemble consecutive winning seasons, landing only two playoff berths since his arrival. The {{lack of success}} prompted the Bears' management to replace Neill Armstrong with Mike Ditka for the season {{that began in the}} Fall of 1982. Ditka, a tight end during the 1960s and 1970s who would <b>also</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Pro Football Hall of Fame, led the Bears to a 3–6 (strike-shortened) record in 1982. He led the Bears to an 8–8 finish in 1983 and to a 10–6 finish in 1984. Payton continued his success by rushing for more than 1,400 yards in both seasons. On October 7, 1984 against the New Orleans Saints, Payton broke Jim Brown's career rushing record of 12,312 yards. In 1985, Payton rushed for more than 1,500 yards, helping the Bears establish the league's second-best offense with the emergence of quarterback Jim McMahon. The Bears' 46 defense of that season would go on {{to become one of the}} best in NFL history, setting a record for fewest points allowed. In one 1984 game, Payton was pressed into service as the team's fourth-string quarterback.|$|E
