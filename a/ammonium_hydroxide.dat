5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions.

Treating actinium trifluoride with <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E

40|$|Novel optical {{carbon dioxide}} sensors {{are based on}} {{emulsion}} of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) – 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium salts in a silicone matrix. Semiquantitative determination of CO 2 is achieved by dissolving an absorption-based pH indicator (thymol blue, TB, or bromthymol blue, BTB) in the RTIL. A quantitative fluorimetric sensor makes use of 8 -hydroxypyrene- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonate (HPTS). The response of the fluorimetric sensors to CO 2 can easily be linearized which makes (re) calibration of the sensor very simple. It is demonstrated that a reference inert fluorescent dye (4 -dicyanomethylene- 2 -methyl- 6 -(4 -(dimethylamino) styryl) - 4 H-pyrane) can be added for ratiometric measurements. It is also shown that stable inorganic salts such as sodium phosphate can be used instead of quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydroxides.</b> Sensitivity of the material can be tuned by varying the pKa of an indicator.

5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E
40|$|Small-column ion {{exchange}} (SCIX) units installed in high-level waste tanks to remove Cs- 137 from highly alkaline salt solutions {{are among the}} waste treatment plans in the DOE-complex. Spherical Resorcinol-Formaldehyde (sRF) is the {{ion exchange}} resin selected {{for use in the}} Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). It is also the primary ion exchange material under consideration for SCIX at the Hanford site. The elution step of the multi-step ion exchange process is typically done with 0. 5 M nitric acid. An acid eluant is a potential hazard {{in the event of a}} spill, leak, etc. because the high-level waste tanks are made of carbon steel. Corrosion and associated structural damage may ensue. A study has been conducted to explore non-acid elution as an alternative. Batch contact sorption equilibrium screening tests have been conducted with 36 potential non-acid eluants. The sorption tests involve equilibrating each cesium-containing eluant solution with the sRF resin for 48 hours at 25 C in a shaker oven. In the sorption tests, an eluant is deemed to have a high cesium elution potential if it minimizes cesium sorption onto the sRF resin. The top candidates (based on lowest cesium sorption distribution coefficients) include ammonium carbonate, <b>ammonium</b> carbonate/ammonium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>ammonium</b> bicarbonate, rubidium carbonate, ammonium acetate, <b>ammonium</b> acetate/ammonium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>ammonium</b> bicarbonate/ammonium <b>hydroxide,</b> calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride. A select few of the top candidate eluants from the screening tests were subjected to actual sorption (loading) and elution tests to confirm their elution ability. The actual sorption (loading) and elution tests mimicked the typical sRF-cesium ion exchange process (i. e., sorption or loading, caustic wash, water rinse, and elution) via batch contact sorption and quasi column caustic wash/water rinse/elution. The eluants tested included ammonium carbonate, ammonium acetate, calcium acetate, magnesium acetate, and nitric acid. Calcium acetate and magnesium acetate were substitutes for calcium chloride and magnesium chloride respectively due to corrosion concerns. Nitric acid was selected for benchmarking since it is the baseline cesium eluant for sRF resin. The cesium elution performance of ammonium carbonate and ammonium acetate was approximately the same as the benchmark eluant, nitric acid. Ninety-seven (97), 94, and 100 % percent of the cesium sorbed or loaded were eluted by ammonium carbonate, ammonium acetate, and nitric acid was respectively. The performance of calcium acetate and magnesium acetate, on the other hand, was mediocre. Percent elution was 16 and 8 respectively...|$|R

5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E

Lt was found that the action of these sulfur compounds was strikingly like that of the analogous nitrogen compounds, the chief difference being that the nitrogen compounds were more active, due, appar-ently to the presence of the additional alkyl group. We have investigated a series of compounds in which sulfur has replaced the oxygen in choline and formocholine ethers. Only the trimethyl-ammonium compounds will be considered at present; for compounds with other alkyl groups have, as has been pointed out in a number of earlier papers, quite different pharmacological properties and, as will be discussed in a later paper, we have found the same to be true of the sulfur analogues of alkyl-ammonium compounds.

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membranes that conduct hydroxide ions {{have potential}} use in fuel cells. A variety of polystyrene-based quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> {{have been reported}} as anion exchange fuel cell membranes. However, the hydrolytic stability and conductivity of the commercially available membranes are not adequate {{to meet the requirements}} of fuel cell applications. When compared with commercially available membranes, polystyrene-imidazolium alkaline membrane electrolytes are more stable and more highly conducting. At the time of this reporting, this has been the first such usage for imidazolium-based polymeric materials for fuel cells. Imidazolium salts are known to be electrochemically stable over wide potential ranges. By controlling the relative ratio of imidazolium groups in polystyrene-imidazolium salts, their physiochemical properties could be modulated. Alkaline anion exchange membranes based on polystyrene-imidazolium hydroxide materials have been developed. The first step was to synthesize the poly(styrene-co-(1 -((4 -vinyl) methyl) - 3 - methylimidazolium) chloride through a free-radical polymerization. Casting of this material followed by in situ treatment of the membranes with sodium hydroxide solutions provided the corresponding hydroxide salts. Various ratios of the monomers 4 -chloromoethylvinylbenzine (CMVB) and vinylbenzine (VB) provided various compositions of the polymer.
