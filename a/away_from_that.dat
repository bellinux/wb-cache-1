5|$|The school {{continued}} {{to change and}} develop, and an additional faculty expansion occurred in 2005–2006. Also, the Fellows' curriculum shifted further <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the AMSP program. To keep pace with increasing demand for SAMS planners, {{the commander of the}} army's Training and Doctrine Command directed an expansion that was approved by the Chief of Staff of the Army, and the school's 11th director, Colonel Steve Banach, began a winter-start course in 2007. During this period, SAMS provided planners to help forward-deployed headquarters plan operations and contingencies. The school moved to new premises in the newly renovated Muir Hall at Fort Leavenworth on 30 August 2011.|$|E
5|$|The massive Islamic {{invasions of}} the mid-7th century began a long {{struggle}} between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The Byzantine Empire soon lost {{the lands of}} the eastern patriarchates of Jerusalem, Alexandria and Antioch and was reduced to that of Constantinople, the empire's capital. As a result of Islamic domination of the Mediterranean, the Frankish state, centred <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages. The battles of Toulouse and Poitiers halted the Islamic advance in the West and the failed Siege of Constantinople halted it in the East. Two or three decades later, in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it governed the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for during the election in 752 of Pope Stephen II and that the papacy was forced to look elsewhere for a civil power to protect it. In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king Pepin the Short conquered the Lombards. He then gifted the lands of the former exarchate to the pope, thus initiating the Papal States. Rome and the Byzantine East would delve into further conflict during the Photian schism of the 860s, when Photius criticised the Latin west of adding of the filioque clause after being excommunicated by Nicholas I. Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division.|$|E

25|$|The IDL {{is roughly}} {{based on the}} {{meridian}} of 180° longitude, roughly {{down the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean, and halfway around the world from the Greenwich meridian. In many places, the IDL follows the 180° meridian exactly. In other places, however, the IDL deviates east or west <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> meridian. These various deviations generally accommodate the political and/or economic affiliations of the affected areas.|$|E
25|$|Baruch's tomb is a mile <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of Ezekiel, near Mashhad Ali; and a Jewish rabbinic source {{reported}} that a strange plant, the leaves of which are sprinkled with gold dust, grows on it. According to the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch, he was translated to paradise in his mortal body. The same is stated in Derekh Eretz Zuta (i.) of Ebed-Melech. Those who regard Baruch and Ebed-melech as identical find this deduction is evident.|$|E

25|$|The Iowa, or Ioway, {{originated}} in the Great Lakes region. They are thought, along with the Ho-Chunk, Otoe, and Missouria tribes, to have once been a single tribe.

25|$|Due to {{differences}} in operational requirements, the training of commando recruits is carried out separately and <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of recruits in other vocations. Basic training is conducted at company-level in Hendon Camp while advanced training is done at the School of Commandos, where certain compulsory courses are conducted. A newly enlisted soldier typically undergoes about a year of training before he becomes a qualified commando. Commando officers and specialists go through a longer training period before receiving their qualifications.|$|E

On the 8th, {{it was observed that}} in the town of Lingayen, {{as a response to the}} pre-landing bombardment, Filipinos had begun to form a parade, complete with United States and Philippine flags; fire was shifted <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> area.|$|E

Robert Zemeckis was either seriously considered to, or attached to direct the 2005 version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Zemeckis is an avid supporter of 3-D Digital Cinema, and has stated that, starting with the 3-D presentations of Beowulf, all of his future films would be done in 3-D using digital motion capture. He has reportedly backed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> statement and said that the decision to use 3-D will be on a film-by-film basis.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a janitor, who {{was also}} a student, {{borrowed}} a book from the library, to read during breaks. The book was Notre Dame vs the Klan, a historical account of how the then-despised Catholic minority in 1924, confronted the then-powerful Ku Klux Klan. The book jacket portrayed the hooded Klansmen. A co-worker complained after seeing the cover, as did his union supervisor. Eventually the school's Affirmative Action Officer issued a formal rebuke to the janitor. After much discussion and criticism she backed <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> rebuke and subsequently retired. After more criticism and a passage of several months, the university chancellor apologized and issued letters of disapproval to the original complainant.|$|E
25|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} family in the summer of 1883, when a {{debilitating}} fever swept through the family. Johnny's half-sister Annie, 13, was the first to succumb; and his mother died shortly thereafter. By the time September 1883 had passed, three more McGraw children had died. The devastated family moved from their house in the country into a hotel in town. Johnny's father, understandably bitter, heaped even more responsibility on the young boy's shoulders, and had very little patience for his son's passion for baseball. He became abusive toward the boy; and later on in 1885 (still only 12 years old), Johnny ran <b>away.</b> <b>From</b> <b>that</b> day onward, young John was raised by a kindly neighbor, Mary Goddard, under whose care he did quite well.|$|E

25|$|These {{cetaceans}} {{are highly}} sociable and they regularly form small groups, or pods, that may contain {{between two and}} 25 individuals, {{with an average of}} 10 members. Pods tend to be unstable, meaning individuals tend to move from pod to pod. Radio tracking has even shown belugas can start out in one pod and within a few days be hundreds of miles <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> pod. These pods contain animals of both sexes, and are led by a dominant male. Many hundreds and even thousands of individuals can be present when the pods join together in river estuaries during the summer. This can represent a significant proportion of the total population and is when they are most vulnerable to being hunted.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a {{body with}} a single stable resting {{position}} is called monostatic, and the term mono-monostatic has been coined to describe a body which additionally has only one unstable point of balance. (The previously known monostatic polyhedron does not qualify, as it has three unstable equilibria.) A sphere weighted so that its center of mass is shifted from the geometrical center is a mono-monostatic body. A more common example is the Comeback Kid, Weeble or roly-poly toy (see left figure). Not only {{does it have a}} low center of mass, but it also has a specific shape. At equilibrium, the center of mass and the contact point are on the line perpendicular to the ground. When the toy is pushed, its center of mass rises and also shifts <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> line. This produces a righting moment which returns the toy to the equilibrium position.|$|E
25|$|Dreams do {{not involve}} {{actually}} sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. When they look <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus {{is no longer the}} focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.|$|E
