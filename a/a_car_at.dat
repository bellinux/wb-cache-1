5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry was {{the fourth}} child {{in a family of}} six. He grew up in the north St. Louis {{neighborhood}} known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry William Berry (1895–1987), was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha Bell (Banks) (1894–1980), was a certified public school principal. Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>at</b> gunpoint with some friends. Berry's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa, near Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.|$|E

5|$|On 23 January the RIRA {{attacked}} Ebrington Army Barracks in Derry for {{a second}} time, firing a mortar over a perimeter fence. A mortar {{similar to the one}} used in the attack was found by Gardaí near Newtowncunningham on 13 February, and British army bomb disposal experts made safe another mortar found between Dungannon and Carrickmore on 12 April. On 1 August a 40lb bomb was discovered in <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>at</b> the long-stay car park of Belfast International Airport following a telephone warning, and was made safe with two controlled explosions by bomb disposal experts. In December a six-day security operation ended when a 70lb bomb found under railway tracks at Killeen Bridge near Newry was defused. The operation began following telephone warnings, and the road and railway line connecting Newry to Dundalk were closed due to security alerts. A pipe bomb was discovered at a police officer's home in Annalong, County Down on 3 January 2002, and two teenage boys were injured in County Armagh on 2 March when a bomb hidden in a traffic cone exploded. On 29 March 2002 the RIRA targeted {{a former member of the}} Royal Irish Regiment from Sion Mills, County Tyrone, with a bomb attached to his car that failed to explode. On 1 August 2002 a civilian worker was killed by an explosion at a Territorial Army base in Derry.

25|$|In 1960, {{the sale}} of cars was deregulated, and anyone could {{purchase}} <b>a</b> <b>car.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, Trondheim started a merger process with the neighboring municipalities, and plans were made to build large suburbs far from the city center, that would be depopulated, and connect the suburbs with motorways. A new four-line highway along Byåsenveien was opened in 1966. Traffic numbers fell rapidly, and the company needed to replace its aging fleet. Traffic patterns were also changing, since Lian {{to a greater extent}} was becoming a winter rather than summer destination.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November, at {{the state}} opening of Parliament, activists dropped a banner in support of Horne {{in front of the}} Queen's {{official}} car as it drove towards the Houses of Parliament. Shortly after this, two activists parked <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>at</b> the end of Downing Street, slashed its tyres, and used D-Locks to attach themselves by the neck to the steering wheel, while protesters demonstrated nearby. Activists marched on BIBRA labs in southwest London and at Windmill mink farm in Dorset. In Finland, 400 foxes and 200 racoons were released from a fur farm. The offices of the Research Defence Society in London were raided. Demonstrations were held outside British embassies and consulates around the world, laboratories were raided, and government buildings picketed.|$|E

25|$|Majeski {{moved to}} Charlotte, North Carolina in early 2017 {{to work in}} the Roush {{organization}} as an engineer. He reportedly was close to securing a Ford development contract but ARCA champion Chase Briscoe received the contract since he had more large track experience. He began the season racing in the World Series of Asphalt at New Smyrna. Majeski won his second consecutive Rattler 250 over Harrison Burton and Steven Wallace. In March 2017, Majeski announced he would be making his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut at Iowa Speedway in June, followed by a part-time schedule in the series and ARCA. On April 24, 2017, after testing <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>at</b> Daytona it was announced that Majeski would run five ARCA races for Cunningham Motorsports.|$|E

Pam, Jenna, J.R., Miss Ellie, Clayton, Ray and Donna were the people present at the time of Bobby's death.|$|E
25|$|The man and {{the myth}} merge in this episode.
