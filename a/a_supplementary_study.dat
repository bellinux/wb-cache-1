40|$|Previous {{research}} {{conducted in the}} United States has demonstrated that help-seekers fail to appreciate the embarrassment and awkwardness (i. e., social costs) targets would experience by saying "no" to a request for help.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control scheme {{which uses a}} combination of linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) and a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) to solve the non-linear operational optimal control of Drinking Water Networks (DWNs). The methodology has been divided into two functional layers: first, a CSP algorithm is used to transfer non-linear DWNs pressure equations into linear constraints on flows and tank volumes, which can enclose the feasible solution set of the hydraulic non-linear problem during the optimization process. Then, a linear MPC with tightened constraints produced in the CSP layer is solved to generate control strategies which optimize the control objectives. The proposed approach is simulated using Epanet to represent the real DWNs. Non-linear MPC is used for validation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Today’s {{engineering}} students have many resources, like textbooks, study supplements, Internet websites, and CD-ROMs available to them. But, {{it is not}} clear if students use these resources, how they use them, and if their use improves student performance. This paper reports a study in which self-reported student activity logs were used to examine how students used <b>a</b> variety of <b>supplementary</b> <b>study</b> resources in the introductory thermodynamics course. Of the <b>supplementary</b> materials <b>studied,</b> students showed a preference for the textbook, interactive CD-ROM supplements, textbook homework problems, and on-line homework problems with instantaneous coaching feedback. Student use of these supplements was correlated with their performance on homework exercises, regularly scheduled examinations, and a final examination. These correlations indicate that students use the four aforementioned supplements in a mutually supportive manner and that they rely heavily upon homework exercises to understand the course material. The one supplement that correlated most strongly with student performance upon a comprehensive final examination was the online homework. This finding reaffirms that instantaneous, constructive performance feedback can and does improve student performance. ...|$|R
40|$|This text {{consists}} of an extract of my master´s thesis (Sanfi, 2007).

The theory part relates {{to the development of the}} special designed music concept, while the empirical part relates to <b>a</b> <b>supplementary</b> pilot <b>study</b> in which a mixed methods design (i. e. semi-structured interviews and questionnaires) is applied. The combination of methods intends to explore meaning and effect of the music concept.

Three main aspects are addressed, starting with the underlying theoretical frame of the music concept. Thereafter follows a presentation of the results of the study. Finally, the theoretical frame and the results are discussed in relation to possible health benefit perspectives of the music concept. The implications of chemotherapy-related side effects are far-reaching and profound, and the results of the study show that the music concept has resource promoting qualities. Among other things the concept structures an overall good and relaxing joint experience for the children and parents. Furthermore, it provides a useful pause from disease, hospitalization, and treatment. In addition, the participants believe that the music concept has health promoting benefits in regard to chemotherapy-related side effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{supplementary}} food humans provide to wild animals is increasing, yet the full {{effects of this}} provisioning remain unclear. For these effects to be assessed at the levels of both the population and the individual, {{the degree to which}} individuals are using this resource must be quantified. Traditional approaches rely on observations of feeding animals and analysis of gut contents and feces, but these have several limitations. Stable-isotope analysis can overcome some of these. If supplementary food items are isotopically distinct from natural ones, the relative contribution of supplementary food to the diet may be quantified accurately. We demonstrate how the isotopic signature of supplementary foods can be manipulated to increase their discrimination from natural food sources and provide an example of the utility of this approach in <b>a</b> <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>study.</b> We provided <b>supplementary</b> food over <b>a</b> winter, then sampled birds during the following breeding season and analyzed their claws for their isotopic signature to estimate diet choices. The results highlight considerable variation in individuals' use of supplementary food, both within a study site and between different sites. Often the results from supplementation experiments are inconclusive. Even within the same species there can be an effect in one year or location but not in others, so a method for quantifying variation in food uptake could help in interpretation of the results. Stable-isotope analysis allows the effects of experimentally increased food supplies on ecology and behavior to be assessed accurately...|$|R

30|$|The {{validity}} {{of this study is}} affected by a methodical problem: The survey data about the motivation for choosing the FRB were collected retrospectively, which is why the respondents might have attempted to rationalise their decision ex post. For this reason the real motives might be disguised in many cases. Given that survey questions concerning the willingness to work and job search activities are considered sensitive, a social desirability bias must be taken into account. However, as FRB payment recipients are legally entitled to cease seeking employment, they can more likely be expected to reveal a lack of propensity to work. The findings of <b>a</b> <b>supplementary</b> <b>study</b> support this assumption: the self-reported motives can be supposed to draw a sufficiently realistic picture of why older long-term unemployed persons withdraw from the labour market.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background COMP (Cartilage {{oligomeric}} matrix protein) is {{a matrix}} protein, {{which is currently}} studied as a potential serum marker for cartilage processes in osteoarthritis (OA). The influence of physical exercise on serum COMP is not fully elucidated. The objective {{of the present study}} was to monitor serum levels of COMP during a randomised controlled trial of physical exercise vs. standardised rest in individuals with symptomatic and radiographic knee OA. Methods Blood samples were collected from 58 individuals at predefined time points before and after exercise or rest, one training group and one control group. The physical exercise consisted of a one-hour supervised session twice a week and daily home exercises. In <b>a</b> second <b>supplementary</b> <b>study</b> 7 individuals were subjected to the same exercise program and sampling of blood was performed at fixed intervals before, immediately after, 30 and 60 minutes after the exercise session and then with 60 minutes interval for another five hours after exercise to monitor the short-term changes of serum COMP. COMP was quantified with a sandwich-ELISA (AnaMar Medical, Lund, Sweden). Results Before exercise or rest no significant differences in COMP levels were seen between the groups. After 60 minutes exercise serum COMP levels increased (p Conclusion Serum COMP levels increased during exercise in individuals with knee OA, whereas levels decreased during rest. The increased serum COMP levels were normalized 30 minutes after exercise session, therefore we suggest that samples of blood for analysis of serum COMP should be drawn after at least 30 minutes rest in a seated position. No increase was seen after a six-week exercise program indicating that any effect of individualized supervised exercise on cartilage turnover is transient. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a progressive}} and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease. Pyrazolone containing small molecules have shown significant disease attenuating efficacy in cellular and murine models of ALS. Pyrazolone based affinity probes were synthesized to identify high affinity binding partners and ascertain a potential biological mode of action. Probes were confirmed to be neuroprotective in PC 12 -SOD 1 G 93 A cells. PC 12 -SOD 1 G 93 A cell lysates {{were used for}} protein pull-down, affinity purification, and subsequent proteomic analysis using LC-MS/MS. Proteomics identified the 26 S proteasome regulatory subunit 4 (PSMC 1), 26 S proteasome regulatory subunit 6 B (PSMC 4), and T-complex protein 1 (TCP- 1) as putative protein targets. Coincubation with appropriate competitors confirmed {{the authenticity of the}} proteomics results. Activation of the proteasome by pyrazolones was demonstrated in the absence of exogenous proteasome inhibitor and by restoration of cellular protein degradation of a fluorogenic proteasome substrate in PC 12 -SOD 1 G 93 <b>A</b> cells.
