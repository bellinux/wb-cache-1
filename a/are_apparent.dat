While outside architectural influences <b>are</b> <b>apparent</b> in much of Norwegian architecture, they have often been adapted to meet Norwegian climatic conditions, including: harsh winters, high winds and, in coastal areas, salt spray.|$|E
5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading <b>are</b> <b>apparent</b> at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
5|$|Han Chinese culture percolated {{into the}} newly conquered territories and the conquered Baiyue and Dian tribes were {{eventually}} assimilated or {{displaced by the}} Han Empire. Han dynasty influences <b>are</b> <b>apparent</b> in artifacts excavated in the Baiyue tombs of modern southern China. This sphere of influence eventually extended to various ancient Southeast Asian kingdoms, where contact led {{to the spread of}} Han Chinese culture, trade and political diplomacy. The increased demand for Chinese silk also led to the establishment of the Silk Road trade routes connecting Ancient Europe, the Near East, and China.|$|E

5|$|Henry was {{allegedly}} buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least {{something that was}} thought to be his bones—were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes <b>are</b> <b>apparent</b> in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.|$|E
5|$|Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children's art mystery novel {{written by}} Blue Balliett and {{illustrated}} by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting, A Lady In Writing, is stolen on route to the Art Institute of Chicago, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under Vermeer's name were really painted by him. This causes Petra, Calder, {{and the rest of}} Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, and problem-solving <b>are</b> <b>apparent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of sows, or groups {{of one or more}} sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns <b>are</b> <b>apparent.</b>|$|E

5|$|The prose play Edwards Dream (Eduards Traum) was {{released}} in 1891, composed of several small grouped episodes, rather than one linear storyline. The work received mixed reception. Joseph Kraus felt it was the peak of Busch's life's work, his nephews called it a masterwork of world literature, and the publisher of a critical collective edition spoke of a narrative style that is not found in contemporary literature. Eva Weissweiler saw in the play Busch's attempt to prove himself in the novella genre, believing that everything that angered or insulted him, and his accompanying emotional depths, <b>are</b> <b>apparent</b> in the story. The 1895 story The Butterfly (Der Schmetterling) parodies themes and motifs and ridicules the religious optimism of a German romanticism which contradicted Busch's realistic anthropology influenced by Schopenhauer and Charles Darwin. Its prose is more stringent in narrative style compared to Edwards Dream. Both were not popular amongst readers, because of their unfamiliar style.|$|E
