500|$|The {{film has}} come to be seen as the archetypal {{portrayal}} of 1980s excess, with Douglas advocating [...] "greed, for lack of <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> is good". Wall Street defines itself through a number of morality conflicts putting wealth and power against simplicity and honesty, and an attack on the value system of extreme competitiveness where ethics and the law are simply irrelevant parts of the show.|$|E
500|$|Wall Street (1987) – The notorious [...] "corporate raider" [...] and [...] "greenmailer" [...] Gordon Gekko, {{representing}} {{a synthesis of}} the worst features of various famous private equity figures, intends to manipulate an ambitious young stockbroker {{to take over a}} failing but decent airline. [...] Although Gekko makes a pretense of caring about the airline, his intentions prove to be to destroy the airline, strip its assets and lay off its employees before raiding the corporate pension fund. [...] Gekko would become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained greed (with the signature line, [...] "Greed, for lack of <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> is good") that would be attached to the private equity industry.|$|E

500|$|Morley {{concludes that}} [...] "Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we {{original}} campaigning anti-rockists {{had been given}} such a tough time at school for liking [...] Bowie and [...] Bolan and not ELP and Led Zep." [...] Regarding the definition, music writer Ned Raggett noted: [...] "Every article, every discussion, anything which involves the word seems to get bogged down or get taken apart in ways which prevent there from being any consensus." [...] Accordingly, some people have used rockism as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Rockism is therefore not a connotatively neutral term, according to Raggett: [...] "You’re {{not going to find}} anyone arguing FOR [...] any time soon, or at least coming out and saying sobut that’s precisely because of the terms of the discourse." [...] Popmatters Robert Loss wrote that [...] "traditionalism" [...] describes the policing of the present with the past, making it <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word</b> for [...] "rockism". Design critic and indie pop musician Nick Currie (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement Stuckism, which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.|$|E

Negra argues that Cher's [...] "flamboyant and self-authored body" [...] {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "the possibility of self-transformation". In addition, her voice, heard via songs like [...] "Walking in Memphis", is associated with the idea of [...] "circumvent patriarchy." [...] Negra notes that Cher's music is used in scenes during The Great Mutato's sexual encounters with women. Negra asserts that [...] "this juxtaposition of sound and image cues our perception that we have entered the realm of carnival where the normal order of things is inverted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club reasons that the ending was not the actual conclusion of the episode, but rather the fanciful and elaborate happy ending that was concocted by Izzy Berkowitz, the writer of the comic book, after talking to Mulder. In this manner, VanDerWeff notes, [...] "the episode abandons logic and reality and, for lack of <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> transcends." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com postulates that the entire episode never happened [...] "rom a canonical perspective" [...] due to the entry's comic book setting, the various meta-references and the [...] "happy ending".|$|E

This research used the quasi-experimental research method by 3 x 4 factorial design. The population of {{this research}} was all of the students in Grade VII of State Junior High School of Tanggamus Regency in the 2013 / 2014 Academic Year. The samples of the research were taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling technique. The samples consisted of 283 students, and they were divided into three groups, 96 students in TAPPS class, 95 students in TSTS class, and 92 students in direct instruction class. The data was analyzed by using analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The results of the research showed as follows. (1) The students exposed to the TAPPS and TSTS learning models have the same ability to solve mathematical word problems. However, the students exposed to the both models have the ability to solve <b>a</b> <b>better</b> mathematical <b>word</b> problems than the students exposed to the direct instructional model. (2) The students with idealist type have the ability to solve <b>a</b> <b>better</b> mathematical <b>word</b> problems than artisan type. However, guardian type, artisan type and rational type, they have the same ability to solve mathematical word problems, as well as guardian type, idealist type and rational type, they also have the same ability to solve mathematical word problems. (3) At group of rational type, the students exposed to the TAPPS learning model have the ability to solve <b>a</b> <b>better</b> mathematical <b>word</b> problems than the students exposed to the direct instructional model. However, the students exposed to the TAPPS and TSTS learning models have the same ability to solve mathematical word problems, and the students exposed to the TSTS and direct instructional models have the same ability to solve mathematical word problem.

500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack of <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E

[...] However, McNutt appreciated Jim's presentation, noting that [...] "the final presentation was a pretty decent setpiece." [...] What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer awarded the episode three out of five stars, noting that the episode fell victim to [...] "the overall lack of focus and believability that has plagued The Office all season." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, noting that [...] "The Office continues to get the comedy boost it needs from the Florida storyline." [...] Hyatt called the scene featuring Dwight and Jim imitating Kelly and Ryan's mom as [...] "one of my favorite moments of the season so far." [...] Despite this, he did call the episode [...] "uneven," [...] noting that the Scranton story-line was [...] "ho-hum."

G4 called the engine [...] "old" [...] and [...] "clunky", and PC Format said that [...] "the whole thing {{is limited by the}} creaking engine." [...] However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it [...] "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented," [...] and GameSpot said that [...] "'immortal' may be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word</b> to describe the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great." [...] In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that [...] "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [...] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated." [...] IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that [...] "the animations are crude by today's standards." [...] New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the [...] "dated Infinity engine" [...] could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that [...] "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game," [...] and Computer Games Magazine said, [...] "it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts." [...] The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that [...] "the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form," [...] and Game Informer called them [...] "beautiful".

In two experiments, sub-jects studied novel words formed out of morphemes, syllables, or pseu-dosyllables.

This effect was present when orthographic factors were controlled and, unlike explicit (recognition) memory, was equally strong following visual and semantic processing. Experiment 2 showed that little priming was present {{across a variety of}} conditions in which the connections between components were altered across study and test. Results are interpreted as evidence for the role of per-ceptually based activation and integration processes in implicit mem-ory for novel stimuli...|$|R

The first phoneme poste-rior probability stream is estimated using only the knowledge of short-term acoustic observation. In our work we refer this stream as ”out-of-context posteriors”. The second posterior probability stream, referred also as ”in-context posteriors” is estimated using {{the knowledge of the}} whole acoustic ob-servation sequence: the acoustic model and the language model of an ASR system. In particular, we focus our study on different types of distance measures, namely KL-divergence and Euclidean distance, to compare the two phoneme poste-rior probability streams.

This is the focal {{site of the}} Flodden 1513 Ecomuseum; the centre to a network of 40 other sites around the United Kingdom which together interpret the Flodden story.
