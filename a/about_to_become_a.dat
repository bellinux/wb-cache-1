5|$|Kepler-40b, {{formerly}} known as KOI-428b, is a hot Jupiter discovered in orbit around the star Kepler-40, which is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> red giant. The planet was first noted as a transit event by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available, including data on Kepler-40; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to collect all the data needed {{to show that a}} planet was producing the periodic dimming of Kepler-40. The planet, Kepler-40b, is twice the mass of Jupiter and slightly larger than it in size, making it as dense as Neptune. The planet is also nearly thirteen times hotter than Jupiter and orbits five times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Scotland's {{economic}} situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only {{began to change}} in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of North Sea oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant Forties oilfield in October 1970 signalled that Scotland was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant Brent oilfield in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field (now Ardmore) in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year. Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace traditional heavy industries. This included a resurgent financial services industry and the electronics manufacturing of Silicon Glen.|$|E

25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named Mrs. Smith, Helene {{tells the story of a}} woman who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that Mrs. Smith was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. Mrs. Smith, however, took solace in the deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, Mrs. Smith had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> mother herself, Mrs. Smith's fear about identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when Mrs. Smith gave birth to a still born child one month before full term.|$|E

25|$|However, {{just when}} {{it looked as if}} the new gun was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> great success, a great deal of {{opposition}} to the gun arose, both inside the army and from rival arms manufacturers, particularly Joseph Whitworth of Manchester. Stories were publicised that the new gun was too difficult to use, that it was too expensive, that it was dangerous to use, that it frequently needed repair and so on. All of this smacked of a concerted campaign against Armstrong. Armstrong was able to refute all of these claims in front of various government committees, but he found the constant criticism very wearying and depressing. In 1862 the government decided to stop ordering the new gun and return to muzzle loaders. Also, because of a drop in demand, future orders for guns would be supplied from Woolwich, leaving Elswick without new business. Compensation was eventually agreed with the government for the loss of business to the company. The government would not release the company from its agreement not to sell armaments abroad, so that avenue was closed to it. Eventually, the restriction was relaxed, and the company was able to sell guns to both sides in the American Civil War.|$|E

Although he originally called it Etudes des Mœurs [...] ( [...] literally 'Studies of manners', or 'The [...] Ways of the World ' [...] ) it eventually became known as La Comédie Humaine, and he included in it all the fiction that he had published in his lifetime under his own name. This was to be Balzac's life work and his greatest achievement.|$|E

Radio 1 DJ Greg James appears in a non-speaking cameo role, as a man shopping for lingerie. His character was nicknamed [...] "Carlos".

While minister in Colombia, Harrison wrote a rebuke to Bolívar, stating [...] "the strongest of all governments is that which is most free". He called on Bolívar to encourage the development of a democracy. In response, Bolívar wrote, [...] "The United States... seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom", a sentiment that achieved fame in Latin America. When the new administration of President Andrew Jackson took office in March 1829, Harrison was recalled so the new president could make his own appointment to the position; he returned to the United States in June.|$|E

500|$|Meryle Secrest, in her {{biography}} of Rodgers, theorizes that South Pacific marks a transition for the pair [...] "between heroes and heroines {{who are more}} or less evenly matched in age and stories about powerful older men and the younger women who are attracted to them". [...] Lovensheimer, however, points out that this pattern really only holds for two of their five subsequent musicals, The King and I and The Sound of Music, and in the former, the love between Anna and the King is not expressed in words. [...] He believes a different transition took place: that their plots, beginning with [...] South Pacific, involve a woman needing to enter and accept her love interest's world to be successful and accepted herself. [...] He notes that both Oklahoma! and Carousel involve a man entering his wife's world, Curly in Oklahoma! <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> farmer with expectations of success, whereas Billy Bigelow in Carousel fails to find work after leaving his place as a barker. [...] Lovensheimer deems Allegro to be a transition, where the attempts of the lead female character to alter her husband Joe's world to suit her ambition lead to the breakup of their marriage. [...] He argues that the nurse Emily, who goes with Joe in his return to the small town where he was happy, is a forerunner of Nellie, uprooting her life in Chicago for Joe.|$|E

2500|$|That same year, RKO put {{out another}} {{historically}} notable film made at low cost {{and with an}} only faintly starry cast: the 85-minute-long Split Second comes to a head in a desert ghost town <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> nuclear blast site, making it perhaps the first example of an [...] "atomic noir." [...] The most famous such movie, Kiss Me Deadly (1955), independently produced by Victor Saville and his Parklane Pictures company, typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture. Film historian Richard Maltby identifies it as a [...] "programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre's double-bill [...] budgeted at approximately $400,000. [...] distributor, United Artists, released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 in 1955. For UA, these movies served to spread the overhead costs of their distribution operation rather than to make profits in themselves." [...] The film's length, 106minutes, is A level, but its star, Ralph Meeker, had previously appeared in only one major film. It {{is based on an}} unequivocally pulpy source, one of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels, but is directed in a self-consciously aestheticized fashion by Robert Aldrich. The result is a brutal genre picture that chillingly evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb.|$|E
