5000|$|The UDC was {{developed}} by the Belgian bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine {{at the end of the}} 19th century. In 1885, they created Universal Bibliographic Repertory (Répertoire Bibliographique Universel) (RBU) which was intended to become a comprehensive classified index to all published information. The idea that the RBU should take the form of a card catalogue came from the young American zoologist Herbert Haviland Field who was at the time himself setting up a bibliographical agency in Zurich, the Concilium Bibliographicum. A means of arranging the entries would be needed, and Otlet, having heard of Dewey Decimal Classification wrote to Melvil Dewey and obtained permission to translate it into French. The idea outgrew the plan of mere translation, and a number of radical innovations were made, adapting the purely enumerative classification (in which all the subjects envisaged are already listed and coded) into one which allows for synthesis (that is, the construction of compound numbers to denote interrelated subjects that could never be exhaustively foreseen); various possible relations between subjects were identified, and symbols assigned to represent them. In its first edition in French [...] "Manuel du Répertoire bibliographique universel" [...] (1905), the UDC already included many features that were revolutionary in the context of knowledge classifications: tables of generally applicable (aspect-free) concepts—called common auxiliary tables; a series of special <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tables</b> with specific but re-usable attributes in a particular field of knowledge; an expressive notational system with connecting symbols and syntax rules to enable coordination of subjects and the creation of a documentation language proper.|$|E
50|$|From 1 March 1943, B-Dienst {{did little}} work outwith <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>tables,</b> due to {{inadequate}} staffing. On 1 December 1943, the Stencil Subtractor system was implemented on Naval Code, meaning that code recyphering was undertaken {{on a much}} faster period, sometime hourly, or a new naval operation was starting It took B-Dienst almost a month to understand that a new recyphering methodology had been put into force, initially suspecting that the underlying code had changed. They also attributed it to Italy surrendering to Allied forces on 13 Oct. 1943. B-Dienst set about trying {{to determine how the}} new recyphering worked and by January 1944, displaying an astonishing high degree of skill managed to establish the principles of the Stencil Subtractor single conversion indicator procedure which was effective at that time. In the course of succeeding weeks, Tranow and his team were ale reconstruct some individual messages and later on, whole days traffic. It was apparent to Tranow by that point that new Key Recoding Pages were effective each day, and their recovery of figures from Key Pages indicated that a Stencil having windows in a constant position was being used for recyphering. It {{was only a matter of}} time before the stencil was reconstructed and a staff of 250 was employed exclusively on this work. B-Dienst assumed that given enough traffic the Stencil Subtractor system could be broken but only if the basic code book was available, i.e. pinched, or perhaps one which had been used for several months in which groups had already been recovered. By January 1944, B-Dienst was able to break the December 1943 traffic in the Auxiliary table, but only due to the fact that he was working with an edition of Naval Code which was almost at end of life. On 1 January 1944, Naval Code No. 4 was introduced with Stencil Subtractor recyphering making it far more secure than the old long-subtractor recyphering method.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAs China {{advances}} toward urbanization, {{the relation}} between supply and demand of land use is growing acutely. Effective supervision of various land use has become necessary to achieve reasonable and lawful use of land. The change of land use from farmland or unused land to construction land use {{in the process of}} urbanization usually undergoes the following stages: approval, expropriation, provision, application, and supplement. The change to construction land use similarly undergoes this process, and then the outcome before and after the change is compared to determine potential land use problems. The present process-oriented spatio-temporal data model for organization and supervision data management records the supervised spatio-temporal variation process and state by using new-added <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tables.</b> This model can efficiently organize and demonstrate multiple relationships among landuse stages and the evolution process in the life cycle of spatial entities. To achieve effective supervision from the upper to the lower in the three-level “province-city-county” distributed environment and to detect potential land use problems early, data from different places are collected and synthesized for analysis. To ensure that the database is up-to-date, real-time synchronization of spatio-temporal supervision data should be studied and the integrity of the spatio-temporal data model should be maintained. Therefore, this study introduces an updating mechanism based on the trigger technology for data synchronization. When importing basic data from distributed databases into the supervision database, simultaneous updating in related <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tables</b> is performed along with changes in the basic tables. That is, records are added automatically into <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tables</b> that reflect the spatio-temporal change of the process and state when basic data are imported. This method not only achieves and maintains consistency in the database, but also ensures integrity and currency in the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tables.</b> Change information can be expressed duly in all supervision stages, and highly efficient supervision of construction landuse is guaranteed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} pipelined field-merge {{architecture}} for memory-efficient and high-throughput large-scale string matching (LSSM). Our proposed architecture partitions the (8 -bit) character input into several bit-field inputs of smaller (usually 2 -bit) widths. Each bit-field input is matched in a partial state machine (PSM) pipeline constructed from the respective bit-field patterns. The matching results {{from all the}} bit-fields in every pipeline stage are then merged {{with the help of}} an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>table</b> (ATB). This novel architecture essentially divides the LSSM problem with a continuous stream of input characters into two disjoint and simpler sub-problems: 1) O (character_bitwidth) number of pipeline traversals, and 2) O (pattern_length) number of table lookups. It is naturally suitable for implementation on FPGA or VLSI with on-chip memory. Compared to the bit-split approach [12], our field-merge implementation on FPGA requires 1 / 5 to 1 / 13 the total memory while achieving 25 % to 54 % higher clock frequencies. I...|$|R

Then rejection inversion, a new variant of the rejection method for discrete distributions that needs only one uniform random number per iteration, is used to sample from the desired distribution. It is shown that the expeceted number of iterations is uniformly bounded for all T-concave discrete distributions. Utilizing a simple squeeze or an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>table</b> of moderate size, which is initialized during generation and not in the set up, Algorithm ARI is fast, at least as fast as the fastest known methods designed for the Poisson, binomial and hypergeometric distributions.
