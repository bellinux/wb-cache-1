5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Tallon came in {{with the}} score at 6/553, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> his end, scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632. Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the match and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. Tallon took two catches in the second innings as Australia won the match by an innings, but he also conceded 24 byes in Surrey's match total of 336.|$|E
5|$|The reverberations of the Black Week defeats {{led to the}} hasty {{approval}} of large reinforcements being sent to South Africa, from both Britain and the Dominions. Although Cronje temporarily defeated the British <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> their advance, General Lord Roberts was appointed as overall Commander in Chief in South Africa; he took personal command on this front, and {{at the head of}} an army reinforced to 25,000 men, he relieved Kimberley on 15 February 1900. Cronje's retreating army was surrounded and forced to surrender at the Battle of Paardeberg on 27 February 1900.|$|E

5|$|Trooper Harper's {{official}} reports {{state that}} after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli {{to the back of}} the vehicle for Trooper Foerster—who had arrived on the scene—to examine his driver's license. The reports then state that after Acoli complied, and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the registration, Trooper Foerster yelled <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> an ammunition magazine as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red pocketbook, pulled out a nine-millimeter weapon and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|With its {{increasing}} {{prosperity and}} population, Wagga Wagga {{and the surrounding}} district became a place of interest to several infamous bushrangers. The Wagga police magistrate Henry Baylis was bailed up by Mad Dog Morgan in 1863. Captain Moonlite and his band arrived in the district on 15 November 1879 <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> 39 people at Wantabadgery Station. Moonlite and his gang escaped a police pursuit only to be captured at another nearby property when police from the neighbouring townships of Gundagai and Adelong arrived.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} more county {{fixtures}} before the First Test, against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and Sussex. Australia drew {{the first two}} before winning the latter pair by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively. Saggers played {{in all but the}} Nottinghamshire match. Against Lancashire, Saggers came in at 6/145 <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> his end, making an unbeaten 22 as Australia reached 204. He then completed a stumping and conceded 11 byes as the hosts replied with 182 before the rain-affected match ended in a draw. Saggers went without a dismissal and conceded 16 byes as Hampshire made 195 in their first innings. He came to the crease with Australia having scored 98 runs for the loss of seven wickets (7/98) and was last man out for 17, one of only four players to pass five, as Australia made 117 and conceded a first innings lead {{for the first time in}} the season. He then completed another stumping in the second innings and conceded four byes as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets. Saggers' final opportunity to stake a claim for Test selection was in the match against Sussex. He did not concede a bye and took a catch in the first innings. Saggers was not required to bat as Australia declared their innings closed at 5/549, and then made three more dismissals and conceded five byes as Australia won by an innings.|$|E

Little Creek got on top of Around <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> a knife, ready to stab Around; at that point, Porcupine Bear, aroused by Around's calls for help, tore the knife away from Little Creek, and stabbed him with it several times. He forced Around to finish off Little Creek.|$|E
25|$|The oligopolistic {{competition}} in the British banking sector has witnessed the success of moral suasion as a monetary policy instrument, allowing the central bank to control by persuasion and directive. Given that only five major banks need to be persuaded in England, a moral suasion policy instrument is very effective because non-compliers can be immediately identified <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> for censure, while in the United States where there are many commercial banks, the Federal Reserve needs to use legalistic controls to pursue the same ends.|$|E
25|$|Baillie {{attempted}} {{to cover the}} Ribble and Darwen bridges on the Wigan road, but Cromwell had forced his way across both before nightfall. Pursuit was at once undertaken, and not relaxed until Hamilton had been driven through Wigan and Winwick to Uttoxeter and Ashbourne. There, pressed furiously in rear by Cromwell's horse <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> in front by the militia of the midlands, the remnant of the Scottish army laid down its arms on 25 August. Various {{attempts were made to}} raise the Royalist standard in Wales and elsewhere, but Preston was the death-blow. On 28 August, starving and hopeless of relief, the Colchester Royalists surrendered to Lord Fairfax.|$|E

25|$|Captain Moonlite {{after being}} {{released}} from gaol in 1879 for a robbery committed at Egerton, near Ballarat arrived on 15 November 1879 looking for work at Wantabadgery Station which is situated about 38km east of Wagga. When work was refused, Moonlite and his band of 5 others returned <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> all 39 people at the station. Later one of the hostages escaped and three mounted police from Wagga arrived to be engaged by the gang in a shoot out. When the police retreated, Moonlite and his gang escaped only to be captured at another nearby property when police from the neighbouring townships of Gundagai and Adelong arrived. Moonlite was later hung for his crimes.|$|E
25|$|The Ribbon Gang and the Bathurst Rebellion {{occurred}} in 1830, {{when a large}} group of over 80 convicts roamed the Bathurst district. They were eventually captured and charged with murder, bushranging and horse-thieving. On 2 November 1830, ten members of the Ribbon Boys were hanged in Bathurst for their crimes. The site of the first and largest public hanging in Bathurst is still marked by the laneway sign Ribbon Gang Lane in the CBD. Ben Hall, who became a notorious bushranger, was married in St Michael's Church at Bathurst in 1856. In October 1863, a gang of five (including Hall) raided Bathurst, robbing a jeweller's shop, bailed up the Sportsmans Arms Hotel and tried to steal a racehorse. They returned three days later <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> more businesses. John Piesley, another bushranger, was tried and hanged for murder at Bathurst Gaol in 1862.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his mohawk hairstyle, Wilson has a large black beard, which he began growing and presumably dyeing during the Giants' playoff run in 2010. He never admitted to dyeing it, saying in 2010, [...] "It's dark because we {{play a lot of}} day games. It's tanned. It's focused." [...] He decided he would not shave until the Giants' season was over, and only if they failed to win the World Series. During the Giants' playoff run in 2010, Giants' fans began growing their own beards or wearing fake beards. Many fans chanted [...] "Fear the Beard", <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> signs bearing the same motto. Teammate Sergio Romo also began growing a beard in 2010; he has had it intermittently ever since.|$|E

500|$|The {{defendants}} {{pleaded not}} guilty, {{saying that they}} had not meant their protest to be offensive. [...] "We sang part of the refrain 'Holy shit'," [...] Tolokonnikova said in court. [...] "I am sorry if I offended anyone with this. It is an idiomatic expression, related to the previous verse — about the fusion of Moscow patriarchy and the government. 'Holy shit' is our evaluation of the situation in the country. This opinion is not blasphemy." [...] Their lawyers stated that the circumstances of the case had revived the Soviet-era tradition of the show trial. On August 15, 20 protesters wearing balaclavas gathered in support of Pussy Riot at Christ the Savior Cathedral, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> placards reading [...] "Blessed are the merciful". Cathedral guards quickly moved against the protesters, trying to detain them and taking off their balaclavas.|$|E
500|$|The {{routine for}} prisoners was {{regulated}} {{by a system}} of bells, and enforced by punishments; prisoners who obeyed the rules would be promoted {{to the second floor}} – whereby they would be allowed to work in the yards everyday. [...] Male prisoners would perform hard labour – including breaking rocks, and other duties in the stone quarries, while women would sew, clean and cook. [...] Women would also make shirts and waistcoats for male prisoners, as well as act as domestic servants for the governor and his family. [...] Prisoners who had become trusted, those nearing the completion of their sentence, and debtors, were housed on the third floor communal cells. [...] These top level cells were large, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to six prisoners at time; and were mostly reserved to prisoners convicted of minor crimes such as drunkenness, vagrancy, prostitution or petty theft.|$|E
500|$|In August, at the Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C. {{there was}} a protest and concert by punk bands. On August 19, two men and a woman dressed as Pussy Riot staged a protest during a service in Germany's Cologne Cathedral. The trio yelled slogans <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> a banner reading [...] "Free Pussy Riot and all prisoners" [...] in English. They were taken out by cathedral {{officials}} and then were charged with disturbing a religious service and breaching the peace. Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, a local newspaper, reported that [...] "disturbing a religious establishment" [...] {{could result in a}} fine or up to three years imprisonment; they were eventually given suspended fines of 1200 Euros and 3 months probation. Assault charges were dropped. One of the three, identified as [...] "Patrick H.", appealed his conviction and sentence; the court upheld his conviction and replaced his sentence with a fine of 150 Euros.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Slant magazine, Keith Uhlich {{gave the}} season an overall rating of four stars out of five. Uhlich {{described}} {{the season as}} [...] "a divisive run of episodes that, for many viewers, blasphemously rewrites what came before", but favourably compared it to the fiction works of Jorge Luis Borges. Uhlich felt that the episodes in the season were [...] "challenging" [...] and celebrated the abilities {{of the individual to}} forge a life for themselves. DVD Talk's Randy Miller also awarded the season an overall four out of five stars, finding that although its concern about the then-coming millennium made it very much a product of its time, it did not seem to have suffered from this <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> well in retrospect. Miller considered Henriksen's portrayal of Frank Black to have been [...] "masterful"; however, he felt that the retcon of its second season finale alienated viewers and led to its dwindling popularity.|$|E
500|$|Roebling's {{bridge was}} {{supported}} by two limestone towers {{on each side of}} the gorge. [...] These Egyptian-style towers stood [...] tall on the American shore and [...] tall on the Canadian shore. [...] With their foundations [...] in the earth, the limestone structures could support up to 12millionpounds (5.4millionkg). [...] Four [...] thick main cables held up the bridge; two cables ran through iron saddles at the top of each tower. Each cable comprised 3,059 wires that were spun with Roebling's patented technique used in his Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct. [...] The ends of each cable were secured to [...] cast-iron plates sunk [...] deep in the bedrock. [...] Support lines hung down from iron clamps that encircled the main cables, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the decks. [...] Deep trussesnever before seen on a large suspension bridgelined the sides of the bridge, [...] and joined the two decks so that the structure looked like a cage. [...] The trussed sides and the upper and lower decks, which spanned , formed a [...] "hollow straight beam", reinforcing the rigidity of the bridge.|$|E
500|$|According {{to initial}} police statements, {{at this point}} {{one or more of}} the {{suspects}} began firing with semiautomatic handguns and Trooper Foerster fired four times before falling mortally wounded. At Acoli's trial, Harper testified that the gunfight started [...] "seconds" [...] after Foerster arrived at the scene. At this trial, Harper said that Foerster reached into the vehicle, pulled out <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> a semi-automatic pistol and ammunition magazine, and said [...] "Jim, look what I found", while facing Harper at the rear of the vehicle. At this point, Assata Shakur and Zayd Shakur were ordered to put their hands on their laps and not to move; Harper said that Assata Shakur then reached down to the right of her right leg, pulled out a pistol, and shot him in the shoulder, after which he retreated to behind his vehicle. Questioned by prosecutor C. Judson Hamlin, Harper said he saw Foerster shot just as Assata Shakur was felled by bullets from Harper's gun. Harper testified that Acoli shot Foerster with a [...]38 caliber semiautomatic pistol and then used Foerster's own gun to [...] "execute him". According to the testimony of State Police investigators, two jammed semi-automatic pistols were discovered near Foerster's body.|$|E
