5|$|The {{northeast}} movement {{followed a}} passing short-wave trough on August18; the forward {{motion of the}} storm also increased due to the trough. On August 20, the steering currents around Arlene collapsed, leading to the storm nearly stalling for 24 hours. During this period, the storm developed excellent outflow and intensified. Operationally, Arlene was upgraded to a hurricane at 2200 UTC on August 20 based on the appearance of an eye-feature on satellite imagery; however, post-storm <b>analysis</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the storm did not attain hurricane-status until 0600 UTC on August 22. This occurred 14.5 days after its formation.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Vince {{was named}} on October 9 {{in the east}} Atlantic near Madeira (east-southeast of the Azores) and was {{upgraded}} to a hurricane later that day though later <b>analysis</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> it had formed as a subtropical storm the previous day. Although Vince was a very small and short-lived storm that only briefly reached hurricane strength, it was notable for developing in the eastern Atlantic, well away from where hurricanes are usually found. This may be the farthest north and east a tropical cyclone has ever formed in the Atlantic Basin.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on August1, an {{unidentified}} ship roughly 950mi (1,550km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii reported 70mph (110km/h) winds within a storm, prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Dot. Despite an apparent correlation between Dot and the preceding unnamed tropical cyclone, {{the lack of}} ship reports between July27 and August1 prevented the agency from confirming that the two systems were the same. Nonetheless, development upon designation was rapid as the system tracked westward, with reports from the SS Sonoma indicating that Dot had intensified to hurricane strength by August2. Rapid intensification continued, and at 0000UTC on August3, reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 952mbar (hPa; 28.11inHg), making Dot a Category4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later <b>analysis</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> these figures constituted the hurricane's peak intensity.|$|E

5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} <b>analysis</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Late on June21, Celia turned due west as {{it moved}} around {{the south side of}} the ridge {{previously}} steering the hurricane to the west-southwest. A secondary eyewall was noted as it made the turn, indicating that the storm would further intensify once this feature further developed. Several hours later, the storm intensified into a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After briefly developing a prominent central dense overcast, the storm's structure began to degrade for unknown reasons. By the evening of June22, Celia was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane and the eye was no longer apparent on satellite imagery, mainly due to cirrus clouds over the system. The following morning, the eye reformed and the storm became more vertically aligned, allowing Celia to re-attain Category2 status. Throughout the day, Celia became increasingly organized and intensified, nearly attaining major hurricane status during the afternoon. Operationally, the hurricane was thought to have reached this intensity but post-storm <b>analysis</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> winds did not exceed 110mph (175km/h).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{bridge over}} the Monnow at Monmouth was constructed of wood in the mid-12th century. In 1988, work on flood defences revealed remains of the wooden bridge directly under the existing one, and dendrochronological <b>analysis</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> its timber came from trees felled between 1123 and 1169. An early account in the Flores Historiarum by Roger of Wendover may indicate that the wooden bridge and the nearby Church of St Thomas the Martyr were damaged by fire in the Battle of Monmouth in 1233, fought between supporters of Henry III and the forces of Richard Marshal, Earl of Pembroke. Both {{the site of the}} battle and the specific bridge involved are debated—the local historian Keith Kissack argued that the battle was fought on Vauxhall Fields, below Monmouth Castle and some way from Monnow Bridge, while other modern historians continue to place the battle at Overmonnow.|$|E

5|$|On July10, a {{tropical}} wave exited the African coast and moved westward over the open Atlantic for several days. Initially, the associated weather activity {{was limited to}} weak showers, and environmental conditions were not forecast to become conducive for significant organization. Although upper-level wind shear remained somewhat adverse, a process of slow development became evident by July19 as surface pressures began to fall. The wave proceeded along the extreme northeastern Caribbean, where convective activity waxed and waned due to periods of variable wind shear and brief land interaction with Hispaniola. By July22, thundershower activity reestablished over the Bahamas, with a distinct {{area of low pressure}} centered between the islands of Acklins and Great Inagua. Satellite observations confirmed a closed circulation, leading the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to issue the formation of Tropical Depression Three around 1500UTC. However, post-storm <b>analysis</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> a depression had developed nine hours earlier than operationally confirmed. Upon its formation, the depression was forecast to be steered to the west-northwest along a well-established subtropical ridge. Later that day, minimum pressure dropped to 1006mbar (29.74inHg), and satellite imagery showed an establishment of favorable outflow in nearly all quadrants. Although its cloud pattern remained disorganizedwith the circulation center disassociated from the deepest convectiona reconnaissance aircraft flight into the cyclone found that the winds had increased. It was therefore upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, about five hours after NHC initiated advisories on the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Beryl {{were from a}} trough that {{developed}} over the Yucatán Peninsula on May16. It drifted eastward into the northwestern Caribbean Sea, spawning a low pressure area on May18. For the next three days, it remained nearly stationary without development, until the system became better defined on May22 when it began moving to the northeast. On May23, the elongated low had an area of disorganized convection. While passing over the Cuban Island of Isla de la Juventud, an exposed center of circulation and transient convection was noted due {{to the effects of}} high wind shear across the region. The next day, the system moved through the Florida Keys, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the potential for increasingly favorable conditions over the next two days. The low became better defined as its cloud pattern consolidated. It moved further into the western Atlantic over the next 24 hours, and a band of convection extended across the Bahamas and Cuba to wrap around the southwestern edge of the circulation. On May25, the system interacted with a mid- to upper-level low, causing the center to reform further to the northeast. After the system attained gale-force winds near the center and sufficiently organized convection, the NHC initiated advisories on Subtropical Storm Beryl at 0300UTC on May26, while the cyclone was 305mi (490km) east of Charleston, South Carolina. Post-season <b>analysis</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> Beryl developed three hours prior.|$|E
