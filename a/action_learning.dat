25|$|The MBA {{dissertation}} (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, {{comprise the}} following in some combination: {{a discussion of}} the literature, providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a case study that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project. Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an <b>action</b> <b>learning</b> orientation, these may be practically oriented. Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.|$|E

2500|$|... "Activity-based" [...] {{means that}} {{for people to}} learn, a real object has to be {{actually}} present; as Jacinta Correia puts it: [...] "{{to learn how to}} ride a bike, you need a bike to ride on". Thus, for a large group to learn how to manage a complex enterprise, it has to have a complex enterprise to manage. In the OW context, this means that a group averaging 150, many of whom often with lower levels of education, are actively engaged, for an entire month, in (a) productive or service provision enterprise(s). For all the apparent, e.g., on-the-job training and <b>action</b> <b>learning</b> parallels, the OW's defining features are not only the need for a cooperative large group and the creation of (a) complex, real enterprise(s), but, principally, the position of the trainer {{and the way in which}} training messages are communicated. In OW-learning, the trainer's role is merely subsidiary (known as [...] "scaffolding" [...] in activity theory). In other words, it is not the trainer/instructor, but [...] "the object that teaches".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Learning</b> <b>action</b> {{models is}} an {{important}} and difficult task for AI planning, since it is both time-consuming and tedious for a human to encode the action models by hand using a formal language such as PDDL. In this paper, we present a new algorithm to <b>learn</b> <b>action</b> models from plan traces by transferring useful knowledge from another domain whose action models are already known. We call this algorithm t-LAMP, (transfer <b>Learning</b> <b>Action</b> Models from Plan traces) which can <b>learn</b> <b>action</b> models in PDDL language with quantifiers from plan traces where the intermediate states can contain noise and partial information. We apply Markov Logic Network to enable knowledge transfer, and show that using the transfer learning framework, {{the quality of the}} <b>learned</b> <b>action</b> models are generally better than the case when not using an existing domain for transfer. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>action</b> {{models is}} {{important}} when goals change. When an agent acted for a while, it can use its accumulated knowledge about {{actions in the}} domain to make better decisions. Thus, <b>learning</b> <b>action</b> models differs from reinforcement learning. It enables reasoning about actions instead of expensive trials in the world. <b>Action</b> model <b>learning</b> {{is a form of}} inductive reasoning, where new knowledge is generated based on agent's observations. It differs from standard supervised learning in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor imprecise action models explicitly corrected.|$|R

5000|$|There is controversy, however, {{about the}} need for an <b>action</b> <b>{{learning}}</b> coach. Reg Revans was sceptical about the use of learning coaches and, in general, of interventionist approaches. He believed the <b>action</b> <b>learning</b> set or group could practice <b>action</b> <b>learning</b> on its own. He also had a major concern that too much process facilitation would lead a group to become dependent on a coach or facilitator. Nevertheless, later in his development of the <b>action</b> <b>learning</b> method, Revans experimented with including a role that he described as a [...] "supernumerary" [...] that had many similarities to that of a facilitator or coach (Revans, 2011, p. 9). Revans, like many other <b>action</b> <b>learning</b> practitioners, noted that without someone dedicated to managing basic process norms as well as championing individual, team, and organizational learning, <b>action</b> <b>learning</b> often devolved into lots of action without much learning.|$|E
