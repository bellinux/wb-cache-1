5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E
25|$|Because this {{reference}} frame rotates {{several times a}} minute rather than only once <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by {{the rotation of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{readers of}} 18th-century {{literature}} now {{need to understand}} the history of the period more than most readers of other literature do. The authors were writing for an informed audience and only secondarily for posterity. Even the authors, who criticised writing that lived for only <b>a</b> <b>day</b> (<b>like</b> Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope, in The Dedication to Prince Posterity of A Tale of a Tub and Dunciad, among other pieces) were criticising specific authors, who are unknown to those without historical knowledge of the period. Poetry of all forms was in constant dialogue, and each author was responding and commenting upon the others. Novels were written against other novels (like the battles between Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding, who, along with Eliza Haywood, wrote a novel satirising Richardson's Pamela, and between Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett). Plays were written to make fun of plays or to counter the success of plays (like the reaction against and for Cato and, later, Fielding's The Author's Farce). Therefore, history and literature are linked in a way rarely seen at other times. On one hand, the metropolitan and political writing can seem like coterie or salon work, but on the other hand, it was the literature of people deeply committed to sorting out a new type of government, new technologies and newly-vexatious challenges to philosophical and religious certainty.|$|E

Buffy and Dawn's conversation at her school, Schlechter says, is [...] "positively wrenching". When the series ended in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the Boston Herald and Siona LaFrance of the New Orleans Times-Picayune both rated the best Buffy episodes giving [...] "The Body" [...] equal billing at the top with [...] "Hush" [...] and [...] "Once More, with Feeling", LaFrance designating the episode an [...] "instant classic".

At some point, {{most of us will}} experience <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> Buffy has in 'The Body' and we sense that the writers have gotten nearly every detail of that day—right down to the absence of a musical score—right." [...] In the A.V. Club, Noel Murray also finds small details compelling, such as the camera's focus on the paper towel Buffy uses to cover the vomit on the carpet. He does, however, write that some of the shots [...] "come off a little gimmicky, but the ones that work are so effective that it seems petty to complain that Whedon overdoes it at times.

2500|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) are a {{new type}} of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources. The vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock. EGS technologies [...] "enhance" [...] and/or create geothermal resources in this [...] "hot dry rock (HDR)" [...] through hydraulic stimulation. EGS and HDR technologies, like hydrothermal geothermal, are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> a fossil plant. Distinct from hydrothermal, HDR and EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth. Good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick (3–5km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss. There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in France, Australia, Japan, Germany, the U.S. and Switzerland. The largest EGS project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the Cooper Basin, Australia. The Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 5,000–10,000MW.|$|E
2500|$|Assuming this {{hypothetical}} planet had a low {{orbital inclination}} {{with respect to}} the mutual orbit of Alpha CentauriA and B, then the secondary star would start beside the primary at [...] "stellar" [...] conjunction.

As a net result, both the local sun and the other star would each be in the sky for half <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>like</b> Sun and Moon are both above the horizon for half a day. But during stellar conjunction, the other star being [...] "new" [...] would be in the sky during daytime, while during the opposition, the other star being [...] "full" [...] would be in the sky for the whole night. In an Earth-like atmosphere, the light of the other star would be appreciably scattered, causing the sky to be perceptibly blue though darker than during daytime, like during twilight or total solar eclipse. Humans could easily walk around and clearly see the surrounding terrain, and reading a book would be quite possible without any artificial light. Over the following half period, the secondary star would be in the sky for a progressively decreasing part of the night (and an increasing part of the day) until at the next conjunction the secondary star would only be in the sky during daytime near the primary star.|$|E

2500|$|Ortmann is most {{remembered for}} his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State, in which he punted 24 times in a {{blizzard}} for 723 yards – still a Michigan record. The weather conditions were so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The strategy worked, as the game's only touchdown was scored after Ortman punted the ball out of bounds at the Ohio State six-yard line, Ohio State was forced to punt from deep in its own territory, and Tony Momsen recovered a blocked punt in the endzone. Ortmann recalled: “You and I would not have gone outside to get the newspaper on <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>like</b> that. [...] But here we were, trying to play football.” Michigan did not get a first down and had only 27 yards of total offense, while Ortman was 0 for 8 passing and gained only 9 yards in 10 rushing attempts. The fierce weather conditions stifled both offenses, and the Wolverines managed to win 9-3 on a safety and Momsen's touchdown after the blocked punt. Interviewed about the Snow Bowl in 2006, Ortmann, then retired and living in Savannah, Georgia, recalled: [...] "Twice during the game, playing as the safety, I couldn't see [...] Vic Janowicz and his backfield, the snow was falling so heavily. Tony Momsen was our regular punter and as we were ready to go out, he said, ‘Charlie, I don't feel like punting today, you punt.' I hadn't punted in three months. But the hero of that game was not Chuck Ortmann, it was Carl Kreager, our center. I just put my hands down and the ball was always there. I still remind him every time we talk, 'Carl, you never got enough credit for that game.' It was so boring. I have a film of the game, and I haven't watched it since, if that tells you something." ...|$|E
