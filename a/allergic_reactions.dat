5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> after {{handling}} onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. <b>Allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|Honey {{bees are}} used commercially to produce honey. They also produce some {{substances}} used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly, though {{all of these}} can also cause <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the edibility of M.frustrata was not {{mentioned}} in the original description, Kuo has elsewhere written of the edibility of North American Morchella. In general, morels should not be eaten raw, as they can trigger <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> in susceptible individuals. Their flavor is enhanced after they are fried, stuffed, or dried.|$|E
5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
5|$|This form of {{treatment}} {{is meant to}} reduce the intensity or altogether eliminate the <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> people have by gradually increasing exposure to the form of radiation that brings about the reaction. In the case of solar urticaria, phototherapy and photochemotherapy are the two major desensitization treatments.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2011 review, {{there have}} been few studies on the {{efficacy}} of Proactiv. A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two less expensive types of benzoyl peroxide, AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can cause severe irritation, as well as rare but life-threatening <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diphenhydramine, a first-generation H1 {{receptor}} antagonist {{or medicine}} that combats the H1 receptor that {{is associated with}} many <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions,</b> {{has been found to be}} the most potent antihistamine for this particular disease. Patients prescribed 50 milligrams four times per day have been able to sustain normal exposure to the sun without suffering a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} histamine.|$|E

50|$|People {{that are}} {{allergic}} to other quinolones may be allergic to finafloxacin as well, and use {{may result in}} an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> in that population. Adverse effects consistent with an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction</b> to finafloxacin may include swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath.|$|R

5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the human {{population}} are allergic to the venom of M. pilosula and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human deaths have been recorded. People prone to severe <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E

5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. <b>Allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal M. nigriceps {{is found}} in hot hilly areas and woodland, nesting {{underground}} in mounds. The ant's diet consists of sweet liquids from flowering plants and invertebrate prey, which are fed to the carnivorous larvae. Spiders are known to eat these ants, and echidnas consume the larvae and pupae. Like other Myrmecia species, M. nigriceps ants possess a powerful and painful sting, and the venom is capable of inducing <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> in sensitive people.|$|E
5|$|Mast cells {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and regulate the inflammatory response. They {{are most often}} associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators {{that are involved in}} defending against parasites and play a role in <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions,</b> such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E

5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E
5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. <b>Allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
