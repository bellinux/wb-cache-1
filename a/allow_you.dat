25|$|These {{manufacturers}} offer special {{models for}} fishing {{that are designed}} and accessorized for this sport, including specially designed hatches, built-in coolers & rod holders, gps receivers and equipment mounts. Other accessories include live wells, anchor trolleys and running lights. Specially designed fishing kayaks usually have designs {{similar to those of}} recreational sit-in and sit-on-top kayaks characterized by very wide beams (up to 36 inches) that increase lateral stability. The increases stability allows for the angler to stand up and fish on the kayak. These kayaks provide a considerable space for storage inside their hulls which allow the angler to stow rods, fishing gear, batteries for fish finders, extra paddles, anchors, and wheels to tow the kayak from vehicle to the water. The cutouts molded into the top of the kayaks are well-suited to hold milk crates with additional supplies. Some anglers equip their fishing kayaks with outriggers to further increase stability. In recent years people have begun using kayaks for fly fishing, most models suited for upright fly casting include upright braces that <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> to safely stand up.|$|E
25|$|Smuggling {{activity}} in Britain became more prevalent though the Tudor and Stuart period reaching its peak {{at the end}} of the 18th century. High rates of duty were levied on imported wine, spirits, and other luxury goods to pay for Britain's expensive wars with France and the United States. Cornwall was a haven for smugglers at this time, with its many secluded coves ideally suited for evasion of the duty, a smuggling provided a highly profitable venture for impoverished fishermen and seafarers. St Buryan was no different in this respect, and also home to smuggling activity. Thomas Johns, a known smuggler and agent of smugglers, was the landlord of the Kings Arms public house, formerly on the site of Belmont House in the village square, who divided his time between St Buryan and his liquor establishments in Roscoff, Brittany. More famous still was the Lamorna wink public house near Lamorna Cove which was also a base for smugglers. The pub was so named as winking at the barman would reputedly <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> to purchase smuggled spirits.|$|E

The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro praised the controls as [...] "nearly-perfect" [...] {{and explained that}} [...] "the transparent controls <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> to concentrate on racing and blasting your opponents, and so the races are faster, more fluid and more fun." [...] Johnny Liu of Game Revolution concluded that the controls [...] "feel very natural, {{with an emphasis on}} maintaining speed rather than fighting lousy controls." [...] However, Joe Ottoson of Allgame ("All Game Guide" [...] at the time) said that the inability to reconfigure the controls was [...] "the only real drawback to Crashs presentation." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} {{praised the}} title for its open-ended gameplay. With regard to character customization, Trent Ward of IGN stated the best {{element of the}} role-playing system was allowing gamers to [...] "play the game as completely different characters", and felt this made each play-through unique. Erik Reckase writing for Just Adventure agreed, saying [...] "There are very few games that <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> [...] play the way you want". Alec Norands of Allgame believed that the different character classes made the game “diverse enough to demand instant replayability". Robert Mayer from Computer Games Magazine called System Shock 2 [...] "a game that truly defies classification in a single genre", and ensured that [...] "the action is occasionally fast-paced, it's more often tactical, placing a premium on thought rather than on reflexes." ...|$|E

500|$|John Doyle of The Globe and Mail {{called the}} pilot [...] "splendidly made". However, Doyle {{considered}} the instance of Torv stripping to a bikini [...] "indulgent", and questioned {{the wisdom of}} making [...] "her body an object of scrutiny" [...] in the first episode. Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe wrote that [...] "after the electrifying start, Fringe unfolds as an uneven, unwieldy piece of work that provides very few chills and thrills". LA Weeklys Robert Abele found Fringe is [...] "a smorgasbord of a show, but one a little too synthetically engineered to <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> the chance to discover what it is". John Leonard of New York was skeptical of the premise and storyline, but found Torv [...] "wonderfully played" [...] her character.

It tends to <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> to explore your artistic interests... There was always an air of liberation, of thinking on your own. I think that influenced a lot in what we do today musically and ideologically." [...] Group members Boris Bilbraut, Willy Rodríguez, Eliut González, Juan Costa, and Ivan Gutiérres began jamming together in 1996, bonding over a shared interest in reggae music, particularly Bob Marley.

500|$|In the Americas, Native American {{nations were}} {{severely}} damaged by European settlers, specifically {{because of the}} Europeans' advanced military technology. Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation [...] "in the frustration of not having the technology to <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> to prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side." [...] In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of Manifest Destiny. Favreau also said of the premise, [...] "It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western {{up in a very}} classic way and then turns it on its ear." [...] When the aliens appear, the film becomes a road movie in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens. Favreau compared the gathering to The Magnificent Seven in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation.|$|E

After having recorded the re-edited version Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and some Schindler's List (1993) at Symphony Hall previously, this was the third time Spielberg and Williams worked on a soundtrack at this location.

Spielberg stated he chose to work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra because the film deals with a [...] "company of soldiers" [...] and the orchestra was an [...] "experienced company of musicians." [...] Over the course of a three-day period in February 1998, the score for the film was recorded at a rate of around $100,000 an hour.|$|E
