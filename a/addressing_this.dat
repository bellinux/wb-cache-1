5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for <b>addressing</b> <b>this</b> issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in <b>addressing</b> <b>this.</b> The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E
5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law <b>addressing</b> <b>this</b> provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E

25|$|Shankar also appealed on {{the ground}} that the Disciplinary Committee, by virtue of its {{excessive}} intervention in the case, had descended into the arena and adopted an inquisitorial role, which had impaired its judgment and ability to properly evaluate and weigh the evidence.

25|$|Keenly {{aware of}} the {{potential}} for bad press and liability, University administrators have used a variety of techniques to moderate negative behaviors. The Administration's more recent tighter relationship with the Greeks provides leverage to the small Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, which sponsors a variety of programming designed to raise awareness and teach essential skills. Undergraduate members, alumni advisors, national fraternities and University administration regularly collaborate on the shared goal of reducing risks. Self-policing by peer moderators and the incorporation of live-in adult mentors have been important tools in <b>addressing</b> <b>this</b> goal.|$|E
25|$|As with SOFCs, MCFC {{disadvantages}} include slow start-up {{times because}} of their high operating temperature. This makes MCFC systems not suitable for mobile applications, and this technology {{will most likely be}} used for stationary fuel cell purposes. The main challenge of MCFC technology is the cells' short life span. The high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode. These factors accelerate the degradation of MCFC components, decreasing the durability and cell life. Researchers are <b>addressing</b> <b>this</b> problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance.|$|E

This {{also applies to}} any filming of another within a public restroom or locker room. Some jurisdictions have banned {{the use of a}} telephone with camera functionality within a restroom or locker room in order to prevent this. The United States enacted the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 to punish those who intentionally capture an individual's private areas without consent, when the person knew the subject had an expectation of privacy.

25|$|A {{strategy}} for <b>addressing</b> <b>this</b> {{problem has been}} suggested; {{the idea is to}} study the boundary amplitude, namely a path integral over a finite space-time region, seen {{as a function of the}} boundary value of the field. In conventional quantum field theory, this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory; it does so in quantum gravity as well, but in a fully background–independent manner. A generally covariant definition of -point functions can then be based on the idea that the distance between physical points –arguments of the -point function is determined by the state of the gravitational field on the boundary of the spacetime region considered.|$|E
25|$|Since Le Sage's {{particles}} must lose speed when {{colliding with}} ordinary matter (in {{order to produce}} a net gravitational force), {{a huge amount of}} energy must be converted to internal energy modes. If those particles have no internal energy modes, the excess energy can only be absorbed by ordinary matter. <b>Addressing</b> <b>this</b> problem, Armand Jean Leray proposed a particle model (perfectly similar to Le Sage's) in which he asserted that the absorbed energy is used by the bodies to produce magnetism and heat. He suggested, that this might be an answer for the question of where the energy output of the stars comes from.|$|E

25|$|In {{advance of}} {{becoming}} {{president of the}} Society of Authors in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. <b>Addressing</b> <b>this</b> issue, Pullman said: New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, {{for all kinds of}} reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is a bad one, and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.|$|E
25|$|The University of Montana Law Review {{published}} three articles <b>addressing</b> <b>this</b> {{topic in}} its winter 2007 issue. David K. DeWolf, John G. West and Casey Luskin, senior fellows or {{officers of the}} Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory, that the Jones court should not have addressed {{the question of whether}} it was a scientific theory, and that the decision will have no effect on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory. Peter Irons responded to the DeWolf et al. article, arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned, and that it marks the end to legal efforts by the intelligent design movement to introduce creationism in public schools. It had been {{an essential part of the}} ruling to consider whether ID was a legitimate scientific theory as claimed by its proponents, and DeWolf, et al. had implicitly recognised this by citing the Lemon test, which would have been irrelevant if ID were legitimate science. DeWolf et al. responded to the Irons article in the same issue.|$|E
