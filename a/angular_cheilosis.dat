40|$|Pachyonychia congenita is a rare, but well-characterized {{autosomal}} dominant disorder of keratinization. It usually begins {{within the first}} few months of life. Here, we are presenting a rare case, which started at the age of 10 years of life and is known as pachyonychia congenita tarda. The case is being reported for its rarer occurrence as the patient had oral leukokeratosis and <b>angular</b> <b>cheilosis</b> present in the same type of the syndrome (Jadassohn-Lewandowsky syndrome), which is still uncommon...|$|E
40|$|We are {{reporting}} an interesting case of ichthyosis follicularis with alopecia and photophobia syndrome in {{a daughter and}} father from the Indian subcontinent associated with Meibomian gland dysfunction. A three-year-old female child presented with pain, redness and severe photophobia in both eyes since one month. Cutaneous examination revealed ichthyosis, absence of hair all over the body including eyebrows, scalp and <b>angular</b> <b>cheilosis.</b> Ocular examination revealed bilateral severe meibomianitis, multiple superficial punctate keratitides in right eye and corneal epithelial defect in the left eye. Other systemic features were prominent high forehead and large ears. Her father had similar symptoms. Her symptoms improved after adequate treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction. She is asymptomatic at present...|$|E
40|$|Acareful {{evaluation}} of the clinical fea-tures of an oral mucosal lesion is important in directing further investiga-tion, such as biopsy, culture and serologi-cal testing. The various individual components of the oropharynx should be examined sequentially with the patient facing a good natural source of light. This is important when looking for cyanosis, pallor and excessive redness of the lips, gums, tongue and the buccal mucosa. Angular cheilitis Angular cheilitis or stomatitis is an acute inflammation of the lips with painful fissur-ing and scaling at the angles of the mouth (Figure 1) which are usually the result of physical damage to the lips by sunlight, cold wind or ill-fitting dentures. In such cases the skin and mucosa {{at the corners of}} the mouth becomes macerated due to dribbling saliva, causing fissuring of the angles of the mouth. A deficiency of the Vitamin B complex, especially of riboflavin, also can be respon-sible for such presentations. 1 Sometimes, <b>angular</b> <b>cheilosis</b> is complicated by a monil-ial infection. Most patients need correction of the mal-occlusion, which is frequently not feasible. Local 1 % hydrocortisone, in combination with a topical anti-yeast preparation, is rec-ommended. In some cases, an oral vitamin B complex, especially riboflavin, is helpful...|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin B1 {{deficiency}} (thiamin deficiency) {{can cause}} glossitis. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) can cause glossitis, along with <b>angular</b> cheilitis, <b>cheilosis,</b> peripheral neuropathy and other signs and symptoms. The glossitis in vitamin B2 deficiency {{is described as}} magenta. [...] Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) can cause glossitis. Vitamin B6 deficiency (pyridoxine deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with <b>angular</b> cheilitis, <b>cheilosis,</b> peripheral neuropathy and seborrheic dermatitis. Folate deficiency (vitamin B9 deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue and possibly neurological signs. Apart from pernicious anemia discussed above, any other cause of vitamin B12 deficiency can cause glossitis, which tends to be painful, smooth and shiny.|$|R
40|$|VERMA (1942) saw {{several hundred}} cases of {{nutritional}} amblyopia and blepharo-conjunctivitis in Madras, and {{reports from the}} prisoner of war camps in the Far East showed that blindness can occur {{as a result of}} vitamin B-complex deficiency. The use of rice mills instead of the primitive hand-pounding method, by which only the husk was removed, and the decreased consumption of millet in urban areas have caused a high incidence of B-complex deficiency among rice-eating Indians. The white bread produced in India also lacks vitamin B. With few exceptions the resulting ocular lesions cannot be definitely ascribed to a deficiency of any particular vitamin, and in most cases all the B-complex factors are deficient. (1) Angular Conjunctivitis and Blepharo-conjunctivitis Lesions of the lid margin {{similar to those of the}} lips in riboflavin deficiency are common. In early cases the lesions appear in the medial and lateral canthi and extend over the whole thickness of the intermarginal strip and some portion of the skin near it. In moderately severe cases where angular stomatitis is associated with cheilosis, the whole length of the lid margins is ulcerated, producing typical blepharo-conjunctivitis which extends over the intermarginal strip of both eyelids and the surface of the skin and conjunctiva and even over the naso-labial folds; the lesion may be 0 5 to 1 0 cm. deep with raised and pigmented edges sometimes resembling a rodent ulcer. A case of riboflavin deficiency is shown in Fig. 1. FiG.

40|$|JARE越冬隊における紫外線障害疾患について調査した。 39 次隊で発生した傷病総数 199 件のうち本疾患は 8 件(4 %) で日光皮膚炎, 雪目, 口唇炎, 口角ヘルペスなどである。これらはすべて顔面周囲に限局していた。作業中の顔面への紫外線照射量を調べるため, 水平方向の紫外線量を測定した。夏の南極では, 太陽高度角が低いことと雪面反射により水平方向の紫外線量は赤道近辺に匹敵し, オゾンホール出現中の 11 月には赤道近辺以上となった。また日照時間と屋外作業時間が長くなることは被爆総線量をさらに増やす。これらは夏の南極における本疾患発生の特徴である。JARE歴代傷病総数 4233 件のうち紫外線関連疾患は 127 件(3. 2 %) であった。季節別では冬の極夜期はほとんどなく春夏秋に発生し 11 月が最多であった。経年変化では 1990 年代より増加傾向を示した。この増加は春期の発生が増加したことによる。これはオゾンホールの出現・増大年代, 出現季節と一致していた。The incidences of {{diseases}} due to UV radiation in wintering personnel of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) were studied. Medical consultations of JARE- 39 included 199 cases. 8 {{of which were}} due to UV radiation; photo dermatitis, dermatitis, <b>angular</b> <b>cheilosis,</b> cheilosis and UV ophthalmia, {{all of which were}} observed near the face. The intensity of UVB radiation from the horizontal direction was measured. It was found that low solar elevation angle and high snow surface reflection enhanced UV radiation in the horizontal direction during the Antarctic summer to equal or more than that observed in the equatorial zone. Prolonged daytime and outdoor work in the Antarctic summer increases exposure to UV radiation. causing diseases due to UV in the Antarctic summer. Of 4233 clinical cases of JARE between 1956 to 1999,the number of UV related diseases was 127 (3. 2 %). The diseases were observed in spring, summer and autumn with a maximum in spring and no cases in winter. The diseases have been increasing since the 1990 s, when the ozone hole was observed. Furthermore the diseases are observed mainly in spring when the ozone hole is in its maximum phase...|$|E
