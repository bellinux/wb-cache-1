40|$|Abstract: Because {{of several}} {{constraints}} in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks, <b>an</b> adaptive <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> routing protocol is increasingly required. In this paper, we propose a synopsis of an adaptation process for <b>an</b> adaptive <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> routing protocol. Next, we {{put into practice}} {{the analysis of the}} process of adaptation to mobility by realizing an adaptive routing protocol: CSR (Cluster Source Routing) which is an extension of <b>a</b> widely used <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> routing protocol: DSR (Dynamic source Routing). Mobility and density metrics are considered to CSRDSR mode switching, it moves from a flat architecture working in DSR to a virtual hierarchical architecture. With this mode switching, CSR can enhance the scalability of the DSR routing protocol. ...|$|R
