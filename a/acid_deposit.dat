To {{discover the}} damage {{mechanism of the}} material, changes of microstructure of concrete samples exposed to the acidic solution were executed. A batch of cubic concrete samples with the dimension of 10 × 10 × 10 mm 3 was prepared. Acidic solution with pH level of 2. 5 was deposed by the mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid solution in the laboratory. Mercury intrusion test, SEM/EDS analyses were performed on the samples exposed to the acidic solution for a certain periods. Pore structure and porosity ratio of the concrete samples were obtained. Microstructure, chemical compounds, elemental distribution in the samples exposed to the acidic solution for various periods are achieved. Development of the micro characteristics of concrete with exposure time is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonic testing (UT) for primary water leak path assessments of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) upper head penetrations. Operating reactors have experienced leakage when stress corrosion cracking of nickel-based alloy penetrations allowed primary water into the annulus of the interference fit between the penetration and the low-alloy steel RPV head. In this investigation, UT leak path data were acquired for an Alloy 600 control rod drive mechanism nozzle penetration, referred to as Nozzle 63, which was removed from the North Anna Unit 2 reactor when the RPV head was replaced in 2002. In-service inspection prior to the head replacement indicated that Nozzle 63 had a probable leakage path through the interference fit region. Nozzle 63 was examined using a phased-array UT probe with a 5. 0 -MHz, eight-element annular array. Immersion data were acquired from the nozzle inner diameter surface. The UT data were interpreted by comparing to responses measured on a mockup penetration with known features. Following acquisition of the UT data, Nozzle 63 was destructively examined to determine if the features identified in the UT examination, including leakage paths and crystalline boric acid deposits, could be visually confirmed. Additional measurements of boric <b>acid</b> <b>deposit</b> thickness and low-alloy steel wastage were made to assess how these factors affect the UT response. The implications of these findings for interpreting UT leak path data are described...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of experiments on the radioracemization of amino acids {{in the presence}} of silica surfaces such as may have been found on the prebiotic earth. L-leucine and a DL-leucine mixture deposited on samples of 1 -quartz and an amorphous silica preparation (Syloid 63) was subjected to Co- 60 gamma-ray irradiation, then analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the radiolysis and racemization rates. The quartz surface is found to have a marginal efficacy in enhancing radiolysis when compared with a crystalline L-leucine control, although enhancing radioracemization symmetrically by a factor of two. Both the radiolysis and radioracemization of L-leucine and DL-leucine on a Syloid- 63 silica surface are observed to increase with increasing radiation dose, and to be substantially greater than in the crystalline controls. Additional experiments with the nonprotein amino <b>acid</b> isovaline <b>deposited</b> on Syloid 63 confirm the greater radiolysis susceptibility of amino <b>acids</b> <b>deposited</b> on silica with respect to the crystalline state, although racemization is not observed.
