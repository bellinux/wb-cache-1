5000|$|The Octavia {{consisted}} of an analog electronic circuit, {{which included a}} frequency doubler, envelope generator and <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator,</b> together with additional frequency-shaping filter circuitry. The effect generated varied depending on use. For example, a clean tone from an electric guitar produced ring modulated overtones (as heard on the guitar solo in [...] "Who Knows" [...] by Jimi Hendrix.) ...|$|E
50|$|A phase {{modulating}} EOM {{can also}} be used as an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator</b> by using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A beam splitter divides the laser light into two paths, one of which has a phase modulator as described above. The beams are then recombined. Changing the electric field on the phase modulating path will then determine whether the two beams interfere constructively or destructively at the output, and thereby control the amplitude or intensity of the exiting light. This device is called a Mach-Zehnder modulator.|$|E
50|$|Electro-optic {{modulators}} {{are usually}} built with electro-optic crystals exhibiting the Pockels effect. The transmitted beam is phase modulated with the electric signal {{applied to the}} crystal. <b>Amplitude</b> <b>modulators</b> can be built by putting the electro-optic crystal between two linear polarizers or in one path of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.Additionally, <b>Amplitude</b> <b>modulators</b> can be constructed by deflecting the beam {{into and out of}} a small aperture such as a fiber. This design can be low loss (<3 dB) and polarization independent depending on the crystal configuration.|$|R
50|$|At high frequencies, the PIN diode {{appears as}} a {{resistor}} whose resistance is an inverse function of its forward current. Consequently, PIN diode {{can be used in}} some variable attenuator designs as <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulators</b> or output leveling circuits.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new chopper modulators {{which can}} enable to assign three modulators in one circuit. Full <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulators</b> as Cowan and Ring modulators are kinds of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulators</b> as well. The proposed circuit is implemented from the differential voltage current conveyor, four-MOS transistors switch and two-MOS transistors inverter. The {{advantage of this}} proposed circuit is high input and low output impedance {{and is able to}} be connected with any load without buffer and the number of transistors is quite less which is suitable for integrated circuits. The technique is to control the switch by using the square pulse which is obtained from a direct signal generator. All simulation results are based on the PSPICE program simulator which confirms the performance of the proposed circuit and technique...|$|R
5000|$|This {{process can}} also be {{considered}} in the time domain. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator</b> acts as a weak 'shutter' to the light bouncing between the mirrors of the cavity, attenuating the light when it is [...] "closed", and letting it through when it is [...] "open". If the modulation rate f is synchronised to the cavity round-trip time τ, then a single pulse of light will bounce {{back and forth in the}} cavity. The actual strength of the modulation does not have to be large; a modulator that attenuates 1% of the light when [...] "closed" [...] will mode-lock a laser, since the same part of the light is repeatedly attenuated as it traverses the cavity.|$|E
50|$|The video (VF) input is a {{composite}} video signal (video information with sync) of maximum 1 volt on 75 Ω impedance. (1 V limit is for luminance signal. Some operators may accept superimposed color signals slightly over 1 V.) After buffer and 1 V clipping circuits the signal {{is applied to the}} modulator where it modulates an intermediate frequency signal (which is different from the one used for aural signal.) The modulator is an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator</b> which modulates the IF signal in a manner where 1 V VF corresponds to low level IF and 0 volt VF corresponds to high level IF. AM modulator produces two symmetrical side bands in the modulated signals. Thus IF band width is two times the video band width. (i.e. if the VF bandwidth is 4.2 MHz, the IF bandwidth is 8.4 MHz.) However, the modulator is followed by a special filter known as Vestigal sideband (VSB) filter. This filter is used to suppress a portion of one side band, thus bandwidth is reduced. (Since both side bands contain identical information, this suppression doesn't cause a loss in information.) Although the suppression causes phase delay problems the VSB stage also includes correction circuits to equalise the phase.|$|E
50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is an optical device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light with a perturbation device. It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through optical fiber (optical waveguide) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator</b> (majority), phase modulator, polarization modulator etc.The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source (laser diode). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators.According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators (absorption coefficient) and refractive modulators (refractive index of the material). Absorption coefficient can be manipulated by Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined Stark Effect, excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of electro-optic effect (amplitude & phase modulation), other modulators are made with acousto-optic effect, magneto-optic effect such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is spatial light modulator (SLM) which is modified two dimensional distribution of amplitude & phase of an optical wave.|$|E
40|$|A {{straightforward}} {{analysis of}} {{the process by which}} nonlinear <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulators</b> in coupled cavities can lead to enhanced mode-locking is presented. The application of the theory is demonstrated by using second-harmonic generation in an external cavity to mode-lock a Nd:YAG laser yielding 30 ps pulses in a Q-switched and mode-locked pulse train...|$|R
40|$|Summary form only given. Mach-Zehnder <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulators</b> {{have been}} {{designed}} for W-band operation (94 GHz), at a 1. 3 -μm optical wavelength. These modulators use bow-tie antennas, which are relatively insensitive to DC bias connections made {{to the ends of}} the antenna elements. The bow-ties should also give a greater bandwidth than the dipole antennas...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{modulators}} play {{an important}} role in optical fibre communication as well as fibre-sensor systems. Fibre modulators have been realised by several techniques such as elasto-optic phase modulators using PZT or PVF 2, acousto-optic frequency shifters and acousto-optic <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulators.</b> Here we report a totally new and novel concept, a Kerr-effect phase modulator based on a fibre containing a pair of built-in electrode...|$|R
50|$|Features include four voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} (VCOs) with tuning, footage (16, 8, 4, 2), waveshape (triangle, saw, pulse-width, and pulse-width modulated), and amplitude. The first oscillator is {{the master}} oscillator as far as fine tuning goes. Two direct modifiers to the VCOs are a detune control that only affects oscillators 2 and 4, and a Pulse Width control that goes to cancellation either side of 50% phase symmetry of a square wave; pulse width can be routed to MG1, MG2, or voltage-controlled filter (VCF) envelope. There is one independent noise generator with an amplitude control (frequency and shape is modified by the VCF). There is one 24/db octave exponential low-pass VCF with resonance, scaling and invertible envelope control shared across all four VCOs. One voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) envelope with triggering and dampering controls is shared across all four VCOs. There are two low frequency modulators: MG1 controls VCO Pitch/Pulse-width, 'EFFECTS' and VCF cutoff; MG2 controls the tempo of the arpeggiator, and Pulse-Width. There is one arpeggiator with on/off/latch control, up/down/up-down pitch control, and 1/2/full keyboard control (44 notes). The arpeggiator can cycle through each oscillator in POLY mode, or all four {{at a time in}} MONO. There is an 'EFFECTS' section which includes an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator</b> (X-MOD) with hard-sync control, and a frequency modulator with which the frequency of the modulator can be altered by the VCF envelope or MG1. For both modulators there is the option of single modulation of all oscillators, or two carriers, and two modulators (using the VCOs). Controller Interfaces are external inputs/outputs for CV/Trigger, VCF and VCO mod inputs, arpeggiator, portamento, and the pitch/MG1 mod wheels can be assigned to control VCO1 pitch, pitch or the filter. Bender goes to 2.5 octaves +/- for Pitch and full range for VCF cutoff. There are 5 different oscillator assignment modes: 'Hold' drones the oscillators until force dampered or Chord Memory is activated; 'Chord Memory (MONO)' allows 2-4 oscillators (VCOs) to be set to any arrangement across 44 keys (for example, in organ or rave chords); 'Unison (MONO)' stacks all 4 oscillators; and 'Unison/Share', which defaults to Unison with one note played, but divides the oscillators across the notes as 2 or more are played. Poly is without explanation, and oscillators always play in sequenced order from 1-4.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new type of phase- and frequency-sensitive {{amplification}} and attenuation in a cyclically driven three-level superconducting Josephson system. Different from the previous linear theory of pure phase-sensitive amplification, a new physical mechanism$-$combined action of nonlinear wave mixing and wave interference$-$is developed and leads to not only amplification but also attenuation. This is referred to as interference nonlinear optics. Our results show the sudden output signal transition from large gain to deep suppression by tuning the relative phase and in this case the system can act as a phase-controlled <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator.</b> We also show the continuous change from output enhancement to attenuation by adjusting the driving-field frequency and in this situation the system behaves as a frequency-controlled <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator.</b> Our study opens up a new perspective for its widespread applications in quantum information science...|$|E

40|$|A square-waveform {{generator}} {{based on}} a fiber optical parametric oscillator (FOPO) is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The FOPO works fundamentally by extracting the longitudinal modes beating signal to drive the intracavity <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator.</b> In order to broaden the longitudinal mode spacing, two sub-ring cavities with a short cavity length are used. The longitudinal modes are phase locked, which ensures the generated microwave signal with very low phase noise. By biasing the <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator,</b> the even-order beating signals are suppressed, while the odd-order beating signals are enhanced. Thus, the FOPO is self-starting and can provide stable square-waveform output with the repetition rate of 1. 133 GHz at the signal and idler simultaneously. It is tunable over 10 nm, which is only limited by the gain bandwidth of the fiber optical parametric amplifier of the current configuration. © 2006 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{efficient}} transmitter {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} (TX MMIC) suitable for high-speed wireless communication. In {{order to achieve}} high output power, the TX is based on a direct modulation approach, containing a stacked-FET voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator.</b> Thus, the modulation scheme is based on amplitude-shift keying (ASK). The MMIC utilizes the Fraunhofer IAF 50 nm gate-length metamorphic high-electronmobility transistor (mHEMT) technology. The stacked-FET oscillator generates the carrier signal and achieves an output power of about 14 dBm. The carrier frequency can be tuned from 87. 8 to 98. 2 GHz. Due to the FET-stacking approach the <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator</b> can be simplified to a single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switch. Hence, the transmitter MMIC achieves a peak output power of 12 : 5 dBm and a maximum data rate of 18 Gbit/s. The maximum continuous wave (CW) efficiency of the entire TX MMIC yields 17. 6 %...|$|E
50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is a device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light. The beam may be carried over free space, or propagated through an optical waveguide (optical fibre). Depending on the parameter of a light beam which is manipulated, modulators may be categorized into <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulators,</b> phase modulators, polarization modulators etc. Often the easiest way to obtain modulation of intensity of a light beam, is to modulate the current driving the light source, e.g. a laser diode. This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason light modulators are, e.g. in fiber optic communications, called external light modulators.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} of the performance of a time-division-addressed fiber-optic gas-sensor array by means of wavelength modulation of a distributed-feedback (DFB) laser are reported. The system performance is found to be severely limited by the extinction ratio of the optical switch used for pulse amplitude modulation. Formulas that relate the cross-talk level to the extinction ratio of the switch, the modulation parameters of the DFB laser, and the optical path differences among sensing channels are derived. Computer simulation shows that an array of 20 methane gas sensors with a detection sensitivity of 2000 parts in 10 ⁶ (ppm) (10 -cm gas cell) for each sensor may be realized with a commercially available single Mach–Zehnder <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulator</b> (− 35 -dB extinction ratio).
