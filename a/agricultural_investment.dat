25|$|The {{government}} also carried out an import substitution policy, taking what {{was obtained by}} agriculture to give support to the industrial sector, trading agricultural product exports for foreign currency to import industrial machinery, thus developing the industrial sector. The government raised tariffs, controlled foreign exchange and restricted imports {{in order to protect}} domestic industry. By the 1960s, Taiwan's import exchange industry was faced with the problem of saturating the domestic market. At the same time, the factories of some industrialized nations, because of rising wages and other reasons, slowly moved to certain areas that had both basic industry and low labor costs. By slow steps, the economic policy of Taiwan changed to pursue export expansion under advice of academic economists such as Ta-Chung Liu and Sho-Chieh Tsiang of Cornell University. They also promoted allowing interest rates to rise, to encourage domestic savings and expand the amount of resources available to fund new businesses. Additional academic advisers also members of Academic Sinica provided sound advice encouraging innovation in agricultural techniques, enabling one of the few successful takeoffs toward modern growth based on <b>agricultural</b> <b>investment</b> in cash crops for export.|$|E

40|$|Overall, {{the study}} shows that large, {{one-time}} cash transfers aimed at increasing <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments</b> can significantly impact smallholders’ agricultural production. This differs from previous findings in the literature, which have found more modest impacts of cash transfers on <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments.</b> It {{is possible that the}} difference in results may stem from the agricultural training and support that accompanied the cash transfer. However, the study found little evidence that the farm management plan alone can be effective. This finding suggests that for programs aimed at “gradu-ating” smallholder farmers from subsistence production to more high- value, commercial production, cash transfers may be the most critical component for overcoming production constraints.

40|$|In {{the case}} of some <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments,</b> often net cash flow changes its sign from {{positive}} to negative, many times during the project. It causes the problem of {{internal rate of return}} calculation, which is an important indicator of economic effectiveness of investments. That is, in such situations, internal rate of return cannot be used. To solve this problem, modified rate of return is applied. This paper aimed to describe this method in detail, and to show its calculation for investments in pigs fattening. By application of modified internal rate of return it is determined that pigs fattening, under assumed conditions, is economically justified. Also, authors calculated the upper limit of discount rate (cost of capital), to which investment in pigs fattening is economically justified. It is concluded that, in {{the case of}} specific <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments</b> (such as pigs fattening), the use of traditional internal rate of return could give the wrong image on actual rate of return on investments...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the international regulatory framework for large-scale <b>agricultural</b> land <b>investments</b> (‘LSALIs’). Population growth, natural resource scarcity, and the financial and food price crises have made financial actors revise their long-held hesitation towards direct investment in farmland. Although these investments could inject much-needed capital into rural areas, LSALIs have been connected with grievous human rights violations and environmental degradation. This article finds that the instruments designed to promote socially and environmentally responsible LSALIs have increasing levels of legitimacy but lack accountability mechanisms. As a result, the emerging regulatory framework for LSALIs does not create the balance required between protecting investors from host state interference and ensuring socially and environmentally responsible <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{notion that}} the formal titling and individualization of land rights in {{developing}} countries lead to higher investments in land and agricultural productivity holds sway in academic and development circles. In this paper, this notion is analyzed based on a comparative study of land reform programs and their implications for access to land, credit, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments</b> in Ghana, Kenya, and Vietnam. It focuses on how different access routes to land influence access to credit, and the transaction costs of land reform programs for <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments.</b> The paper concludes that in developing countries, the transaction costs of land reforms for investments can significantly increase if the influence of power is not {{addressed in order to}} reduce unequal access to land. The practical implementation of land reform is influenced by many factors, including the control on political power. Thus, measures must accompany implementation to check the use of power to derail land reform objectives. Moreover, the paper supports the argument that land reforms should be implemented in their local contexts so as to have positive effects on agriculture...|$|R

40|$|The {{attainment}} {{of food and}} water security rank high on the agendas of governments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Although the objectives are similar, the underlying drivers, resource endowments and opportunities for achieving them are different. Differences between two regions in natural resource endowment and investment capital stock can, in theory, lead to mutually beneficial trade to achieve desired objectives. Concerns about the recent food crises coupled with the disparity in land and water endowment and investable capital between MENA and SSA have led in recent years to <b>investment</b> in <b>agricultural</b> land in the latter by a number of MENA countries with the aim of producing food. At the same time, many SSA countries seek these investments to infuse capital, technology and know-how into their agricultural sector to improve productivity, food security and rural livelihoods. However, these recent foreign direct <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments</b> have to date performed poorly or have been abandoned without achieving the initial objectives of setting them up. Based on research conducted in selected sub-Saharan countries, this paper analyses the reasons for the failure of these investments. It then reviews a few successful <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments</b> by private sector companies with a long history of operation in SSA. Juxtaposing lessons distilled from failed and successful case studies, the paper argues that large-scale <b>agricultural</b> <b>investments</b> that take advantage of this accumulated knowledge are needed and do have a critical role to play. Such investments, when they also incorporate ecosystems management practices and smallholder inclusive business models in their operations, can serve as appropriate instruments to reconcile the food and water security objectives of both the MENA region and SSA, while promoting sustainable intensification of agriculture and improved rural livelihoods in SSA...|$|R
