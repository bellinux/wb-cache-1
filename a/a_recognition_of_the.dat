5|$|In 1972 all {{production}} at Churchill-Redman in Halifax moved to Blaydon with the consequent loss of 350 jobs. This formed {{a part of}} TI's many rationalisation measures taken in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the closure was explained as being due to the desire for greater productivity and <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low sales generated at the site. A Churchill factory at Bedford which had been operating since 1967 was closed at this time.|$|E
5|$|This was <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{de facto}} {{political}} situation, as the Patriarch of Constantinople was partially under the political {{control of the}} Ottoman Empire. However, faithful people—concerned that having a Catholic {{as the head of}} the Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church—criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as non-canonical. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant, missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up {{as a role model}} for putting his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, the Australian Army mostly copied British Army doctrine, {{in as much}} as one existed semi-officially in {{the form}} of the Field Service Regulations. Pre-war {{planning}} had largely seen the Australian Army focus on defending the continent from invasion with a relatively small force, and as a result any future war was thought to likely be a highly mobile one. This was in contrast to the offensive focus of many British and European theorists of this time, despite their influence on local professional military debate. As a result, there was an emphasis on entrenchments, and whilst there was <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problems posed by increasing firepower as a result of the continued development of small arms and artillery technology, there was considered to be little requirement for the direct assault of static defensive positions given the room for manoeuvre afforded by the vastness of the Australian continent. Meanwhile, in order to be compatible with British forces, pre-war agreements ensured that Australian Army units were mostly organised, trained and equipped in accordance with British Army doctrine and establishment tables.|$|E

25|$|About 120 notable {{politicians}} and intellectuals from Albania attended the Albanian Congress of Trieste from 27 February to 6 March 1913 and requested from the Great Powers <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political and economical independence of Albania. Isa Boletini and Ismail Qemali travelled to London in March 1913 to obtain Britain's {{support for their}} new country. On March 6 Ioannina was captured by forces of the Kingdom of Greece. In March 1913 a group of 130 (or 200) soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia were killed near Prizren by Albanian irregulars in act of revenge for repression of Serbian army.|$|E
25|$|The San Francisco Peace Treaty is definitive, where Japan ceded Taiwan (like Sakhalin and Kuril Islands etc.) without specifying a clear recipient. China was {{prohibited}} from acquiring Taiwan sovereignty as a benefit when the treaty was finalized. Moreover, the Treaty of Taipei only became effective on 5 August 1952, over {{three months after}} the coming into force of the San Francisco Peace Treaty on 28 April 1952. Hence, the Treaty of Taipei cannot be interpreted to have ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to the ROC or the PRC, but only as <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territories which ROC had and under its control, as Japan cannot cede what it no longer possessed.|$|E

25|$|The {{important}} {{legacy of}} this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in anatomy, zoology, botany, mineralogy, geography, mathematics and astronomy; {{an awareness of the}} importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research. In the Hellenistic age scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations. Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, to medieval Muslim philosophers and scientists, to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment, to the secular sciences of the modern day.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{deviations}} from Boasian orthodoxy was White's view {{of the nature of}} anthropology and its relation to other sciences. White understood the world to be divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomenon. Such a division {{is a reflection of the}} composition of the universe and was not a heuristic device. Thus, contrary to Alfred L. Kroeber, Kluckhohn, and Edward Sapir, White saw the delineation of the object of study not as a cognitive accomplishment of the anthropologist, but as <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actually existing and delineated phenomena which comprise the world. The distinction between 'natural' and 'social' sciences was thus based not on method, but on the nature of the object of study: physicists study physical phenomena, biologists biological phenomena, and culturologists (White's term) cultural phenomena.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s the Forestry Commission {{had begun}} {{a shift in}} focus to {{conservation}} and amenity value of their woods. The 1975 symposium considered the history and ecology of Bedford Purlieus and discussed how to retain and enhance {{the elements of the}} woods of greatest ecological value. The resulting publication, edited by G.F. Peterken and R.C. Welch, produced a detailed management plan. Among its recommendations were the restoration of areas of coppicing, and the reduction of conifers. The plan provided a basis for an ecological management of Bedford Purlieus within commercial constraints. Its designation as a national nature reserve in 2000 is <b>a</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extent to which the policy shift had been made. In 2005 it received an injection of funding from landfill tax credits arising from the nearby Augean landfill. This has facilitated the Forestry Commission to re-instate areas of coppicing, open up grassland glades and remove conifers and other introduced species.|$|E
