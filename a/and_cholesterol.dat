5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation <b>and</b> <b>cholesterol</b> metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, <b>and</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain. Each of these lipid classes is known to play functional roles within the body, including the support of gut, immune, and central nervous system development.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Diabetes or insulin resistance, overweight, {{arterial}} hypertension, and dyslipidaemia {{are recognized}} {{risk factors for}} cardiovascular (CV) disease. However, their predictive value and hierarchy in elderly subjects remain uncertain. METHODS: We investigated the impact of cardiometabolic risk factors on mortality in a prospective cohort study of 331 elderly high-risk subjects (mean age+/-SD: 85 +/- 7 years). RESULTS: Two-year total mortality was predicted by age, diabetes, low BMI, low diastolic blood pressure (DBP), low total <b>and</b> HDL <b>cholesterol,</b> <b>and</b> previous CV events. The effect of diabetes was explained by previous CV events. In non-diabetic subjects, mortality was predicted by high insulin sensitivity, determined by HOMA-IR and QUICKI indices. In multivariate analyses, the strongest mortality predictors were low BMI, low HDL <b>cholesterol</b> <b>and</b> previous myocardial infarction. Albumin, a marker of malnutrition, was associated with blood pressure, total <b>and</b> HDL <b>cholesterol,</b> <b>and</b> HOMA-IR. The inflammation marker CRP was associated with low total <b>and</b> HDL <b>cholesterol,</b> <b>and</b> high HOMA-IR. CONCLUSION: In very old patients, low BMI, low DBP, low total <b>and</b> HDL <b>cholesterol,</b> <b>and</b> high insulin sensitivity predict total mortality, indicating a "reverse metabolic syndrome" that is probably attributable to malnutrition and/or chronic disorders. These inverse associations limit the relevance of conventional risk factors. Previous CV events <b>and</b> HDL <b>cholesterol</b> remain strong predictors of mortality. Future studies should determine {{if and when the}} prevention and treatment of malnutrition in the elderly should be incorporated into conventional CV prevention...|$|R

The mass quotients of total plasma <b>cholesterol</b> <b>and</b> high-density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> as well as low-density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> <b>and</b> high-density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> are well-established predictive risk factors of cardiovascular disease. We evaluated and compared these lipoprotein cholesterol ratios of 80 patients treated systemically with isotretinoin (13 -cis-retinoic acid) and 81 patients treated with etretinate (aromatic retinoid). Lipoprotein cholesterol data were derived from 5 lipid studies on isotretinoin, including our own results, and 4 published lipid studies on etretinate. For all isotretinoin and etretinate lipid studies, significant increases in the mean plasma levels of total <b>cholesterol</b> <b>and</b> low-density lipopro-tein <b>cholesterol</b> <b>and</b> significant decreases in the mean concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were demonstrated. In comparison with etretinate, oral isotretinoin {{gave rise to a}} nearly twofold percent increase of both lipoprotein cholesterol ratios from pretreatment levels. Furthermore, for isotretinoin, an approximately linear dose-related increase of the ratio of low-density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> <b>and</b> high-density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> could be observed. If sustained over long periods, the mean differential rise of the ratio of low-density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> <b>and</b> high-density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> of 0. 92 ± 0. 51 for isotretinoin and 0. 56 ± 0. 10 for etretinate indicates an increased risk of cardiovascular disease for both retinoids.
