25|$|Beuys made {{it clear}} that he {{considered}} this song as a work of art, not the “pop” product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. Such becomes more obvious when one looks at the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex and whoever is trying to defrost the “Cold War” to make it “hot.” The song has to be understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive frustration in 1982. Beuys warns Reagan et al. that the peace-loving masses are behind him, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> <b>the</b> Americans as well.|$|E
25|$|All the {{electromagnetic}} motors, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> <b>the</b> types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector {{product of the}} interacting fields. For calculating the torque {{it is necessary to}} know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{above-mentioned}} historic process {{of determining the}} age and distance to globular clusters is not as robust as first thought, since the morphology and luminosity of globular cluster stars in color-magnitude diagrams are influenced by numerous parameters, {{many of which are}} still being actively researched. Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters (e.g., blue hook stars), or feature multiple populations. [...] The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time, or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance, has likewise been overturned (e.g., NGC 2808). [...] Further, the morphology of the cluster stars in a color-magnitude diagram, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> <b>the</b> brightnesses of distance indicators such as RR Lyrae variable members, can be influenced by observational biases. One such effect is called blending, and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low-resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target. [...] Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star (e.g., an RR Lyrae variable) is erroneously too bright, given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined. [...] Consequently, the computed distance is wrong, and more importantly, certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder, and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant.|$|E

2500|$|The CF-104 was {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Widowmaker" [...] {{by the press}} but not by the pilots and crews of the {{aircraft}}. David Bashow states on page 92 of his book [...] "I never heard a pilot call it the Widowmaker". Sam Firth is quoted on page 93 in Bashow's book [...] "I have never heard a single person who flew, maintained, controlled, or guarded that aircraft of any force (<b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe) call it the Widowmaker". The pilots did refer to it, in jest, as the [...] "Aluminium Death Tube", [...] "The Lawn Dart" [...] and [...] "The Flying Phallus" [...] but generally called it the 104 (one oh four) or the Starfighter.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} known since before the 1960s that a [...] "full-roller" [...] type of {{delivery}} does not hook as well as [...] "3/4 rollers" [...] on oily lanes. On successive rotations, the [...] "full roller" [...] repeatedly contacts the lane on the same full circumferential circle, on which the oil accumulates, {{making it harder for}} the side-roll to find traction and create hooking action. The [...] "full-roller" [...] had been the dominant choice before the changes in lane coatings and oil. The [...] "semi-roller" [...] is now preferred (it may also be called [...] "3/4 roller" [...] or by other slang terms). With a 3/4-roller a bowler puts the ball into a rotation whose contact ring is smaller, and on successive rotations enlarges (subsequent examination of the ball often shows a flaring of the circles of oil). This is because at every spot along the circle, friction reduces the rotation, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> <b>the</b> spin component, causing rotation on a continually larger circle. This has the effect of bringing relatively dry ball surface in contact with the lane, increasing traction for both forward-roll and side-roll. It probably goes without saying why bowlers often wipe oil off the ball.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} a negative review in Variety; critic Justin Chang characterized {{the film as}} [...] "a high-energy, low-impact caper-comedy that labors to bring a measure of wit, romance and glamour to an overworked spy-thriller template". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter summarized his review of the film with, [...] "Bottom Line: Logic and plausibility take a holiday in this nonstop actioner that counts on stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz to sell the nonsense." [...] Honeycutt wrote of the writing, [...] "the script is too lazy to develop any of its characters – <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> <b>the</b> leads", and commented, [...] "laziness permeates the film from the inexplicable escapes to the neglected romance". Knight and Day {{received a}} rating of {{one and a half}} stars from a review by Michael Phillips in the Chicago Tribune; which criticized multiple aspects of the film, including its script, directing, cinematography, set pieces, and action sequences. Phillips concluded, [...] "A 21st Century 'Charade' pumped up on all the wrong steroids, 'Knight and Day' may well suffice for audiences desperate for the bankable paradox known as the predictable surprise, and willing to overlook a galumphing mediocrity in order to concentrate on matters of dentistry." [...] Lexi Feinberg of Big Picture Big Sound gave the film a rating of one and a half stars, and characterized it as an [...] "asinine, action-adventure dud", with a [...] "stupid plot". Feinberg commented, [...] "'Knight and Day' is a ludicrous, large-scale failure".|$|E
