5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{generally}} <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> dramatic {{reduction in}} the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. It is argued that the {{reduction in the}} Congo was atypical and {{can be attributed to the}} direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate. Estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian {{conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin is the {{principal}} subject of the Gesta Hungarorum, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle. Most scholars <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> notary of Béla III of Hungary, who ruled between 1173 and 1196, wrote the Gesta after the king's death. According to an alternative theory, {{the author of the}} Gesta, who is now known as Anonymus, had served Béla II of Hungary before starting to complete his work around 1150. Anonymus did not write of Svatopluk I of Moravia, Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia and the invading Magyars' other opponents who had been mentioned in works written in earlier centuries. Neither did he refer to the Magyars' fights with the Moravians, Franks and Bavarians which had been described in earlier annals and chronicles. On the other hand, Anonymus wrote of local polities and rulersincluding Gelou, the Vlach duke of Transylvania, Menumorut, the lord of the regions between the rivers Mureș, Someș and Tisza, and Salanus, the Bulgar ruler of the lands between the Danube and the Tiszaunknown from other primary sources.|$|E
5|$|The Six-Day {{war began}} when Israel {{launched}} {{air strikes against}} Egypt's air force on 5 June 1967. The war ended in an Arab defeat and Israel's occupation of several Arab territories, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although Nasser and his Arab allies had been defeated, Arafat and Fatah could claim a victory, in {{that the majority of}} Palestinians, who had up to that time tended to align and sympathize with individual Arab governments, now began to <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> 'Palestinian' solution to their dilemma was indispensable. Many primarily Palestinian political parties, including George Habash's Arab Nationalist Movement, Hajj Amin al-Husseini's Arab Higher Committee, the Islamic Liberation Front and several Syrian-backed groups, virtually crumbled after their sponsor governments' defeat. Barely a week after the defeat, Arafat crossed the Jordan River in disguise and entered the West Bank, where he set up recruitment centers in Hebron, the Jerusalem area and Nablus, and began attracting both fighters and financiers for his cause.|$|E

25|$|Despite these {{different}} estimates, scientists <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> supereruption {{of the scale}} at Toba must have led to very extensive ash-fall layers and injection of noxious gases into the atmosphere, with worldwide effects on weather and climate.

25|$|As is {{the case}} with other mental disorders, the causes of BPD are complex and not fully agreed upon.

25|$|Osman Pasha {{organized}} a defense and repelled two Russian attacks with colossal casualties on the Russian side.

25|$|All Jewish {{religious}} movements <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{person may}} be a Jew either by birth or through conversion.

25|$|Bach-Zelewski left {{prison in}} 1949. In 1951, Bach-Zelewski {{claimed that he}} helped Hermann Göring commit suicide in 1946.

The authorities never verified Bach-Zelewski's claim, however, and did not charge him with aiding Göring's death. Most modern historians dismiss Bach-Zelewski's claim and <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> U.S. Army contact within the Palace of Justice's prison at Nuremberg most likely aided Göring in his suicide.|$|E
