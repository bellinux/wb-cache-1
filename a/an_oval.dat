5|$|Kingston Russell is {{the largest}} {{surviving}} stone circle in Dorset. The stones are arranged in <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> with a diameter measuring from 24 by 27 metres (79 by 89 feet).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Kingston Russell ring is the largest of those in Dorset, measuring 24 by 27 metres (79 feet by 89 feet) in diameter and containing eighteen sarsen stones arranged in <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> shape. The site has not been excavated or been subject to in-depth archaeological investigation.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} built, the Federal-style {{house had}} three stories. The completed house had {{four or five}} parlors. It was built of unpainted, cream-colored brick. The entrance was level with the ground, with an oriel window above it {{on the second floor}} and a Palladian window on the third floor above that. <b>An</b> <b>oval</b> portico protected visitors arriving at the front doors.|$|E

5|$|Descriptions of Imogen as a {{small child}} {{indicate}} that she had blue eyes, fair hair, <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, {{at the age of}} five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Holidays were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Loughor Castle is a ruined, medieval {{fortification}} {{located in}} the town of Loughor, Wales. The castle was built around 1106 by the Anglo-Norman lord Henry de Beaumont, during the Norman invasion of Wales. The site overlooked the River Loughor and controlled a strategic road and ford running across the Gower Peninsula. The castle was designed as <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> ringwork, probably topped by wicker fence defences, and reused the remains of the former Roman fort of Leucarum.|$|E
5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E

5|$|The Gevninge helmet {{fragment}} is {{what remains}} of a Danish helmet from the Viking Age or end of the Nordic Iron Age. Made of gilded bronze, it consists of a stylised eyebrow above <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> with eyelashes, and originally formed the right eyepiece of the helmet. Three holes {{on the top and}} {{on the bottom of the}} fragment would have once held it in place.|$|E
5|$|The Rockingham 500 was {{an annual}} Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) motor race {{held at the}} Rockingham Motor Speedway oval track in Corby, Northamptonshire, England, United Kingdom in 2001 and 2002. The event {{was the first major}} motor race held on <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> track {{featuring}} Champ Cars in the United Kingdom. It was created in the hope of rivalling the Formula One British Grand Prix, although CART had problems promoting the event to the public.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} is a sport which {{includes}} athletic contests established on {{the skills of}} running, jumping, and throwing. The name {{is derived from the}} sport's typical venue: a stadium with <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} 2/19th and 2/20th Battalions, it was {{assigned}} to the 22nd Brigade, which formed part of the 8th Division. The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 18th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were purple over green, in a diamond shape, although a border of gray in <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval shape designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division.|$|E
5|$|Eight centimeters {{wide and}} five tall, the Gevninge {{eyepiece}} was molded from bronze and then gilded. <b>An</b> <b>oval</b> eye opening is overlain by a sculpted eyebrow with grooves forming individual hairs, while grooves around the oval may represent eyelashes. The {{top and the}} bottom of the fragment each have three holes, presumably used to attach it to the helmet; the top three may have attached it to the helmet cap, the bottom three to some form of face protection such as a facemask or camail.|$|E
5|$|Geospace is {{populated}} by electrically charged particles {{at very low}} densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. During geomagnetic storms two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere, can become strongly disturbed. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, disrupting telecommunications and GPS technologies, and {{can also be a}} hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> surrounding the geomagnetic poles.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, if a spherical {{wavefront}} is refracted {{through a}} spherical lens, or reflected from a concave spherical surface, the refracted or reflected wavefront {{takes on the}} shape of <b>a</b> Cartesian <b>oval.</b> The caustic formed by spherical aberration in this case may therefore {{be described as the}} evolute of <b>a</b> Cartesian <b>oval.</b>|$|R

5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (â˜§) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E
5|$|The fish's {{upper surface}} is brown to reddish brown with many {{scattered}} darker spots, lighter streaks, and reticulations. The {{center of each}} pectoral fin is marked with <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> spot or blotch. The lower surface is light, white to grey, blotched irregularly with gray spots. The barndoor skate is unique from other species of skate in its having a straight line that begins at the snout and ends at the anterior margin of the outer corner of the disk, but stopping short of the disk.|$|E
5|$|The hamlet was {{designed}} by John Nash, master of the Picturesque style. He had worked for Harford on other buildings. The hamlet is the first fully realised exemplar of the garden suburb and was the inspiration for virtually all garden suburbs that followed. The cottages are all unique and include brick chimneys and dormer windows with some having thatched roofs. They are examples of the picturesque, an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin. <b>An</b> <b>oval</b> path links the cottages and encircles the village green, which has a sundial at its centre. The cottage gardens are planted in a Victorian cottage garden style.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of high power, light weight, and high cornering ability allow supermodifieds to average over 120 mi/h km/h on <b>a</b> 1/2-mile <b>oval</b> and 150 mi/h km/h on <b>a</b> 1 mi <b>oval,</b> with top speeds over 190 mi/h km/h.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} hold the games at the Shenton Park Annexe of the Royal Perth Hospital but this was abandoned due the need for temporary buildings. The Royal Agricultural Showgrounds in the suburb of Claremont was used as it had <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> and buildings for accommodation and events. A major advantage of the venue was that all facilities were on one level. There was no suitable facility for basketball and after much debate a wooden court was laid on a sand foundation {{in front of the}} main grandstand. Beatty Park was used for swimming events.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. <b>An</b> <b>oval</b> cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into <b>an</b> <b>oval</b> shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
