5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that particular day the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
25|$|Following Hurricane Sandy in {{the fall}} of 2012, B’nai B’rith’s Young Professional Network in New York {{immediately}} began assisting in the cleanup.

500|$|Although Dianetics was not cheap, a {{great many}} people were {{nonetheless}} willing to pay; van Vogt later recalled [...] "doing little but tear open envelopes <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> $500 checks from people who wanted to take an auditor's course". Financial controls were lax. Hubbard himself withdrew large sums with no explanation of what he was doing with it. On one occasion, van Vogt saw Hubbard taking a lump sum of $56,000 (equivalent to $0.5 million at 2010 prices) out of the Los Angeles Foundation's proceeds. One of Hubbard's employees, Helen O'Brien, commented that at the Elizabeth, N.J. branch of the Foundation, the books showed that [...] "a month's income of $90,000 is listed, with only $20,000 accounted for".|$|E
500|$|Morgan was {{inspired}} to write this episode after seeing men working on an open escalator in a mall around Christmas time. He thought of the scare factor from a creature living underneath the escalator, and felt Tooms {{would be the perfect}} choice for the creature. Tooms was the first villain in the show's history to make an appearance in a second episode. It was actor Doug Hutchison's idea to play Tooms nude during the escalator sequence, a decision which Carter felt [...] "caused a little discomfort", but that [...] "actually added to the scene". The bile-like substance coating Tooms and his nest was actually a yellow piping gel, which the cast found would stick to their skin <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> hair upon removal. Tooms framing Mulder for assault seems to have been inspired by a similar plot point in the film Dirty Harry.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} couple of months, they were merely [...] "killing time", {{according}} to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. [...] "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. [...] "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come out here, to show us." [...] Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, {{is the way in which}} Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the [...] "globe-trotting psychosis" [...] of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.|$|E
2500|$|Zhang then {{appeared}} {{in her first}} American film, Rush Hour 2 (2001).

[...] Evert would not even {{make it to the}} final having been ousted by Britain's Virginia Wade in the semi-finals. [...] The match was lost by Evert in 26, 64, 16, which Evert amassed 25 {{unforced}} errors mostly due to a poor forehand shot, and her serve was not much better having made six double faults. [...] Evert said of her poor showing that [...] "I could not reach deep inside of myself <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> what I needed to win the match." ...|$|E
2500|$|A pair of [...] long {{self-acting}} mules with 1320 spindles {{each would}} be tended by three employees: the minder or operative spinner, the big piecer, {{and the little}} piecer. The little piecer would start in the mulegate on his fourteenth birthday, and rise {{to the status of}} a minder. All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, doffing, cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken.The piecer would catch the snarled fuzzy broken end {{at the top of the}} spindle in his right hand <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the hand away when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the piecer was close enough to lean over the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, his crotch was adjacent to the base of the spindles.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Kebra Nagast of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Pharaoh's {{daughter}} tricked Solomon into committing idolatry {{by making}} him swear an oath. In the text {{she was upset}} that he has slept with the Queen of Sheba and fathered Menyelek (who is held to have taken the Arc of the Covenant with him when the Queen returned with him to Africa). Solomon at first resists her calls saying [...] "I will neither sacrifice to nor worship thine idols, and I will not perform thy wish." [...] So [...] "one day she beautified and scented herself for him, and she behaved herself haughtily towards him, and treated him disdainfully. And he said unto her, [...] "What shall I do? Thou hast made thy face evil towards me, and thy regard towards me is not as it was formerly, and thy beautiful form is not as enticing as usual. Ask me, and I will give thee whatsoever thou wishest, and I will perform it for thee, so that thou mayest make thy face (or, attitude) gracious towards me as formerly"; but she held her peace and answered him never a word. And he repeated to her the words {{that he would do}} whatsoever she wished, and she said unto him, [...] "Swear to me by the God of Israel that thou wilt not play me false." [...] And he swore to her that he would give her whatsoever she asked for, and that he would do for her everything that she told him. And she tied a scarlet thread on the middle of the door of [...] her gods, and she brought three locusts and set them in the house of her gods. And she said unto Solomon, [...] "Come to me without breaking the scarlet thread, bend thyself and kill these locusts before me <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> their necks"; and he did so. And she said unto him, [...] "I will henceforward do thy will, for thou hast sacrificed to my gods and hast worshipped them." [...] Now he had done thus because of his oath, so that he might not break his oath which she had made him to swear, even though he knew that it was an offence (or, sin) to enter into the house of her gods." ...|$|E
