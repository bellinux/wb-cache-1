It's well known than even {{a small amount of}} time delay in a closed-loop control system, if untreated, can cause instability. Anyway stability remains the first requirement for any dynamical system. Wave variables method is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> guarantees stability regardless of the time delay. However this method is able to deal with constant time delays. In the thesis wave variables method is reviewed. Particular attention is focused on bilateral teleoperation schemes under time-varying communication delays.

30|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> {{introduces}} a parametric modeling for multimodal background is the Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) model [29]. In this approach, the pixel evolution is statistically modeled as a multimodal signal, described using a time-adaptive mixture of Gaussian components, widely {{employed in the}} surveillance community. Each Gaussian component of a mixture describes a gray level interval observed at a given pixel location. A weight is associated to each component, mirroring the confidence of portraying a BG entity. In practice, the higher the weight, the stronger the confidence, and the longer the time such gray level has been recently observed at that pixel location. Due to the relevance assumed in the literature and the numerous proposed improvements, we perform here {{a detailed analysis of}} this approach.|$|E

Even a small time delay in a bilateral teleoperation system will generally degrade the system’s performance and cause instability. <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> guarantees stability for any fixed time delay is the wave variable method. In this paper we present some recent material dealing with teleoperation systems using wave variables. In particular, we describe a wave variable scheme based on a family of scaling matrices for multiple degree-of-freedom bilateral teleoperation system. We include a derivation of a larger family of scaling matrices that will guarantee the system remains stable for a fixed time delay.

We designed a selection scheme with drug selection markers and Cre/loxP technology which allows screening of gene trap events that responded to a signaling molecule in a 96 -well format. Nine hundred twenty gene trap clones were assayed, and 258 were classified as gene traps induced by in vitro differentiation. Sixty-five of the in vitro differentiation-inducible gene traps were also responsive to retinoic acid treatment. In vivo analysis revealed that 85 % of the retinoic acid-inducible gene traps trapped developmentally regulated genes, consistent with the observation that genes induced by retinoic acid treatment {{are likely to be}} developmentally regulated. Our results demonstrate that the inducible gene trapping system described here can be used to enrich in vitro for traps in genes of interest. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cre reporter is extremely sensitive and can be used to explore chromosomal regions that are not detectable with neo as a selection cassette.

40|$|The {{development}} of temporomandibular joint implants has involved simplified mechanical tests that apply pure vertical forces or pure rotational movements to the implant. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a biological based mastication mechanism and conduct preliminary testing of a novel temporomandibular joint implant. The mechanism was designed to mimic temporomandibular joint loads by performing compression and anterior/posterior translation. Pilot testing was performed on six implant/joint specimens for seven consecutive hours, completing approximately 22, 000 cycles at a frequency of approximately 1 Hz. Each cycle had a joint compression phase (67. 3 N over 0. 15 s) followed by a translation phase (8. 67 N over 0. 43 s) that was similar to joint loads/motions that have been reported in vivo. This new mastication mechanism incorporates both anatomical and mechanical variability.

This article reports the usage, diagnoses and outcomes associated with the 2 -year Trauma Response Programme (TRP) for those affected by the 2005 London bombings. MethodFollowing a systematic and coordinated programme of outreach, the contact details of 910 people were obtained by the TRP. Of these, 596 completed a screening instrument that included the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ) and items assessing other negative responses. Those scoring ≥ 6 on the TSQ, or endorsing other negative responses, received a detailed clinical assessment. Individuals judged to need treatment (n= 217) received trauma-focused cognitive-behaviour therapy (TF-CBT) or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Symptom levels were assessed pre- and post-treatment with validated self-report measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, and 66 were followed up at 1 year. RESULTS: Case finding relied primarily on outreach rather than standard referral pathways such as primary care. The effect sizes achieved for treatment of DSM-IV PTSD exceeded those usually found in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and gains were well maintained an average of 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: Outreach with screening, linked to the provision of evidence-based treatment, {{seems to be a}} viable method of identifying and meeting mental health needs following a terrorist attack. Given the failure of normal care pathways, it is <b>a</b> potentially <b>important</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> merits further evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A DNA {{sequence}} can {{be described}} as a string composed of four symbols: A, T, C and G. Each symbol represents a chemically distinct nucleotide molecule. Combinations of two nucleotides are called dinucleotides and CpG islands represent regions of a DNA sequence, certain substrings, which are enriched in CpG dinucleotides (C followed by G). CpG islands represent a prominent and enigmatic feature of vertebrate genomes. They are associated with the promoters of more than 60 % of all human genes and represent a critical target for transcriptional control. Methylation of these CpG islands leads to structural changes in the DNA that stops the expression of any associated gene (genesilencing). The factors that provoke or impede methylation are currently all but unknown. In general, the maintenance of a particular pattern of methylated CpG dinucleotides represents a critical regulatory system during a host of normal developmental processes, but the erroneous methylation of CpG islands and the resulting gene-silencing can lead to the development of cancer. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised machine learning method that is capable of distinguishing biologically significant classes of CpG islands, including the separation of methylated and unmethylated CpG islands. This method represents <b>an</b> <b>important</b> novel <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> will aid in the computational prediction of methylation, which is commonly used in the pre-selection of worthwhile sequences for methylation experiments.

In a systemic model of murine {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML), tumor progression resulted in increased regulatory T cells (Treg) and elevation of program death- 1 (PD- 1) expression on CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) at the tumor site. PD- 1 knockout mice were more resistant to AML {{despite the presence of}} similar percentage of Tregs compared with wild type. In vitro, intact Treg suppression of CD 8 + T-cell responses was dependent on PD- 1 expression by T cells and Tregs and PD-L 1 expression by antigen-presenting cells. In vivo, the function of adoptively transferred AML-reactive CTLs was reduced by AML-associated Tregs. Anti–PD-L 1 monoclonal antibody treatment increased the proliferation and function of CTLs at tumor sites, reduced AML tumor burden, and resulted in long-term survivors. Treg depletion followed by PD- 1 /PD-L 1 blockade showed superior efficacy for eradication of established AML. These data demonstrated that interaction between PD- 1 and PD-L 1 can facilitate Treg-induced suppression of T-effector cells and dampen the antitumor {{immune response}}. PD- 1 /PD-L 1 blockade coupled with Treg depletion represents <b>an</b> <b>important</b> new <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> can be readily translated into the clinic to improve the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive AML-reactive CTLs in advanced AML disease...|$|R

Many studies exploited the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) syntax to extract useful service metadata for building indexes. However, a fundamental issue associated with this approach is the WSDL term tokenization. This paper proposes the application of three statistical methods for WSDL term tokenization—MDL, TP, and PPM. With the increasing need for effective IR-style Web services discovery facilities, term tokenization is of fundamental importance for properly indexing WSDL documents. We compare our applied methods with two baseline methods. The experiment suggests the superiority of MDL and PPM methods based on IR evaluation metrics. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically investigate the issue of WSDL term tokenization for Web services discovery. Our solution can benefit source coding mining, in which a key step is to tokenize names (i. e. terms) of variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. for semantic analysis. Our methods could also be used for solving Web-related string tokenization problems such as URL analysis and Web scripts comprehension...|$|E

Guanxi is a culture pattern in China and plays {{important role in}} business of Chinese context. The purpose of the thesis is to find how business network and guanxi affect on Swedish SMEs’ internationalization, especially their business with China in the cleantech industry. Based on market information from pre-study, four propositions connected with business network and guanxi are generated for Swedish SMEs in their business with China. Later, four cases are selected to match raised propositions for deeper analysis. By the theory of guanxi and business network internationalization, each proposition and case gives a specific view to analyze and understand this topic from an explorative way. Several conclusions are drawn by the analysis. First, guanxi {{plays an important role}} in network building for China market, and the native Chinese can provide great help in such a guanxi building process. Second, the business network can bring valuable information and business opportunities for Swedish SMEs in their business with China. Third, it is beneficial for Swedish cleantech SMEs to cooperate with Chinese state owned companies in their business network. Fourth, Chinese local SMEs cannot gain competitive advantage by guanxi building because the foreign competitors can copy or imitate with proper strategy to learn the skill to connect with Chinese people in the market...|$|E

Traditionally, lakes are studied as a whole system ‘from physics to fish’ and long-term monitoring programmes were initiated on this basis, some starting over a century ago. This chapter describes the long-term monitoring programme on the Cumbrian lakes, UK, how it is operated and how its scientific value is increased by combining it with additional activities. Case-studies are presented on the advances long-term research has made to testing ecological theory and understanding teleconnexions and phenology.

Finally, lake models constructed using the insights from monitoring, as well as experiments, are powerful ways to identify knowledge gaps and allow forecasts to be made of future responses to environmental change or management intervention.

40|$|In this rapidly {{changing}} world, improving {{the capacity to}} predict future dynamics of ecological systems and their services is essential for better stewardship of the earth system. Prediction relies on models that describe {{our understanding of the}} major processes that underlie system dynamics and data about these processes and the present state of ecosystems. Prediction becomes more effective when models are well informed by data. A technological revolution in the capacity to collect data now provides very different opportunities to test hypotheses and project future dynamics than when many standard statistical tests were first developed. Data assimilation is an emerging statistical approach to combine models with data in a rigorous way to constrain model parameters and system states, identify model error, and improve ecological prediction. In this paper, we illustrate how data assimilation can improve ecological prediction to support decision-making by reviewing applications of data assimilation across four different research fields: (1) emerging infectious disease, (2) fisheries, (3) fire, and (4) the terrestrial carbon cycle. Across these fields, data assimilation substantially improves prediction accuracy, highlighting its important role in enabling predictive ecology. Data assimilation with regional and global models faces major challenges, such as the large number of parameters to be estimated, high computational demands, the need to integrate multiple and heterogeneous data sets, and complex social-ecological interactions. Nevertheless, data assimilation provides <b>an</b> <b>important</b> statistical <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> has great potential to enhance the predictive capacity of ecological models in a changing climate. 16 page(s...|$|R

A high-level abstraction of sensor networks forms the distributed database view, in which query is adopted to retrieve {{data from the}} network. Continuous query is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> is commonly used for collecting real-time data. Sensor nodes have limited energy resources and their functionality continues until their energy drains. Therefore, query for sensor networks, and especially continuous query, should be wisely designed to extend the lifetime of sensors. This paper presents a query optimization method for continuous data gathering in sensor networks. The method {{is based on the}} flexible setting of thresholds and the analysis on the content to be sent over the network. Thresholds represent the accuracy requirement of the application issuing the queries. Thus at each single sensor node, instead of direct delivery of each result data, data communication is needed only when the current data is out of the range constrained by the thresholds. A series of static and dynamic algorithms are proposed for the flexible setting of threshold values. In particular, the paper studies deeply the situation where phenomena under monitoring appear a periodical feature.

40|$|In {{the world}} of {{recommender}} systems, so-called content-based methods are <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> rely {{on the availability of}} detailed product or item descriptions to drive the recommendation process. For example, recommendations can be generated for a target user by selecting unseen products that are similar to the products that the target user has liked or purchased in the past. To do this, content-based methods must be able to compute the similarity between pairs of products (unseen products and liked products, for example) and typically this is achieved by comparing product features or other descriptive elements. The approach works well when product descriptions are readily available and when they are detailed enough to afford an effective similarity comparison. But this is not always the case. Detailed product descriptions may not be available since they can be expensive to create and maintain. In this article we consider another source of product descriptions {{in the form of the}} user-generated reviews that frequently accompany products on the web. We ask whether it is possible to mine these reviews, unstructured and noisy as they are, to produce useful product descriptions that can be used in a recommendation system. In particular we describe a novel approach to product recommendation that harnesses not only the features that can be mined from user-generated reviews but also the expressions of sentiment that are associated with these features. We present a recommendation ranking strategy that combines similarity and sentiment to suggest products that are similar but superior to a query product according to the opinion of reviewers, and we demonstrate the practical benefits of this approach across a variety of Amazon product domains...|$|E

This research addresses the commitment bonds and targets of independent consultants who are not employees and therefore {{do not have an}} employing organisation. These individuals are constructed here as ‘liminal’; they are betwixt and between organisations, professions and clients, part of many but fully part of none. Semi-structured interviews and the participant drawings of 50 independent consultants were analysed thematically and the results are presented below. We establish the important foci of commitment, how they experience this commitment and then enact it in a liminal context. The main foci include other independent consultants, professional bodies and their clients, relationships with whom can be both dyadic and triadic. The reasons for committing to these foci are discussed as a fundamental understanding of commitment that is sometimes overlooked. Commitment is also discussed as a way in which formal organisations are formed for specific projects, as a way in which offers a substitute for organisational commitment and as a way of anchoring {{in the absence of an}} employing organisation in order to cope with the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in their liminal situation.

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} effects of regular, {{systematic}} and supervised activity on the cognitive functions, balance and risk of falls of elderly patients with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). Methods: Sixteen elderly patients (mean age 78. 5 +/- 6. 8 years) {{were divided into two}} groups: intervention group (IG; n= 9) and routine group (AG; n= 7). The IG exercised systematically for six months, and both groups were submitted to the following tests: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) and the agility/dynamic balance (AGIBAL) item of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AAHPFRD) test battery. Results: There was a statistically significant interaction (two-way ANOVA; F(1, 14) = 32. 07; p= 0. 01) between groups and moments for the AGIBAL. The Mann Whitney U test indicated significant differences between groups (p= 0. 03), only at the post-intervention moment for the TUG measured in steps and for BBS. Therefore, no significant intergroup differences were found for the TUG, BBS and MMSE at the pre-intervention moment or at post-intervention moment for the TUG measured in seconds and MMSE. The intragroup analysis by means of the Wilcoxon test showed a significant decline in the TUG, BBS and MMSE for the AG, but not for the IG. Spearman's coefficient showed a significant correlation between the results of the MMSE and AGIBAL.

The effectiveness of these drugs is indeed very variable and side effects, particularly severe in pediatric patients, are common and often unpredictable: {{the understanding of the}} complex gene regulation mediated by GCs could shed light on the causes of this variability. In this context, microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a new and promising field of research. miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that suppress gene expression at post-transcriptional level, and are fine-tuning regulators of diverse biological processes, including the development and function of the immune system, apoptosis, metabolism and inflammation. Emerging data have implicated the deregulated expression of certain miRNA networks in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as IBD. There is a great interest in the identification of the role of miRNAs in the modulation of pharmacological response; however, the association between miRNA and GC response in patients with IBD has not yet been evaluated in a prospective clinical study.

These and other practices have enabled ASML to develop into the technology leader in the chip lithography market. By drawing on four embedded case studies of innovation projects conducted within ASML’s supplier network, we present both the theory and the practice of ASML’s supply chain management approach. We conclude that ASML’s approach to managing its network of suppliers is notably different from approaches in less dynamic industries such as the automotive industry (Dyer and Nobeoka, 2000). The modularization of the network means that knowledge is integrated in separate projects, each involving a limited number of partners. As a consequence, ASML is able to innovate with a large number of partners without implementing numerous knowledge management mechanisms across the entire supplier network. However, this approach has its limitations. It only works when the partners in the network have high managerial and technological skilIs. Where these skilIs are absent, difficulties occur...|$|E
40|$|Treatment and {{morbidity}} {{control of}} schistosomiasis {{relies on a}} single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), and the selection of resistant worms under repeated treatment is a concern. Therefore, there is a pressing {{need to understand the}} molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. We used a custom-designed Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro assay. We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP 1 A 2 gene product, was chosen and tested. Sublethal doses of PZQ combined with OMP significantly increased worm mortality in vitro when compared with PZQ or OMP alone, thus evidencing a synergistic effect. Functional analysis of gene interaction networks is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> can point to possible novel synergistic drug candidates. We demonstrated the potential of this strategy by showing that PZQ in combination with OMP displayed increased efficiency against S. mansoni adult worms in vitro when compared with either drug alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} {{industry has been}} criticised {{for a lack of}} innovation associated with the drug discovery and development process, for example when compared with the computer or music industries. In fact, bringing a new medicine to the market requires, on average, the screening of up to 10 000 molecules, an expense in the range of 500 million- 2 billion and roughly 10 - 15 years of research. Such a situation not only has a direct impact on the health and life expectancy of every single human being on the planet, but also indicates that alternative strategies for drug development should be investigated. In this thesis, studies of direct formulation-membrane interactions, both in a high throughput (HT) manner and at a nanometre scale, were initially identified as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> could offer advantages for in vitro-in vivo correlations of in-man drug behaviours. Subsequently, supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) of physiologically-relevant lipid compositions were indicated as experimental models of preference for pre-clinical drug development. For that reason, the characterisation and assessment of physicochemical and behavioural properties of the model SLBs at a nanometre scale, as well as development of an SLB microarray for HT applications were the focus of this research. Here, the optimisation and characterisation of model lipid films was performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, the AFM-investigated assessment of the interactions between model SLBs and formulation components (e. g. Pluronics®, siRNA, DNA polyplexes) enabled both the correlation of in vitro observations with literature-reported in vivo performances of the components of interest and the development of hypotheses with regards a number of phenomena in biology. Furthermore, the development of a SLB microarray prototype suitable for HT applications is reported. Directly, this research improves: the understanding of SLB behaviours and experimental investigation at a nanometre scale of the mechanisms of interactions between membranes and: Pluronics®, nucleic acids and their complexes, as well as the technology of SLB microarray development. Indirectly, this research contributes towards the progress in a number of research areas within pharmaceutical sciences, potentially resulting in new scientific disciplines, such as immunolipidomics or nanopharmacology...|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} speculated that ‘parenting’ is an {{academic}} term to represent the reality, which is ‘families’. The suggested shift in approach from parenting to family might be useful in increasing {{the impact of the}} interventions. This recommendation stems not only from the shifting definition of who is a parent because of health, demographic and economic changes in society, but also the recognition that the immediate context of a young child consists of several key individuals who constitute a family. Also, ‘family’ as an institution is recognized across sectors, and, particularly in times of conflict and disaster, is often the only institution that is able to support the child. UNESCO’s report contained <b>an</b> <b>important</b> set of <b>approaches</b> <b>that</b> resonate even today, for example with respect to the Millennium Development Goals. The shift will allow for multiple sectors to provide a coordinated focus on the institution of ‘family’ in a cohesive manner. Family intervention programmes, although primarily from high-income countries, have been very effective in improving well-being in a service and cost-effective manner.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in maturity models in management-related disciplines; which reflects a growing recognition that becoming more mature and having a model to guide the route to maturity can help organisations in managing major transformational change. Lean Construction (LC) is <b>an</b> increasingly <b>important</b> improvement <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> organisations seek to embed. This study explores how to apply the maturity models to LC. Hence the attitudes, opinions and experiences of key industry informants with high levels of knowledge of LC were investigated. To achieve this, a review of maturity models was conducted, and data for the analysis was collected through a sequential process involving three methods. First a group interview with seven key informants. Second a follow up discussion with the same individuals to investigate some of the issues raised in more depth. Third an online discussion held via LinkedIn in which members shared their views on some of the results. Overall, we found that {{there is a lack of}} common understanding as to what maturity means in LC, though there is general agreement that the concept of maturity is a suitable one to reflect the path of evolution for LC within organisations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nigeria {{carries the}} highest burden and {{diversity}} of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in sub-Saharan Africa and is preparing to scale up its efforts to control/eliminate these diseases. To achieve this it will require a range of internal technical support and expertise for mapping, monitoring and evaluating, operational research and documenting its success. In order to begin to evaluate this potential in Nigeria, this study collated and analysed information for lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), which are currently being targeted with preventive chemotherapy through mass drug administration (MDA). Information from 299 scientific articles published on the selected NTDs in 179 journals between January 2008 and September 2013 was extracted and systematically compiled into a geo-referenced database for analysis and mapping. The highest number of articles was from the southern geo-political zones of the country. The majority of articles focused on one specific disease, and schistosomiasis and STH {{were found to have}} the highest and most wide ranging research output. The main type of study was parasitological, and the least was biotechnological. Nigerian authors were mostly affiliated with universities, and there was a wide range of international co-authors from Africa and other regions, especially the USA and UK. The majority of articles were published in journals with no known impact factor. The extensive database and series of maps on the research capacity within Nigeria produced in this study highlights the current potential that exists, and needs to be fully maximized for the control/elimination of NTDs in the country. This study provides <b>an</b> <b>important</b> model <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> can be applied to other low and middle income countries where NTDs are endemic, and NTD programmes require support from the expertise within their own country, as well as internationally, to help raise their profile and importance...|$|R
