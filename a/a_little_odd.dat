500|$|Writers Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett {{put it that}} [...] "On paper, at least, {{the premise}} seemed irresistible", yet view the {{blending}} of puppetry and live action as [...] "uneasy". Prior to his death in 2002, Unwin himself praised the off-beat nature of The Secret Service, defending the inclusion of elements such as Unwinese dialogue as [...] "an attempt to add {{a new dimension to}} the puppet field ... It was a bit bizarre, but then aren't many new ideas <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> at first?" [...] On the subject of the cancellation, he commented that the series was possibly [...] "a little bit before its time". Contrary to Peel and La Rivière, John Walsh of The Guardian challenges the idea that the gobbledegook devalued the series, arguing that [...] "British audiences quite like not understanding things." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} {{was praised}} by reviewers, especially {{in comparison to}} the single-player [...] "Story Mode". The multiplayer element was noted for appealing to a diverse demographic for its party game qualities and being an [...] "'everybody' title". Conversely, [...] "Story mode" [...] was criticised for exacerbating issues relating to pace, which was already remarked as having [...] "snail's pace". Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence involved was bemoaned for contributing an imbalance in the game, with the random availability of quality items giving players an unfair advantage. The [...] "reversal of fortune" [...] space, which initiates a minigame by which the victor would receive another player's stars or coins, was criticised for similar reasons, as it potentially penalises players who do well in the game. The minigames were mainly met with a positive reaction, with critics praising their simplicity. The grouping feature in the minigames were also welcomed for contributing a new dynamic of gameplay, although Bramwell commented that [...] "It might seem <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> to gang up with your competitors in some cases".|$|E
500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd,</b> suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E

60|$|The Canadian nodded. Then the Wellington gave another lurch, and Tom {{noticed that}} her bow gave <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> dip.|$|R
6000|$|Her colour deepened, but {{her lips}} moved into <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> smile, {{out of which}} came the words, 'Isn't that rather foolish?' ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{appearance}} of Christina Hendricks as office manager Joan, {{is said to}} have sparked a renewed interest in a voluptuous look for women and to be partly responsible for, among other things, a 10 percent increase in breast implant surgery in Britain in 2010. The nostalgia for the fashions and social norms of the early 1960s engendered by Mad Men, has been criticized by some commentators. Amy Benfer, writing in Salon, asked, [...] "But [...] isn’t it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> that a show that, among other things, warns about the dangers of seeing the past in too amber a light has spawned an industry devoted to fetishizing nostalgia for that same flawed past?" [...] Anna Kelna, in Ms. Magazine, wrote, [...] "Mad Men itself might ascribe [...] to the feminist agenda, but thanks to its pervasive impact on pop culture, the show is crafting a whole new generation of would-be Bettys (Draper's stylish wife) not Peggys (the show's ambitious “career woman”)." ...|$|E
2500|$|This film prelude {{was also}} written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, with Lanning writing the plots based on brainstormed ideas, and Abnett writing the final scripts. With art by Wellinton Alves, the issues were {{published}} on April 2 and May 28, 2014, respectively. The stories {{were intended to}} flesh out {{the history of the}} film characters based on the details in Gunn's script, while Abnett also attempted to bridge the feeling of the film with that of the original comics. Speaking on working with familiar characters, but now the film versions of them, Abnett said, [...] " [...] Fun, but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd.</b> The characters of the Prelude comics had to fit very cleanly to the movie versions so there wasn't quite the same opportunity for madcap invention...I had to make sure the tone fitted precisely." [...] Lanning said, [...] "There’s a definite distinction between the Marvel comic universe and the Marvel Cinematic universe... these characters are not so distant to their comic counterparts as to be unrecognizable, they are more like an alternate version, similar to what the Ultimate Universe did." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--carry rice. Now Russians got rice, got junk--all Won Lung's money gone up spout!" [...] And the Celestial made <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> grimace.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} he had sprawlingly {{recovered}} the hat, and made <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> bobbing bow over it, as if setting everything quite right.|$|R
6000|$|The Stork at the {{fountain}} was now singing <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> song in <b>a</b> soft, cooing voice, and as Dot listened {{she caught the}} following words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon: I've lived alone {{so much that}} it seems <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> to be told to do things, even if they are as easy and {{pleasant}} as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I {{will not take}} up your time any more," [...] he said, growing {{thoroughly}} alarmed, for really the proceedings were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd,</b> and he rose to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is quite}} an adventure, isn't it?" [...] said Diana. [...] "And isn't Miss Lavendar sweet, if she IS <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd?</b> She doesn't {{look a bit}} like an old maid." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled himself}} {{together}} {{and struggled to}} his feet. Then he looked round the room and finally into my anxious face, with <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> laugh, strained and unnatural.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only the light. It {{was such}} a moment. I don't think I saw Mr. Maddox, but I am quite certain I heard him, for he had <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> cough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] she said, {{screwing}} up her eyes, [...] "I {{have to think}} of Robert." [...] She cut the word in two, with <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> hitch in her voice--"ROB-ert." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't the money, Hugh," [...] she cried, with a vehemence which {{struck me}} as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd.</b> [...] "I {{sometimes}} think we'd {{be a great deal}} happier without--without all you are going to make." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had the {{pleasure}} of making Tom's acquaintance at one o'clock this morning," [...] I answered. [...] "But, excuse my asking it, isn't it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> for you to mix with people in their position?" ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they walked}} back to the Vicarage, Mr. Granger exultant and yet perplexed, for it struck him that there was {{something}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> about the proceeding, and Owen Davies in silence or muttering occasionally to himself.|$|E
60|$|Be this as it may, {{there is}} not much fancy {{otherwise}} stirring at Chesney Wold. If there be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> at any <b>odd</b> moment, it goes, like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> noise in that old echoing place, a long way and usually leads off to ghosts and mystery.|$|R
6000|$|Sanborn's laugh had <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> quaver. [...] "Why, {{so far as}} I know, I guess it's all right. Damn queer, though. I wish we'd {{got here}} in daytime.... But maybe that wouldn't help." ...|$|R
6000|$|But she {{was very}} much {{surprised}} to hear <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> voice cry out: [...] "Oh! I am half killed!" [...] and could not tell where it came from, because cabbages do not generally speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Jarvis, rather humbly, [...] "I am sensible, Mr Moseley, I {{was very}} wrong as regards your sister; but don't {{you think it}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> in a soldier not to fight when {{properly}} called upon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said Jessie, {{looking at}} him thoughtfully. Artists were a very {{heterogeneous}} class certainly, and geniuses had a trick of being <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd.</b> He avoided her eye and bit his grass. [...] "I don't do MUCH, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be scared, little woman," [...] he said. [...] "You'll get on {{all right}} with my aunt, I am sure. She is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> just at first, and she hates to show any feeling about anything, but she's a thundering good sort." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was very}} unhappy {{at the loss}} of her sister, and had <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> {{conversation}} with Babie, who showed her to her room, {{while the rest of the}} world made much of the bride.|$|R
60|$|Secondly. That <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> dwarf and bottle conjurer, both {{of whose}} ears, for some misdemeanor, {{have been cut}} off close to his head, has been missing for several days from the {{neighboring}} city of Bruges.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, you {{may depend}} upon it he is, or he wouldn't be so surly,' remarked Miss La Creevy, who was <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> mixture of shrewdness and simplicity. 'When a man's a bear, he is {{generally}} pretty independent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> that Miles never told {{us all about}} this, in his letters, at the time, Lucy. When young gentlemen drag young ladies out of canals, their friends at home {{have a right to}} know {{something}} of the matter." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet he felt <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd</b> when {{he first}} 'rattled the bones;' and his {{affected}} nonchalance made him constrained. He fancied every one was watching him; while, on the contrary, all were too much interested in their own different parties. This feeling, however, wore off.|$|E
60|$|She {{did not say}} {{anything}} more, which I thought <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>odd,</b> for she was generally full of mild curiosity about all strangers and sojourners in Glenboro. Presently she got up and went away from her window. Deserted even by Miss Ponsonby, I went grumpily to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think so? She's rather <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> thing," [...] {{declared}} her brother, absently surveying {{himself at}} last with {{satisfaction in the}} long pier-glass. [...] "Didn't know you'd ever seen her before. I say"--with sudden emphasis--"isn't Aggie Hamilton a jolly good-looking girl?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Dejah Thoris {{caught her}} breath at my last words, and gazed upon me with dilated eyes and {{quickening}} breath, and then, with <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>little</b> laugh, which brought roguish dimples to {{the corners of her}} mouth, {{she shook her head and}} cried: ...|$|R
50|$|Larry meets Karen {{and finds}} her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too <b>odd,</b> since she didn't board the train back in New York with him. When the train stops {{for three hours}} in Chicago, Karen manages to steal Larry's suitcase, which now {{contains}} the jacket where the medallion is hidden. Larry follows Karen and the suitcase to an address where she is supposed to meet an agent, but Karen finds the agent murdered and has to change her plans. She is instructed to continue to Los Angeles instead.|$|R
