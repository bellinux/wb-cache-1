His proposals called for a strong reduction in the importance of classical studies and the morality fostered thereby. This is manifested in his proposed changes for the civil service examination system, which went beyond the examinations to include the curricula, pedagogy, and the social and fiscal status of students and graduates.

In regard to [...] [...] [...] the classical texts, they have already been clearly explained and commented upon by previous scholars, and {{there is no need for}} our students to complicate these commentaries further[...] [...] one need only understand the meaning He denounced the emphasis placed on contemplating the meaning of such literature, spending [...] "days and months writing about them in the useless, archaic eight-legged style." ...|$|E
