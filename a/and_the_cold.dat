5|$|After reentering {{the central}} Pacific, John briefly reached a {{tertiary}} peak strength of 90 {{miles per hour}} (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, well {{to the north of}} Midway Island. However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately 1000 miles (1600 km) south of Unalaska Island.|$|E

5|$|Although lynchings and racially {{motivated}} murders {{had occurred}} throughout the South for decades, {{the circumstances surrounding}} Emmett Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention {{to the case of}} a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, the activities of the NAACP and the White Citizens' Councils, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is the reason why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E

5|$|Following this, the 15th Battalion {{moved to}} Mouquet Farm, where they {{supported}} {{an attack by}} the 14th Battalion and carried out defensive duties. They remained there until early September, when they were withdrawn back to Warloy and then to Reingheist, via Doulens. Before this occurred, on 30 August, the 15th experienced a change in command, as Cannan, who had been promoted to brigadier-general, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Terence McSharry. The remainder {{of the year was}} spent in the Ypres salient, around St Eloi and Boorlartbeek, before winter fell on the Western Front. It was the worst winter in Europe in 40 years, and the men suffered heavily from sickness <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> as they rotated through the line, conducting defensive duties and labouring before moving to Gueudecourt, and then later Lagnicourt, in the new year.|$|E
5|$|From the 1970s to {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Thayer School saw {{expansion}} into new fields such as nanotechnology and biochemical engineering, as well as collaboration with such nearby institutions as Dartmouth Medical School, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. In the early first decade of the 21st century, the core curriculum for undergraduates was revamped under Dean Lewis Duncan (1998–2004), making the school's offerings more accessible to non-major Dartmouth students. The MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), completed in 2006, was a $21million project to expand the school's classrooms and research centers.|$|E
5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can {{be at risk for}} life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many of the}} {{convective}} bands {{were already}} located over the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Dean continued to intensify until the eye made landfall. As the eye moved over Mexico {{near the town of}} Majahual in the Costa Maya area, the NHC estimated surface level winds of 175mph (280km/h), making Dean the first storm to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. At the same time, a dropsonde reading from the hurricane's eye estimated a central pressure of 905mbar, making Dean the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988) and tying Dean with Camille and Mitch as the seventh most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. The landfall itself occurred in a sparsely populated area of the Costa Maya region of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo near 18.7N 87.8W at 0900UTC August21 and brought with it a storm surge of 12–18ft (3.7–5.5m). A weather station at Chetumal (the capital of Quintana Roo, Mexico) reported 6.65in (17cm) of rainfall during Hurricane Dean's landfall. As expected, the landfall caused significant weakening of the storm; the eye filled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> cloud-tops warmed. The land severely disrupted the storm's organization, and by the time Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula it had weakened to a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained {{international}} renown for its lavish {{dinner parties}} and galas, {{often at the}} center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it {{played a significant role in}} world politics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} carry up to 20 AGM-69 SRAM nuclear {{missiles}} was added to G and H models, starting in 1971. To further improve its offensive ability, air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) were fitted. After testing of both the Air Force-backed Boeing AGM-86 and the Navy-backed General Dynamics AGM-109 Tomahawk, the AGM-86B was selected for operation by the B-52 (and ultimately by the B-1 Lancer). A total of 194 B-52Gs and Hs were modified to carry AGM-86s, carrying 12 missiles on underwing pylons, with 82 B-52Hs further modified to carry another eight missiles on a rotary launcher fitted in the bomb-bay. To conform with SALT II Treaty requirements that cruise missile-capable aircraft be readily identifiable by reconnaissance satellites, the cruise missile armed B-52Gs were modified with a distinctive wing root fairing. As all B-52Hs were assumed modified, no visual modification of these aircraft was required. In 1990, the stealthy AGM-129 ACM cruise missile entered service; although intended to replace the AGM-86, a high cost <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War's end led to only 450 being produced; unlike the AGM-86, no conventional (non-nuclear) version was built. The B-52 {{was to have been}} modified to utilize Northrop Grumman's AGM-137 TSSAM weapon; however, the missile was canceled due to development costs.|$|E

5|$|The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, {{was located}} at Kalinin, 160km (100mi) {{northwest}} of Moscow. It was worn out, {{at the end}} of a long and tenuous supply line (Model had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was a whirlwind of energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran roughshod over the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing in his wake. By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just 35km (22mi) from the Kremlin. There, the advance stopped, as the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40°C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
