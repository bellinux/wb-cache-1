5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>each</b> race {{is unique}} in its composition, no race has an innate {{advantage}} over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>each</b> {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting {{out to sea}} when resting and eating, sea otters may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>each</b> type of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types {{consists of a}} very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E
5|$|During the strike-shortened 1982 season, {{only nine}} regular season games were played, and a {{modified}} playoff format was instituted. Divisional play was ignored (there were some cases where division rivals had both games {{wiped out by}} the strike, <b>although</b> <b>each</b> division ultimately sent at least one team to the playoffs), and the top eight teams from each conference (based on W-L-T record) were advanced to the playoffs. As a result, this became {{the first time that}} teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs: the 4–5 Cleveland Browns and the 4–5 Detroit Lions.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s South Stoneham House was {{merged into}} the Wessex Lane Halls complex of residences, <b>although</b> <b>each</b> {{individual}} hall maintained an individual character.

5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, <b>although</b> <b>each</b> {{outrigger}} landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot on {{location}} over 24 days in Los Angeles, {{with a budget}} of $8 million. It was filmed by cinematographer Xavier Pérez Grobet, with whom Holofcener had previously worked on the HBO television series Enlightened. <b>Although</b> <b>each</b> scene was scripted, the actors would often ad-lib lines of dialogue. The final scene of the film, in which Eva and Albert reunite {{in front of his}} house, was improvised by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini. It was edited by Robert Frazen, Holofcener's boyfriend at the time, who had also worked on all four of her previous films.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone: they are {{generally}} known as the Theban plays, <b>although</b> <b>each</b> play was actually {{a part of a}} different tetralogy, the other members of which are now lost. Sophocles influenced the development of drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot. He also developed his characters {{to a greater extent than}} earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{is a long}} polymer {{made from}} repeating units called nucleotides. The {{structure}} of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops, and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled round the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34ångströms (3.4nanometres). The pair of chains has a radius of 10ångströms (1.0nanometre). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3Å (0.33nm) long. <b>Although</b> <b>each</b> individual nucleotide repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions to {{hundreds of millions of}} nucleotides. For instance, the DNA in the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85mm long if straightened.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September the {{regional}} commands {{were replaced by}} six operational zones, headquartered in Osijek, Bjelovar, Zagreb, Karlovac, Rijeka and Split. The zones possessed uneven strength; those in Slavonia and Dalmatia were heavily equipped, and the Zagreb zone had twice the average troop strength. After capturing a stockpile of weapons during the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded to 60 reserve brigades and independent battalions {{by the end of}} October (in addition to the four all-professional guards brigades). <b>Although</b> <b>each</b> brigade was planned to have 1,800 troops, in reality their size varied from 500 to 2,500. Three named special-forces battalions were also established within the ZNG (in addition to the Zrinski Battalion): the Frankopan, Kralj Tomislav and Matija Vlačić Battalions.|$|E

5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, <b>although</b> <b>each</b> species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with Corsican pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. <b>Although</b> <b>each</b> borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|The Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings {{are used}} to {{determine}} the qualification of the players for the tournament. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, each singles tournament had 38 competitors, while each doubles tournament had 16 pairs. All players or pairs from the top 16 places on the BWF rankings automatically qualify, <b>although</b> <b>each</b> National Olympic Committee (NOC) can send less than three players or pairs in each tournament. The top 64 then qualify with the caveat that each NOC can send only two players/pairs from that portion of the list. Players and pairs ranked below the 64th place only qualify if they are the highest-ranked competitor from their nation. Two places each in the men's and women's singles will be determined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Tripartite Commission. The host nation, if it has not already qualified two competitors, receives at least either two singles players or one pair. The rules used in the tournament are the same as the BWF rules.|$|E

5|$|Trinidad and Tobago {{submitted}} {{a team to}} participate in the 4×100meters relay. <b>Although</b> <b>each</b> relay consists of four people, five Trinidadians were involved between both the first and second (final) round. During the first round, Trinidad and Tobago participated in the first heat, which consisted of then 20-year-old Port-of-Spain-born Keston Bledman, who only participated in the relay; Marc Burns, who also participated in the men's 100meters; Richard Thompson, who also medaled in the men's 100meters; and Aaron Armstrong, who also ran in the men's 200meters. The relay ran the collective 400meters in 38.26 seconds, placing first in the first heat during the August 21 semifinal (and first) round. Trinidad and Tobago defeated Japan, which placed second in the heat (at 38.52seconds) and the Netherlands, which placed third (38.87seconds). The Trinidadian team placed first overall out of the ten relays that finished, and progressed to the August 22 final round.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{editor of}} the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were {{regularly}} harassed {{by the police and}} Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting, <b>although</b> <b>each</b> time he was acquitted. Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in Prussia collapsed and the king, Frederick William IV, introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country. Consequently, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May. Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a cholera epidemic and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, {{the balance}} of power within English {{football}} began to change. The first national competition, the FA Cup, had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds, such as Wanderers and Old Etonians. However the 1883 FA Cup Final saw the first victory by a working-class team, Blackburn Olympic. At this time professionalism was not permitted. Clubs from urban areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice, but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed. Though not initially an advocate of professionalism, McGregor came to favour its introduction. By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs, predominantly from Lancashire, announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted. An emergency FA conference was called in response. Representing Aston Villa, McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism, the only delegate from the Midlands to do so, {{and was one of the}} few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players. Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents, such as Preston North End's William Sudell, McGregor was well respected. The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism, <b>although</b> <b>each</b> club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived for at least two years within six miles of its home stadium.|$|E
