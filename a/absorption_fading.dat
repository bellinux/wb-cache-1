The escape fraction of H-ionizing photons must be close to 100 percent for the observed sample of LBGs.

A galaxy-dominated UV background appears inconsistent with the observed HeII/HI opacity ratio at z= 2. 4, but might be able to explain the SiIV/CIV abundances measured at z> 3 in absorption spectra. A scenario may be emerging where star-forming galaxies reionized intergalactic hydrogen at $z> 6 $ and dominate the 1 Ryd metagalactic flux at z> 3, with quasi-stellar sources taking over at low redshifts. If the large amplitude of the H-ionizing flux estimated by Steidel etal is correct, hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation in the IGM require a baryon density (to explain the observed Lyalpha opacity in absorption spectra) which is similar to or larger than that favoured by recent CMB experiments, and is inconsistent with standard nucleosynthesis values.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{implications}} of a stellar-dominated UV background at high redshifts for the star formation history of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The composite spectrum of 29 LBGs evaluated by Steidel et al. (2000) at 〈z 〉 = 3. 4 can be well fit by a stellar population with ongoing star formation, a Salpeter initial mass function, modest or negligible dust reddening, and no intrinsic H I photoelectric <b>absorption.</b> <b>Fading</b> starbursts in which star formation has ceased for 10 7 yr or more cannot reproduce the observed flux shortward of 1 Ryd. The small H I optical depth in LBGs suggests that the neutral gas from which stars form is most likely contained in compact clouds of neutral gas with small covering factor. The escape fraction of H-ionizing photons must be close to 100 percent for the observed sample of LBGs. The spectrum of ionizing photons produced by a stellar population with ongoing star formation {{is similar to that}} of QSOs between 1 and 3 Ryd, but becomes softer between 3 and 4 Ryd and drops sharply shortward of 4 Ryd. A galaxy-dominated UV background appears inconsistent with the observed He II /H I opacity ratio at z = 2. 4, but might be able to explain the Si IV/C IV abundances measured at z> 3 in quasar absorption spectra. A scenario may be emerging where star-forming galaxies reionized intergalactic hydrogen at z> 6 and dominate the 1 Ryd metagalactic flux at z> 3, with quasi-stellar sources taking over at lower redshifts. If the large amplitude of the H-ionizing flux estimated by Steidel et al. is correct, hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation in the IGM within the cold dark matter paradigm require a baryon density (to explain the observed opacity of the Lyα forest in quasar absorption spectra) which is similar to or larger than that favoured by recent CMB experiments, and is inconsistent with standard nucleosynthesis values.

5000|$|Character {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} the press. The Skinny {{wrote that the}} album [...] "has a pronounced transportive power, its affecting serenity capable of sparking {{the same kind of}} meditative introspection in the listener as that which reportedly drove its creation", but added that [...] "after a while, the textures blur and the willing sense of <b>absorption</b> <b>fades</b> into distraction, with tracks too similar in sound for all to possess their own distinct tenor. While it lasts, however, the spell cast is strongly felt, and therefore worth seeking exposure to". The Headphone Commute wrote [...] "The soundscape of Character is minor in chord progression, major in cinematic undertones, and neutral in acceptance of things as they are. There is a certain meditative aspect to the music, which at times rejects its nature and picks up in pace, only to stop chasing, catching its breath, and subsiding again. The pieces become a soundtrack to our daily trepidation, perhaps in facing the fictitious story that we live".The album received praise from AllMusic, who wrote [...] "Character may not carry the blissed-out expressions Kent's earlier records did. But it is here that she speaks most poignantly of loneliness, fear, desire, life's richness, and more -- by creating a listening experience of nearly cavernous depth and poetic beauty".|$|R
50|$|The above factors {{contribute}} to the measurement uncertainty of the results obtained with UV/Vis spectrophotometry. If UV/Vis spectrophotometry is used in quantitative chemical analysis then the results are additionally affected by uncertainty sources arising from {{the nature of the}} compounds and/or solutions that are measured. These include spectral interferences caused by <b>absorption</b> band overlap, <b>fading</b> of the color of the absorbing species (caused by decomposition or reaction) and possible composition mismatch between the sample and the calibration solution.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Spiropyrans {{are among}} the most {{promising}} organic photochromic dyes. However, spiropyrans are very sensitive dyes and there are many independent factors that can affect the performance of these dyes. The effect of substituent on the optical <b>absorption</b> spectra, <b>fading</b> kinetic, and also the dye stability of spiropyrans in diphenyl ether by UV irradiation has been investigated. The 6 -nitro BIPS displayed greater absorbance intensity of 0. 740 % at 600 nm compared to 8 -ethoxy- 6 -nitro BIPS of 0. 651 % at 620 nm. Furthermore, 6 -nitro BIPS is less stable as it has higher rate constant of 0. 1003 s- 1 and thus lower half-life time (50 % decay of the photochromic effect) of 6. 9 s, in contrast to 8 -ethoxy- 6 -nitro BIPS of 0. 0594 s- 1 and 11. 7 s respectively...|$|R

The International Telecommunication Union Radio Propagation Recommendation (ITU-RP 676, 2012) data bank {{was used for the}} computation of gaseous attenuation for West Africa. Monthly and yearly mean of temperature, pressure and relative humidity were used as input parameters obtained from ITU-R study group 3 data base. The results presented on contour map show that total atmospheric <b>absorption</b> signal <b>fade</b> attenuation values at C, Ku, Ka and V bands is between 0. 015 to 0. 09 dB, 0. 04 to 0. 9 dB, 0. 04 to 1. 4 dB and 0. 2 to 3. 2 dB respectively for both uplink and downlink frequencies. Generally, consistent signal absorption due to Oxygen and water vapour are higher in the western region than southern part of West Africa...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we derive {{fundamental}} performance {{limits of}} underwater (UW) networks via {{an analysis of}} the average behavior of random deployments. In particular, we consider an UW network that consists of a Poisson point process of transmitters, each with a receiver at a given distance. The link channel model accounts for path-loss, frequency-dependent <b>absorption,</b> and Rayleigh <b>fading.</b> We evaluate the probability of a successful transmission, defined as the probability that the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio at the typical receiver is greater than a predetermined threshold, over different network and channel realizations. We then determine the network throughput density and the transmission capacity, defined as the maximum throughput density such that a constraint on the success probability is satisfied. The dependence of these metrics on the operating frequency and other system parameters is quantified through the proposed framework...|$|R
40|$|Denim garment is {{the most}} {{preferred}} of today’s youth. This paper presents the effect of enzyme wash using cellulase enzyme on the properties of denim garments to develop novel design and fashion. Three parameters in enzyme washing namely concentration of enzyme, washing temperature and time at pH 5. 5 were considered. To investigate the optimum washing condition, indigo dyed cotton denim garments (trousers) were chosen and processed by enzyme with the concentration of 0. 5 % to 3. 5 %, temperature 40 °C to 70 °C and time 20 min to 60 min for the achievement with desired worn and aged effect. The effect of each parameter is discussed, and denim garment’s properties like tensile strength, elongation at break, weight loss, stiffness, water <b>absorption,</b> shrinkage, color <b>fading</b> and morphological values by SEM were evaluated. The optimized washing condition for the best value is 2 % enzyme concentration at 55 °C for 40 min...|$|R
30|$|Denim garment {{was treated}} with {{cellulase}} enzyme by varying the process parameters, namely concentration of enzyme, washing temperature and time to develop novel design and fashion. The effect of process parameters on the physical and mechanical properties of cotton denim garment was investigated and denim fabric properties like tensile strength, elongation at break, weight loss, stiffness, water <b>absorption,</b> shrinkage, color <b>fading</b> and morphological values by SEM were discussed. To obtain the desired fashion effect in terms of color fading, comfort ability in terms of reducing the stiffness of denim and high wear performance in terms of longevity/minimum tensile strength losses of denim, indigo dyed denim garment (trousers, 100 % cotton with twill weave 3 / 1 construction) had been chosen and processed with the enzyme concentration of 0.5 % to 3.5 %, treatment temperature from 40 °C to 70 °C and treatment time from 20  min to 60  min. The process parameters were optimized and the optimized washing condition for the best value is 2 % enzyme concentration at 55 °C for 40  min.|$|R
40|$|Functional {{variability}} of {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) from the surface water of Esthwaite Water (N. England) was investigated using a series of 12 standardised assays, which provide quantitative information on light <b>absorption,</b> fluorescence, photochemical <b>fading,</b> pH buffering, copper binding, benzo(a) pyrene binding, hydrophilicity, and adsorption to alumina. Ten lakewater samples were collected {{at different times of}} year during 2003 – 2005, and DOM concentrates obtained by low-temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid was used as a quality control standard. For nine of the assays, variability among DOM samples was significantly (p< 0. 01) greater than could be explained by analytical error. Seasonal trends observed for six of the assays could be explained by a simple mixing model in which the two end-members were DOM from the catchment (allochthonous) and DOM produced within the lake (autochthonous). The fraction of autochthonous DOM predicted by the model is significantly correlated (p< 0. 01) with chlorophyll concentration, consistent with production from phytoplankton. Autochthonous DOM is less light-absorbing, less fluorescent, more hydrophilic, and possesses fewer proton-dissociating groups, than allochthonous material...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} the end-to-end {{bit error rate}} (BER) of point-to-point underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems with multi-hop transmission. To do so, we analytically derive the BER expression of a single-hop UWOC link as the building block for end-to-end BER evaluation. We also apply photon-counting method to {{evaluate the}} system BER {{in the presence of}} shot noise. Moreover, we use Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula to obtain the closed-form solutions for the system BER in the case of log-normal underwater fading channels. Our analytical treatment involves all the impairing effects of the underwater optical channel, namely <b>absorption,</b> scattering and <b>fading.</b> Numerical results demonstrate that multi-hop transmission by alleviating the aforementioned impairing effects of the channel, can significantly improve the system performance and extend the viable end-to-end communication distance. For example, dual-hop transmission in $ 22. 5 $ m and $ 45 $ m coastal water links can provide $ 17. 5 $ dB and $ 39 $ dB performance enhancement at the BER of $ 10 ^{- 6 }$, respectively...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} UV, optical, X-ray, and radio {{properties}} of the Type IIb SN 2008 ax discovered in NGC 4490. The observations in the UV {{are one of the}} earliest of a Type IIb supernova (SN). On approximately day 4 after the explosion, a dramatic upturn in the u and uvw 1 (λ_c = 2600 Å) light curves occurred after an initial rapid decline which is attributed to adiabatic cooling after the initial shock breakout. This rapid decline and upturn is reminiscent of the Type IIb SN 1993 J on day 6 after the explosion. Optical/near-IR spectra taken around the peak reveal prominent Hα, He I, and Ca II <b>absorption</b> lines. A <b>fading</b> X-ray source is also located at the position of SN 2008 ax, implying an interaction of the SN shock with the surrounding circumstellar material and a mass-loss rate of the progenitor of M (overdot) = (9 ± 3) × 10 ^(− 6) M_☉ yr^(− 1). The unusual time evolution (14 days) of the 6 cm peak radio luminosity provides further evidence that the mass-loss rate is low. Combining the UV, optical, X-ray, and radio data with models of helium exploding stars implies the progenitor of SN 2008 ax was an unmixed star in an interacting binary. Modeling of the SN light curve suggests a kinetic energy (E_k) of 0. 5 × 10 ^(51) erg, an ejecta mass (M_(ej)) of 2. 9 M_☉, and a nickel mass (M_(Ni)) of 0. 06 M_☉...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of 6 -aryl-, 5 -aryl- and 5, 6 -diaryl- substituents upon the photochromic properties [A-max and fading kinetics (tv,) ] of 3, 3 -diaryl- 3 H- naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans. 1 -Aryl- 3 -methoxynaphthalenes, prepared by cross-coupling of arylboronic acids or esters with 3 -methoxy- 1 -(trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy) naphthalene, were demethylated to provide a series of 4 -aryl- 2 -naphthols. The latter were subjected to acid-catalysed condensation with 1, l-diarylprop-z-yn-l-ols providing a novel series of 3, 3, 6 -triaryl- 3 H-naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans. Electron rich 6 -aryl substituents provided hypsochromicaIly shifted absorption maxima and slower fading kinetics whereas, electron deficient 6 -aryl substituents induced bathochromicaIly shifted <b>absorptions</b> and fast <b>fading</b> kinetics compared to-the unsubstituted naphthopyran derivative. A series of 2 -aryl- 3 - methoxynaphthalenes, prepared by cross-coupling of aryl halides with 3 -methoxynaphthalene- 2 - boronic acid or, by complementary cross-coupling of arylboronic acids with 2 -bromo- 3 - methoxynaphthalene, were demethylated to afford the corresponding 3 -aryl- 2 -naphthols from which a novel range of 3, 3, 5 -triaryl- 3 H-naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans were prepared. Similar trends were observed for the changes in Amax as noted for the 3, 3, 6 -triaryl series. However, whilst Amax did not change significantly, the fading kinetics (tv,) showed dramatic differences. The 5 -aryl series exhibited much larger ty, values, generally by a factor of two, than those of the 6 -aryl series. A range of 3, 4 -diaryl- 2 - naphthols was prepared by two routes that involved: (i) palladium-catalysed cycloaddition of diarylacetylenes to (o-boronatophenyl) acetic esters or, (ii) functionalisation of 2 -methoxynaphthalene or 2, 3 -dihydroxynaphthalene to provide a new and versatile entry to unsymmetrically substituted 3, 4 - diaryl- 2 -naphthols. A series of novel 3, 3, 5, 6 -tetraaryl- 3 H-naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans has been prepared. Symmetrical 5, 6 -diarylnaphthopyrans containing either electron rich or electron deficient aryl groups exhibited similar spectrokinetic trends to the 3, 3, 5 - and 3, 3, 6 -triarylnaphthopyrans. Unsymmetrical 5, 6 -diarylnaphthopyrans also exhibited similar trends in ~nax but had larger tv, valuescompared to that of their 'monoaryl' counterparts. Two examples of 5, 6 -bis(2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -thienyl) - 3, 3 -diaryl- 3 H- naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans which represent a novel type of multi-addressable T - and P-type photochromic system have been prepared. These systems contain a dithienylethene motif embedded within the naphthopyran nucleus. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
