5|$|As he was {{preparing}} to begin post-graduate studies in orthodontics <b>at</b> <b>Loyola</b> University in Chicago, Cannon {{received a call from}} Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram. Stram signed Cannon to a one-year contract and he played in six games for the Chiefs in 1970, catching two touchdowns before a season-ending injury convinced him to retire. He ended his eleven-year professional career with 2,455 yards rushing, 3,656 receiving yards, and 64 touchdowns on offense. He also threw one touchdown pass and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon holds the NFL record for the most yards from scrimmage in a non-overtime game (330 against the New York Titans in 1961) and is tied with four other players for the most touchdown receptions by a running back in a season (nine in 1961).|$|E

Mirkin grew up in Philadelphia and intended to become an electrical engineer, but abandoned this career path in favor of studying film <b>at</b> <b>Loyola</b> Marymount University. After graduating, he became a stand-up comedian, and then moved into television writing. He wrote for the sitcoms Three's Company, It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Larry Sanders Show and served as showrunner on the series Newhart. After an unsuccessful attempt to remake the British series The Young Ones, Mirkin created Get a Life in 1990.

Venues <b>at</b> <b>Loyola</b> University Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago State University, Northern Illinois University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, among others, were also available and had been mentioned in early news reports as possibilities. Northerly Island and the lakefront along Lake Michigan would have hosted all beach and water events. The McCormick Place convention center, the second largest in the world, was the planned venue for indoor events like judo and weightlifting, as well as hosting all press offices, while Archery and the medals podium were slated for Grant Park.|$|E

Peterson, inspired by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event. At the 1984 Nationals, 32 states as well as Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea fielded teams. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, only a handful of international schools have competed.|$|E

5|$|Aidoo was a multi-sport athlete at St. Ignatius of Loyola High School, playing Canadian football, soccer, {{track and}} field, and basketball. With {{the track and}} field team, he was twice named most {{valuable}} player, participating in events including the 110 metres hurdles, shot put, and javelin. Aidoo played on the Loyola Hawks football team from 1995 to 1997, and he ruptured his spleen during a playoff game in 1996. Despite this, Aidoo increasingly focused on football, eventually leaving the track and field team in his final year. In 1997, he played for the Oakville-Burlington Invictas of the Great Lakes Football League, a junior football league. Aidoo {{played a major role}} on the Invictas, including rushing for 165 yards and two touchdowns on only 11 carries against the Essex Ravens.

5|$|In April 1982, {{the first}} Nationals was held <b>at</b> <b>Loyola</b> Marymount University in California—16 {{states and the}} District of Columbia participated. However, the competition's founder, Dr. Robert Peterson, was {{inspired}} by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event, and so at the 1984 Nationals, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand fielded teams in addition to teams from 32 U.S. states. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, {{no more than a few}} teams a year have competed at Nationals. Since the first national event in 1982, only three states have ever won the National Competition: California, Texas, and Wisconsin, with California having won the majority of the National Competitions. El Camino Real High School from California currently holds the record for the most wins, having won its sixth national title in 2010. The current National Champion is Granada Hills Charter High School from Granada Hills, California.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Bruges, Belgium, and raised in France. His father, Tony Parker Sr., an African American, played {{basketball}} <b>at</b> <b>Loyola</b> University Chicago as well as professionally overseas. His mother, Pamela Firestone, is a Dutch model. Parker's great-uncle Jan Wienese is an Olympic gold medalist in rowing. Parker enjoyed close relationships with his brothers, and they would often attend their father's basketball games together. At first, Parker {{was more interested in}} football, but after watching the evolution of Michael Jordan into a global basketball superstar during summer trips to his father's native city of Chicago, he changed his mind. Parker's two younger brothers were also heavily involved in basketball; T.J. and Pierre would go on to play basketball at college and professional levels. As Parker built his skill, he played the point guard position, recognizing that his speed and agility made this position ideal for him. He was eventually asked to attend the INSEP in Paris. After playing in the French amateur leagues for two seasons, Parker turned professional and signed with Paris Basket Racing in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Vikram {{began his}} {{professional}} career by modelling in advert films for brands including Chola Tea, TVS Excel and Alwyn watches {{as well as}} appearing in a six episode television serial titled Galatta Kudumbam which aired between November and December 1988. During {{the final year of}} his M.B.A programme <b>at</b> <b>Loyola</b> College, he was recognised by the film industry, with veteran director C. V. Sridhar approaching him for a lead role in a film. Vikram made his film debut in 1990 by appearing in En Kadhal Kanmani, a small budget love story featuring him alongside Rekha Nambiar, with Sridhar's Thanthu Vitten Ennai opposite Rohini being his next release. He then signed on {{to be a part of}} cinematographer P. C. Sriram's college love story, Meera with high expectations, however the three films failed to launch his career. His appearances in Meera and in Kaaval Geetham, with another veteran director S. P. Muthuraman, helped him secure film offers from the Malayalam and Telugu film industries. In 1993, he almost signed on to appear in Mani Ratnam's Bombay and featured in the initial photo shoot alongside Manisha Koirala. However Mani Ratnam wanted Vikram to remove his beard for the role, and Vikram could not do so due to continuity problems with another film he had signed and hence was dropped from the project.|$|E
