40|$|Abstract—We {{investigated}} the largest Lyapunov exponents (LLEs) of finger plethysmogram (FPG) {{and heart rate}} (HR) under anxiety, fear and relief states and compared each measured LLEs with the HR. We devised a task in which the participants experienced the emotions of anxiety, fear, and relief. FPG and HR were recorded during <b>the</b> task, <b>and</b> chaos analysis was applied to FPG to calculate the LLEs. Our results showed significant positive correlations between the LLEs <b>of</b> FPG <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> anxiety <b>and</b> fear.

40|$|In this paper, we {{characterize}} the information-theoretic capacity scaling of wireless ad hoc networks with n randomly distributed nodes. By using an exact channel model from Maxwell's equations, we successfully resolve {{the conflict in}} the literature between the linear capacity scaling by Özgür et al. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom limit given as the ratio of <b>the</b> network diameter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wavelength λ by Franceschetti et al. In dense networks where the network area is fixed, the capacity scaling is given as the minimum <b>of</b> n <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom limit λ^- 1 to within an arbitrarily small exponent. In extended networks where the network area is linear in n, the capacity scaling is given as the minimum <b>of</b> n <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom limit √(n) λ^- 1 to within an arbitrarily small exponent. Hence, we recover the linear capacity scaling by Özgür et al. if λ=O(n^- 1) in dense networks and if λ=O(n^- 1 / 2) in extended networks. Otherwise, the capacity scaling is given as <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom limit characterized by Franceschetti et al. For achievability, a modified hierarchical cooperation is proposed based on a lower bound on the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output channel between two node clusters using our channel model.

The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|No {{subspecies}} are recognised, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> geographic {{variation is}} unclear. Adult male birds which breed {{on the mainland}} have been reported as having lighter upperparts and underparts than their Tasmanian relatives, and females {{are said to be}} browner, but these differences may also result from worn plumage. Furthermore, migration across the Bass Strait by some birds obfuscates the issue. Mainland and Tasmanian birds are the same size. Ornithologists Richard Schodde and Ian Mason argued that the poor quality of museum collections and partially migratory habits meant that discrete subspecies could not be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} observed variation within the species.|$|E

5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{soon began}} {{to come to a}} head. Austria had {{solidified}} its control over Lombardy-Venice and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis' daughter Marie Louise. On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at war with Murat's Naples. Austria won the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May and captured Naples less than three weeks later. Metternich then was able to delay a decision {{on the future of the}} country until after Vienna. Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June, when a joint Austrian-Prussian proposition was ratified. It left most constitutional issues to the new diet; its President would be the Emperor Francis himself. Despite criticism from within Austria, Metternich was pleased with the outcome <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> control it granted Habsburgs, and, through them, himself. Certainly, Metternich was able to use the diet to his own ends on numerous occasions. The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives. A summation treaty was signed on 19 June (the Russians signed a week later), bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end. Metternich himself had left on 13 June for the front line, prepared for a lengthy war against Napoleon. Napoleon, however, was defeated decisively at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June.|$|E
