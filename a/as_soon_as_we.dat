In the example we considered above, it's {{easy to see that}} the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E

25|$|On August 6 and August 7, the Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited Dubrovnik, {{which was}} {{followed}} by fires in that area. It prompted some county officials to make arson accusations against {{the nearby town of}} Trebinje in the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mario Magud, the firefighting commander in Konavle, said: There are no firemen on the Trebinje side. Everything indicates that they set the fire themselves with the intention to burn Konavle and beyond. It's not a coincidence that, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> localize one fire, a new fire breaks out.. Luka Korda, the chief of Konavle municipality, made similar accusations. The Bosnian civil defense secretary Stanko Slišković said it was not true that the Bosnian firemen did not do anything to prevent fires in the border area near Dubrovnik: Our people made the greatest effort to fight every fire where it was possible. Nobody can say with certainty where a fire started... I'm sorry this happened and I understand the indignation of the citizens of Dubrovnik, but it's not our fault. He claimed that the Bosnian civil defense cooperated well with their Croatian counterparts and said that the Bosnian forces could not fight the fires in the inaccessible or mined areas.|$|E

500|$|As {{chair of}} the McGovern–Fraser Commission in 1969–70, McGovern instituted major changes in Democratic party rules that {{continue}} to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well, with large institutional {{changes taking place in}} both. Among those was the centralization of decisions about the nominating process at the national party level, rather than with the states. His 1972 campaign fundamentally altered how presidential primary campaigns were waged. Within the Democratic Party, power shifted from the New Deal coalition to younger, more affluent, issue-oriented activists; the women's movement and gay rights movement found a place; skepticism about military buildups and foreign interventions took hold; and the 1960s [...] "New Politics" [...] found its culmination in McGovern's nomination. In turn, the overwhelming defeat of McGovern in the general election led to the liberal wing of the party's being stigmatized for decades to come and a turn in the party towards centrist directions. McGovern himself recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, [...] "We made a serious effort to open the doors of the Democratic Party – and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> did, half the Democrats walked out." [...] SUNY Albany political scientist Bruce Miroff wrote in 2007 that the McGovern campaign was the last time in presidential politics that liberals had [...] "their chance to speak of their goals with enthusiasm and their dreams with fire... Yet almost at the instant that the insurgents successfully stormed the heights of American politics, they found themselves on the brink of one of the worst free falls on record." ...|$|E

Following her cover of [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] in 1974, seventh track [...] "You and I" [...] is Streisand's second cover of a Stevie Wonder song. Taken from his 1972 studio album Talking Book, she called the pop song [...] "immediately [...] touch" [...] and considered Wonder [...] "brilliant" [...] for his work on it. Written by Howard Dietz and Ralph Rainger, Streisand's cover of Libby Holman's [...] "Moanin' Low" [...] appears as the eighth song. In order to place focus on the lyrics during the song, the production contains [...] "octave leaps" [...] while Streisand [...] "changes timbre frequently and quickly between loud and soft sections and high and low pitches".
