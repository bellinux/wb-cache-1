5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E

5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E

25|$|The natural {{approach}} is a language teaching method developed by Stephen Krashen and Tracy D. Terrell. They emphasise the learner receiving large amounts of comprehensible input.

25|$|His new <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{seen in the}} Rime of 1602, later {{expanded}} {{under the}} title La lira (The Lyre) in 1614, which {{is made up of}} erotic verse, encomiastic and sacred pieces, arranged either by theme (sea poems, rustic poems, love poems, funereal poems, religious poems) or by verse form (madrigal, canzone).|$|E
25|$|A {{more fully}} Bayesian {{approach}} to parameters {{is to treat}} parameters as additional unobserved variables and to compute a full posterior distribution over all nodes conditional upon observed data, then to integrate out the parameters. This <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> expensive and lead to large dimension models, so in practice classical parameter-setting approaches are more common.|$|E

25|$|It has {{recently}} been suggested that the Wigner function <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> viewed as a quantum analogy to the operatorial formulation of classical mechanics introduced in 1932 by Bernard Koopman and John von Neumann: the time evolution of the Wigner function approaches, in the limit ħ → 0, the time evolution of the Koopman–von Neumann wavefunction of a classical particle.|$|E
25|$|The above <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{performed}} at many sections containing the PETM. This {{has led to}} an intriguing result. At some locations (mostly deep-marine), sedimentation rates must have decreased across the PETM, presumably because of carbonate dissolution on the seafloor; at other locations (mostly shallow-marine), sedimentation rates must have increased across the PETM, presumably because of enhanced delivery of riverine material during the event.|$|E
25|$|The goal is {{to allow}} market {{mechanisms}} to drive industrial and commercial processes {{in the direction of}} low emissions or less carbon intensive approaches than those used when there is no cost to emitting carbon dioxide and other GHGs into the atmosphere.

30|$|There is {{a strong}} need to develop both {{acquisition}} and processing tools that are specifically adapted to low-dose and high-speed ET and for STEM-based techniques in particular.

25|$|Forecasting {{the life}} {{expectancy}} directly, generally using ARIMA or other time series extrapolation procedures: that {{has the advantage of}} simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results.

25|$|Multi-scale {{approach}} is a multiple resolution approach in vessel segmentation. At low resolution, large-diameter vessels can first be extracted. By increasing resolution, smaller branches from the large vessels can be easily recognized. Therefore, one advantage of using this technique is the increased analytical speed. Additionally, this <b>approach</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used with 3D images. The surface representation is a surface normal to the curvature of the vessels, allowing the detection of abnormalities on vessel surface.|$|E
25|$|As an approach, BPM sees {{processes}} as important assets {{of an organization}} that must be understood, managed, and developed to announce and deliver value-added products and services to clients or customers.
