5|$|Before {{the end of}} the war, {{architect}} Charles Holden drew up {{plans to}} redevelop the city centre, but locals were so opposed that the Citizens' Defence Association was formed <b>and</b> <b>swept</b> to power in the 1945 municipal elections. Rebuilding of the city centre eventually began 10years after the war. A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre, which was later pedestrianised. The biggest expansion of the city occurred in the 1960s, {{with the arrival of the}} University of Kent at Canterbury and Christ Church College.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{successful}} contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design {{evolved from a}} straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines <b>and</b> <b>swept</b> wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become {{commonly referred to as}} the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker).|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 49 BC, the {{hardened}} legions of Caesar crossed the river Rubicon, the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, <b>and</b> <b>swept</b> down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Afterwards Caesar {{turned his attention to}} the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.|$|E

5|$|From Aquileia, Alboin {{took the}} Via Postumia <b>and</b> <b>swept</b> through Venetia, taking in rapid {{succession}} Tarvisium (Treviso), Vicentia (Vicenza), Verona, Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking Opitergium (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns closer to the coast on the Via Annia, such as Altinum, Patavium (Padova), Mons Silicis (Monselice), Mantua and Cremona. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as Torcello and Heraclia.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 Cochet {{retained}} the Carlton L.T.C. doubles with Brugnon. In March he defeated George Lyttleton-Rogers {{for his third}} Monaco Cup crown.

In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy <b>and</b> <b>swept</b> across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.|$|E

A third {{member of the}} group raised the alarm by mobile telephone by 14:05 (GMT), less than five minutes after Shaw had been swept away, and Devon and Cornwall Police, a Royal Navy helicopter and the Dartmoor Rescue Group were mobilised to search for Shaw. Believing that the weather conditions may be too bad for the helicopter to fly, members of the Dartmoor Rescue Group—a volunteer organisation which co-ordinates the four separate charities who undertake search and rescue operations on Dartmoor—set out on foot in an attempt to reach the scene of the accident.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{in the way}} of Okabe's advance was A Company of the 2/6th Infantry Battalion under Captain W. H. Sherlock. Okabe {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Sherlock's {{position}} on 28 January. Sherlock was forced from his position and retreated onto a nearby spur. For much of the afternoon, frontal Japanese attacks were repelled by Australian mortar and machine gun fire, and efforts to infiltrate Sherlock's positions were defeated by a bayonet attack led by Sherlock in person. By 18:00, Sherlock's mortar ammunition had run out and his small arms ammunition was running short, while his position was being plastered with mortar rounds <b>and</b> <b>swept</b> by machine gun fire. Sherlock held on through the night and was killed the next day trying to break through the Japanese lines. For his actions, Sherlock was posthumously mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Transport {{suffered}} severely: several main roads, including {{part of the}} Trans-Canada Highway and Nova Scotia Highway 102, {{in northeastern}} Nova Scotia received flood damage and were temporarily blocked off. Additionally, the rising waters washed out several bridges in the region <b>and</b> <b>swept</b> away automobiles. Railways were covered by water, forcing trains to suspend their operation. Drinking water in Dartmouth was contaminated due to excessive runoff into Lake Antigonish, and a trailer park in Antigonish flooded, prompting 600 residents to evacuate. Overall monetary damage from Beth is estimated at between $3.5 million and $5.1 million USD. One person was indirectly killed by the hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rain.|$|E
