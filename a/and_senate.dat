5|$|The C-SPAN network's core {{programming}} is {{live coverage of}} the U.S. House <b>and</b> <b>Senate,</b> with the C-SPAN channel emphasizing the United States House of Representatives. Between 1979 and May 2011, the network televised more than 24,246 hours of floor action. C-SPAN2, the first of the C-SPAN spin-off networks, provides uninterrupted {{live coverage of the}} United States Senate. With coverage of the House <b>and</b> <b>Senate,</b> viewers can track legislation as it moves through both bodies of Congress. Important debates in Congress that C-SPAN has covered live include the Persian Gulf conflict during 1991, and the House impeachment vote <b>and</b> <b>Senate</b> trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998 and 1999. When the House or Senate are not in session, C-SPAN channels broadcast other public affairs programming.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} of the C-SPAN Video Library, websites such as Metavid and voterwatch.org hosted House <b>and</b> <b>Senate</b> video records, however C-SPAN contested Metavid's usage of C-SPAN copyrighted footage. The result was Metavid's removal of portions of the archive produced with C-SPAN's cameras, while preserving its archive of government-produced content. C-SPAN also engaged in actions to stop parties from making unauthorized uses of its content online, including its video of House <b>and</b> <b>Senate</b> proceedings. Most notably, in May 2006, C-SPAN requested the removal of Stephen Colbert's performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner from YouTube. After concerns by some webloggers, C-SPAN gave permission for Google Video to host the full event. On March 7, 2007 C-SPAN liberalized its copyright policy for current, future, and past coverage of any official events sponsored by Congress and any federal agency and now allows for attributed non-commercial copying, sharing, and posting of C-SPAN video on the Internet, excluding re-syndication of live video streams. The new policy {{did not affect the}} public's right to use the public domain video coverage of the floor proceedings of the U.S. House <b>and</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Governor Dayton {{formally}} {{proposed a}} state budget on February 15, calling for $37 billion in state spending, necessitating cuts of about 10 percent to most state agencies. Because {{the state was}} projected to take in only about $32 billion in taxes, {{the rest of the}} budget shortfall was covered by increases to income and property taxes for wealthier Minnesotans, as he had promised during his campaign. Meanwhile, Republican legislators, led by House Speaker Kurt Zellers <b>and</b> <b>Senate</b> Majority Leader Amy Koch, demanded the budget be kept below $32 billion.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1950, Charles {{dissolved}} parliament pending fresh elections.
