40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} how interactive read <b>alouds</b> effect student comprehension with the claim being that they increase comprehension scores.

There was no difference in scores for the above average readers. The implications of this study include using read <b>alouds</b> as a support in intermediate grades, average and below average readers preferring read <b>alouds</b> to independent reading, and using interactive read <b>alouds</b> to help engage students and enhance the discussion of text...|$|R
