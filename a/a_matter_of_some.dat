5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him {{to the status of}} subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Kneale was a BBC {{employee}} at the time, {{which meant that}} his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC and he received no extra payment {{for the sale of}} the film rights. This became <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> resentment on Kneale's part, and when his BBC contract came up for renewal he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work. Despite this Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an ex-gratia payment of £3,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatrosses}} comprise between 13 and 24 species (the {{number of}} species is still <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> debate, 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in four genera. These genera are the great albatrosses (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific albatrosses (Phoebastria), and the sooty albatrosses or sooties (Phoebetria). The North Pacific albatrosses {{are considered to be}} a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks.|$|E

The list of Victorian Rules matches was compiled by historian Greg Ryan and relied heavily on coverage of the matches in the Melbourne press. The frequency of matches suggests the list is complete.|$|E
5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since he was not the family heir it was <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{information}} contained in the Liber is important to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made. The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> debate amongst historians.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Hamilton's {{relationship}} with slavery is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> historical contention.

50|$|Further fate <b>of</b> Thracians is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> dispute. <b>Some</b> authors like Schramm derived the Albanians {{from the}} Christian Bessi, or Bessians, an early Thracian {{people who were}} pushed westwards into Albania, while {{mainstream}} of historians support Illyrian-Albanian continuity or a possible Thraco-Illyrian creole.|$|R
50|$|The {{classification}} <b>of</b> leukoencephalopathies is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate. <b>Some</b> authors divide leukoencephalopathies into hereditary {{disorders and}} acquired disorders.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> {{confusion}} for Anglicans {{elsewhere in}} the world is that while the Anglican Church of Canada is a province of the Anglican Communion, the Ecclesiastical Province of Canada is merely one of four such ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Church of Canada. This confusion is furthered by the fact that Canada has ten civil provinces, along with three territories.|$|E

Mordvinic is commonly seen as particularly closely related to or part of Finno-Samic. The term Volgaic (or Volga-Finnic) was used to denote a branch previously believed to include Mari, Mordvinic {{and a number of}} the extinct languages, but it is now obsolete and considered a geographic classification rather than a linguistic one.|$|E
