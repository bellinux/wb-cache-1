The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.

25|$|According to Alan Robock, who {{has also}} {{published}} nuclear winter papers, the Toba eruption did not precipitate the last glacial period. However assuming an emission of six billion tons of sulphur dioxide, his computer simulations concluded that a maximum global cooling of approximately 15°C occurred for {{three years after the}} eruption, and that this cooling would last for decades, devastating life. Because the saturated <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> is 4.9°C/1,000 m for temperatures above freezing, the tree line and the snow line were around 3,000 m (9,900ft) lower at this time. The climate recovered over a few decades, and Robock found no evidence that the 1,000-year cold period seen in Greenland ice core records had resulted from the Toba eruption. In contrast, Oppenheimer believes that estimates of a drop in surface temperature by 3–5°C are probably too high, and he suggests that temperatures dropped only by 1°C. Robock has criticized Oppenheimer's analysis, arguing that it is based on simplistic T-forcing relationships.|$|E

500|$|The uneven {{solar heating}} (the {{formation}} of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) {{can also be}} due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. [...] Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate.</b> In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.|$|E
500|$|Most {{subtropical}} cyclones {{form when}} a deep cold-core extratropical cyclone drops {{down into the}} subtropics. [...] The system becomes blocked by a high latitude ridge, and eventually sheds its frontal boundaries as its source of cool and dry air from the high latitudes diverts away from the system. [...] Temperature differences between the 500hPa pressure level, or [...] above ground level, and the sea surface temperatures initially exceed the dry <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> which causes an initial round of thunderstorms to form at a distance east of the center.

It results from the adiabatic warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes.

If the parcel is saturated it is unstable and will rise to the LCL or CCL, and either be halted due to an inversion layer of convective inhibition, or if lifting continues, deep, moist convection (DMC) may ensue, as a parcel rises to the level of free convection (LFC), after which it enters the free convective layer (FCL) and usually rises to the equilibrium level (EL).|$|R

2500|$|... g modes are {{standing}} internal gravity waves whose principal restoring force is negative buoyancy of vertically displaced material, {{hence the name}} [...] "g mode". They are of relatively low frequency (0-0.4 mHz). They are confined either to {{the interior of the}} sun below the convection zone (the inner 70 per cent by radius), or to the atmosphere. [...] Because they cannot propagate through convectively unstable regions (in which the temperature gradient exceeds the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> buoyancy is positive and the force on a displaced element of fluid is not restoring), the former are practically unobservable at the surface. The g modes are said to be evanescent in the convection zone, and are thought to have residual velocity amplitudes of only millimeters per second at the photosphere, though perhaps they are more prominent as temperature perturbations. Since the 1980s, there have been several claims of g-mode detection, including one claimed in 2007 using the GOLF data. At the GONG2008 / SOHO XXI conference held in Boulder, the Phoebus group reported that it could not confirm these findings, putting an upper limit of [...] 3mm/s on g-mode amplitudes, right at the detection limit of the GOLF instrument.

5000|$|The {{difference}} in moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> and the dry rate {{is the cause}} of foehn wind phenomenon (also known as [...] "Chinook winds" [...] in parts of North America). The phenomenon exists because warm moist air rises through orographic lifting up and over the top of a mountain range or large mountain. The temperature decreases with the dry <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> until it hits the dew point, where water vapor in the air begins to condense. Above that altitude, the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> decreases to the moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> as the air continues to rise. Condensation is also commonly followed by precipitation on the top and windward sides of the mountain. As the air descends on the leeward side, it is warmed by adiabatic compression at the dry <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, the foehn wind at a certain altitude is warmer than the corresponding altitude on the windward side of the mountain range. In addition, because the air has lost much of its original water vapor content, the descending air creates an arid region on the leeward side of the mountain.|$|E

The difference of <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> of water and moist air creates temperature imbalance between the flowing fluids in deep underground systems, leading to thermal and water exchanges, in which water flow globally subtracts energy from the system.

The rate of aggressive water condensation on the walls is comparable to the external rain and can play a leading role in Speleogenesis...|$|R
