5000|$|Design flaw of the {{aircraft}} [...] - [...] This is the second Nomad aircraft crash following the first crash on 3 October 1973 when {{the aircraft}} was leased to Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as A18-002 in July 1973. The 3rd Nomad aircraft crash occurred on 6 August 1976 during a test flight at Avalon Airport, Australia, exactly 2 months after the Malaysian Double Six Crash. In November 1995, 20 years after the Double Six Crash, the Four Corners TV series of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which is noted for its investigative exposés, ran a programme {{on the dangers of}} Nomad aircraft which had been suppressed over the years. At the time when the programme was broadcast, there were a total of 19 Nomad accidents with 56 deaths. It was the aircraft crash flown by Glen Donovan on 12 March 1990 that caused a mutiny among Australian army pilots and the usage of all military Nomads were discontinued after that. Harry Bradford was a former RAAF test pilot. He found controllability issues {{of the aircraft}} especially during its handling on approach and landing. However, his reports were being suppressed because it could harm the reputation GAF and Australian national interests. A former GAF design engineer, Paul Hughes, bought 16 Nomad aircraft through his own corporation. However, soon after that, he filed a legal suit against Nomad for a number of <b>aircraft</b> <b>defects</b> such as a defective tail design and maximum weight limit that the aircraft can carry which was far lower than advertised weight limit. The Australian government finally paid A$ 4 million to Hughes Corporation. Hughes then disposed of 15 out of 16 aircraft that he had bought. Tun Fuad's family now believed that the aircraft faulty design is a more likely cause of the Double Six Crash.|$|E
40|$|To ensure {{flight safety}} of {{aircraft}} structures, {{it is necessary}} to have regular maintenance using visual and nondestructive inspection (NDI) methods. In this paper, we propose an automatic image-based <b>aircraft</b> <b>defect</b> detection using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for <b>aircraft</b> <b>defect</b> detection using DNNs. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art feature descriptors and show that the best performance is achieved by vgg-f DNN as feature extractor with a linear SVM classifier. To reduce the processing time, we propose to apply SURF key point detector to identify defect patch candidates. Our experiment results suggest that we can achieve over 96 % accuracy at around 15 s processing time for a high-resolution (20 -megapixel) image on a laptop. Comment: 5 page...|$|R

40|$|We study {{spare parts}} {{inventory}} control for a repair shop for <b>aircraft</b> components. <b>Defect</b> components that {{are removed from}} the aircraft are sent to such a shop for repair. Only after inspection of the component, it becomes clear which specific spare parts are needed to repair it, and in what quantity they are needed. Market requirements on shop performance are reflected in fill rate requirements on the turn around times of the repairs for each component type. The inventory for spare parts is controlled by independent min-max policies. Because parts {{may be used in}} the repair of different component types, the resulting optimization problem has a combinatorial nature. Practical instances may consist of 500 component types and 4000 parts, and thus pose a significant computational challenge. We propose a solution algorithm based on column generation. We study the pricing problem, and develop a method that is very efficient in (repeatedly) solving this pricing problem. With this method, it becomes feasible to solve practical instances of the problem in minutes...|$|R

Demanding of its performance and maintaining is increasingly day by day. An aircraft cable fault diagnosis and location system based on Phase Detection Frequency Domain Reflectometry (PDFDR) is presented in this paper, which is used to diagnose and locate the special aircraft cable faults, such as intermittent fault, continuous fault and cross-connect fault.

40|$|Abstract. Composite materials, such as FRP and {{honeycomb}} structures, {{are used}} for crucial structures in <b>aircraft.</b> Critical <b>defects</b> that weaken {{the strength of the}} composite structures are delamination and debonding. In order to assure the safety and reliability of a composite structure, these defects should be inspected using appropriate techniques that are nondestructive. Although various nondestructive evaluating techniques exist for inspecting composite structures, a novel technique is required in the industrial field for non-contacting and real time inspection. Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry(ESPI), {{which is one of the}} optical techniques that exist to precisely measure displacement, uses a CCD camera and a computer aided technique to show the resulting image in real time. Shearography is one of the robust ESPI techniques that allow non-contacting, full-field observation of surface displacement derivatives. In this study, a nondestructive shearography was applied to detect and characterize internal defects of composite materials for both CFRP laminates and honeycomb structure. For this purpose, CFRP laminated and honeycomb structured panels containing artificial delamination and debonding with different sizes and locations were used. It was demonstrated that shearography could effectively detect and characterize internal defects by analyzing corresponding shearography images. The sizes of artificial defects were also evaluated quantitatively by the shearography technique. It was shown that shearography is a useful tool for quantitative nondestructive evaluation of composite structures, such as FRP and honeycomb structures...|$|R

40|$|Subsurface {{corrosion}} in {{aircraft structure}} {{is a major}} concern in lap joints and other joints. Small open gaps in the joints form regions where moisture can be trapped. The trapped water often produces a chemical environment in the regions which accelerates the corrosion process. Corrosion considerably reduces structural strength and load-bearing capacity of the structure. To ensure flight safety, it is imperative to detect subsurface corrosion as early as possible during aircraft maintenance operations. Since long downtimes of commercial aircraft translate to large operating costs for airline industries, it is desirable to develop techniques that can consistently and reliably detect corrosion by rapidly scanning the aircraft. Towards this goal, the thermal technique, which is a nondestructive, noncontacting technique capable of rapidly inspecting <b>aircraft</b> structures for <b>defects</b> such as disbonds, corrosion, and cracks is currently under development [1]. Also under parallel development are techniques such as ultrasonics, magneto-optics, shearography, electromagnetics, and radiography...|$|R
5|$|Deliveries of the Vengeances to Australia {{were much}} delayed. Following Australia's entry into Pacific War in December 1941, the RAAF order still stood at 297 Vengeances. These {{aircraft}} {{were scheduled to}} be delivered between January and December 1942. No Vengeances had arrived by 8 May 1942, though the RAAF's order had been increased to 367. A small number of the type arrived in Australia in late May 1942, but subsequent deliveries were slow. This was because the USAAF was also rapidly expanding at this time, which limited the number and types of aircraft available to its allies. Attempts by the Australian Government to obtain Vengeances from USAAF allocations in March 1942, when the country faced a possible Japanese invasion, were unsuccessful. The majority of the dive bombers arrived after April 1943; {{by this time the}} threat of invasion had passed. Overall, Australia received 15 Vengeances in 1942, 227 in 1943 and 100 during 1944. Many of the <b>aircraft</b> suffered from <b>defects,</b> which led to delays in introducing them into service and caused the type to have a relatively low serviceability rate.|$|R
25|$|The {{other two}} branches, the Manchukuo Imperial Air Force and the Manchukuo Imperial Navy, {{were small and}} underdeveloped, largely {{existing}} as token forces to give legitimacy to the Manchukuo regime. An Air Force was established in February 1937 with 30 men selected from the Manchukuo Imperial Army who were trained at the Japanese Kwantung Army aircraft arsenal in Harbin (initially the Kwantung Army did not trust the Manchukuoans enough to train a native air force for them). The Imperial Air Force's predecessor was the Manchukuo Air Transport Company (later renamed the Manchukuo National Airways), a paramilitary airline formed in 1931, which undertook transport and reconnaissance missions for the Japanese military. The first air unit was based in Hsinking (Changchun) and equipped with just one Nieuport-Delage NiD 29 and was later expanded with Nakajima Army Type 91 Fighters and Kawasaki Type 88 light bombers. Two more air units were established, but they suffered a setback when one hundred pilots took their <b>aircraft</b> and <b>defected</b> to insurgents after murdering their Japanese instructors. Nonetheless three fighter squadrons were formed in 1942 from the first batch of cadets, being equipped with Nakajima Ki-27 fighters in addition to Tachikawa Ki-9s and Tachikawa Ki-55 trainers, along with some Mitsubishi Ki-57 transports. In 1945, because of American bombing raids, they were issued with Nakajima Ki-43 fighters {{to have a better}} chance of intercepting B-29 Superfortresses. Some pilots saw action against the American bombers and at least one Ki-27 pilot downed a B-29 by ramming his plane into it in a kamikaze attack. The air force practically ceased to exist by the Soviet invasion but there were isolated instances of Manchukuoan planes attacking Soviet forces. The Imperial Navy of Manchukuo existed mainly as a small river flotilla and consisted mainly of small gunboats and patrol boats, both captured Chinese ships and some Japanese additions. The elderly Japanese destroyer Kashi was lent to the Manchukuoan fleet from 1937 to 1942 as the Hai Wei before returning to the Imperial Japanese Navy. These ships were mostly crewed by Japanese.|$|R
40|$|During the High Speed Machining (HSM) of <b>aircraft</b> components, {{geometrical}} <b>defects,</b> such as mismatches or chatters, can be created. To {{obtain a}} high surface quality, an expensive manual grinding operation is systematically done to remove these defects. The {{aim of this}} study is to identify the impact of HSM defects on the fatigue behaviour of the aluminium alloy Al 7050. After listing and reproducing the most frequently observed surface defects, fatigue tests are conducted under fully reversed plane bending loads. Investigations carried out in previous work showed that residual stresses and the strain hardening introduced by machining under these conditions can be neglected. Therefore, only the geometric aspect of the surface integrity is considered in this study. The results show that the fatigue strength decreases only when the surface roughness is significantly degraded. It is also pointed out that manual grinding allows the effect of the machining defects to be removed from the fatigue behaviour. In order to predict the influence of the surface condition on the fatigue behaviour, a numerical approach based on the real surface topology is also developed. Crack initiation sites that are numerically identified are in agreement with experimental results. Numerical simulation results are compared to the predictions of different fatigue criteria from the literature and discussed over a wide range of surface defects...|$|R
