5000|$|<b>Aerophyte</b> (エアロファイト) - Microscopic {{vegetative}} {{organisms that}} float on Darwin IV's air currents and constitute {{a major source}} of food for several species on the planet.|$|E
5000|$|As stated, H. sambuci {{occurs in}} North Europe mostly on Sambucus nigra, {{but there is}} a much bigger {{spectrum}} of substrates in warmer regions in southern areas. The variability of micromorphology increases in the tropics, but the macromorphological characteristics however always stay the same: the basidiocarp with chalky white color and often growing as <b>aerophyte</b> on dead branches of trees and bushes, that are still attached to the tree. H. sambuci consists of a complex of species. Similar species with capitate cystidia thin-walled hyphae and exactly the same chalky white fruit body are H. griselinae and H. fimbriata. They can be differentiated by their spores and morphology of their basidiocarp.|$|E
50|$|Tillandsia landbeckii is {{a species}} in the genus Tillandsia. This species is endemic to Peru and Chile. It {{is one of the}} species of Tillandsia known as <b>aerophytes,</b> that grow on {{shifting}} desert soil rather than attached to other plants.|$|R
50|$|The antonym of poikilohydry is homoiohydry, a {{suite of}} {{morphological}} adaptations and strategies that enable plants to regulate or achieve homeostasis of cell and tissue water content. The vascular plants have largely lost the capacity to tolerate dehydration. Aside from most seeds and spores, only about 300 species of vascular plants are desiccation-tolerant, including resurrection plants (such as Selaginella lepidophylla) and <b>aerophytes</b> (including some species of Tillandsia) needed.|$|R
5000|$|Rimerunner (ライムランナー) - The Rimerunner is a one-legged animal {{from the}} polar regions of Darwin IV. Supported {{by only one}} leg, the Rimerunner hops across its Arctic home like a kangaroo. It eats only <b>aerophytes</b> and other {{microscopic}} airborne organisms. At the front of its head, the Rimerunner sports an umbrella-like organ. This organ, suspended by thin neural cables, is a sophisticated sonar system along with a simple and atrophying eye.|$|R
5000|$|Tillandsia is a genus {{of around}} 650 species of evergreen, {{perennial}} flowering {{plants in the}} family Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of Central and South America, the southern United States and the West Indies. They have naturally been established in diverse environments such as equatorial tropical rain forests, high elevation Andes mountains, rock dwelling (saxicolous) regions, and Louisiana swamps, such as Spanish Moss (T. usneoides), a species that grows atop tree limbs. Airplant is a common name for plants in this genus. [...] Most Tillandsia species are epiphytes - i.e. they normally grow without soil while attached to other plants. Some are <b>aerophytes</b> or air plants, which have no roots and grow on shifting desert soil. Generally, the thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought. Most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain, dew, dust, decaying leaves and insect matter, aided by structures called trichomes.|$|R
40|$|The author kept 108 algal strains (Cyanophyta 53, Chlorophyta 35, Chrysophyta 20), of axenic {{cultures}} {{from the}} Kol-Algotheca in the Botanical Division of the Hungarian National Sciences Museum in the Baradla Cave, at Aggletek (Hungary) in darkness for 204 - 420 days under different environmental conditions. The experiments have proven that several algal strains can tolerate well the {{complete absence of}} light. Furthermore, that some algal strains show intensive development even under such conditions. These axenic cultures kept in the cave in metal boxes on inorganic medium {{have shown that the}} energy source used by these green coloured algae is not some by-product of chemotrophic bacteria, nor is it available organic material, but that it must be some kind of radiation which is able to penetrate even the metal boxes. The ability to adapt to the conditions existing in a cave is not a general characteristic of algal species, but is the capability of individual algal strains within that species. Most probably the algae living in the caves are <b>aerophytes,</b> terrestrial forms, and also some belonging to the edaphon. The cells were found to be smaller in the algae kept in the cave, there was almost no starch deposition in the cells, the pyrenoids were barely discernible, but the development of carotenes was more intense. Whether there are specific cave dwelling algal strains must be determined by future algological research conducted in caves. The composition of the algal floras of the caves may be equally dependent upon the chemical and physical characteristics of the biotope, {{as is the case in}} every other biotope...|$|R
