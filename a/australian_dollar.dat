5|$|Nauru has no armed forces, {{though there}} is a small police force under {{civilian}} control. Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries. The September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed. Nauru uses the <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar</b> as its official currency.|$|E

The contract {{for construction of}} six submarines was signed on 3 June and valued at A$3.9 billion in 1986 prices, with allowances for inflation and the changing value of the <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar.</b> The submarine acquisition project {{was at the time}} the most expensive project ever undertaken by the Australian Defence Force, but was unseated from this title by the Anzac-class frigate project a few years later.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} meet {{production}} targets, GAF was required to complete 1.5 Hornets per month. Production fell behind schedule {{during the first half}} of 1987, however, as a result of inefficiencies at the company's factory and industrial relations problems. GAF was able to accelerate production later in the year, though some components that were planned to be manufactured in Australia were purchased from companies in the United States instead. The final cost of the Hornet project was A$4.668 billion; after adjusting for the depreciation of the <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar</b> this was $186 million less than the initial estimate.|$|E
5|$|GM {{assembly}} plants were operated in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by General Motors New Zealand Limited {{in an earlier}} and quite separate operation from Holden's in Australia. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar,</b> and government grants have been reduced. This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden will cease vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company. Holden will retain their design centre, but with reduced staffing.|$|E

25|$|Economists posit that {{commodity}} prices are the dominant {{driver of the}} <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar,</b> and this means changes in exchange rates of the <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar</b> occur in ways opposite to many other currencies. For decades, Australia's balance of trade has depended primarily upon commodity exports such as minerals and agricultural products. This means the <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar</b> varies significantly during the business cycle, rallying during global booms as Australia exports raw materials, and falling during recessions as mineral prices slump or when domestic spending overshadows the export earnings outlook. This movement is {{in the opposite direction}} to other reserve currencies, which tend to be stronger during market slumps as traders move value from falling stocks into cash.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1980s onwards, the Australian economy has {{undergone}} a continuing economic liberalisation. In 1983, under Prime Minister Bob Hawke, but mainly driven by Treasurer Paul Keating, the <b>Australian</b> <b>dollar</b> was floated and financial deregulation was undertaken.|$|E
