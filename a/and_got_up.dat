25|$|A rematch between Vic Darchinyan and Nonito Donaire {{took place}} on 9 November 2013. The 37-year-old Darchinyan gave the 30-year-old Donaire a lot more trouble than was expected, as this was {{intended}} to be an easy bounce-back fight for Donaire who was coming off his first loss in over a decade. Darchinyan fought a smarter fight and confused a sluggish Donaire for much of the first 8 rounds, but in the 9th round round was dropped <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to be finished by TKO. At the time of the stoppage, Darchinyan was leading on the scorecards: 78-74, 78-74, and 76-76.|$|E

25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{interest}} in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent {{said she did}} not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of attachment to anybody, including her mother and brother. At first she would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she sat on her mother's lap when requested she remained very tense <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial, and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and blew her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. She had no sense of personal property, frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted from someone else, or situational awareness. Doctors wrote that she acted on impulse irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.|$|E

25|$|The sixth {{match was}} a tag team match between D-Generation X (DX) (Shawn Michaels and Triple H) and The McMahons (Vince and Shane). Before the {{beginning}} of the match, the Spirit Squad interfered on the behalf of the McMahons but were tossed out by DX until Finlay, William Regal, Mr. Kennedy, and The Big Show interfered. Triple H controlled the first three, while Michaels fought Big Show, who chokeslammed Triple H through a broadcast table. The match officially began as the McMahons took advantage and performed several tag team moves on DX, including the Hart Attack and the Doomsday Device. Shane tried to pin Michaels, but Michaels kicked out of the move <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>up.</b> He clotheslined Shane and tagged in Triple H. The McMahons were knocked to the floor, but Umaga interfered as the final man on the behalf of the McMahons. Armando Alejandro Estrada distracted the referee while Umaga delivered the Samoan Spike to Triple H. He also tried a Samoan Spike on Michaels, but Kane came to prevent Umaga from attacking DX by chasing him away. Vince tried to take advantage of Umaga's attack by pinning Triple H, but Triple H kicked out of the cover. Vince attacked the referee and then put a trash can on the face of Triple H, who was lying in the corner. Shane tried a Coast-To-Coast on Triple H but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on Shane. Vince tried to rescue his son, but a trash can was smashed on his head by Triple H. Michaels superkicked Vince, who went straight into Triple H's Pedigree for DX's pinfall victory.|$|E
25|$|At Silverstone, {{which he}} said he {{considers}} to be his second home, he qualified 16th, outpacing Button. With heavy rain on race day, through good use of an extreme wet tyre he finished 3rd, achieving his first podium since 2005. However, in Germany, a collision with David Coulthard ended his hopes for points. In Hungary, he was lapped by the leader, repeating the same performance in Valencia. In Belgium he qualified 16th but had to retire because of a gearbox fault. At a wet Monza, he was second fastest in Friday practice and started from 16th on the grid. He managed {{to get up to}} 9th but as a result of using the wrong type of tyre in his second pit stop he ended up 17th. At the first ever night race in Singapore he was in a good position to score some points after pitting before the pit lane closed for the safety car period, but shortly afterwards the engine failed and he had to retire. In Japan he started from 17th on the grid, but managed to get up to 13th {{by the end of the}} race. In China he managed to get into Q2 for the first time in ten races, and would have started 14th. But after Mark Webber had his ten place penalty for an engine change added he was moved up to 13th. On race day he had a good start, <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to 10th early on and held a strong mid table position all race and finished 11th, five places ahead of Button, who had struggled all weekend.|$|E

This time the going was really rough from the Republican {{side of the table}} and Acheson consciously lost his temper over some of Wherry's remarks <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and tried to slug him. Adrian Fisher, State Department Legal Adviser and a close friend of Acheson, caught his arm, fortunately, because Acheson would have missed Wherry by about three feet and probably fallen flat on his face on the floor. It was a great show." ...|$|E

[...] In Alabama, Moon and Entwistle loaded a toilet with cherry bombs after being denied room service. According to Entwistle, [...] "That toilet was just dust all over the walls by the time we checked out. The management brought our suitcases down to the gig and said: 'Don't come back...'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Räikkönen {{qualified}} {{third at}} the [...] Before the race, Räikkönen pushed noted photographer Paul-Henri Cahier {{to the ground}} as he lined up a close-up shot. Räikkönen's manager Steve Robertson claimed the driver was provoked by Cahier touching him with his lens and standing on his belongings, but Cahier disputed this version of events. The race was in wet conditions and Räikkönen stayed third at the first corner behind Hamilton and Kovalainen. He kept pace <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to second when Kovalainen spun. He then chased after Hamilton, and set the fastest lap as he drew up directly behind the McLaren. During the first pitstop, Ferrari did not change the intermediates on his car {{in the hope that the}} track would become dry. However, the track was hit by another shower, and Räikkönen rapidly lost pace, and dropped down to sixth before finally pitting for new tyres. He finished fourth, a lap down.|$|E
