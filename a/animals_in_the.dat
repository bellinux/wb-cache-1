5|$|Individuals of the Asian {{species have}} been often trained as working <b>animals.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> forests of Myanmar, for example, {{elephants}} have {{played a critical role}} in sustainable logging. Under the guidance of their handlers, elephants are used to manipulate and drag heavy teak logs from road-less areas to rivers and roads.

5|$|Most of the <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spruce-fir forest have ranges {{that extend}} into the balsam fir forest higher up.

Mammals include the red {{squirrel}} and the pine marten.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 genetic {{study showed}} that two {{examined}} specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E
5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E

5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed with the <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monophyletic group of opisthokonts. Analyses using molecular phylogenetics support a monophyletic origin of the Fungi. The taxonomy of the Fungi {{is in a state of}} constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E
5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary <b>animals,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E

5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of slaughter of <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E

Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound {{equipment}} available {{to him at the}} time. Most of the actors did not dub their own voices. The only voices of the actors that are their own in the film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film were fake and were done by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music.|$|E
5|$|Glucose, {{dextrose}} or grape sugar, occurs {{naturally in}} fruits and plant juices {{and is the}} primary product of photosynthesis. Most ingested carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion {{and it is the}} form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bloodstream. It can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids. Glucose syrup is a liquid form of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, Oliver Butterworth {{authored}} a children's book, The Enormous Egg.

The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia.|$|E
