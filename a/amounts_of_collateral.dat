40|$|The authors build a {{theoretical}} model that generates demand for collateral by Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) participants {{under the assumption}} that they minimize the cost of holding and managing collateral for LVTS purposes. The model predicts that the optimal <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> held by each LVTS participant depends on the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral,</b> the transactions costs of acquiring assets used as collateral and transferring them {{in and out of the}} LVTS, and the distribution of an LVTS participant's payment flows in the LVTS. The authors conclude that the aggregate <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> pledged to the LVTS is quite close to that predicted by the model, when benchmark values are used for opportunity and transactions costs that are based on anecdotal evidence, despite the fact that these costs are likely to vary among participants. If one LVTS participant that appears to face a lower opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is excluded from the analysis, the model predicts an aggregate level <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> that is within 5 per cent <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> actually held by LVTS participants, on average, between February 1999 and May 2003. The authors also apply panel-data regressions to the level <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> held in the LVTS. They find that the results are broadly supportive of the theoretical model. Sensitivity analysis of this model indicates that, when the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> increases, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> that participants hold could be greatly reduced. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to being able to}} destroy infectious organisms through cell to cell contact via phagocytosis, microglia can also release a variety of cytotoxic substances. Microglia in culture secrete large amounts of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide in a process known as ‘respiratory burst'. Both of these chemicals can directly damage cells and lead to neuronal cell death. Proteases secreted by microglia catabolise specific proteins causing direct cellular damage, while cytokines like IL-1 promote demyelination of neuronal axons. Finally, microglia can injure neurons through NMDA receptor-mediated processes by secreting glutamate, aspartate and quinolinic acid. Cytotoxic secretion is aimed at destroying infected neurons, virus, and bacteria, but can also cause large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> neural damage. As a result, chronic inflammatory response can result in large scale neural damage as the microglia ravage the brain in an attempt to destroy the invading infection.|$|E
5000|$|Adverse {{selection}}: Adverse selection occurs {{before the}} signing of the contract. The lack of information occurs since the lenders do not have information about the type of borrowers, i.e. whether the borrower tends to engage in riskier projects or not. There is positive correlation between possibility of selecting [...] "bad" [...] types as the interest rate increases since it is more costly for safe borrowers than risky borrowers since the possibility of not paying back his/her debt for the risky one is relatively higher. In adverse selection, the borrower type is only known by the individual and occurs when there are no enough tools to screen the borrower types. One of the examples of screening is offering different types of funds having different interest rates and asking different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> in order to reveal the information about the type of the borrower. If the borrower is a [...] "bad" [...] type, then he/she will choose the type of funds having higher interest rates and requesting lower amount of collateral. However, in real world there are many types of borrowers which we can not categorize with just [...] "bad" [...] and [...] "good" [...] types. For each characteristic of the borrower lender needs {{to increase the number of}} instruments to fully reveal the information about the type of the borrower. Hence, in real life it is not possible for lender to fully reveal the type of borrowers.|$|E
50|$|The {{initial margin}} {{requirement}} is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> required {{to open a}} position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> after haircuts dips below the maintenance margin requirement, the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|R

40|$|The Saskatchewan {{agricultural}} industry {{as reported in}} the 1961 Census, consisted of 93, 924 farm units. 1 Of this number, a large percentage must be classified as "uneconomic" {{in the sense that the}} return from land, labor and capital is invariably too low to ensure a satisfactory standard of family living. This low-income farm situation is not new to agriculture. It has existed over the years chiefly because of the failure of many operators and their families to adjust to the changing needs of efficient agricultural production. In order that the low-income farmers remaining on the farm might increase their net income however, they must be able to adjust through some combination of increased land base, increased production on present land or increased efficiency of land, labor and capital use. Although increased efficiency of resource use may offer promise of additional net returns for many farmers, the needed volume of income adjustment can for the most part, only be met through expanding the over­all scale of production. This expanded production, however, whether by means of additional land or through more intensive land use, requires sub­stantial amounts of extra capital. By restricting family living expend­itures, an established farmer can often accumulate much of this capital needed for further expansion. The low-income farmer, on the other hand, cannot adjust in so ready a fashion. With family living standards already too low, he can scarcely hope to accumulate sufficient savings to finance his own adjustment. He must instead, look to credit as the means by which his production and hence income, can be increased. Credit is an important key in meeting the adjustment needs of the low-­income farmer; as such, it is the central problem of this study. Despite the need for substantial amounts of credit, the low-income farmer is the least able to qualify for assistance from present lending agencies. This is due in large measure to the fact that credit institutions rely heavily on large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> security as the basis for extending loans to farmers. Since the low-income farmer has little to offer in the line of first class security, he is denied the one means by which he could hope to increase his production and hence his standard of family living. Such credit as is currently available, has not been designed to assist the low-­income farmer to gain an economic status. The short-comings become even more important as changing agricultural conditions suggest the need for still greater quantities of capital on behalf of today's farmer. 1.

5000|$|Insurance companies: Corporations such as AIG provide {{insurance}} products called credit default swaps, which {{are intended to}} protect against credit defaults, {{in exchange for a}} premium or fee. They are required to post a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> (e.g., cash or other liquid assets) {{to be in a position}} to provide payments in the event <b>of</b> defaults.

This risk-downgrade-post cycle can be circular and destructive across multiple firms and was a factor in the AIG bailout. Further, many major banks insured their mortgage-backed assets with AIG.

Since September 2008, the U.S. government has since stepped in with $150 billion in financial support for AIG, much of which flows through AIG to the banks.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a {{competitive}} {{general equilibrium model}} with collateralized con-tracts under limited commitment. Even though all conceivable collateralized contracts are allowed, with limited aggregate collateral, risk sharing is imperfect and contract markets are endogenously incomplete. I prove that constrained optimal allocations can be decentralized as a general equilibrium with collateral constraints. I show that the equilibrium exists and that the First and Second Welfare theorem hold. There exists a unique minimal spanning set of collateralized contracts that generates the feasible space and that contains more than the complete set of collateralized Arrow securities. Because the capital good serves as collateral, it has an additional value, called collateral value. The collateral value, which is a risk sharing implication of the model, becomes smaller as more collateralizable capital is available. A positive collateral value implies incomplete risk sharing. I show analytically and numerically that a "sufficiently large" <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> leads to perfect risk sharing and complete markets. An economy endowed with a larger <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> could have {{a greater number of}} contracts traded in equilibrium.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the occurrence of expectation-driven fluctuations of a rational bubble and the (de-) stabilizing role of monetary policy. Our explanation of fluctuations is based on credit market imperfections. For this purpose, we consider an overlapping generations exchange economy where households realize a portfolio choice between money and bubble. Money is held because of a partial cash-in-advance constraint affected by the bubble. Bubble acts as a store of value, but also as a collateral. Indeed, a higher value of the bubble implies a higher <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral,</b> which, in turn, reduces the need of cash, and thus increases consumption purchased on credit. Under these credit market features, expectation-driven fluctuations and the multiplicity of steady-states occur, in particular for arbitrarily small market distortions. Investing the stabilizing role of monetary policy, we show that when the monetary policy rule depends on expected inflation only, a more active rule stabilizes only if collateral has a large effect on consumption financed on credit. Finally, we enrich this rule by including asset prices. A policy which depends on asset prices can stabilize whatever the effect <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> and can also rule out the multiplicity of steady states.
