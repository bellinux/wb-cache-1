5|$|The bath complex {{featured}} {{an entrance}} room (vestibulum), an exercise hall (basilica thermarum), a sweating room (sudatorium), a cold {{room with a}} cold pool (frigidarium), a warm room (tepidarium), and <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> room with <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> plunge bath (caldarium). An unsheltered exercise yard (palaestra) also formed part of the complex. The baths had mosaic floors and were heated by a hypocaust under-floor system connected to three furnaces. Such furnaces required several metric tons of wood each day.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> spring. The next best option is to drill a well into <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the star}} has fused the helium of its core, the carbon product fuses {{producing}} <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> core with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, {{but with a}} higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo {{a brief period of}} carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>hotbed</b> {{covered with}} <b>a</b> small glass cover (also called a hotbox) {{is used as}} a small version of a {{hothouse}} (heated greenhouse). Oftentimes, this bed is made of manure from animals such as horses. These animals pass undigested plant cellulose in their droppings, creating a good environment for microorganisms to come and break down the cellulose and create <b>a</b> <b>hotbed.</b>|$|R

5|$|An {{earthquake}} at 8:32:17a.m. PDT (UTC−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, {{caused the}} entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, {{it is clear}} that Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have causal effects on his body and vice versa: A child touches <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the {{caregiver}} (mental event), and so on.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-40b is <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter that is {{estimated}} to be 2.2 times the mass of Jupiter (over 700 times the mass of Earth), but 1.17 times Jupiter's radius (13.12 times the radius of Earth). Thus, the planet has a density of 1.68grams per cubic centimeter, similar to that of Neptune (1.638 g/cm3). The planet's equilibrium temperature {{is estimated}} to be 1620 K, thirteen times hotter than Jupiter's equilibrium temperature.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b is <b>a</b> <b>Hot</b> Jupiter with a {{mass that}} is 2.114 times that of Jupiter and a radius of 1.431 times Jupiter's radius. This also means that Kepler-5b is not very dense.

The planet has an equilibrium temperature of 1868 K, making it fifteen times hotter than Jupiter.|$|E
