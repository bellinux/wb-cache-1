5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1900 hurricane, Galveston {{adopted a}} {{commission}} government (in 1960 {{the city would}} switch to council-manager system). At the beginning of Prohibition the city council originally opposed gambling and vice; though the council members were tolerant of small-scale activities which {{had always been a}} part of the city, they were more concerned about organized crime. As the Maceos reorganized vice in the city and made these businesses more respectable, the council became far more <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> the criminal enterprises, particularly as they became linchpins of the local economy. According to some reports this was because the Maceos bought the cooperation of the council members, taking advantage of easily corruptible structure of the commission.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more <b>accepting</b> <b>of</b> his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.|$|E
