A 231 87 -stimulated synthesis of cysteinyl LT and LTB 4 was measured by HPLC in the absence or presence of various concentrations of Koboku in rat basophilic leukemia- 1 (RBL- 1) cells. In a dose-dependent manner, Koboku inhibited synthesis of cysteinyl LT and LTB 4 by up to 92. 3 and 100 %, respectively. Immunoglobulin E-mediated release of cysteinyl LT and LTB 4, which was measured by specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) was also inhibited by Koboku in RBL- 2 H 3 cells. Sites of inhibition of Koboku in the metabolic pathway of LT synthesis were phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) and 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO), but not LTC 4 synthase or LTA 4 hydrolase. We conclude that the anti-allergic effect of Koboku may be attributable, at least in part, to the inhibition of LT synthesis...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} of current issues concerning the coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere. The tropopause region, more generally the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere, is {{the region of}} direct contact where exchange of material takes place. Dynamical coupling through angular momentum transfer by waves occurs nonlocally, and provides a generally negative torque on the stratosphere which drives an equator-to-pole circulation (i. e., towards the Earth’s axis of rotation). This wave-driven circulation is the principal mechanism for intraseasonal and interannual variability in the extratropical stratosphere. Although such variability is generally dynamical in origin, there <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>chemical</b> and radiative feedbacks. The location of the tropopause has implications for radiative forcing of climate, through {{its effect on the}} distribution of relatively short-lived greenhouse gases (ozone and water vapour). Some outstanding puzzles in our current understanding are identified. Attention is focused on possible climate sensitivities, and how these may be tested and constrained. Results from the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM), a fully interactive radiative-chemical-dynamical general circulation model, are used to illustrate some of the points...|$|E

Banana fruit has the particularity of being ripened out of the plant after harvest and during postharvest maturation titratable acidity and pH of the pulp continue to change until consumption. A modeling approach was used to understand the mechanisms involved in changes in titratable acidity and pH of the pulp during maturation. Changes in pH were modeled by solving a set of equations representing acid/base reactions. Changes in titratable acidity were modeled by taking organic acid content (citrate, malate, oxalate, and phosphate) and mineral content (potassium, magnesium, chlorine) into account. The two models were built using data from three dessert banana cultivars with contrasting acidity. For each model, calculated values were compared to observed values. Sensitivity {{analysis was used to}} study the influence of the model parameters on pH and titratable acidity. These models allowed fairly good predictions of pH and titratable acidity, and shed some light on the determinants of acidity changes during banana maturation...|$|E

Oxidation of methylphenyl sulphide (MPS), diphenyl sulphide (Ph 2 S), and dibenzothiophene (DBTH) over lamellar titanosilicate catalysts with the MFI and UTL-derived topology was investigated with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Lamellar titanosilicates combine the advantages of crystalline zeolites and mesoporous molecular sieves due to accessible active sites located on the external surface of their layers.

A methylphenyl sulphoxide selectivity of 95 % at 40 % conversion was achieved using the Ti-IPC- 1 -PI catalyst together with an outstanding TONtot = 1418 after 30 min.

In the terrestrial salamander Plethodon shermani, a male delivers proteinaceous pheromones {{to the female}} {{as part of their}} ritualistic courtship behavior. These pheromones increase the female’s receptivity to mating, as shown by a reduction in courtship duration. One pheromone component in particular is plethodontid receptivity factor (PRF), a 22 -kDa protein with multiple isoforms. This protein alone can act as a courtship pheromone that causes the female to be more receptive. We used a bacterial expression system to synthesize a single recombinant isoform of PRF. The recombinant protein was identical to the native PRF, based on mass spectrometry, circular dichroism spectra, and a behavioral bioassay that tested the effects of recombinant PRF (rPRF) on female receptivity (21 % reduction in courtship duration). The rPRF appears to mimic the activity of a mixture of PRF isoforms, as well as a mixture of multiple different proteins that comprise the male courtship gland extract. Pheromones that are peptides have been characterized for some vertebrates; to date, however, rPRF is one of only 2 synthesized vertebrate proteins to retain full biological activity.
