Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery.

5|$|The Round Church {{contains}} many medieval inscriptions, both official <b>and</b> <b>scratched</b> on its walls as graffiti. One study counted {{a total of}} 193signs and 30drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of Christian symbolism. As a whole, the epigraphy of the Round Church dates from the 10th century, and three alphabets are represented: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, {{as well as two}} languages: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic inscriptions of the Round Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{conducted}} at International Automotive Components Group in Torslanda, Sweden. The company produces door panels, instrument panels, consoles and cockpits for the automotive industry. During the production of door panels, defects such as pressure marks <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> emerge which results in scrap and rework. The objective of the thesis work was to identify the causes of pressure marks <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> <b>and</b> also to suggest measures {{to reduce the amount}} of scrap and rework on door panels. Through observations, interviews and experiments, several causes leading to pressure marks <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> on door panels were identified. Small pieces of plastics on fixtures, the operator's rough handling and specific process steps are the main causes that result in pressure marks <b>and</b> <b>scratches.</b> Pressure marks <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> emerge at several places on the door panels during the production. To reduce the amount of pressure marks <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> both short-term <b>and</b> long-term measures were suggested. Some of the measures are:  Use vacuum cleaners at some stations  Add padding on unpadded areas and edges  Make new instructions that emphasize to keep production stations clean and to avoid rough handling  Introduce workshops to engage operator...|$|R

5|$|The {{ash fall}} created some {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, <b>and</b> <b>scratched</b> moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E
25|$|De Mestre’s {{plans to}} run Archer in the third Melbourne Cup in 1863 were upset when, after already having shipped Archer and other horses to Melbourne, the Victoria Turf Club {{declared}} that de Mestre's telegraph of acceptance for Archer for the Cup had arrived late <b>and</b> <b>scratched</b> Archer on a technicality. In protest of this decision and {{in a show of}} solidarity, all the interstate owners boycotted the third race <b>and</b> <b>scratched</b> their horses in sympathy. What was unknown at the time, however, was that due to injuries Archer would later sustain in the lead up to the Cup it is unlikely that he {{would have been able to}} race. As a result, the scratchings the Melbourne Cup of that year ran with only the 7 local Victorian starters, the smallest number in the history of the Cup.|$|E

25|$|The {{formulation}} of glasses using lead, alumina, and thallium to increase RI and dispersion {{began in the}} late Baroque period. These glasses are fashioned into brilliants, and when freshly cut they can be surprisingly effective diamond simulants. Known as rhinestones, pastes, or strass, glass simulants are a common feature of antique jewelry; in such cases, rhinestones can be valuable historical artifacts in their own right. The great softness (below hardness 6) imparted by the lead means a rhinestone's facet edges and faces will quickly become rounded <b>and</b> <b>scratched.</b> Together with conchoidal fractures, and air bubbles or flow lines within the stone, these features make glass imitations easy to spot under only moderate magnification. In contemporary production it is more common for glass to be molded rather than cut into shape: in these stones the facets will be concave and facet edges rounded, and mold marks or seams may also be present. Glass has also been combined with other materials to produce composites.|$|E

40|$|Does {{the spinal}} cord use a single network to {{generate}} locomotor <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> rhythms or two separate networks? Previous research showed that simultaneous swim <b>and</b> <b>scratch</b> stimulation (“dual stimulation”) in immobilized, spinal turtles evokes a single rhythm in hindlimb motor nerves with a frequency often greater than during swim stimulation alone or scratch stimulation alone. This suggests that the signals that trigger swimming <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> converge <b>and</b> are integrated within {{the spinal cord}}. However, these results could not determine whether the integration occurs in motoneurons themselves or earlier, in spinal interneurons. Here, we recorded intracellularly from hindlimb motoneurons during dual stimulation. Motoneuron membrane potentials displayed regular oscillations at a higher frequency during dual stimulation than during swim or scratch stimulation alone. In contrast, arithmetic addition of the oscillations during swimming alone <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> alone with various delays always generated irregular oscillations. Also, the standard deviation of the phase-normalized membrane potential during dual stimulation was similar to those during swimming or scratching alone. In contrast, the standard deviation was greater when pooling cycles of swimming alone <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> alone {{for two of the}} three forms of scratching. This shows that dual stimulation generates a single rhythm prior to motoneurons. Thus, either swimming <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> largely share a rhythm generator or the two rhythms are integrated into one rhythm by strong interactions among interneurons...|$|R

500|$|Colts {{head coach}} Weeb Ewbank cited {{injuries}} to fullback Alan Ameche {{as the key}} reason for the team's inability to win a third straight NFL championship. Ewbank hoped Perry could fill in the role if Ameche was not ready when the season began.

[...] A thigh ligament injury caused him to miss several games in 1962 which, along with an injury to halfback Lenny Moore, severely hampered the Colts' running game.

500|$|The barn's main posts {{are made}} of oak. Each is about [...] square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone, a common {{building}} material in medieval London. The posts were cut into shape using axes, adzes and saws, the marks from which can still be seen in some instances. The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together on the ground <b>and</b> <b>scratched</b> Roman numerals, called assembly marks, on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined. Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two. They were all placed upside down, relative to the original direction of the tree. This was because {{the bottom of a}} tree is always wider than the top; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof. Despite the care that the builders took to get the joints right, they may have made some mistakes along the way, as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and mortises that were never used. Alternatively, the timbers may have been reused from another construction.|$|E

40|$|Furnished cages for {{laying hens}} {{exist in a}} wide variety of sizes and designs and should be {{equipped}} to allow hens to express some of their behavioural priorities. European Council Directive 1999 / 74 /EC stipulates that litter must be provided for pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> but the type of litter and the pad where litter is delivered are not defined. In the same way, neither the maximum nor the optimum number of birds per cage has been defined. Two successive experiments were carried out to analyse pecking, <b>scratching</b> (PS) <b>and</b> dustbathing (DB) behaviours performed in different furnished cages with different designs. Three group sizes of ISA brown laying hens (20, 40 or 60 hens, with the same density in all the cages), with or without additional feed distribution as litter substrate, were compared in the first experiment. The second experiment focussed on DB behaviour and compared two pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> pads (artificial turf or rubber mats), with or without wheat bran distribution as litter substrate, in groups of 60 hens per cage. Irrespective of litter presence, group size, and type of pad, DB and PS were mainly performed in the pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area, showing the attractiveness of this area. In the first experiment, feed–litter provision in pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area increased PS and DB behaviours, while group size did not affect them. In the second experiment, hens performed more DB in the pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area when wheat-bran litter was present than when it was absent. Rubber matting was more attractive to hens for DB than artificial turf matting. Durations of DB bouts were not affected by the presence or absence of wheat-bran litter or the choice of pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> pad. In furnished cages, hens clearly seek out pads and litter to perform PS, and providing litter (feed or wheat bran) or rubber in pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area is attractive for hens to DB in it. However, the cage design could be improved to promote more DB activity, for instance by increasing space of pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area in the cage...|$|R
