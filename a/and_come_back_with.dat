25|$|His {{debut in}} the Octagon was a third fight with Heath Herring at UFC 73, {{promoted}} under various combinations of his name and nickname, but was officially introduced to the audience under his full name and nickname. Nogueira once again defeated Herring, via unanimous decision. During the first round, Herring landed a head kick that sent Nogueira to the canvas, in which unofficial judge Eddie Bravo thought the fight could have been stopped. Herring let Nogueira get back to his feet, and Nogueira was then able to recover <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a dominant decision victory.|$|E
25|$|The next day, two Baldwin–Felts men, Hickey and Griggs, {{show up in}} {{town and}} take up {{residence}} at the Radnor boarding house. Danny at first refuses to give rooms to Hickey and Griggs, but Kenehan voluntarily moves to the hotel, freeing up a room for the two men and averting trouble for Mrs. Radnor. Hickey and Griggs then start their campaign against the union by forcibly evicting miners from company-owned houses in town. Mayor Testerman and Police Chief Sid Hatfield refuse to let them be evicted without eviction writs from Charleston. Hatfield deputizes all the men in town and tells them to go home <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> their guns.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not at all, father. Until today, {{nobody has}} been into this room besides {{ourselves}} and that woman. The door was generally left a little open for air, for {{you see there}} are no windows here. She used {{to go into the}} next room <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> our food.

60|$|The {{next morning}} their appetites were {{as sharp as}} ever. They looked at Ulysses, as if they {{expected}} him to clamber up the cliff again, <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> another fat deer upon his shoulders. Instead of setting out, however, he summoned the whole crew together, and told them it was in vain to hope that he could kill a stag every day for their dinner, and therefore it was advisable to think of some other mode of satisfying their hunger.|$|E

60|$|Richard Naseby {{read the}} whole thing from {{beginning}} to end; and a crushing shame fell upon his spirit. His father had played the fool; he had gone out noisily to war, <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> confusion. The moment that his trumpets sounded, he had been disgracefully unhorsed. There was no question as to the facts; they were one and all against the Squire. Richard would have given his ears to have suppressed the issue; but as {{that could not be}} done, he had his horse saddled, and furnishing himself with a convenient staff, rode off at once to Thymebury.|$|E

60|$|A {{bright light}} {{streamed}} through the window, flooding {{the opening and}} spreading in a wide circle on the ceiling. It was not difficult to understand what had happened. They {{had gone to the}} automobile <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> one of the head-lamps, an astute move in which I seemed to see the finger of Sam. The danger-spot thus rendered harmless, they renewed their attack on the door with a reckless vigour. The mallet had been superseded by some heavier instrument--of iron this time. I think {{it must have been the}} jack from the automobile. It was a more formidable weapon altogether than the mallet, and even our good oak door quivered under it.|$|E
60|$|Steele was readily found <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> me. He was as unlike {{himself as}} she was strange. But when they again faced each other, then they were indeed new to me.|$|R
