40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimated}} and analyzed the atmospheric turbidity {{behavior of the}} parameters α and β, that accompanies the Angstrom relation {{and the quality of}} atmospherical materials existent in an urban spot of high density in Turin, Italy. The values of α and β were compared with the number of particles present in the atmosphere with the <b>Aitken</b> <b>Nucleus</b> Counter. It is found that instantaneous values of α are very irregular during the day, indicating a variation in the dimension and shape of the aerosols. The behavior of the parameter β  is very regular during the day. This means that there is a small variation in the quantity of the material existent in the atmosphere during the period of observations...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{the total}} nucleus {{concentration}} and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) were acquired for several conditions representing both high normal and severe pollution levels for the Los Angeles Basin as well as clean filtered air. The data show that in filtered air {{there is a large}} photochemically induced increase in the total particle content within a few minutes after starting the lamp. The concentration of CCN remains near zero, until sufficient coagulation and condensation occurs on the smaller Aitken particles. The addition of gaseous pollutants to filtered air results in large increases in the photochemical production of both the cloud and <b>Aitken</b> <b>nucleus</b> concentration. Fogs were also generated under controlled, reproducible conditions in the cloud chamber and seeded with aerosols of various compounds which form monomolecular surface films at air-water interfaces. Visibility characteristics and droplet data were obtained. The data suggest that droplet growth on treated nuclei can be retarded but fog formation was not significantly altered by the chemical seeding...|$|E

The climatological means and extremc values of the <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> concentration were obtained and are presented in graphical form. A mean monthly stability index to measure the local stability of the atmosphere is developed and compared to the mean monthly values of thc <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> concentration...|$|R

5000|$|Today, {{his name}} is given by {{atmospheric}} scientists to the smallest atmospheric aerosol particles (<b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei),</b> those with a radius less than 0.1 micrometres. [...] This size range include the newly nucleated particles whose existence Aitken demonstrated.|$|R
40|$|<b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> (0. 002 or = r or = 0. 1 microns in the {{atmosphere}} are produced through gas-to-particle conversion processes, and they grow in size by heterogeneous nucleation processes and others to produce larger aerosol particles. In the study of global background aerosol pollution, full knowledge of such aerosol processes in the clean atmosphere is essentially required. In this sense, {{it is important to}} examine the behavior of aerosols in a clean atmosphere which is not contaminated directly by aerosols and gases emitted from the Earth's surface. The Antarctic atmosphere is thought to be such a clean atmosphere. From an extensive surface observation of aerosols carried out at Syowa Station (69 deg 00 'S, 39 deg 35 'E) Antarctica, it has been revealed that various phenomena relating to long-range transport of trace constituents and/or photochemical processes resulting in production or growth of aerosol particles are clearly observed in Antarctica. This paper gives a preliminary report of observations made by balloon-borne <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> sonde in 1983, at Syowa Station...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> sonde is reported. The sonde {{consists}} of an expansion fog chamber, which is similar in principle to the Pollak counter or the Aitken counter, as a measuring device of Aitken unclei concentration. The most important characteristics of the present fog chamber are {{that it is a}} very compact automatic one and it has a construction to keep expansion ratio constant irrespective of ambient pressure. The constant expansion ratio is an essential requirement for the measurement of <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> concentration at different heights by a balloon or an airplane. The variation of measured values during 50 times measurement for a same air sample is smaller than 3 % of the mean. Two identical fog chambers in the present sonde give Aitken unclei concentrations which agree within 50 (cm) ^ for the concentration range covering between about 200 and about 2000 cm^. A nuclei measuring signal is inserted into rawinsonde signal, which is transmitted to a ground station, every minute for 10 s. The total weight of a sonde is 9 kg, comprising a 5 kg fog chamber, a 3. 5 kg battery and a 0. 5 kg rawinsonde...|$|R
40|$|The aerosol {{soundings}} {{were carried}} out at Syowa Station (69 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 39 ° 352 ̆ 7 E), Antarctica in October 1983. The vertical distribution of concentrations of <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> (particles larger than 0. 002 μm in radii) up to 15 km in height was obtained at 1600 LT October 17 by use of the sonde which comprises an adiabatic expansion fog chamber with a photo-electric detector. The main results are summarized as follows : The mixing ratio of <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> higher than 1000 /mg is observed around 750, 600, 300 and above 200 mb, whereas the surface value is a few hundreds/mg. The maximum mixing ratio {{is seen in the}} stratosphere just above the tropopause. The tropospheric high-concentration layer seems to exist commonly over Antarctica, whereas the high concentration in the stratosphere is peculiar to the present sounding. The high concentration in the troposphere may give an evidence for the possible production of new particles through the photochemical gas-to-particle conversion process in the antarctic troposphere. The high concentration in the stratosphere, which may be partly attributed to the effect of eruption of El Chichon, may give an evidence for the possible occurrence of evaporation and recondensation of aerosol particles in the antarctic lower stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|To {{characterize}} the background aerosol in air off the California coast, observations of suspended particles {{were made in}} the summer and fall of 1970 on San Nicolas Island (SNI), located about 130 km west-south-west of Los Angeles. Measurements of the physical and chemical properties of aerosols showed that the particles are a complex mixture of material from marine and continental origins. The <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> population averaged 2400 cm− 3, while the particles > 0. 5 μm diameter averaged 20 – 100 cm− 3. The average total mass concentration of aerosol evaluated from 22 samples was 29. 8 μg m− 3, but the refined fraction defined as particles < 3. 5 μm diameter was 40...|$|R
40|$|A {{sampling}} and analysis technique that uses the binomial distribution to characterize stratospheric aerosol populations at the 95 % level of confidence is described. Particle samples obtained over Alaska during July 15 - 19, 1979, are used; the results show the presence of more small particles at lower altitude than at high altitudes. Calculations of the surface area and volume distributions for all aerosol samples collected are given. Evidence from these data suggests either that <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> are injected or diffused across the tropopause and rise into the stratosphere, where they mature into larger particles, or nuclei form in the lower stratosphere and become mature aerosols at high altitude. Samples obtained at another site give the same results, supporting {{the view that the}} process of injection or nucleation and maturing of aerosols with altitude may be global and need not occur only in locations exhibiting unique meteorologic features...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{measurements}} of particle size distributions obtained {{during the spring}} and summer of 1975 - 1976 at various locations in the high plains of the U. S. are presented. The instrumentation and techniques used to collect the data are described. Particle number, surface area, and volume distribution are measured; differences in particle concentrations are investigated. Variables in particle size are related to changes in strength of ground sources of <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei,</b> age of the particle population, and presence or absence of rain. An accumulation mode between particles diameters of 0. 1 - 1 micron, a coarse particle mode between particle diameters between 10 - 20 microns, and a nucleation mode at particle diameters less than 0. 1 micron are detected. The control of the accommodation and coarse particle modes and their influence on particle concentration are studied. The elemental composition of the particles is analyzed and the morphologies are examined with an electron scanner microscope...|$|R
40|$|Results {{of ozone}} and <b>Aitken</b> {{condensation}} <b>nuclei</b> measurements {{made over the}} rain forest in equatorial Africa during February 12 - 25, 1988 are presented. The results indicate {{the presence of a}} layer between 1 and 4 km altitude where these species are strongly enriched. Based on information derived from simultaneous measurements of other chemical and meteorological parameters, satellite imagery, and trajectory calculations, this enrichment is attributed to emissions from biomass burning in sub-Saharan Africa, from which ozone is formed by photochemical reactions...|$|R
40|$|Multi-decadal {{observations}} of aerosol microphysical properties from regionally representative sites {{can be used}} to challenge regional or global numerical models that simulate atmospheric aerosol. Presented here is an analysis of multi-decadal observations at Cape Grim (Australia) that characterise production and removal of the background marine aerosol in the Southern Ocean marine boundary layer (MBL) on both short-term weather-related and underlying seasonal scales. A trimodal aerosol distribution comprises <b>Aitken</b> <b>nuclei</b> (  350  nm) modes, with the Aitken mode dominating number concentration. Whilst the integrated particle number in the MBL over the clean Southern Ocean is only weakly dependent on wind speed, the different modes in the aerosol size distribution vary in their relationship with wind speed. The balance between a positive wind dependence in the coarse mode and negative dependence in the accumulation/CCN mode leads to a relatively flat wind dependence in summer and moderately strong positive wind dependence in winter. The changeover in wind dependence of these two modes occurs in a very small size range at the mode intersection, indicative of differences in the balance of production and removal in the coarse and accumulation/CCN modes. Whilst a marine biological source of reduced sulfur appears to dominate CCN concentration over the summer months (December to February), other components contribute to CCN over the full annual cycle. Wind-generated coarse-mode sea salt is an important CCN component year round and is the second-most-important contributor to CCN from autumn through to mid-spring (March to November). A portion of the non-seasonally dependent contributor to CCN can clearly be attributed to wind-generated sea salt, with the remaining part potentially being attributed to long-range-transported material. Under conditions of greater supersaturation, as expected in more convective cyclonic systems and their associated fronts, Aitken mode particles become increasingly important as CCN...|$|R
