As implementation of IPM measures and strategies has a high perceived risk, demonstration of and discussion on possibilities may be {{a key element in}} reducing the risk perception. Together with Dutch asparagus growers and chain partners, WUR and Aceera initiated a grower’s network to examine and discuss pest status and possible risk of a number of insect pests in asparagus, and possible IPM solutions. Such networks are a Dutch government initiative, aiming at improved knowledge transfer from (applied) science to several crop sectors. In the asparagus network insect pest species were determined; pest status was estimated, simultaneously assessing the growers´ knowledge of the species. Subsequently a species specific approach was formulated and tested. Control strategy of the <b>asparagus</b> <b>fly</b> (Plioreocepta poeciloptera Schrank) was focused on a monitoring system, which was developed and validated by Applied Plant Research in 2012 - 2015. The presence and population pressure of the flies was determined in cooperation with farmers based on sticky trap catches. The asparagus beetle (Crioceris asparagi Linnaeus) was mainly controlled by all kinds of mechanical technics and natural enemies. This publication presents the outcome of this network with the new goals of the EU as background, that make implementation of new control methods necessary...|$|E
5000|$|The miner is a {{possible}} passive vector of pathogenic species of fungi [...] {{that are responsible for}} the development of Fusarium crown and root rot and early decline of fields. Species in this fungal complex include Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium proliferatum, among others, and these can shave 5-8 years off the economic life span of an <b>asparagus</b> field. The <b>fly</b> may passively vector the fungi from spores injected into the asparagus plant from the ovipositor or the sites of mining damage may create entrance points for the fungal spores from windblown sand.|$|R
