5000|$|The {{simplest}} paired disparity code is <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> signal.Other paired disparity codes include 8B10B, [...] 8B12B, {{the modified}} AMI codes, coded <b>mark</b> <b>inversion,</b> and 4B3T.|$|R
5000|$|Pair each {{code word}} with the polarity-inverse of that code word. The {{receiver}} is {{designed so that}} either code word of the pair decodes to the same data bits, such as <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion,</b> Differential Manchester encoding, coded <b>mark</b> <b>inversion,</b> Miller encoding, etc.|$|R
50|$|Modified AMI {{codes are}} a digital {{telecommunications}} technique to maintain system synchronization. <b>Alternate</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> (AMI) line codes are modified by deliberate insertion of bipolar violations. There are {{several types of}} modified AMI codes, used in various T-carrier and E-carrier systems.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} codes are bipolar codes, where the pulses can be positive, {{negative}} or absent. In the typical <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> code, non-zero pulses alternate between being positive and negative. These rules may be violated to generate special symbols used for framing or other special purposes.|$|R
50|$|Vendor cables {{are often}} wired with tip and ring reversed—i.e. pins 1 and 2 reversed, or pins 4 and 5 reversed. This {{has no effect}} on the signal quality of the T1 signal, which is fully differential, and uses the <b>Alternate</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> (AMI) {{signaling}} scheme.|$|R
50|$|The H-ternary code {{has also}} timing superiority {{compared}} to similar ternary codes. Other ternary line code such as <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) also lacks the timing information when {{a run of}} zeros needs to be transmitted. This drawback is partly overcome by its modified version the high density bipolar with three zeros substitution (HDB3).|$|R
50|$|MLT-3 {{encoding}} (Multi-Level Transmit) is a {{line code}} (a signaling method used in a telecommunication system for transmission purposes) that uses three voltage levels. An MLT-3 interface emits less electromagnetic interference and requires less bandwidth than most other binary or ternary interfaces that operate at the same bit rate (see PCM for discussion on bandwidth / quantization tradeoffs), such as Manchester code or <b>Alternate</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term digital {{baseband}} modulation (or digital baseband transmission) {{is synonymous}} to line codes. These are methods to transfer a digital bit stream over an analog baseband channel (a.k.a. lowpass channel) using a pulse train, i.e. a discrete number of signal levels, by directly modulating the voltage or current on a cable or serial bus. Common examples are unipolar, non-return-to-zero (NRZ), Manchester and <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) codings.|$|R
50|$|If the {{characteristics}} of the input data do not follow the pattern that every eighth bit is '1', the coder using <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> adds a '1' after seven consecutive zeros to maintain synchronisation. On the decoder side, this extra '1' added by the coder is removed, recreating the correct data. Using this method the data sent between the coder and the decoder is longer than the original data by less than 1% on average.|$|R
50|$|T-carrier and E-carrier {{signals are}} {{transmitted}} using a scheme called bipolar encoding, a.k.a. <b>Alternate</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> (AMI), where a ONE {{is represented by}} a pulse, and a ZERO is represented by no pulse. Pulses (which represent ones) always alternate in polarity, so that if, for example two positive pulses are received in succession, the receiver knows that an error occurred (a violation) in that one or more bits were either added or deleted from the original signal.|$|R
5000|$|One kind of bipolar {{encoding}} is a paired disparity code, {{of which}} the simplest example is <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion.</b> In this code, a binary 0 is encoded as zero volts, as in unipolar encoding, whereas a binary 1 is encoded alternately as a positive voltage or a negative voltage. The name arose because, {{in the context of}} a T-carrier, a binary '1' is referred to as a [...] "mark", while a binary '0' is called a [...] "space".|$|R
50|$|The signal {{transmitted}} on a T1 line, {{referred to}} as the DS1 signal, consists of serial bits transmitted at the rate of 1.544 Mbps. The type of line code used is called <b>Alternate</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> (AMI). Digital Signal Designation is the classification of digital bit rates in the digital multiplex hierarchy used in transport of telephone signals from one location to another. DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a framing bit (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit, transmitted over a digital circuit called T1. T1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{optimization}} of an optical filtering module (OFM) of a single-channel 40 Gb/s transmission system with optical single-sideband modulation and <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> signaling. Sideband suppression and dispersion compensation are simultaneously {{performed by the}} fiber Bragg grating (FBG) optical filtering through amplitude and phase response, respectively. Different amounts of accumulated dispersion are compensated using an OFM based on optical switches and chirped FBGs with different accumulated dispersion. Linear transmission simulations to assess the OFM effectiveness yield a Q-factor penalty variation lower than 1 dB relative to back-to-back considering a maximum accumulated dispersion of 20400 ps/nm. A transmission distance of 1040 km of nonlinear standard single mode fiber is achieved with a Q-factor higher than 7...|$|R
40|$|Multilevel analog {{signaling}} {{techniques are}} rapidly gaining favor {{for their ability}} to provide very high-speed symbol transfer rates at appreciably lower observed line rates. Early bipolar methods such as <b>Alternate</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> have paved the way to signaling techniques using four or more levels. In light of rapidly growing interest in multimedia communications, a particularly important application of multilevel signaling methods is Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Base-T), which combines Five-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM 5) with the use of parallel differential signal lines to increase symbol rates while retaining low line rates. For device manufacturers, however, multilevel signaling poses new challenges for achieving reliable, high-throughput testing needed to deliver required levels of quality and productio...|$|R
50|$|Initially, T1 used <b>Alternate</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Inversion</b> (AMI) {{to reduce}} {{frequency}} bandwidth {{and eliminate the}} DC component of the signal. Later B8ZS became common practice. For AMI, each mark pulse had the opposite polarity of the previous one and each space was {{at a level of}} zero, resulting in a three level signal which however only carried binary data. Similar British 23 channel systems at 1.536 megabaud in the 1970s were equipped with ternary signal repeaters, in anticipation of using a 3B2T or 4B3T code {{to increase the number of}} voice channels in future, but in the 1980s the systems were merely replaced with European standard ones. American T-carriers could only work in AMI or B8ZS mode.|$|R
40|$|The novel {{concept of}} spatio-Temporal {{modulation}} of Nyquist pulses is introduced, {{and the resulting}} wave-packets are termed Nyquist Localized Waves (LWs). Ideal Nyquist LWs belong to the generic family of LW solutions and can propagate indefinitely in unbounded media without attenuation or chromatic dispersion. The possibility of modulating Nyquist LWs for free-space optical (FSO) communication systems is demonstrated using two different modulation techniques. The first technique is on-off keying (OOK) with <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) coding for 1 -bit per symbol transmission, and the second one is 16 -Ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM) for 4 -bits per symbol transmission. Aspects related to the performance, detection and generation of the spatio-Temporally coupled wave-packets are discussed and future research directions are outlined. © 2012 Optical Society of America...|$|R
50|$|Appendix III of G.961 {{specifies}} a {{line system}} based on the Time Compression Multiplex (TCM) duplex method and an <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) line code. The AMI line code maps one input bit to one ternary symbol. Like with MMS43, the ternary symbol can either be a positive (+), zero (0), or negative (-) voltage. A 0 bit is represented by a zero voltage, while a 1 bit is alternatingly represented by a positive and a negative voltage, resulting in a DC-bias free signal. In a 2.5 ms interval, each side can send a 1.178 ms frame representing 360 bits of 2B+D data. To the 2B+D data, an 8-bit preamble, 8 bits from the CL channel, {{as well as a}} parity bit are added, yielding a frame size of 377 bits and a baud rate of 320 kilobaud. The CL channel is used for operations and maintenance, as well transmitting a 12-bit CRC covering 4 frames.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{theoretical}} {{analysis for}} evaluating {{the performance of a}} lincoded continuous phase optical frequency shift keying (CPFSK) optical transmission system with delay line demodulation receiver is presented. It accounts for the combined effects of signal phase distortion due to polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and group velocity dispersion (GVD) in a single mode fiber. The analysis is carried out for three different linecoding schemes, i. e., <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion,</b> order- 1 and delay modulation coding, to investigate the efficacy of the linecoding in counteracting the effect of PMD in CPFSK optical transmission system. The average bit error rate (BER) performance results are evaluated with line codes and compared with NRZ-CPFSK system at a bit rate of 10 Gb/s considering Maxwellian probability distribution for the mean differential group delay (DGD) due to PMD. The results show that the penalty improvement of line coded systems is within 0. 5 dB to 1. 95 dB with respect to NRZ data at a BER of 10 - 9. I...|$|R
50|$|Legacy T1 {{carriers}} operated {{using the}} <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) line code, more recently also B8ZS, on two wire pairs. Each wire pair was operated in simplex, that is, one wire pair {{was used for}} transmission in each direction. The Nyquist frequency of a 1.544 megabaud signal is 772 kHz. Higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly than lower frequencies, motivating the use of technologies that reduce the signal bandwidth. In HDSL, full duplex by means of echo cancellation is used, enabling simultaneous transmission in both directions {{on each of the}} two wire pairs, effectively reducing the symbol rate by a factor two. Through the use of 2B1Q encoding, two bits are combined to one symbol, further reducing the symbol rate by a factor of two. For this two-pair 2B1Q variant of HDSL, framing increases the bitrate from 1.544 Mbit/s to 1.568 Mbit/s, resulting in a symbol rate of 392 kilobaud and a Nyquist frequency of 196 kHz.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike with Manchester encoding, {{only the}} {{presence}} of a transition is important, not the polarity. Differential coding schemes will work exactly the same if the signal is inverted (e.g. wires swapped). Other line codes with this property include NRZI, bipolar encoding, coded <b>mark</b> <b>inversion,</b> and MLT-3 encoding.|$|R

40|$|<b>Marked</b> surface <b>inversions</b> occur most {{frequently}} in dry continental climates, where low atmospheric humidity allows heat transfer by long wave thermal radiation. In the northern latitudes, surface inversions reach their maximum intensity during the winter, when the incoming Sun's radiation is negligible and radiative cooling is dominant {{during the long}} nights. During winter, air mass boundaries are sharp, which causes formation of <b>marked</b> surface <b>inversions.</b> The existence of these inversions and sharp boundaries {{increase the risk of}} wind shear.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to incorporate cobalt atoms into a magnetite single crystal {{is demonstrated by}} a combination of x-ray spectro-microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and density-functional theory calculations. Co is deposited at room temperature on the reconstructed magnetite (001) surface filling first the subsurface octahedral vacancies and then occupying adatom sites on the surface.

The oxidation state, coordination, and magnetic moments of the cobalt atoms are followed from their adsorption to their final incorporation into the bulk, mostly as octahedral Co.
