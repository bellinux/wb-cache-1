40|$|Due {{to growing}} {{complexities}} in business-to-business products, {{the relationship between}} a seller and a buyer usually never ends after the purchase transaction. Customers buy augmented products, expecting bundle of values that come with the product which will satisfy the buyer. Thus, integrating services into the core offerings in manufacturing industries has taken crucial importance. Especially, <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> is considered a tool for enhancing a valuable advantage for the customer as well as it is a business opportunity for the company. <b>After-sales</b> <b>services</b> have proven to be of importance, and a strategic after-sales framework is necessary. Three major activities that play a crucial role within the <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> in the manufacturing industry are field technical assistance, spare parts distribution and customer care. However, intensive studies regarding after-sales in a specific industry are lacking. This thesis focuses on the Swedish heavy equipment machinery industry organizations of different sizes and thus, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate the major activities of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> focusing on customer relationship among three classified sizes of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> providers. A multiple case study has been carried out in the form of semi-structured interviews with three organizations; one small, one medium and one large size <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> providers. The study reveals that customer care is the most focused activity of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> in the heavy equipment machinery industry in Sweden. Simultaneously, it shows the most significant differences of offers depending on the size of the company, in relation to the remaining activities.   Field technical assistance appears to be the part of after-sales that produces least profit in the industry. Thus, it might be the reason that small organizations would rather tend to outsource it, in order to avoid high costs.   Spare parts distribution can be considered as the most profitable activity of after-sales. The warehouses and repair centers of companies naturally varied according to firm sizes. Although the organizations do not state formal goals for providing <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> to its customers, they are aware of its importance and aim for satisfying customer demands. All organizations are convinced that if <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> are not handled properly, they face the risk of losing the customer. Finally, this research indicates that organizations in the heavy equipment machinery industry have a lot of room for improvements to its after-sales activities with respect to their relationship with customers, which can be accomplished in strategic and systematic ways.     Keywords: <b>After-sales</b> <b>service,</b> Field technical <b>assistance,</b> Spare parts distribution, Customer care, Customer relationship marketing, Firm siz...|$|R

The scope of this research is to analyse how the specific characteristics of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> affect a company’s manufacturing strategy, which in effect should become an operations strategy not only considering the manufacturing of goods. Considering the <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> as a product, consisting of both good and service characteristics, the objective of this dissertation is to develop conceptual models for an improved long-term management of operations where production of both new goods and <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> are competing for the same or similar resources. Specifically, the structural decision categories of a manufacturing strategy, process technology, capacity, facilities, and vertical integration, are adapted to include the demands of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> products. The research result is an extension of the existing manufacturing strategy framework, which is transformed towards a more general operations strategy framework capable of providing managerial guidance for a larger set of products than just pure goods. Tools are developed for analysing what processes would be suitable for the <b>after-sales</b> <b>services,</b> and whether the after-sales processes should be merged with, or separated from, the new goods process.

The accents of {{the study}} fall upon the {{required}} form of the contemporary trends of consumer markets development necessary for expanding the conceptual base of after-sales marketing and its strategic orientation. A thorough analysis {{has been made of}} the <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> market as subject {{of the study}}. Identified are the aspects of after-sales consumer behavior on the market of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services.</b> Some directions and approaches to market segmentation oriented to after-sales phase are suggested. 1. THE MARKET FOR AFTER-SALE SERVICES AS A SUBJECT TO RESEARCH Current trends in development of consumer markets show a tendency towards active organization of the after-sale phase of exchange pursuing long-term commitment with consumers by fully satisfying their demands. Within the still prevailing tendency in "mainstream marketing " for strong emphasis on the before-sale phase and the sale phase itself, the necessity arises for studying the strategic and tactic dimensions of <b>after-sale</b> marketing of <b>services</b> on consumer markets. The issues related to the market for services as a whole, and that for <b>after-sale</b> <b>services</b> on the consumer market in particular, are quite different from those concerning the goods market. This difference stems from the conceptual characteristics of services such as their intangibility, inseparability of production and consumption, heterogeneity (or diversity), limited durability, etc. The growing competition on the market for <b>after-sale</b> <b>services</b> at consumer level makes it necessary to develop further the concept and the implements of the after-sale marketing of those services. The main driving force for such a development are the skills of marketing specialists, dealing with the service market sector.

Introduction and objectives: <b>After-sales</b> <b>services</b> have become paramount in the automobile industry. However, they are not sufficiently researched, particularly in emerging markets.

Thus no explicit knowledge can be applied regarding emerging markets service demand behaviour, which might be a crucial point, as some of these countries culture is different to the western culture. Methods: The research is based in a survey carried out among Chinese premium brand automotive customers.
