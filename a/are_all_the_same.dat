5|$|Voalavo {{is a small}} rodent {{resembling}} a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to Monticolomys koopmani. In terms of external morphology, Voalavo is barely different from Eliurus; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of mammae (six) <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in both genera. However, all species of Eliurus have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs {{at the tip of}} the tail, a feature that is absent in Voalavo, although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of Eliurus, Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but V.antsahabensis has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the pads of the feet are larger in Eliurus, and specifically, the thenar pad (located at the middle of the tarsus) is circular and fairly small in Voalavo, but longer and larger in Eliurus. On the chest, Voalavo species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in Eliurus. Unlike all other nesomyines but Brachyuromys, Voalavo lacks an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).|$|E

25|$|Critics, {{such as the}} American Council of the Blind, {{note that}} U.S. bills are {{relatively}} hard to tell apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint secondary color was added), and they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value and/or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use of Braille codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because (1) these markings would only be useful to people {{who know how to}} read Braille, and (2) one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is rubbed off. Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in their wallets, they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-reading machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still have to trust sighted people or machines each time they receive US banknotes.|$|E

500|$|Actress {{and writer}} Jacquetta May, {{who played the}} {{character}} Rachel Kominski between 1991 and 1993, has discussed the storyline {{and the role of}} women in an article about EastEnders. According to May, the scriptwriters were faced with a problem once Peggy, [...] "a key figure of the community", was shown to exhibit such [...] "pig-headed ignorance and appalling prejudice". In order for Peggy to be redeemed, she had to be seen to be punished, and so the character was given breast-cancer later that year. May comments, [...] "Peggy, malicious gossip and bigot, herself becomes the victim of a life-threatening illness. At Christmas they run a Christian forgiveness story. Peggy calls on Mark and tells him she now knows what it is like to suffer as he has. She apologises, thus underlining one of the basic tenets of the programme: underneath the skin we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> human and vulnerable, and recognition of this should unite us not divide us. Along the way, a great deal of useful information about these illnesses was broadcast. So, although EastEnders endlessly repeats its conservative format, and although all issues are there primarily to feed the great hungry story-beast, its positive by-products cannot be denied." ...|$|E
500|$|At this time, the anarcho-syndicalists {{were still}} {{at the head of}} the labor {{movement}} in Cuba. However, despite the maritime, railway, restaurant and tobacco industries being controlled by organized anarchists, it wasn't until 1925 that a major anarchist federation was successfully organized by workers. Similar to the ConfederaciÃ³n Nacional del Trabajo of Spain, non-anarchist members of the ConfederaciÃ³n Nacional Obrera Cubana (National Cuban Workers Confederation), eventually formed the Communist Party of Cuba in August 1925. By this time, many anarchists (including Alfredo LÃ³pez and Carlos BaliÃ±o) had become swept up in the excitement about the Russian Revolution, and had become party to more authoritarian forms of organizing. Many strikes occurred in the fall of 1925, and the government, once again under the leadership of Machado, was quick to suppress the labor movement. Several labor leaders were shot, and several hundred Spanish anarchists were deported in one month. Machado stated [...] "You are right - I don't know what anarchism is, what socialism is, what communism is. For me they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> All bad patriots." [...] Alfredo LÃ³pez, then secretary-general of the CNOC, was arrested first in October 1925, and encouraged to join the government, followed by a second arrest in July 1926. He was [...] "disappeared" [...] at this point, only to have his body found in 1933, after the fall of the Machado government.|$|E
