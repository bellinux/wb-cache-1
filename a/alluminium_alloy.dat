40|$|Abstract. During {{the past}} decades, {{increasing}} requirement in aircraft for high-performance, lightweight structures have caused strong interests {{on the development}} of fiber-metal laminates (FMLs), which are manufractured from thin layers of glass fibre reinforced composite and <b>alluminium</b> <b>alloy.</b> In this paper, the nonlinear dynamic response problem of the FML plate subjected to unstable temperature with interfacial damage is analyzed. Based on the weak bonded theory, the interfacial constitutive relations of the FML are constructed. According to the Hamilton’s variance principle, the nonlinear motion equations of the FML with interfacial damages subjected to the unstable thermal field are obtained. And then, the finite difference, Newmark- β and the iteration method are applied to solve the nonlinear motion equations. In the numerical examples, the effects of the interface damage, the amplitude and frequency of imposed loads and the temperature fields on the nonlinear dynamic response of the FML plates are investigated. And in conclusion, the effects of various type of temperature on the nonlinear dynamic response of FML plate are different obviously...|$|E
40|$|The Cambridge Stereoscan {{electron}} microscope facilitates detailed examination of nematode cuticle. Specimens {{must not be}} covered and all volatile liquid must be removed. The least distorted specimens were those impregnated with anhydrous glycerol or polyethylene glycol (400) the excess of which was drained from the surface before they were mounted and plated with gold/palladium in a vacuum chamber The Cambridge "Stereoscan " {{electron microscope}} scans the outer surface of specimens with a focussed beam of electrons in an evacuated chamber. A signal due to reflected primary electrons and emitted secondaries is collected and used to modulate the brightness of a cathode ray tube scanned in synchronism with the beam (Oatley, Nixon & Pease, 1965). This gives a picture with great depth of focus. The surface of the sample must be electrically conducting to prevent charge build-up due to the electron beam; resolutions down to 200 A. U. can then be achieved in some cases. The specimen holder used has a 12 mm diameter mounting disc of <b>alluminium</b> <b>alloy.</b> The maximum area of scan was 4 mm 2 but {{any part of the}} mounting area can be examined from almost any angle: this makes it difficul...|$|E
40|$|Subject of investigation: {{technology}} of production of wear-resistant coatings. Purpose of the work: investigation {{and development of}} a highly effective technology for producing a high-hardness oxide coating on automotive parts made from cast aluminium alloys in an ozonized medium. Laws are found concerning {{the influence of the}} component composition of the ozonized aqueous solution of the sulphuric acid used as an ozonizing medium on the phase state of conversion films on aluminium alloys. A technology is proposed for production of a thick coating on <b>alluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> parts under the conditions of domination of oxygen ions. The developed {{technology of}} production of oxide coating for alloy AL 9 in the ozonizing conditions makes it possible to obtain coatings, the microhardness of which reaches 7000 MPa. Changes in the oxidation conditions increase the productivity of the process by 40 - 70 % and provide a possibility of its introduction at a reduced concentration of the sulphuric electrolyte from 20 to 2, 5 %. The technology of oxidation of fuel pump parts is introced at some automotive engineering plants.

Fatigue and boiling heat transfer behaviour of this alloy after. shot peenir-fg was studied. Out of 0. 2 N and 0. 4 N peening intensities, 0. 4 N gave higher improvement on fatigue strength and boiling heat transfer. Fatigue of butt welded aluminium joints were also studied. Shot peening wi th zirconium oxide shots at 0. 4 N intensity {{was found to be}} more advantageous than glass beads. Welding reduces 19. 4 % fatigue strength compared to virgin samples. Effect of corrosive (3 N Nacl) environment on fatigue strength was alos studied. Zir shots were found to be economical. The commercial application of shot peening in automobiles t o enhance boiling heat transfer was also studied. The heat trans-fer media then used was the coolant commonly used in Car ra-diators.
