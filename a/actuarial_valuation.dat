As an arbitrage-free pricing principle requires specification of an equivalent martingale measure, we characterize all equivalent martingale measures in a very general combined insurance and financial model.

40|$|This {{paper has}} two parts. In the first, we apply the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) {{methodology}} to the modelling of longevity bond prices. The {{idea of using}} the HJM methodology is not new. We can cite Cairns et al. [Cairns A. J., Blake D., Dowd K, 2006. Pricing death: framework for the valuation and the securitization of mortality risk. Astin Bull., 36 (1), 79 - 120], Miltersen and Persson [Miltersen K. R., Persson S. A., 2005. Is mortality dead? Stochastic force of mortality determined by arbitrage? Working Paper, University of Bergen] and Bauer [Bauer D., 2006. An arbitrage-free family of longevity bonds. Working Paper, Ulm University]. Unfortunately, none of these papers properly defines the prices of the longevity bonds {{they are supposed to}} be studying. Accordingly, the main contribution of this section is to describe a coherent theoretical setting in which we can properly define these longevity bond prices. A second objective of this section is to describe a more realistic longevity bonds market model than in previous papers. In particular, we introduce an additional effect of the actual mortality on the longevity bond prices, that does not appear in the literature. We also study multiple term structures of longevity bonds instead of the usual single term structure. In this framework, we derive a no-arbitrage condition for the longevity bond financial market. We also discuss the links between such HJM based models and the intensity models for longevity bonds such as those of Dahl [Dahl M., 2004. Stochastic mortality in life insurance: Market reserves and mortality-linked insurance contracts, Insurance: Math. Econom. 35 (1) 113 - 136], Biffis [Biffis E., 2005. Affine processes for dynamic mortality and <b>actuarial</b> <b>valuations.</b> Insurance: Math. Econom. 37, 443 - 468], Luciano and Vigna [Luciano E. and Vigna E., 2005. Non mean reverting affine processes for stochastic mortality. ICER working paper], Schrager [Schrager D. F., 2006. Affine stochastic mortality. Insurance: Math. Econom. 38, 81 - 97] and Hainaut and Devolder [Hainaut D., Devolder P., 2007. Mortality modelling with Levy processes. Insurance: Math. Econom. (in press) ], and suggest the standard pricing formula of these intensity models could be extended to more general settings. In the second part of this paper, we study the asset allocation problem of pure endowment and annuity portfolios. In order to solve this problem, we study the "risk-minimizing" strategies of such portfolios, when some but not all longevity bonds are available for trading. In this way, we introduce different basis risks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{defined benefit}} pension plans, the primary {{function}} of the <b>actuarial</b> <b>valuation</b> is to determine appropriate contribution rates from the plan sponsor. For this reason, the valuation discount rate {{is based on the}} expected return on the assets of the pension fund and the definition of the actuarial liability can very according to the funding objectives. The valuation of pension liabilities for financial reporting purposes requires a unique definition of the accrued liabilities and a unique discount rate to value these liabilities. Equilibrium pricing theory can be used to derive a formula for the discount rate that should be used to value final salary pension liabilities. Based on UK data, however, the required risk-adjustment appears to be small. Modern pension accounting standards make no allowance for market risk, but use an ad-hoc approach to allow for default risk.

40|$|Purpose –The {{demographic}} risk is {{the risk}} due to the uncertainty in the demographic scenario assumptions by which life insurance products are designed and valued. The uncertainty lies both in the accidental (insurance risk) and systematic (longevity risk) deviations {{of the number of}} deaths from the value anticipated for it. This last component gives rise to the risk due to the randomness in the choice of the survival model for valuations (model risk or projection risk). If the insurance risk component can be assumed negligible for well-diversified portfolios, {{as in the case of}} pension annuities, longevity risk is crucial in the <b>actuarial</b> <b>valuations.</b> The question is particularly decisive in contexts in which the longevity phenomenon of the population is strong and pension annuity portfolios constitute a meaningful slice of the financial market – both typical elements of Western economies. The paper aims to focus on the solvency appraisal for a portfolio of life annuities, deepening the impact of the demographic risk according to suitable risk indexes apt to describe its evolution in time. Design/methodology/approach – The financial quantity proposed for representing the economic wealth of the life insurance company is the stochastic surplus, and the paper analyses the impact on it of different demographic assumptions by means of risk indicators as the projection risk index, the quantile surplus valuation and the ruin probability. By means of the proposed models, the longevity risk is mainly taken into account in a stochastic scenario for the financial risk component, in order to consider their interactions, too. In order to furnish practical details significant in the portfolio risk management, several numerical applications clarify the practical meaning of the models in the solvency context. Findings – This paper studies the impact on the portfolio surplus of the systematic demographic risk, taking into account their interaction with the financial risk sources. In this order of ideas, the internal risk profile of a life annuity portfolio is deeply investigated by means of suitable risk indexes: in a solvency analysis perspective, some possible scenarios for the evolution of death rates (generated by different survival models) are considered and this paper evaluates the impact on the portfolio surplus caused by different choices of the demographic model. The first index is deduced by a variance decomposition formula, the other ones involve the conditional quantile calculus and the ruin probability. Such indexes constitute benchmarks, whose conjoined use provides useful information to the meeting of the solvency requirements. Originality/value – With respect to the recent actuarial literature, in which the most important contribution on the surplus analysis has been given by Lisenko et al. – where the analysis focuses on the financial aspect applied to portfolios of temporary and endowment contracts – the paper considers life annuity portfolios, taking into account the effect of the systematic demographic risk and its interactions with the financial risk components...|$|R
40|$|The Solvency II {{directive}} {{has introduced}} a specific so-called risk-neutral framework to valuate economic accounting quantities throughout European life insurance companies.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide {{an analysis of the}} Variable Annuity (VA) products. In particular, we focus on the <b>actuarial</b> and financial <b>valuation</b> of some embedded guarantees in VAs, derive No-arbitrage pricing models and study the impact of mortality risk. We have decided to deal with this products in the light of significant international success obtained by VAs and we believe that perspectives of their development in Italy market and throughout Europe and Asia are favourable. One of the reasons of this success is the presence of guarantees which offer partial protection against the downside movements of the interest rates or the equity market, an attractive feature for the individual retirement security. The shift from defined benefit to self-directed defined contribution plans and the reform of the Social Retirement System in many countries, so that it includes personal accounts, have encouraged the proliferation of new kind of products. Owing to the long term horizon of their commitments, pension funds are exposed to important financial risk due to the volatility of interest rates and equity markets. At this regard, VAs were first introduced by insurance companies in the 1970 s in the United States to compete with mutual funds. Over the years, many practical and academic contributions have been offered for describing the VAs and the guarantees embedded. Most of the earlier literature (e. g., Rentz Jr. (1972) and Green (1973)) is constituted by empirical works dealing with product comparisons rather than pricing and hedging issues. It was not until recently that some guarantees were discussed by practitioners (e. g., J. P. Morgan (2004), Lehman Brothers (2005), Milliman (2007)); they highlight the growing opportunities to introduce VAs in new markets. Recently, the academic literature has shown a fervent interest to the topic too (cfr. Bauer et al. (2006), Chen et al. (2008), Coleman et al. (2006), Dai (2008), Holz (2006), Milevsky and Panyagometh (2001), Milevsky and Posner (2001), Milevsky M. A and Promislow S. D (2001), Milevsky and Salisbury(2002)., Milevsky and Salisbury (2006), Nielsen and Sandmann (2003)). Bauer et al. offer the first universal general framework in which any design of options and guarantees currently offered within Variable Annuities can be modeled. Besides the valuation of a contract assuming that the policyholder follows a given strategy with respect to surrender and withdrawals, they are able to price contracts with different embedded options. Milevsky und Posner (2001) price various types of guaranteed minimum death benefits. They present closed form solutions for this option in case of an exponential mortality law and numerical results for the more realistic Gompertz-Makeham law. They find that in general these guarantees are overpriced in the market. In Milevsky und Salisbury (2006), the authors price GMWB options. Besides a static approach, where deterministic withdrawal strategies are assumed, they calculate the value of the option in a dynamic approach. Here, the option is valuated under optimal policyholder behavior. They show that under realistic parameter assumptions optimally at least the annually guaranteed withdrawal amount should be withdrawn. Furthermore, they find that such options are usually underpriced in the market. This result is in contrast with the common belief that the guarantees embedded in variable annuity policies are overpriced (see Clements (2004)). This thesis aims at following this literature by proposing some theoretical and practical innovative works. Our original contributions lie in: 1) describe how the value of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB) options evolves over time and in the presence of mortality changes and produce an application to Italian data; 2) study the insurance surplus over time for a portfolio of Variable Annuities with GMDB Options and offer a model {{that can be used for}} an evaluation of the adequacy of solvency; 3) develop a sensitivity analysis for the value of Guaranteed Lifelong Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) options under the hypothesis of a static withdrawal strategy; 4) decompose a VA with a GLWB option into a life annuity plus a portfolio of Quanto Asian Put Options, with decreasing strikes and increasing expiration dates, and verify that this product is underpriced on US market...|$|R
