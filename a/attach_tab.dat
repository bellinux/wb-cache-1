40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation conducted in the NACA 7 by 10 -foot wind tunnel of control surfaces equipped with tabs for reducing the control forces or trimming the aircraft. Two sizes of ordinary ailerons with several sizes of <b>attached</b> and inset <b>tabs</b> were tested on a Clark y wing.

A tail-surface model of symmetrical section, equipped with tabs, was tested with 40 percent of the area movable (elevator) when used as a horizontal tail and 60 percent of the area movable (rudder) when used as a vertical tail.

The introductory chapters deal with meaning and signification of catechesis, its goals, forms, methods and requirements of today's world. The following parts characterized, its principles, goals and types. The next chapter describes relations between theology and theatre as ?parent? branches of catechesis and drama education. The next part compares catechesis and drama education, their general characteristics [principles], goals and methods. This comparison reveals the common colouring and focus of both fields ? focus on complex harmonius development of individuals, - on relationships [with God], with oneself, with people, with the world around, - on life situations, especially crisis, - on overlaps [truth, beauty, symbol ?]. The author sets four basic areas which can make drama education effective in catechesis. They are: aesthetic element ? education via art, expressing oneself {{through the medium of}} symbols, games and work with a story. The next part of the work elaborates the four areas and shows their significance for catechesis.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and computational {{investigation of the}} effect of lift enhancing tabs on a two-element airfoil was conducted. The objective {{of the study was to}} develop an understanding of the flow physics associated with lift enhancing tabs on a multi-element airfoil. A NACA 63 (sub 2) - 215 ModB airfoil with a 30 percent chord Fowler flap was tested in the NASA Ames 7 by 10 foot wind tunnel. Lift enhancing tabs of various heights were tested on both the main element and the flap for a variety of flap riggings. Computations of the flow over the two-element airfoil were performed using the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes code INS 2 D-UP. The computer results predict all of the trends in the experimental data quite well. When the flow over the flap upper surface is <b>attached,</b> <b>tabs</b> mounted at the main element trailing edge (cove tabs) produce very little change in lift. At high flap deflections. however, the flow over the flap is separated and cove tabs produce large increases in lift and corresponding reductions in drag by eliminating the separated flow. Cove tabs permit high flap deflection angles to be achieved and reduce the sensitivity of the airfoil lift to the size of the flap gap. <b>Tabs</b> <b>attached</b> to the flap training edge (flap tabs) are effective at increasing lift without significantly increasing drag. A combination of a cove tab and a flap tab increased the airfoil lift coefficient by 11 percent relative to the highest lift tab coefficient achieved by any baseline configuration at an angle of attack of zero percent and the maximum lift coefficient was increased by more than 3 percent. A simple analytic model based on potential flow was developed to provide a more detailed understanding of how lift enhancing tabs work. The tabs were modeled by a point vortex at the training edge. Sensitivity relationships were derived which provide a mathematical basis for explaining the effects of lift enhancing tabs on a multi-element airfoil. Results of the modeling effort indicate that the dominant effects of the tabs on the pressure distribution of each element of the airfoil can be captured with a potential flow model for cases with no flow separation...|$|R

It lies in an area {{with a long history}} of {{volcanic}} and glacial activity, extending from Lassen Peak in northern California northward into Canada. In the middle of the park is Crater Lake, which formed about 7, 700 years ago after the climatic eruption of Mount Mazama. The lake occupies the collapsed caldera of the mountain. The lake is 7 to 9. 5 km (4. 5 to 6 mi) across, has 32 km (20 mi) of shoreline, a surface area of 5, 339 ha (13, 192 acres), and a depth of 597 m (1, 958 ft) at its deepest point, making it the deepest lake in the USA. Annually, about 500, 000 visitors come to see the famous deep blue lake. Early scientists were not content to merely gaze at the sublime beauty of the lake. They longed to know what lay beneath.

50|$|With the {{continued}} {{growth of the}} company Alexander Simpson began to take more control of the business, and in 1935 DAKS gained further fame for the S Simpson brand as an innovation in the tailoring world of the first self-supporting trouser. He went about to invent a way to support his trousers that wouldn’t need braces as these interrupted his swing whilst playing golf and caused his shirt to become untucked. The DAKS trouser was invented - it had a channel within the waistband at the back wherein an elasticated strip was attached at the sides with <b>tabs</b> <b>attached</b> {{to one of two}} buttons for adjustment. On the inside of the waistband were sewn-on rubber pads that gripped the shirt and stopped it from becoming loose. This happened in a world where to buy a pair of trousers of high quality one would have to have a bespoke pair made by a tailor, and thus this new design allowed the ease of ready-to-wear trousers. Simpson was so sure of his new design that he had 100,000 pairs made before being introduced to the public at a high price of 30 shillings in a time when a whole bespoke suit would cost 50 shillings. The trousers were available in many colours and fabrics that weren’t generally associated with menswear. They became so popular that the trousers were incorporated into suits and soon after a DAKS womenswear line was released, using the patented waistband for skirting.|$|R
