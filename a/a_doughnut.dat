5|$|Commercially {{prepared}} old-fashioned doughnut batter mixes are mass-produced in the United States, {{which may}} be prepared by simply adding cold water to the mix. Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> maker, which upon turning a hand crank, drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E
5|$|Leonard's Bakery is a Portuguese bakery in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{known for}} popularizing the malasada. The fried pastry, {{slightly}} crispier and chewier than <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> {{and with no}} hole, {{is known as a}} cuisine of Hawaii. Though Portuguese immigrants brought the malasada to Hawaii {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, Leonard's opened in 1952 and brought it to a wider audience. Leonard's is a household name in Hawaii and is well known in the continental United States and internationally. A franchise location opened in Japan in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, two {{spaces are}} homeomorphic {{if one can}} be {{deformed}} into the other without cutting or gluing. A traditional joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from <b>a</b> <b>doughnut,</b> since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} 1990s comic series, Holey Crullers, {{centered on}} <b>a</b> chain of <b>doughnut</b> shops named [...] "Holey Crullers". The name was a word-play on <b>a</b> type of <b>doughnut,</b> <b>a</b> cruller {{with a hole}} in the center, that paid homage to the regular outbursts of Robin in the 1960s era Batman.|$|R

25|$|On July 1, 2010, Krispy Kreme {{introduced}} <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> {{that included}} the soft drink Cheerwine, {{which was to be}} sold in grocery stores in North and South Carolina during July. The doughnuts proved so popular, the Salisbury, North Carolina Krispy Kreme location (the town where Cheerwine is made), sold them as well. After July 31, this was the only place to get them. The Cheerwine Kreme doughnut returned for July 2011 and made its debut in Tennessee and Roanoke, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} are diamonds {{produced in}} a technological process {{as opposed to}} natural diamonds, which are created in geological processes. Synthetic diamonds are also widely known as HPHT diamonds or CVD diamonds, HPHT and CVD being the production methods, high-pressure high-temperature synthesis and chemical vapor deposition, respectively. Although the concept of producing high quality artificial diamonds is an old one, the reproducible synthesis of diamonds is not. In 1954, Howard Tracy Hall at the GE Research Laboratory invented a belt press {{in the shape of}} <b>a</b> <b>doughnut,</b> which confined the sample chamber and two curved, tapered pistons to apply pressure on the chamber in order to produce the first commercially successful and reproducible synthesis of a diamond.|$|E

25|$|On December 30, the New York Post {{reported}} that several sanitation workers confessed that cleanup was intentionally slowed down {{to protest the}} aforementioned budget cuts. On January 3, 2011, WCBS-TV {{reported that}} prosecutors had obtained a video of two sanitation trucks driving down 155th Street in Whitestone, Queens after the blizzard with their plows raised {{so as not to}} remove the snow. Allegations were also made that sanitation workers slept on the job, hung out at <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> shop for 11 straight hours while on the job, and drank beer for six or seven hours while on the job. Claims were also made that supervisors encouraged such work stoppages. However, a month later, the New York Times reported that the allegations of a slowdown remained unsubstantiated and that Councilman Daniel Halloran, who had originally reported the confessions, had not named his sources.|$|E
25|$|Herring {{are among}} the most {{spectacular}} schooling fish. They aggregate together in huge numbers. Schools have been measured at over four cubic kilometres in size, containing about four billion fish. These schools move along coastlines and traverse the open oceans. Herring schools in general have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant cruising speeds. Herrings have excellent hearing, and their schools react very fast to a predator. The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a vacuole which can look like <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> from a spotter plane. The intricacies of schooling is far from fully understood, especially the swimming and feeding energetics. Many hypotheses to explain the function of schooling have been suggested, such as better orientation, synchronized hunting, predator confusion and reduced risk of being found. Schooling also has disadvantages, such as excretion buildup in the breathing media and oxygen and food depletion. The way the fish array in the school probably gives energy saving advantages, though this is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like <b>a</b> <b>doughnut,</b> whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E

25|$|George Doundoulakis, who {{directed}} research at General Bronze Corporation in Garden City, New York, along with Zachary Sears, {{who directed}} Internal Design at Digital B & E Corporation, New York, received the RFP from Cornell University for the antenna design {{and studied the}} idea of suspending the feed with his brother, Helias Doundoulakis, a civil engineer. George Doundoulakis identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the feed. He presented his proposal to Cornell for <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> truss suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the azimuth truss positioning. This second truss, {{in the form of}} an arc, or arch, was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed's elevational positioning. A counterweight would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. Helias Doundoulakis designed the cable suspension system which was finally adopted. Although the present configuration is substantially the same as the original drawings by George and Helias, (though with three towers instead of the original four), the U.S. Patent office granted Helias a patent, for the brothers' innovative idea. Another assignee on the patent, William J. Casey, later became director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President Ronald Reagan.|$|E
500|$|As soon as {{the bubble}} reached the air, it started a {{supersonic}} atmospheric shock wave which, like the crack, was more visually dramatic than destructive. Brief low pressure behind the shock wave caused instant fog which shrouded the developing column in a [...] "Wilson cloud", also called a [...] "condensation cloud", obscuring it from view for two seconds. The Wilson cloud started out hemispherical, expanded into a disk which lifted from the water revealing the fully developed spray column, then expanded into <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> and vanished. The Able shot also produced a Wilson cloud, but heat from the fireball dried it out more quickly.|$|E
500|$|... "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] was {{directed}} by Pete Michels and written by Matt Selman, although {{the idea for the}} episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer. It featured the first official appearance of Lindsey Naegle and was the first episode in which theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking guest-starred as himself. The Simpsons staff wanted Hawking to guest-star because they needed someone who would be smarter than all of Springfield's Mensa members, and because they had heard that he was a fan of the show. The episode features references to Star Trek, painter Vincent van Gogh and architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and mentions the theory of the universe being toroidal, the same shape as <b>a</b> <b>doughnut.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{a parody}} of The Devil and Daniel Webster, at work, Homer states that he would sell his soul for <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> after finding that Lenny and Carl took all the {{doughnuts}} and threw them at an old man (Grampa) [...] "for kicks". The devil, revealed to be Ned Flanders, appears and offers Homer a contract to seal the deal. However, before Homer finishes the doughnut, he realizes that Ned {{will not be able}} to have his soul if he does not eat all of the doughnut and keeps the final piece in the refrigerator. Unfortunately, while half-asleep and looking for a midnight snack, he eats the final piece of the [...] "forbidden donut", and Ned instantly reappears to take possession of Homer's soul. Marge and Lisa plead with Ned, finally getting him to agree to hold a trial the next day. Until then, Homer is sent to spend the rest of the day being punished in Hell. At the stroke of twelve midnight, Ned brings Homer back to the Simpson household for his trial. Then, when the Simpsons' lawyer, Lionel Hutz, flees after ruining his case, Marge makes a final effort to save Homer by displaying a photo from their wedding day. On the back of the photo, Homer has written that, in return for Marge giving him her hand in marriage, he pledges his soul to her forever; therefore, it was not his property to sell at the time of his deal with Ned. The jury rules in favor of the Simpsons and the presiding judge dismisses the case. Enraged, the Devil leaves, but gets his revenge by turning Homer's head into <b>a</b> <b>doughnut.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{cover for}} Off the Deep End parodies the famous cover of Nirvana's album Nevermind, which depicts an infant {{in the deep}} end of a pool chasing after a dollar bill on a hook and line. The Off the Deep End cover shows Yankovic in the baby's place {{apparently}} chasing after <b>a</b> <b>doughnut</b> on a string. While the Nirvana cover has a fully nude baby, Yankovic instead wore a bathing suit {{in a way that}} his body position hid it; he later jokingly noted, [...] "I never really anticipated going full-frontal on any of my album covers." [...] The CD, liner notes, and artwork continue the parody of Nirvana's album, borrowing the same blue, wave-light graphics from the printed surface of Nevermind.|$|E

A trial is held between Homer and the Devil to determine the rightful owner of Homer's soul. In [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet", while riding the bus to school, Bart Simpson believes he sees a gremlin taking apart the bus piece by piece. Nobody sees it except for Bart, so he tries to remove it on his own. In [...] "Bart Simpson's Dracula", Mr. Burns is a vampire and Bart falls victim to his bite. Lisa {{and the rest of the}} family go to Burns' castle to kill Burns so Bart can return to normal.|$|E
