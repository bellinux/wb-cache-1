Both types of <b>silver</b> <b>films</b> possess micro/nanobinary structures, {{the formation and}} evolution of which are achieved through the oriented attachment growth mechanism. After modification by a monolayer of n-dodecanethiol, the cauliflower-like <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> becomes hydrophobic with a contact angle (CA) of 115 +/- 1 degrees and a CA hysteresis of 74 +/- 1 degrees and the dendrite coral-like <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> exhibits the extreme hydrophobicity characterized by a CA of 158 +/- 1 degrees and a CA hysteresis of less than 2 +/- 1 degrees. Furthermore, the bouncing property of millimeter-sized water droplets on the modified dendrite coral-like silver surface {{is much better than}} that on the modified cauliflower-like silver surface. The different wetting property between the two <b>silver</b> <b>films</b> is attributed to the surface roughness.

40|$|Graduation date: 1958 This {{investigation}} {{is a study}} of how the magnitude and energy distribution of the photoelectric current from the light emergent side of thin <b>silver</b> <b>films</b> varies with film thickness. The Fowler-Dubridge graphical analysis of the energy distribution of photoelectrons is {{used to determine the}} energy of the most energetic of the emitted photoelectrons, at O°K. The experimental phototube is of the concentric: sphere type. The <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> was deposited {{on the inside of the}} sphere to act as a collector for the photoelectrons. The tube was mounted on a vacuum system consisting of a mechanical pump, an oil diffusion pump and an oil vapour trap. During the investigation the tube was left on the pumps at a pressure of approximately 2 x 10 ⁻⁷mm. Hg. The photocurrent from the <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> was amplified with a Brown and Dubridge circuit using a FP- 54 electrometer tube. The film was irradiated by light from a mercury arc lamp and a Bausch and Lomb monochromator. The intensity of light transmitted through the <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> was monitored by an R. C. A. IP 28 electron multiplier phototube. In order to determine the thickness of the <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> a separate experiment was carried out to determine the per cent light transmission through a film of known thickness. The main investigation consisted of depositing a layer of silver on the quartz disc mounted in the center of the experimental tube, and measuring the percentage of transmitted light, of wavelength 2483 A, through the film. The emitted photocurrent was then measured as a function of the light intensity at the light emergent side of the <b>silver</b> <b>film,</b> and as a function of the retarding potential across the experimental phototube. The film was increased in nineteen steps to a maximum thickness of 255 A, and the above data was recorded for each film thickness. The magnitude of the photocurrent increased with film thickness up to about 40 A and was then relatively constant for thicker films. The analysis of the energy distribution of the photocurrent showed an increase of the maximum energy of emission with film thickness up to about 50 A. This increase in maximum energy may be due to a change in contact potential between the collector and the <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> or to a decrease in the work function of the <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> as the thickness increases. A decrease in the work function of the <b>silver</b> <b>film,</b> with increasing thickness, would explain the increase in the emitted photocurrent, with increasing film thickness...|$|R
30|$|The {{relative}} {{content of}} carbon decreased rapidly while oxygen content increased when D decreased from 25 to 23  cm. Meanwhile, the electrical resistivity of the <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> decreased. There were two possible {{reasons for this}} phenomenon. The first one was the oxidation of silver nanoparticles. Sung Joon Kim et al. proposed that the amorphous silver oxide was formed on the <b>silver</b> <b>film</b> due to the reaction of ozone gas to the <b>silver</b> <b>films</b> [21]. The increasing relative content of oxygen when D =[*] 23  cm indicates the oxidation of the <b>silver</b> <b>film.</b> When D decreased, the intensity of radiation became larger, and ozone gas was more possible to be generated near {{the surface of the}} <b>silver</b> <b>films,</b> resulting in the increasing possibility of oxidation. Besides, the electrical resistivity of silver oxidation is 5.2  ×  10 − 5 Ω m [22] that is much larger than that of pure silver (1.6  ×  10 − 8 Ω m). So the silver oxidation may cause the increase of the electrical resistivity. The second one was the removal of the carbon that bridged the nanoparticles [13]. When D decreased, the accumulation of heat became faster and the curing depth became deeper, the carbon inside the films may be removed because of the increasing temperature. As a result, the contact between the silver particles got worse leading to the increasing electrical resistivity.|$|R

The electrical resistivity of <b>silver</b> <b>films</b> decreased as the UV curing time increased or the D decreased {{due to the}} efficient removal of organic substances.
