25|$|Zenon Panoussis, a {{resident}} of Sweden, was also sued for posting Scientology's copyrighted materials to the Internet. In his defense, he used a provision of the Constitution of Sweden that guarantees access to public documents. Panoussis turned over {{a copy of the}} NOTs documents {{to the office of the}} Swedish Parliament and, by law, copies of all documents (with few exceptions) received by authorities are available for anyone from the public to see, at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> or she wishes. This, known as the Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen), is considered a basic civil right in Sweden. The case, however, was decided against Panoussis. The results of his case sparked a legal firestorm in Sweden that debated the necessity of re-writing part of the Constitution.|$|E

25|$|James Ennis was {{a prized}} recruit for the Wildcats and his {{agreement}} with the team was well documented, with the Miami Heat holding his draft rights {{and being able to}} recall him at <b>any</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> opened the season with a 25-point effort against the Adelaide 36ers—the most points scored by a Wildcat on debut at the time. Ennis helped the new-look Wildcats dominate the NBL with an 8–0 start to the season, a start which ultimately culminated in a 21–7 overall record and a minor premiership. His high-flying dunks and athleticism enthralled the entire league, as he proved to be a top MVP candidate alongside Melbourne Tigers guard Chris Goulding and the eventual winner, Rotnei Clarke of the Wollongong Hawks.|$|E
25|$|Captains, mates (officers), and pilots {{supervise}} ship {{operations on}} domestic waterways {{and the high}} seas. A captain (master) is in overall command of a vessel, and supervises the work of other officers and crew. A captain {{has the ability to}} take the conn from a mate or pilot at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> feels the need. On smaller vessels the captain may be a regular watch-stander, similar to a mate, directly controlling the vessel's position. Captains and department heads ensure that proper procedures and safety practices are followed, ensure that machinery is in good working order, and oversee the loading and discharging of cargo and passengers. Captains directly communicate with the company or command (MSC), and are overall responsible for cargo, various logs, ship's documents, credentials, efforts at controlling pollution and passengers carried.|$|E

[...] Stengel's American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him [...] "I swear I don't understand {{some of the things he}} does when he manages". Though platooning survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.|$|E

500|$|On October 11, 1946, Reynolds {{was traded}} to the New York Yankees for second baseman Joe Gordon. A {{possible}} trade was speculated throughout the 1946 season. The Yankees had a wealth of infield talent, but needed pitching help. The Indians were managed by player-manager Lou Boudreau who played shortstop, but they needed help at second base. [...] Cleveland wanted Gordon and offered the Yankees any pitcher on their staff, with the exception of Bob Feller. Yankee executive Larry MacPhail discussed the potential trade with Yankees star Joe DiMaggio. Though MacPhail initially wanted Red Embree, DiMaggio replied: [...] "Take Reynolds.

500|$|At Extreme Rules, Hardy {{defeated}} Edge {{to win the}} World Heavyweight Championship in {{a ladder}} match. Immediately after the match, CM Punk cashed in his second Money in the Bank briefcase, which gave him a guaranteed world championship match at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> wanted, and defeated Hardy to win the championship. Hardy received his rematch at The Bash, and won the match via disqualification after Punk kicked the ref {{in the back of}} the head while feigning an eye injury with Punk still retaining the title. At Night of Champions, however, Hardy won the championship for the second time, by defeating Punk. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view in August, Hardy lost the title back to Punk in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. On the August 28 episode of SmackDown, Punk beat Jeff [...] Hardy in a steel cage rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship, resulting in Hardy leaving WWE, in storyline, per the pre-match stipulation. This storyline was put in place to allow Hardy to leave WWE to heal his injuries, including a neck injury. Hardy also had two herniated discs in his lower back and was suffering from restless legs syndrome.|$|E
500|$|Kerr rang Whitlam on Sunday 19 October, asking {{permission}} {{to consult with}} the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Garfield Barwick, concerning the crisis. Whitlam advised Kerr not to do so, noting that no Governor-General had consulted with a Chief Justice under similar circumstances since 1914, when Australia was at a much earlier stage of her constitutional development. On 21 October, Kerr phoned Whitlam regarding the Ellicott opinion, and asked, [...] "It's all bullshit, isn't it?". Whitlam agreed with Kerr's view. Kerr then requested that the Government provide him with a written legal opinion rebutting Ellicott's views. Kerr would receive no written advice from the Government until 6 November. Journalist and author Paul Kelly, who wrote two books on the crisis, paints this delay as a major mistake by Whitlam, given Kerr's judicial background. Kerr also asked on 21 October for Whitlam's {{permission to}} interview Fraser, which the Prime Minister readily granted, {{and the two men}} met that night. Fraser told Kerr that the Opposition were determined to block supply. Fraser indicated that the Opposition's decision to defer the appropriation bills, rather than defeating them, was a tactical decision, since then the bills would remain in the control of the Senate and could be passed at <b>any</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> stated that the Coalition agreed with the Ellicott opinion, and proposed to continue deferring supply while it awaited events. The media were not told of the substance of the conversation, and instead reported that Kerr had reprimanded Fraser for blocking supply, causing the Governor-General's office to issue a denial.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the elected}} UFA members espoused radical {{political}} doctrines calculated {{to transform the}} provincial government. Brownlee quickly became identified with the caucus's conservative faction. At the caucus meeting that approved his appointment, he {{put an end to}} discussion of whether nominations for justices of the peace should come from UFA locals or its central political committee by asserting that they would continue to be handled by the office of the Attorney-General. [...] Later, many UFA MLAs argued that only motions explicitly declaring a lack of confidence in the government should be treated as motions of non-confidence. [...] They were concerned that supporters of the government who nonetheless disagreed with it on a specific issue might be pressured to refrain from voting their consciences on motions, such as money bills, that were conventionally considered tests of the government's confidence. [...] Brownlee warned these MLAs that regardless of their beliefs, the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta was free to request the government's resignation <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> considered that it lacked or did not merit the legislature's confidence. [...] Despite this warning, UFA MLAs John Russell Love and Alex Moore proposed a resolution in the legislature changing the convention. The proposal attracted notice from across Canada; R. B. Bennett advised Brownlee, his former clerk, to warn Moore and Love that it was unconstitutional and demand that they withdraw it. Brownlee was reluctant to do so, since a similar proposal {{had been part of the}} UFA's election platform, and instead moved successful amendments weakening the motion to a vague [...] "statement of intent".|$|E
