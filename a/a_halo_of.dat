5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
25|$|NGC 2787 is a {{lenticular}} galaxy at {{a distance}} of 24 million light-years. Unlike most lenticular galaxies, NGC 2787 has a bar at its center. It also has <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> globular clusters, indicating its age and relative stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{synaptic}} ribbon is {{a unique}} structure at the active zone of the synapse. It is positioned several nanometers away from the pre-synaptic membrane and tethers 100 or more synaptic vesicles. Each pre-synaptic cell can have from 10 to 100 ribbons tethered at the membrane, or a total number of 1000–10000 vesicles {{in close proximity to}} active zones. The ribbon synapse was first identified in the retina as a thin, ribbon-like presynaptic projection surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> vesicles using transmission electron microscopy in the 1950s, as the technique was gaining mainstream usage.|$|E

25|$|Geochemically, the Kambalda Ratio Ni:Cr/Cu:Zn {{identifies}} {{areas of}} enriched Ni, Cu and depleted Cr and Zn. Cr {{is associated with}} fractionated, low-MgO rocks and Zn is a typical sediment contaminant. If the ratio is at around unity or greater than 1, the komatiite flow is considered fertile. Other geochemical trends sought include high MgO contents to identify the area with highest cumulate olivine contents; identifying low-Zn flows; tracking Al content to identify contaminated lavas and, chiefly, identifying anomalously enriched Ni (direct detection). In many areas, economic deposits are identified within <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> lower grade mineralisation, with a 1% or 2% Ni in hole value contoured.|$|E
500|$|The {{published}} {{edition of}} The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with {{the portrayal of}} a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In , Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In , Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> light before a mob of [...] "monks and monsters". In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies {{in front of a}} peasant.|$|E
500|$|Tengu are worshipped as {{beneficial}} kami (gods or revered spirits) {{in various}} Japanese religious cults. For example, the tengu Saburō of Izuna is worshipped on that mountain and various others as , {{one of the}} primary deities in the Izuna Shugen cult, which also has ties to fox sorcery and the Dakini of Tantric Buddhism. Izuna Gongen is depicted as a beaked, winged figure with snakes wrapped around his limbs, surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> flame, riding {{on the back of a}} fox and brandishing a sword. Worshippers of tengu on other sacred mountains have adopted similar images for their deities, such as [...] or [...] of Akiba and [...] of Saijō-ji Temple in Odawara.|$|E

500|$|After the American Civil War, Northern writers began {{questioning}} {{the validity of}} the rescue story of Captain John Smith and Pocahontas, attacking the accounts of the historical role played by both, {{as well as that of}} her husband John Rolfe. The movement was led by Henry Adams, a descendant of John Adams whose rival was John Randolph of Roanoke, a descendant of Pocahontas. Several Virginians replied, one of whom was Robertson. [...] "Northern attacks disturbed him so much that he prepared a detailed study" [...] and wrote Pocahontas alias Matoaka and Her Descendants through Her Marriage with John Rolfe. He traced her descendants, who included the Bollings, Branches, Lewises, Randolphs, and Pages, as well as his own family. His thesis was that because her descendants were notable, so was she. [...] "History, poetry, and art," [...] wrote Robertson, [...] "have vied with one another in investing her name from that day to the present with <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> surpassing brightness." ...|$|E
500|$|In France {{the action}} was greeted with celebration, and it became the only naval battle commemorated on the Arc de Triomphe. The British {{response}} was despondent, although all four captains were subsequently cleared and praised at their courts-martial inquiring into {{the loss of their}} ships. The only criticism was of Willoughby, who was accused of giving a misleading signal in indicating that the French were of inferior force on 22 August. Contemporary historian William James described British reaction to the battle as [...] "that the noble behaviour of her officers and crew threw such <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> glory around the defeat at Grand Port, that, in public opinion at least, the loss of four frigates was scarcely considered a misfortune." [...] However, he also notes that [...] "No case of which we are aware more deeply affects the character of the Royal Navy than the defeat it sustained at Grand Port." [...] On 30 December 1899, a monument was erected at the harbour of Grand Port in the memory of the British and French sailors who were killed in the engagement.|$|E

2500|$|From the Augustaeum led a great street, the Mese (Greek: Μέση [...] lit. [...] "Middle [...] "), {{lined with}} colonnades. As it descended the First Hill {{of the city}} and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the Praetorium or law-court. Then it passed through the oval Forum of Constantine where there was a second Senate-house and a high column with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of Helios, crowned with <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there, the Mese passed on and through the Forum Tauri and then the Forum Bovis, and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the Constantinian Wall. After the {{construction}} of the Theodosian Walls in the early 5th century, it was extended to the new Golden Gate, reaching a total length of seven Roman miles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prevailing}} [...] "Roman" [...] custom was {{to shave}} a circle {{at the top}} of the head, leaving <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> hair or corona; this was eventually associated with the imagery of Christ's Crown of Thorns. The early material referring to the Celtic tonsure emphasises its distinctiveness from the Roman alternative and invariably connects its use to the Celtic dating of Easter. Those preferring the Roman tonsure considered the Celtic custom extremely unorthodox, and associated it with the form of tonsure worn by the heresiarch Simon Magus. This association appears in a 672 letter from Saint Aldhelm to King Geraint of Dumnonia, but it may have been circulating since the Synod of Whitby. The tonsure is also mentioned in a passage, probably of the 7th century but attributed wrongly to Gildas: [...] "Britones toti mundo contrarii, moribus Romanis inimici, non solum in missa sed in tonsura etiam" [...] ("Britons are contrary to the whole world, enemies of Roman customs, not only in the Mass but also in regard to the tonsure").|$|E

2500|$|Dove {{exhibited}} {{his works}} at Stieglitz’s 291 gallery in 1910 {{as part of}} the show [...] "Younger American Painters", which also included Dove's old friend Maurer. Dove showed one painting, a large still life painted in France entitled “The Lobster”, which would be his last representational work. Stieglitz provided Dove with his first one-man show in 1912 at the 291. The show, which included a group of Dove's pastels that {{came to be known as}} [...] "The Ten Commandments", was the first public exhibition of abstract art by an American. In the two years after meeting Stieglitz, Dove became a leader in international art developments. From 1912 to 1946 Dove showed his work annually at Stieglitz’s galleries: 291, Intimate Gallery, and An American Place. Dove used a wide range of media over the course of his career, sometimes in unconventional combinations. During the 1920s Dove made many works on paper such as the pastel on paper, Nature Symbolized (or Reefs) from 1924. As stated above Dove did experimental collage works in the 1920s in works like The Critic, 1925, and The Intellectual 1925; and he experimented with techniques, combining paints like oil and/or tempera over a wax emulsion. Tanks, 1938 is an example of oil over a wax emulsion; commenting about Tanks, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts says: Set off by <b>a</b> <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> pale gray, the quivering structures almost seem to dematerialize and merge into the surrounding scenery, yet at the same time, they retain their hulking forms.|$|E
