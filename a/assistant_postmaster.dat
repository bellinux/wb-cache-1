A month later the <b>Assistant</b> Army <b>Postmaster,</b> Thomas Angell set up an Army Post Office in Varna {{in support of the}} Army Headquarters.|$|R
25|$|Bradley's {{service to}} the country as <b>assistant</b> <b>postmaster</b> general is {{regarded}} as influential. Bradley's postal routes and schedules, enforced rigidly over a thirty-year period, gave the Post Office Department a rapid and reliable engine for delivering information across vast distances, instilling in citizens {{the importance of the}} connectedness they shared with their distant neighbors. The numerous maps Bradley published, while later discarded and redrawn by the new Jackson administration, created in their time a sense of the immensity of American territory.|$|E
25|$|The Stevensons vacationed at lake {{resorts in}} Wisconsin during summers. There, Stevenson befriended William Freeman Vilas, a growing voice among Midwest Democrats {{and a friend}} of Grover Cleveland.

5000|$|A regular seaborne {{mail service}} was {{established}} between Varna and Constantinople. In late summer, an invasion fleet of some 600 ships and 50,00 men gathered at Varna creating {{a shortage of}} accommodation which prompted the <b>Assistant</b> Army <b>Postmaster</b> to obtain Lord Raglan's permission to operate from the ship Ganges, but the ship sailed for the Crimea before the <b>Assistant</b> Army <b>Postmaster</b> had moved on board. So he established the Army Post Office on the Sovereign which was smaller. This caused him sorting difficulties as his report reflects: Scarcely had the sorting operation commenced (by making use of buckets for letter boxes) when a perfect rush was made aboard, officers, non-commissioned officers and privates came to demand the letters and papers for their respective regiments, it was in vain that I endeavoured to interpose a barrier to enable me to continue the sorting unmolested... of the confusion caused he sorted through the night ...On the following morning, at five o'clock, I signalled [...] "Send for letters", but the order being given shortly after for the whole fleet to weigh anchor I was unable to dispose of them.|$|R

That same morning, shortly after conclusion of the cabinet meeting, second <b>assistant</b> <b>postmaster</b> general Harllee Branch called Foulois to his office. A conference between members of the Air Corps, the Post Office, and the Aeronautics Branch of the Commerce Department ensued in which Foulois, asked if the Air Corps could deliver the mail in winter, casually assured Branch that the Air Corps could be ready in a week or ten days.|$|E
25|$|In September 1796 Bradley {{published}} the first combined {{map of the}} post office stations, routes, and distances between. The map included a remarkable and innovative table that indicated times and {{days of the week}} to expect mail at various important postal coach stops along the primary eastern route. By this chart it could be determined that a letter posted in northernmost station at Brewer, Maine could be expected to reach St. Marys, Georgia in six weeks plus four days, 46 days of travel. Bradley spent much of his career improving, expanding, and refining U.S. postal maps during the rapid westward expansion of America in the early 19th century. Appointed <b>assistant</b> <b>postmaster</b> general by Habersham in 1799, he would serve in the office until 1828.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} {{appointments}} Harrison was forced to reverse was that of James S.

500|$|Although Hanna was {{reputed to}} control the administration's patronage, in fact, other men were more influential. [...] McKinley's friend Joseph Smith, who had served as State Librarian of Ohio during McKinley's tenure as governor, [...] {{probably}} had more influence over federal jobs {{until his death in}} 1898. [...] Charles Dawes, who was slated to be Comptroller of the Currency as soon as the incumbent left office, was also a McKinley confidant. [...] Joseph Bristow, whose duties as Fourth <b>Assistant</b> <b>Postmaster</b> General under McKinley involved patronage appointments, later wrote that the President [...] "gave Hanna's requests great consideration and had confidence in the clearness of his opinion, but in the end he always followed his own judgment".|$|E
500|$|<b>Assistant</b> <b>Postmaster</b> General Frank H. Hitchcock {{resigned}} {{from his office}} in February 1908 to lead the Taft effort. In April, Taft made a speaking tour, traveling as far west as Omaha before being recalled to go to Panama and straighten out a contested election. At the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago in June, there was no serious opposition to him, and he gained a first-ballot victory. Yet Taft did not have things his own way: he had hoped his running mate would be a midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator Jonathan Dolliver, but instead [...] the convention named Congressman James S. Sherman of New York, a conservative. [...] Taft resigned as Secretary of War on June 30 to devote himself full-time to the campaign.|$|E

500|$|On February 20, 1858, Lahaina {{experienced}} a violent hurricane that destroyed approximately twenty buildings, including the original courthouse at Hale Piula, initially {{intended as a}} [...] palace for Kamehameha III.

500|$|On January 30, 1925, Kvale {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Coinage Committee, at which the proposal that would become the Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar was considered. [...] Treasury officials were present in opposition, suggesting a medal be issued instead, and Kvale asked several questions about the Mint's issuance of medals. On February 3, Kvale and his son Paul met with Treasury officials, bringing a draft bill authorizing the Bureau of the Mint to strike commemorative medals for the Restauration anniversary. Acting Mint Director Mary M. O'Reilly and Treasury Undersecretary Garrard Winston were dubious about the idea of striking silver medals that would be between the quarter and half dollar in size. To offset this concern, Paul Kvale suggested making the medal octagonal or hexagonal. O'Reilly and Winston favored the idea, and after Congressman Kvale met with legal counsel to the Treasury and other officials, he was assured of the department's full support. Kvale also successfully lobbied the Post Office Department for the issuance of commemorative stamps; he told Third <b>Assistant</b> <b>Postmaster</b> General Warren I. Glover that, in a broader sense, the medal recognized the North American explorations of the Vikings around the year 1000. Kvale declared that in seeking the souvenir medal and stamps, he was contributing to the [...] "growth of the Norwegian heritage by having it 'preserved in metal' as well as 'paper time capsules'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The US {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} about transatlantic flights for faster postal service between Europe and America. [...] In 1931 W.
