25|$|Besides farming, slate was mined for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Irmenach {{area are}} many slate mines, {{some of which}} already existed in the 17th century.

According to local lore, Irmenach slate was used in the building of, among others, the Reichstag in Berlin and Brussels Cathedral. In the late 1960s, the last slate quarry was closed as recovery had become unprofitable.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{identification}} is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, {{and may be}} impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P {{does not imply that}} all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.|$|E
