50|$|Asset-based lending is {{any kind}} of lending secured by an asset. This means, if the loan is <b>not</b> repaid, the <b>asset</b> is taken. In this sense, a {{mortgage}} {{is an example of}} an asset-based loan. More commonly however, the phrase is used to describe lending to business and large corporations <b>using</b> <b>assets</b> <b>not</b> normally <b>used</b> <b>in</b> other loans. Typically, these loans are tied to inventory, accounts receivable, machinery and equipment. Asset-based lending in this more specific sense is possible only in certain countries whose legal systems allow borrowers to pledge such assets to lenders as collateral for loans (through the creation of enforceable security interests).|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} {{of a system}} which enables the cost-effective exploration {{of the solar system}} is proposed. Such a system will make use of the benefits of the natural dynamics represented in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP). Additionally, a case study of the first missions which apply the lessons from the CRTBP is examined. The guiding principle of the proposed system is to apply lessons learned from both the Apollo project for deep space exploration and the International Space Station for long term habitation in space as well as modular space vehicle design. From this preliminary system design, a number of missions are outlined. These missions form the basis of an evolvable roadmap to fully develop the infrastructure required for long-term sustained manned exploration of the solar system. This roadmap provides a clear and concise pathway from current exploration capabilities to the current long-term goal of sustained manned exploration of Mars. The primary method employed in designing the staging orbits is the "Single Lunar Swingby", each of the component segment trajectory design processes is explored in detail. Additionally, the method of combining each of these segments together in a larger End-to-End optimizer environment within the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) is introduced, called the Multiple Shooting Method. In particular, a specific Baseline Parking Orbit, or BPO, is chosen and analyzed. This BPO serves as the parking home orbit of any <b>assets</b> <b>not</b> currently <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> A BPO of amplitude (14000, 28000, 6000) kilometers. The BPO has full coverage to both the Earth and the Moon and orbit station-keeping may be conducted at a cost of less than 1 m/s over a 14 year period. This provides a cost-effective platform from which more advanced exploration activities can be based, both robotic and manned. One of the key advanced exploration activities considered is manned exploration of Mars, one of the current long-term goals of NASA. Trajectories from the BPO to Mars and back to Earth are explored and show approximately 50 % decrease in required ΔV provided by the spacecraft...|$|R

50|$|Within {{classical}} economics, Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations, Book II, Chapter 1) distinguished {{fixed capital}} from circulating capital. The former designated physical <b>assets</b> <b>not</b> consumed <b>in</b> {{the production of}} a product (e.g. machines and storage facilities), while the latter referred to physical assets consumed in the process of production (e.g. raw materials and intermediate products).

30|$|The housing losses {{experienced}} by {{households in the}} middle wealth quartiles might be contributing toward the general increase in wealth inequality widely reported and discussed today.

50|$|Full {{liquidity}} guarantees {{are similar}} to full credit guarantees with the main difference being that the sponsor only needs to pay off maturing asset-backed commercial paper if the conduit <b>assets</b> are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> default.

This form of guarantees is weaker than full credit, but from the bank's side, they can move these assets off the balance sheet.|$|R

40|$|A {{mortgagee}} can, {{through the}} device of a foreclosure sale, acquire a secured property {{for its own}} account at a fictitiously low figure, and then use that unfairly small amount as the appropriate dollar credit against the amount due on the loan. This creates a double-bind situation for mortgagors. Some states {{have responded to the}} two problems of inadequate foreclosure sale prices and oppressive deficiency judgments by passing various kinds of legislation. My proposal is a simple one: (1) forbid the mortgagee from buying in at foreclosure; (2) to bring in the highest possible price for the benefit of all concerned, have the mortgagee, as agent for all the parties in interest sell the property in the manner that such <b>assets</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> foreclosure are ordinarily marketed; (3) change the traditional rule regarding the distribution of foreclosure proceeds requires that liens be paid off in order of priority, with the balance, if any, then going to the mortgagor.
