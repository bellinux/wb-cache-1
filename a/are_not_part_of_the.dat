5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linguistic system, but {{are an important part of}} how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{scholars}} have always defended {{the value of}} specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, {{has argued that the}} lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars. As a result, his translation of the History for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as Lives of the Later Caesars, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original texts, which begin with Hadrian).|$|E

Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance.

5|$|When a new seal was {{unveiled}} in June 2011, it received several negative {{feedback from the}} students through social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. The changes were made after the Curia in Rome suggested for a uniformity in the titles and name of UST. The university's council of Regents decided to include UST's name in the new seal and drop the titles of Royal and Pontifical because they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official name of university. The seal was revised a month after and is currently being used today.|$|E
5|$|Activity {{after the}} caldera's {{formation}} created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults. One flow was dated at 1,090,000 ± 110,000 years old, and the domes are 1.4 to 1.2 million years old. La Reforma eruption products were later partially buried by activity from El Aguajito, where volcanic activity had migrated to. Basaltic cones which erupted 600,000 {{years ago on}} the caldera's flanks despite their location <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> La Reforma volcano; like Isla Tortuga and Tres Virgenes, they are controlled by the tectonic processes that accompanied the rifting of the Sea of Cortez. Also, rivers deposited sediments inside the caldera itself. Seismic activity still occurs at Tres Virgenes volcano. La Reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism, especially in its southwestern part.|$|E

5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes feel that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, {{they do not have}} any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Many of Goya's preparatory drawings, {{mostly in}} red chalk, have survived and are {{numbered}} {{differently from the}} published prints. He produced two albums of proofs—among many individual proof impressions—of which only one is complete. The full album consists of 85 works, including three small Prisioneros ("Prisoners") made in 1811 which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. Goya gave the copy of the full album, now in the British Museum, to his friend Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez. It contains a title-page inscription in Goya's hand, is signed at the page edges, and has numbers and titles to the prints written by Goya. These were copied on the plates when the published edition was prepared in 1863. By then, 80 had passed from Goya's son, Javier—who had stored them in Madrid after his father left Spain—to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), of which Goya had been director. Numbers 81 and 82 rejoined {{the others in the}} Academy in 1870, and were not published until 1957.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of string}} theory, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is used to}} understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics {{and other parts of}} theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called 3D mirror symmetry which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.|$|E
