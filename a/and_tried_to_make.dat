5|$|A {{four-year}} {{starting quarterback}} at Mississippi Valley State University, Dickinson {{was drafted by}} the Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 1976 NFL Draft. He served as the backup quarterback behind Steve Spurrier his rookie season, and saw playing time in eight games, including one start against the Miami Dolphins. His season ended after suffering an injury {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Browns. He recovered from the injury <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the team in 1977, but was cut, ending his career. After retiring, he became a high school offensive coordinator in Tampa.|$|E
5|$|Henry II died in 1189 and was {{succeeded by}} Richard I. Rhys {{considered}} {{that he was}} no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest, and Gower and captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne, and Llansteffan. Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was not prepared to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.|$|E
5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E

25|$|Vlad III Dracula fled to Moldavia, {{where he}} lived under the {{protection}} of his uncle, Bogdan II. In October 1451, Bogdan was assassinated and Vlad fled to Hungary. Impressed by Vlad's vast knowledge of the mindset and inner workings of the Ottoman Empire, as well as his hatred towards the Turks and new Sultan Mehmed II, Hunyadi reconciled with his former enemy <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Vlad III his own adviser, but Vlad refused.|$|E
25|$|While Gustavus Adolphus landed {{his army}} in Pomerania <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> alliances {{with the leaders}} of Northern Germany, the League's army laid siege to the city of Magdeburg for two months from 20 March 1631, as the city had promised to support Sweden.

25|$|Christian IV {{spent more}} time in Norway than any other Oldenberg monarch and no Oldenburg king made such a lasting {{impression}} on the Norwegian people. He visited the country {{a number of times}} and founded four cities. He also established and took control over one silver mine (Kongsberg), one copper mine (Røros), <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an iron plant with limited success in Eiker. He also restored the fortress at Akershus, where he invited the people of Norway to the official and age-old installment of the king in 1590, and again in 1610.|$|E

He ended up in prison, and, as he recalled, was {{subjected}} to numerous beatings. His academician's title, his pension and his right of attending the Romanian Academy Library were all removed from him (see List of purged members of the Romanian Academy). His son-in-law, Diomid Strungaru, was stripped of all positions in academia, and had {{to work at a}} clothes iron factory.|$|E
25|$|French and British colonists traded {{with these}} {{indigenous}} peoples <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> alliances with them.

On May 26, 1736 the Battle of Ackia was fought {{near the site of}} the present Tupelo; British and Chickasaw soldiers repelled a French and Choctaw attack on the then-Chickasaw village of Ackia. The French, under Louisiana governor Jean Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, had sought to link Louisiana with Acadia and the other northern colonies of New France.|$|E

25|$|Saint Cloud, {{where she}} was less watched and {{confined}} than in Paris (where her jailers followed her every step, even in her bedroom). Mirabeau retained a close connection with the queen, and drew up many state papers for her. In return, the king used money from Austria to pay his debts secretly {{and give him a}} monthly subsidy of six thousand francs, with promises of a million or more. Some historians argue Mirabeau was not the traitor that many believed him to be because he continued to uphold his political beliefs <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> possible a bridge between the king and the revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|The Kurnell Peninsula, {{also the}} site of the Cronulla Sand Dune System was the first landing place for Captain James Cook in Australia. On 29 April 1770, HM Bark Endeavour landed in Botany Bay and Cook stepped ashore. Shortly after, James Cook looked down from the sand hills at what is now known as Cronulla Beach. The sand dunes were {{completely}} covered in vegetation, so Cook made no mention of any sand dunes during his visit to the Kurnell peninsula. Captain Cook along with his crew stayed in Botany Bay for eight days. During his visit he collected botanical specimens, mapped the area <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> contact (unsuccessfully) with the indigenous population. When Cook reported back to England he said that the land was suitable for agriculture, it had sandy soil and the area was lightly wooded.|$|E
25|$|However {{inconsistency}} and successive {{back and}} ankle injuries have {{prevented him from}} cementing {{his place in the}} Indian team. His career statistics are better in ODI cricket than in Test cricket, but with 144 ODI wickets at an average of 30.54 his average is higher(lesser the best) than all three of his main competitors for fast bowling places in the Indian team – Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, who all have bowling averages below 30. The new crop of fast bowlers like Munaf Patel, RP Singh and Ishant Sharma also add to the competition. Nevertheless, Nehra completed recovery from a bowel injury in March 2006 <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a comeback into the Indian team. He recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies in June 2009 after 4 years due to an injury to Zaheer Khan.|$|E

25|$|While Pakistan {{said that}} the plane was unarmed and the debris was within Pakistani territory, India {{maintained}} that warnings {{had been given to}} the Atlantic and that its flight trajectory meant it could have fallen {{on either side of the}} border. According to the Indian version of events, the MiGs tried to escort it to a nearby Indian base, when the Pakistani aircraft turned abruptly <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a dash for the border; it was only then that it was fired upon. India claimed that the debris was found in a radius of 2km on either side of the border and that the intrusion took place 10km inside the Kori Creek, which is Indian territory. Pakistan requested that the matter be taken up in the UN. Indian officials claimed that there had been previous violations in the area and pointed out that in the previous year a Pakistani unmanned surveillance aircraft had intruded 150km inside the Indian border, coming close to the Bhuj air base before the IAF spotted it and brought it down with several missiles.|$|E
25|$|In a 10th-century Life of Saint Giles, {{written for}} the benefit of pilgrims, a legend is {{recorded}} about how, one day, when King Wamba (also known as Flavius) was out hunting in the forest between Arles and Nîmes in Provence, he began to pursue a hind (deer). The animal fled, seeking refuge in the cave where Giles the hermit was quietly praying. (In some versions of the story, the hind, provided by God, was Giles' sole companion and sustained him on its milk.) Wamba shot his arrow into the opening. But he missed the hind, striking Giles instead, wounding him in the leg and causing a permanent disability. The king's hunting dogs then rushed in for the kill. But when Wamba arrived he found his dogs miraculously rooted to the spot. Discovering what he had done, he begged forgiveness <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> amends. But Giles continued his prayers, refusing all help or recompense. The king nonetheless had doctors care for the wound. He also offered Giles the land upon which to build a monastery. But Giles refused.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced {{his way through the crowd}} with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E

500|$|The cliffhanger {{resolves}} several plot threads {{that had}} been seeded throughout the previous episodes of the series. According to executive producer Beth Willis, the Amy Pond Ganger has been acting {{in place of the}} original Amy Pond {{since the beginning of the}} series. [...] Amy claimed she was pregnant in [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", but denied this in the following episode. Since then, the Doctor has performed several inconclusive pregnancy tests on Amy. The Eye Patch Lady, who was later revealed to be named Madame Kovarian in the episode [...] "A Good Man Goes To War", previously made brief appearances in [...] "Day of the Moon", [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot", and [...] "The Rebel Flesh".

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} {{as part of}} the twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–01) and was written by writing partners John Frink and Don Payne. [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] was the first episode of the show directed by Lauren MacMullan, who joined the staff of The Simpsons following the cancellation of the short-lived television series Mission Hill, which was created by former Simpsons writers and executive producers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein on which she worked as a supervising director and designer. American actress and stand-up comedian Kathy Griffin guest starred in the episode as the bully Francine. MacMullan designed this new character herself <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her seem like a professional bully by having her carry her lunch box with her all the time like a briefcase.|$|E
500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in {{the crack in the}} universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", though the episode reveals his consciousness was placed in a Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and now {{it was time for a}} casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as he stopped to look at the crack. Gillan called the scene [...] "incredibly challenging" [...] for her to perform <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it [...] "truthful and believable".|$|E
