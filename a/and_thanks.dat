5|$|In the Douglas Adams novel So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> for All the Fish, Fenchurch was so-named {{because she}} was {{conceived}} at the station.|$|E
5|$|Taunton also {{features}} in So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> for All the Fish by Douglas Adams, part of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{considered}} {{writing a}} third radio series {{to be based}} on his novel Life, the Universe and Everything in 1993, but the project did not begin until after his death in 2001. Dirk Maggs, with whom Adams had discussed the new series, directed and co-produced the radio adaptation as well as adaptations of the remaining Hitchhiker's Guide novels So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> for All the Fish and Mostly Harmless. These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series, transmitted in 2004 and 2005.|$|E

A fourth and fifth series based on So Long, <b>and</b> <b>Thanks</b> For All the Fish and Mostly Harmless were to have been transmitted in September 2004.|$|E
5|$|Bessas first sent an {{expeditionary force}} to {{suppress}} a rebellion among the Abasgians, who neighboured Lazica to the north. The expedition, under John Guzes, was successful, and the Abasgian leader Opsites {{was forced to}} flee across the Caucasus to the Sabir Huns. In spring 551, after a long siege <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> largely to his own perseverance and bravery, the Byzantines and their Sabir allies (some 6,000 troops) captured Petra. A few Persians continued to resist from the citadel, but Bessas ordered it torched. Following his victory, he ordered the city walls razed to the ground.|$|E

5|$|Sport {{has been}} both {{one of the most}} unifying {{cultural}} forces in Northern England <b>and,</b> <b>thanks</b> to local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire Roses rivalry, one of the most divisive. As huge numbers of people moved into recently-built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that was otherwise absent.|$|E
5|$|The Debian project {{released}} the 0.9x versions in 1994 and 1995. During {{this time it}} was sponsored by the Free Software Foundation for one year. Ian Murdock delegated the base system, the core packages of Debian, to Bruce Perens and Murdock focused on the management of the growing project. The first ports to non-IA-32 architectures began in 1995, and Debian 1.1 was released in 1996. By that time <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> to Ian Jackson, the dpkg package manager was already an essential part of Debian.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was damaged}} during World War II, but efforts {{to restore the}} castle began in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war. Once again, <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> to local non-profit organizations like the Wüstenrot Foundation and Community Fund for the Preservation of Lichtenstein Castle, the walls were restored in 1980, followed by the second floor in 1998. The upper floor and roof were restored in 2002.|$|E

Some crustaceans are {{more closely related to}} insects and other hexapods than they are to certain other crustaceans.|$|E

5|$|The fourth marquess, John Crichton-Stuart, was an {{enthusiastic}} restorer and builder and commissioned a major restoration project between 1928 and 1939. The stonework was carefully repaired, with moulds made to recreate missing pieces. The Inner East Gatehouse was rebuilt, {{along with several}} of the other towers. The marquess carried out landscaping work, {{with the intent of}} eventually re-flooding the lakes, <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> to several decades of purchases was finally able to demolish the local houses encroaching on the view of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} initially {{followed through}} with this recommendation but the move was widely disapproved of by scholars of Japanese affairs including Cortazzi <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> in part to their protests the Foreign Affairs Ministry eventually agreed to revive Japan Echo as an online magazine, which would be produced {{on an annual basis}} by whichever company put forward the best bid.|$|E
5|$|Brian {{realizes that}} {{if no one}} cares {{about the lives of}} animals, then he is {{worthless}} to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{would remain}} with the Blues until 1995. The 1992–93 NHL season was his most {{successful}} season as he {{played a key role}} in the upset of the Chicago Blackhawks, the reigning Clarence Campbell Conference regular season champions, sweeping them in four games in the first round of the playoffs. The Blues then faced the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round <b>and</b> <b>thanks</b> to Joseph the series went to seven games. The Leafs eventually prevailed. Because of his efforts, he was nominated as a finalist for the Vezina Trophy that season, finishing third in voting behind winner Ed Belfour and Tom Barrasso.|$|E
5|$|Only Maryland and New York had yet {{to authorize}} {{independence}} {{towards the end of}} June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the Annapolis Convention for instructions. On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But Samuel Chase went to Maryland <b>and,</b> <b>thanks</b> to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28. Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the New York Provincial Congress told the delegates to wait. But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.|$|E

Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.|$|E
