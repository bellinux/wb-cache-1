The <b>acoustic</b> solid <b>horns</b> are the {{important}} parts in high power ultrasonic vibrating systems, and its design {{is critical to}} the quality and the efficiency of ultrasonic welding. The using of multiple function <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn</b> can reduce machining time very effectively. This paper performs the analysis and design of multiple function <b>acoustic</b> <b>horns</b> for ultrasonic welding of plastic by employing ANSYS finite element software. Firstly, the theoretical dimensions of the horns are calculated. Moreover, their natural frequencies and amplitudes are obtained through the simulations of ANSYS.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop {{numerical}} techniques for the analysis and optimization of <b>acoustic</b> <b>horns</b> for time harmonic wave propagation. An <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn</b> may be viewed as an impedance transformer, designed to give an impedance matching between the feeding waveguide and the surrounding air. When modifying the shape of the horn, the quality of this impedance matching changes, as well as the angular distribution of the radiated wave in the far field (the directivity). The dimensions of the horns considered are in the order of the wavelength. In this wavelength region the wave physics is complicated, and it is hard to apply elementary physical reasoning to enhance the performance of the horn. Here, topology optimization is applied to improve the efficiency and to gain control over the directivity of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>horn</b> <b>effect</b> {{is known}} as an {{important}} amplification mechanism in tyre/road noise. The name is referring to the geometry between tyre and road surface which resembles an exponential <b>horn.</b> The <b>horn</b> <b>effect</b> is a common subject for both experimental and numerical research. Contrary to previous studies which considered point sources, this paper focusses on the <b>horn</b> <b>effect</b> by simulated tyre vibrations. The amplification of acoustic pressure, however, depends largely on {{the location of the}} observer. The sound power {{can be used as a}} measure for the <b>horn</b> <b>effect</b> which is independent on the point of observation. In this paper, the sound radiation problem is solved using the boundary element method (BEM). First, a case study considering equivalent point sources is used to validate the accuracy of the boundary element model and solver using experimental results. Next, the vibrations of tyres rolling on textured road surfaces are investigated numerically. The computed tyre vibrations are used to study the <b>horn</b> <b>effect</b> using different tyre designs. The amplification by <b>horn</b> <b>effect</b> is determined by the combined tyre/road geometry and the distribution of the noise. The current method may be used to systematically study the influence of the <b>horn</b> <b>effect,</b> for example, during tyre development...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) formulation {{based on the}} method of fundamental solutions (MFS) {{is applied to the}} study of <b>acoustic</b> <b>horns.</b> The implemented model follows and extends previous works that only considered two-dimensional and axisymmetric horn configurations. The more realistic case of 3 D <b>acoustic</b> <b>horns</b> with symmetry regarding two orthogonal planes is addressed. The use of the domain decomposition technique with two interconnected sub-regions along a continuity boundary is proposed, allowing for the computation of the sound pressure generated by an <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn</b> installed on a rigid screen. In order to reduce the model discretization requirements for these cases, Green’s functions derived with the image source methodology are adopted, automatically accounting for the presence of symmetry conditions. A strategy for the calculation of an optimal position of the virtual sources used by the MFS to define the solution is also used, leading to improved reliability and flexibility of the proposed method. The responses obtained by the developed model are compared to reference solutions, computed by well-established models based on the boundary element method. Additionally, numerically calculated acoustic parameters, such as directivity and beamwidth, are compared with those evaluated experimentally.
