A 26 - year-old female presented with a painful left breast mass and an associated sinus tract w i th purulent d i scharge. Physical examination revealed a tender, erythematous, firm left breast mass with an associated sinus tract opening with discharge within the upper outer quadrant of her left breast with a clinically palpable left axillary lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound revealed nonspecific findings and mammography could not utilize due her young age. <b>A</b> <b>surg</b> i cal procedure wa s planned and the left breast mass was completely removed by an open surgical biopsy including left axillary lymphnodes and the hystopathological evaluation of the specimen revealed findings consistent with mammary tuberculosis whereas no other nidus for tuberculosis were found within the organs including lungs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{describe}} the medico-economic characteristics of Crohn's disease (CD), we implemented a multicenter study in France. METHODS: From 2004 to 2006, disease severity states, direct (hospital and extra hospital) and indirect costs were prospectively collected {{over 1 year}} in patients with CD naive from anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (infliximab) at inclusion. Economic valorization was performed from the French Social Insurance perspective, and a statistical modeling over 10 years was performed. RESULTS: In 341 patients, the mean total costs of management were &OV 0556; 6024 per year (&OV 0556; 4675 for direct costs). As compared to patients in remission, costs were 4 to 6 times higher in patients in an active period and 19 times higher for patients requiring surgery (SURG). The most important expense items were medical and surgical hospitalizations (56 % of total costs), including cost of infliximab (36 % of hospitalization costs, i. e., 20 % of total costs), indirect costs (22 %), and drugs (11 %). The statistical modeling over 10 years showed {{that most of the}} clinical course was spent in drug-responsive state (54 %) with 26 % of costs or in remission (32 %) with 11 % of costs; time spent in <b>a</b> <b>SURG</b> state was small (3. 2 %) but generated 48 % of total costs. CONCLUSIONS: Before the introduction of self-injectable anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha, the most important expenses were supported by hospitalizations, explaining why the most costly states were for patients requiring SURG or dependent on inhospital administrated drugs. Projected data show that most time is spent in a stabilized state with appropriate treatments or in remission, and that costs associated with SURG are high. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Near {{infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) is a convenient noninvasive method for measuring both tissue oxygenation and total hemoglobin. The utility {{of this method}} was investigated using a porcine model for detecting areas of ischemia and monitoring intestinal hemodynamics. Sections of the small intestine were isolated to study ischemia and reperfusion. The segments were divided into control and two arterial-venous occlusion treatment groups, which were monitored by NIRS. Oxygenation and total hemoglobin showed no significant change over {{the duration of the}} protocol in the control segments. Oxygenation of the treatment segments dropped promptly upon, and remained depressed during occlusion. This variable was promptly restored to pre-occlusion levels in the segments that were later reperfused. Total hemoglobin displayed an increase in treatment groups, which can be attributed to insufficient occlusion to the four segments. Spectroscopic measurement of oxygenation and total hemoglobin precisely tracked the hemodynamic manipulations performed on each segment of the jejunum. NIRS provides a rapid and reliable means of detecting and monitoring ischemic regions of the small intestine. The ability to measure tissue oxygenation and to track perfusion using total hemoglobin as an indicator of blood volume make NIRS an attractive tool for noninvasive assessment of regional hemodynamics of the small intestine.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the model}} {{filamentous}} fungus Aspergillus nidulans, PilA and PilB, two homologues of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae eisosome proteins Pil 1 /Lsp 1, and <b>SurG,</b> <b>a</b> strict orthologue of Sur 7, are assembled and form tightly packed structures in conidiospores. As A. nidulans differs in its reproduction pattern from the Saccharomycotina {{in that it}} {{has the ability to}} reproduce through two different types of spores, conidiospores and ascospores, the products of the asexual and the sexual cycle respectively, we investigated the eisosome distribution and localization during the sexual cycle. Our results show that core eisosome proteins PilA, PilB and SurG are not expressed in hülle cells or early ascospores, but are expressed in mature ascospores. All eisosomal proteins form punctate structures at the membrane of late ascospores. In mature but quiescent ascospores, PilA forms static punctate structures at the plasma membrane. PilB also was observed at the ascospore membrane as well, with higher concentration at the areas where the two halves of ascospores are joined together. Finally, SurG was localized both at the membrane of ascospores and perinuclearly. In germlings originating from ascospores the punctate structures were shown to be composed only of PilA. PilB is diffused in the cytoplasm and SurG was located in vacuoles and endosomes. This altered localization is identical to that found in germlings originated from conidiospores. In germinated ascospores PilA foci did not colocalise with the highly mobile and transient peripheral punctate structures of AbpA, a marker for sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Deletions of each one or all the three core eisosomal genes do not affect viability or germination of ascospores. In the presence of myriocin - a specific inhibitor of sphingolipid biosynthesis - PilA-GFP foci of ascospore germlings were less numerous and their distribution was significantly altered, suggesting a correlation between PilA foci and sphingolipid biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{maternal}} deaths through family plan-ning in a 2010 lancet paper (Hogan et al., 2010), re-searchers {{from the}} University of Washington pre-sented maternal mortality patterns {{over the last}} three decades. based on an analysis of mortality data from 181 countries, they concluded that the improvement made in decreasing maternal deaths was much more substantial than previously assumed. according to the authors, nowadays almost 350, 000 women die every year as a result of pregnancy or delivery. This figure is indeed noticeably lower than the half million deaths that was commonly cited until then, but it remains nonetheless an unacceptably high number of lives lost. an important factor influencing maternal mortal-ity is the number of children a woman bears during her life. The lifetime risk of dying during a preg-nancy is almost linearly correlated with the number of pregnancies. in contrast to the important reduction that was achieved in maternal mortality ratios (the number of women who die of pregnancy-related causes per 100, 000 live births), the fertility rate at global level decreased between 1980 and 2011 from 3. 6 children per woman to 2. 5, only a 32 % decrease (United nations, 2011). These figures however mask important regional differences. in Sub-Saharan africa, the decrease over these three decades was ap-proximately 22 %, compared to 33 % in asia and 42 % in latin america. Today, the fertility rate in Sub-Saharan africa is still approximately 5 children per woman; in asia and latin america this figure is respectively 2. 2 and 2. 3. The slow decrease in fertility rate in Sub-Saharan africa is caused partly {{by the fact that the}} level of unmet need for contraception has almost stagnated over the last decade: the use of contraception me-thods among married women increased from 20 % in 2000 to 22 % in 2007 (United nations Population A call for <b>a</b> family planning <b>surg...</b>|$|R

(2009) Cell surface and secreted protein profiles of human thyroid cancer cell lines reveal distinct glycoprotein patterns. J. Proteome Res. 8, 3958 – 3968). Equally, it has been well established that tumor-associated inflammation through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a common cause of reduced hepatic drug metabolism and increased toxicity in advanced cancer patients being treated with cytotoxic chemotherapies. However, {{little is known about the}} impact of bearing a tumor (and downstream effects like inflammation) on liver membrane protein glycosylation. In this study, proteomic and glycomic analyses were used in combination to determine whether liver membrane protein glycosylation was affected in mice bearing the Engelbreth-Holm Swarm sarcoma. Peptide IPG-IEF and label-free quantitation determined that many enzymes involved in the protein glycosylation pathway specifically; mannosidases (Man 1 a-I, Man 1 b-I and Man 2 a-I), mannoside N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (Mgat-I and Mgat-II), galactosyltransferases (B 3 GalT-VII, B 4 GalT-I, B 4 GalT-III, C 1 GalT-I, C 1 GalT-II, and GalNT-I), and sialyltransferases (ST 3 Gal-I, ST 6 Gal-I, and ST 6 GalNAc-VI) were up-regulated in all livers of tumor-bearing mice (n = 3) compared with nontumor bearing controls (n = 3). In addition, many cell surface lectins: Sialoadhesin- 1 (Siglec- 1), C-type lectin family 4 f (Kupffer cell receptor), and Galactose-binding lectin 9 (Galectin- 9) were determined to be up-regulated in the liver of tumor-bearing compared with control mice. Global glycan analysis identified seven N-glycans and two O-glycans that had changed on the liver membrane proteins derived from tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, α (2, 3) sialic acid was found to be up-regulated on the liver membrane of tumor-bearing mice, which reflected the increased expression of its associated sialyltransferase and lectin receptor (siglec- 1). The overall increased sialylation on the liver membrane of Engelbreth-Holm Swarm bearing mice correlates with the increased expression of their associated glycosyltransferases and suggests that glycosylation of proteins in the liver plays a role in tumor-induced liver inflammationFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{understand}} dynamic optical changes during laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), we utilize the perturbative solution of the diffusion equation in heterogeneous media to formulate scattering weight functions for cylindrical line sources. The analysis explicitly shows how changes in detected interstitial light intensity {{are associated with the}} extent and location of the volume of thermal coagulation during treatment. Explanations for previously reported increases in optical intensity observed early during laser heating are clarified using the model and demonstrated with experimental measurements in ex vivo bovine liver tissue. This work provides an improved understanding of interstitial optical signal changes during LITT and indicates the sensitivity and potential of interstitial optical monitoring of thermal damage.
