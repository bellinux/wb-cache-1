5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality <b>and</b> <b>availability</b> of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E
5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind <b>and</b> <b>availability</b> of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E
5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see Production <b>and</b> <b>availability).</b> Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity in}} Military Command and Control (C 2) systems {{has led to}} greater vulnerability due to system <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> integrity caused by internal vulnerabilities and external threats. Several studies have proposed measures of <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> integrity for the assets in the C 2 systems using precise and certain measures (i. e., {{the exact number of}} attacks on the <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> the integrity, the number of countermeasures for the <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> integrity attacks, the effectiveness of the <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> integrity countermeasure in eliminating the threats, and the financial impact of each attack on the <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> integrity of the assets). However, these measures are often uncertain in real-world problems. The source of uncertainty can be vagueness or ambiguity. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets can represent vagueness and ambi-guity by formalizing inaccuracies inherent in human decision-making. In this paper, the authors extend the risk assessment literature by including fuzzy measures for the number of attacks on the <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> the integrity, the number of countermeasures for the <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> integrity attacks, and the effectiveness of the <b>availability</b> <b>and</b> integrity countermeasure in eliminating these threats.

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization <b>and</b> <b>availability</b> of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. This {{leads to}} an increase in mobility <b>and</b> <b>availability</b> of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E

Exports gradually increased after the war to 300 tons by 1949 but then started to decline with about four tons of export in 1985 as it became ineffective to produce vanilla due to as international competition, the costs of transportation of processed vanilla, exchange rates, state protectionism, plant pathology, varying global economics, <b>and</b> <b>availability</b> of cheaper varieties all affected the economics of vanilla production in the area.|$|E

5|$|Psilocin and {{psilocybin}} {{are scheduled}} drugs in many countries, and mushrooms containing them are prohibited by extension. In the United States, Federal {{law was passed}} in 1971 that put the psychoactive components into the most restricted schedule I category. For about three decades following this, several European countries remained relatively tolerant of mushroom use and possession. In the 2000s (decade), in response to increases in prevalence <b>and</b> <b>availability,</b> all European countries banned possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms; the Netherlands was the last country to enact such laws in 2008. However, they did not include psilocybin-containing sclerotia in the 2008 law, and thus, psilocybin-containing fungal compounds are available commercially in the Netherlands. In parallel legal developments in Asia, P.tampanensis was one of 13 psychoactive mushrooms specifically prohibited by law in Japan in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO {{development}} program. RSIP {{enhances the}} operational {{capability of the}} E-3 radars' electronic countermeasures, and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, <b>and</b> <b>availability.</b> Essentially, this program replaced the older transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and emitter-coupled logic (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with off-the-shelf digital computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding pulse compression to the pulse-Doppler mode, replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits). These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.|$|E

For tracks other than those by American Idol or Canadian Idol winners, sales {{were likely to be}} less than 1,000 per week. Nevertheless, this was the only singles chart Canadians had until June 2007, when the Canadian Hot 100 was released to the public.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} modern era Gaelic had been in {{geographical}} decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands. The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland, with the last fully competent member of the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were hereditary poets to the Lords of the Isles and then the Donalds of Clanranald, still working in the early eighteenth century. Nevertheless, interest in the sponsorship of panegyric Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders. Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots, which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Middle Scots was derived substantially from Old English, with Gaelic and French influences. It was usually called Inglyshe and {{was very close to}} the language spoken in northern England, but by the sixteenth century it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England. With the increasing influence <b>and</b> <b>availability</b> of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came {{to be done in the}} English fashion.|$|E
5|$|Several notable and {{damaging}} medicanes {{are known to}} have occurred. In September 1969, a north African Mediterranean tropical cyclone produced flooding that killed nearly 600individuals, left 250,000homeless, and crippled local economies. A medicane in September1996 that developed in the Balearic Islands region spawned six tornadoes and inundated parts of the islands. Several medicanes have also been subject to extensive study, such as those of January1982, January1995, September2006, November2011, and November2014. The January1995 storm is one of the best-studied Mediterranean tropical cyclones, with its close resemblance to tropical cyclones elsewhere <b>and</b> <b>availability</b> of observations. The medicane of September2006, meanwhile, is well-studied due to availability of existing observations and data.

In 2015, the NOAA resumed issuing advisories for tropical systems in the Mediterranean region.|$|E
5|$|The Global Crop Diversity Trust is an {{independent}} international organisation which exists to ensure the conservation <b>and</b> <b>availability</b> of crop diversity for food security worldwide. It was established through a partnership between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) acting through Bioversity International. The CGIAR is a consortium of International Agriculture Research Centers (IARC) and others that each conduct research on and preserve germplasm from a particular crop or animal species. The CGIAR holds one of the world's largest off site collections of plant genetic resources in trust for the world community. It contains over 500,000 accessions of more than 3,000 crop, forage, and agroforestry species. The collection includes farmers' varieties and improved varieties and, in substantial measure, the wild species from which those varieties were created. National germplasm storage centers include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, India's National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, the Taiwan Livestock Research Institute, and the proposed Australian Network of Plant Genetic Resource Centers.|$|E
