30|$|Tumors {{involving}} the ischiorectal fossa {{are most often}} secondary to direct extensions of primary anorectal, prostate, and sacral tumors [4]. Primary tumors are rare and diverse, benign (e.g., <b>aggressive</b> <b>angiomyxomas</b> [4 – 6], plexiform neurofibromas [4, 6], GIST [5, 6], leiomyomas [7]) to malignant (e.g., metastatic disease [4], lymphomas [5], liposarcomas [5], epithelioid sarcomas [5]). In these primary tumors, solid well-circumscribed and slow-growing tumors are often benign and tend to be followed up depending on their size. Most SFTs are also benign, but approximately 10 – 15 % of SFTs are malignant, recurring locally or as metastases [5].|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Cellular angiofibroma is {{a benign}} {{vascular}} neoplasm that typically arises in the paratesticular region {{in men and}} is easily confused with inguinal or scrotal hernia. Case presentation We present {{a case of a}} cellular angiofibroma arising from the spermatic cord of a 74 -year-old Caucasian man. Initially, the lesion was confused with a scrotal hernia, but imaging revealed a subcutaneous, inhomogeneous, but well-circumscribed lesion to the surrounding tissues with rich vasculature. Surgical resection of the lesion was performed. Histology revealed a benign tumor of vascular origin rich in fibroblasts. Conclusions Angiofibroma can easily be confused with an inguinal hernia and should be differentiated from Schwann cell tumors, perineuromas, spindle-cell lipomas, <b>aggressive</b> <b>angiomyxomas,</b> angiomyofibroblastomas, solitary fibrous tumors, spindle-cell liposarcomas, and leiomyomas.

40|$|A 49 -year-old female {{presented}} with an <b>aggressive</b> pelvic <b>angiomyxoma</b> (AAM). The completely resected specimen revealed the usual myxedematous tumor with a nodule inside it.

In the nodule, cellularity was increased and nuclear enlargement was observed, but nuclear atypia was not significant and mitotic figures were scarce. Immunohistochemically, both compo-nents were positive for desim, SMA, estrogen receptors, and progesterone receptors. However, they were negative for AE 1 / 3, EMA, S 100, CD 34, HMB 45, and Melan A.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Aggressive</b> <b>angiomyxoma</b> {{is a rare}} mesenchymal neoplasm. Although benign in the {{majority}} of the cases, these neoplasms usually present a locally infiltrative nature and high rates of recurrence. Due to its rarity, misdiagnosis is a common problem. Case Presentation. We present one case of <b>aggressive</b> <b>angiomyxoma</b> in a 25 -year-old pregnant woman. The patient presented with a large vaginal mass that was interpreted as a vaginal cyst. We performed surgical resection of the neoplasm and the correct diagnosis was only achieved after histological examination. With this case, we highlight the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients with genital and perineal masses of unknown origin and the impact of a correct preoperative diagnosis in patient’s management and follow-up. Conclusion. Although <b>aggressive</b> <b>angiomyxoma</b> is rare, it should be considered in differential diagnosis of pelviperineal masses in young women. Its positivity to estrogen and progesterone receptors can justify enlargement and recurrence during pregnancy, although few cases are reported. Early recognition demands high index of suspicion for both gynaecologists and pathologists. Wide surgical excision with tumor free margins is the basis of curative treatment. Adjuvant therapy may be necessary for residual or recurrent tumors. Long-term follow-up is recommended...|$|E
