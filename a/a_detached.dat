These figures are, however, below the England and Wales average.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>detached</b> four-storey {{bell tower}} was built near the riverbanks {{by the first}} Augustinian Recollect priest of Loboc. It has seven bells, with the 1863 bell being the oldest and the 1937 bell, named for Father Cayetano Bastes, being the largest. It also has a large wooden ratchet, {{installed}} in 1899, used during Holy Week, and a clock made by the Altonaga Company, installed in 1893.|$|E

He {{underwent}} surgery to repair <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> retina, and only registered 380 rushing yards in the eight-game shortened season, which the Chiefs finished with a 3–6 record. Delaney averaged 4.6 yards per carry, 9.1 yards per reception, and registered 1,811 all-purpose yards during his career with three touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|After {{complaints}} from the dispossessed parishioners of St Faith's, {{the east end}} of the west crypt was allotted to them as their parish church. The congregation were also allowed to keep <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> tower with a peal of bells east of the church which had historically been used to peal the summons to the Cheapside Folkmote. The parish later moved to the Jesus chapel during the reign of Edward VI and was merged with St Augustine Watling Street after the 1666 fire.|$|E
5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown {{has suggested that}} because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected by}} the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E

5|$|House {{prices in}} Weymouth and Portland are {{relatively}} high by UK standards, yet around {{average for the}} south of England—the average price of <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> house in 2010 was £303,622; semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper, at £204,647 and £203,207 respectively, and an apartment or maisonette cost £155,056. The crime rate in Weymouth of 7.6 burglaries per 1000 households is {{lower than that of}} England and Wales (11.6 per 1000), but above that of Dorset (3.6 per 1000). Unemployment levels are low, particularly in summer, at 2.5% of the economically active population in July 2011, compared to the UK average of 7.7%.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, the {{businessman}} Charles Seale Hayne restored Kingswear {{to form a}} summer house, using the local architect Thomas Lidstone; the ground floor was redesigned, a conical roof added and <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> round tower constructed on the north-west side. During the Second World War, it {{was used by the}} Royal Marines and the site reinforced by a concrete blockhouse. The Landmark Trust acquired it in 1987 for use as a holiday let, restoring the ground floor of the main building to its original appearance and recreating the earlier flat, lead roof. It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|In 1904, {{commissioned}} by the painter Lluís Graner, he designed the decoration of the Sala Mercè, in the Rambla dels Estudis, {{one of the first}} cinemas in Barcelona; the theatre imitated a cave, inspired by the Coves del Drac (Dragon's Caves) in Mallorca. Also for Graner he designed <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the foundations and the main gate were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building would have had a structure similar to the Casa Batlló or the porter's lodge of the Park Güell.|$|E
5|$|Iron Age and Roman remains {{have been}} found in the area. Steep {{formerly}} included <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> parish enclave called Ambersham, which lies deeply in West Sussex. It was the only detached part of Hampshire and was returned to West Sussex when a new law came into effect in 1844. The church of All Saints was built around 1125. From medieval times, Steep was included in the parish of East Meon until it became an independent parish in 1867. Since 1899 the village has been the location of Bedales School, a progressive public school.|$|E

In 1973–75 <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> belfry, designed by George Pace, was erected in {{the grounds of the}} cathedral. In 2005 a new Song School was added to the cathedral.

5|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, Bradley was <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> part of Overton. The parish {{boundaries}} of the village have been slightly altered since 1913, with Bradley Wood being cut down in order to widen a lane linking {{the centre of the}} village to Burkham. Some parts of the parish's eastern boundary was ceded to Bentworth around this time. A boarding kennel for dogs and cats named Gay Dogs opened in the village in the 1960s. Aside from a large solar energy farm being constructed near the boundary to Bentworth in November 2014, there have been no developments in the village.|$|E

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} classification, {{introduced by}} B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration {{instead of the}} Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if its orbit is not resonant, has a semi-major axis no greater than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If the object is not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240, it is classified as <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> TNO. (Objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In this scheme, the disc extends from the orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region {{referred to as the}} inner Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained <b>a</b> <b>detached</b> position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
