40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{recently}} that in mitral cells of the rat olfactory bulb, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) <b>autoreceptors</b> are activated during mitral cell firing. Here we consider in more details the mechanisms of mitral cell self-excitation and its physiological relevance. We show that both ionotropic NMDA and non-NMDA <b>autoreceptors</b> are activated by glutamate released from primary and secondary dendrites. In contrast to non-NMDA <b>autoreceptors,</b> NMDA <b>autoreceptors</b> are almost exclusively located on secondary dendrites and their activation generates a large and sustained self-excitation. Both intracellularly evoked and miniature NMDA-R mediated synaptic potentials are blocked by intracellular bis-(o-aminophenoxy) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) and result from a calcium-dependent release of glutamate. Self-excitation can be produced by a single spike, and trains of spikes result in frequency facilitation. Thus activation of excitatory <b>autoreceptors</b> is a major function of action potentials backpropagating in mitral cell dendrites, which results in an immediate positive feedback counteracting recurrent inhibition and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of olfactory inputs...|$|R

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{aspect of}} drug addiction {{is the ability}} of drug-associated cues to elicit craving and facilitate relapse. Understanding the factors that regulate cue reactivity will be vital for improving treatment of addictive disorders. Low availability of dopamine (DA) D 2 receptors (D 2 Rs) in the striatum is associated with high cocaine intake and compulsive use. However, the role of D 2 Rs of nonstriatal origin in cocaine seeking and taking behavior and cue reactivity is less understood and possibly underestimated. D 2 Rs expressed by midbrain DA neurons function as <b>autoreceptors,</b> exerting inhibitory feedback on DA synthesis and release. Here, we show that selective loss of D 2 <b>autoreceptors</b> impairs the feedback inhibition of DA release and amplifies the effect of cocaine on DA transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in vitro.

40|$|Abstract Background Neurotensin (NT) {{is known}} to act on {{dopamine}} (DA) neurons at the somatodendritic level to regulate cell firing and secondarily enhance DA release. In addition, anatomical and indirect physiological data suggest the presence of NT receptors at the terminal level. However, a clear demonstration of the mechanism of action of NT on dopaminergic axon terminals is lacking. We hypothesize that NT acts to increase DA release by inhibiting the function of terminal D 2 <b>autoreceptors.</b> To test this hypothesis, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) to monitor in real time the axonal release of DA in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Results DA release was evoked by single electrical pulses and pulse trains (10 Hz, 30 pulses). Under these two stimulation conditions, we evaluated the characteristics of DA D 2 <b>autoreceptors</b> and the presynaptic action of NT in the NAcc shell and shell/core border region. The selective agonist of D 2 <b>autoreceptors,</b> quinpirole (1 μM), inhibited DA overflow evoked by both single and train pulses. In sharp contrast, the selective D 2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride (5 μM), strongly enhanced DA release triggered by pulse trains, without any effect on DA release elicited by single pulses, thus confirming previous observations. We then determined the effect of NT (8 – 13) (100 nM) and found that although it failed to increase DA release evoked by single pulses, it strongly enhanced DA release evoked by pulse trains that lead to prolonged DA release and engage D 2 <b>autoreceptors.</b> In addition, initial blockade of D 2 <b>autoreceptors</b> by sulpiride considerably inhibited further facilitation of DA release generated by NT (8 – 13). Conclusion Taken together, {{these data suggest that}} NT enhances DA release principally by inhibiting the function of terminal D 2 <b>autoreceptors</b> and not by more direct mechanisms such as facilitation of terminal calcium influx. </p...|$|R

50|$|The D2sh <b>auto{{receptor}}</b> {{interacts with}} the trace amine-assorted receptor 1 (TAAR1), a recently discovered GPCR, to regulate monoaminergic systems in the brain. Active TAAR1 opposes the autoreceptor's activity by inactivating the dopamine transporter (DAT). In their review of TAAR1 in monoaminergic systems, Xie and Miller proposed this schematic: synaptic dopamine binds to the dopamine <b>autoreceptor,</b> which activates the DAT. Dopamine enters the presynaptic cells and binds to TAAR1, which increases adenylyl cyclase activity. This eventually allows for the translation of trace amines in the cytoplasm and activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, which further activate TAAR1 and dump dopamine into the synapse. Through a series of phosphorylation events related to PKA and PKC, active TAAR1 inactivates DAT, preventing uptake of dopamine from the synapse. The presence of two presynaptic receptors with opposite abilities to regulate monoamine transporter function allows for regulation of the monoaminergic system.|$|E
40|$|Drugs were infused {{into the}} substantia nigra {{of the rat}} brain via a {{microdialysis}} probe, and the extracellular concentration of dopamine (DA) and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was recorded from a second dialysis probe implanted in the ipsilateral striatum. This approach allowed {{the evaluation of the}} sensitivity of nigral <b>autoreceptors</b> to various D 1 and D 2 agonists and antagonists in conscious animals. Intranigral administration of the specific D 2 agonists, quinpirole (LY 171555; 1, 10 and 50 -mu-mol/l) and (-) -N- 0437 (10 -mu-mol/l), decreased the output of striatal dopamine, whereas the specific D 2 antagonist, (-) -sulpiride (10 and 50 -mu-mol/l), stimulated slightly the release of dopamine from the ipsilateral corpus striatum. Intranigral administration of the D 1 agonist, SKF 38393 (100 -mu-mol/l), and the D 1 antagonist, SCH 23390 (100 -mu-mol/l), was without effect on the release of striatal dopamine. The results indicate that release-controlling <b>autoreceptors</b> on nerve terminals and <b>autoreceptors</b> controlling impulse flow in the nigra contribute equally to the decrease of striatal DA release caused by a high systemic dose of D 2 agonists. The stimulating effect of D 2 antagonists on the release of DA is mainly caused by release-controlling <b>autoreceptors</b> localized on nerve terminals.
