5|$|The band {{arrived in}} Japan on 9 August, {{a week before}} the tour started, to a strong reception, and were greeted with gifts and flowers. Birch was not {{confident}} that the recording quality would be satisfactory, since the equipment supplied by Warner Bros. did not have any balance control and that the recorder's size did not appear big enough on sight to capture a commercial quality recording. The band were uninterested in the end result, concentrating on simply being able to deliver <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show.</b> Lord later noticed however that he felt this attitude meant the spontaneity of the performances and interplay between the band members was captured well.|$|E
25|$|Sports Night is an American {{television}} series about a fictional sports news show also called Sports Night. It {{focuses on the}} friendships, pitfalls and ethical issues the creative talent of the program face while trying to produce <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> under constant network pressure.

25|$|Hatton {{became very}} wealthy {{as a result}} of his {{progressing}} career and the Queen's fondness for him, so much so that in 1583 he embarked on the construction of a magnificent house in Holdenby, Northamptonshire. It was, at the time, the largest privately owned Elizabethan house in England. It contained 123 huge glass windows, in the days when glass was very expensive (indeed, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> of wealth was how many windows you could afford in your house). It had two great courts and was as large as the palace of Hampton Court. It was three storeys high and had two large state rooms, one for himself and another for the queen should she ever come and stay, which she never did.|$|E

25|$|Dravid {{compensated}} for the below par performance in tests in 2001–02 season with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> in the ODIs. On the tour to Zimbabwe, he scored an unbeaten 72 of 64 balls while chasing a target of 235 against Zimbabwe in the 3rd match of the tri-series guiding India to a 4-wicket win with 4 balls to spare. He was adjudged man of the match for his match winning knock. He {{ended up with a}} series aggregate of 121 runs from 5 matches at a decent average of 40.33 and a strike rate of 101.68. He was the only batsman with a strike rate of more than 100 among those who managed to aggregate more than 100 runs in the series. In the triangular series in Sri Lanka, India lost 3 consecutive matches and was on the brink elimination from the series. In the absence of injured Tendulkar and Zaheer and suspended Ganguly, Dravid captained the side in the 4th match and led them to their first win in the series. He played crucial innings in the last three league matches contributing to three consecutive victories, thus helping India qualify for the Finals which they eventually lost to Sri Lanka. Dravid topped India's run chart for the series scoring 259 runs at an average of 51.80 and a strike rate of 59.81. Dravid followed it up with another decent show in Standard Bank tri-series in South Africa, scoring 214 runs at an average of 53.50 and a strike rate of 71.81 including 3 fifties. He also kept wickets in the final two ODIs including the Final of the series effecting 3 stumpings. By the end of the South African tour, Dravid had started experiencing problem in his right shoulder. Although he played the ensuing home test series against England, he pulled out of the 5-match ODI series against England to undergo shoulder rehabilitation programme in South Africa. He returned for the home series against Zimbabwe and had a forgettable outing in the ODI series barring the one inning of 66 not out from 59 balls in the 2nd match.|$|E

[...] Robert Bianco wrote in USA Today in 2004, [...] "If any one outing can take credit for moving Friends from good to great, it's Prom Video" [...] and describes the resolution as an [...] "ingenious, unexpected twist." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show.</b> We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{said that}} [...] "Born Free" [...] was [...] "an intense episode {{that brought the}} Ice Truck Killer story to a {{satisfying}} conclusion." [...] He felt that the [...] "biggest shock of all" [...] was the reveal of Rudy as Dexter's brother, and described their confrontation as [...] "riveting". Goldman gave the episode an [...] "incredible" [...] rating of 9.5 out of 10. Paula Paige of TV Guide was [...] "impressed" [...] by Michael Hall's [...] "incredible acting ability," [...] praising his ability to transform from a [...] "stoic killer to overwrought brother {{in a matter of}} moments." [...] She said that the series went [...] "from being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> to a fantastic show in the course of one season," [...] and hoped that [...] "the sophomore season will be just as terrific." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad felt {{that it would be a}} [...] "shame" [...] if Hall did not win a Golden Globe Award, saying that he [...] "certainly deserves it." [...] He understood why Rudy wanted to make Debra the brothers' first victim together; Rudy was jealous of the life that Dexter received and killing Debra was the symbol of that life dying. Although Toomey said that the episode was [...] "really well written," [...] he was troubled that no one made the connection between Dexter and Rudy when all they had to do was read Rudy's file, but Toomey speculated that it could be discovered the next season.|$|E
500|$|Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network was sharply {{critical}} {{of the first two}} episodes of the anime adaptation. He did praise the show for [...] " [...] back the terror of the fee-fi-fo-fum set", but then said that it [...] "does not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> make". Kimlinger criticized Araki's direction, saying he [...] "clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling, but it's just crude and unpleasant." [...] On the other hand, other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it [...] "is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals", and [...] "an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next." [...] Though there are several apocalyptic action shows, Carlo Santos noted that [...] "few get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does". Santos described it as [...] "a masterpiece of death and destruction" [...] even if he only watched the first episode. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the [...] "intense, impactful first episode" [...] despite his feeling that it has [...] "limited animation". Martin also compared Attack on Titan vibe and visual aesthetic to Claymore. John Sinnott of DVD Talk called the series one of the best ones he has ever watched and one [...] "that anime fans should not miss." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Wass {{from the}} website Idolator called the show a [...] "concert extravaganza {{in the style}} of Michael Jackson or Madonna" [...] praising the fact that the singer made a {{progress}} in the production values compared with her previous performances, mostly due to the expensive and high-quality visual projections which [...] "create atmosphere and add another layer to the production". He further praised the singer's [...] "extraordinary talent" [...] during the performances hailing her as [...] "the greatest entertainer of her generation" [...] after seeing the show which showcased [...] "an icon at top of her game". Tiffany Poole from The Oklahoman praised the fashion, video backdrops and [...] "some of the most impersonated dance moves on YouTube" [...] concluding, [...] "To say that Beyoncé puts on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> would be grossly understated." [...] Billboard writer Gail Mitchell hailed the concert as a [...] "musical and visual extravaganza" [...] complete with a kaleidoscope of colorful imagery and dancing, which according to him enhanced the music complete with the singer's strong vocals, rather than overshadowing it. He concluded that the tour claimed [...] "the multi-talented artist's intent to join the rarefied ranks of ultimate entertainer". Nick Hasted of The Independent wrote that the tour followed the stadium trends containing [...] "big-budget movie clips and Broadway musical dance moves, with platoons of backing singers and dancers acting as extras" [...] further hailing it as a [...] "Cecil B. DeMille spectacle". He finished his reviews by concluding, [...] "what makes this show's largely enervating juggernaut breathe is Beyoncé's tireless physical effort. She has created a literal body of work".|$|E

He then introduces the first group of musicians, led by Shankar, who, like Harrison, attempts to convey the intricacies of Indian classical music to the audience, as well as outlining the reason for this [...] "special benefit concert". Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan proceed to tune their instruments and then stop after about 90 seconds. The audience, apparently believing they have heard an entire piece, respond with enthusiastic applause, to which Shankar replies: [...] "Thank you, if you appreciate the tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more." [...] The four musicians then launch into a fifteen-minute dhun.|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, Barrichello {{took the}} lead at the first corner but after his first stop, he came out behind Felipe Massa who held him up. A fuel rig problem during his second stop meant that he {{finished}} the race in sixth, a place behind teammate Jenson Button. After the race he publicly blamed Brawn GP saying [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> from the team in how to lose a race" [...] and [...] "They made me lose the race". Team principal Ross Brawn said of the incident [...] "He had the 11th fastest time of the race. You can't win a race with that speed". However he refused to criticize Barrichello for his outburst.

2500|$|Invalid Channel said, [...] "Bajo and Hex are hilarious to watch, {{they have}} so many funny moments. You can tell they know their shit, too, they've been around the block {{when it comes to}} games and they use {{terminology}} without it sounding super lame and out of place. At the same time, they make it easy for non-gamers, or people who wish they were gamers (ie: me) to understand. Bits and pieces feel really awkward though, and I know they put in awkward moments for comedic effect sometimes, but I find that these don't always have the comedic effect that they're probably going for, and end up going full circle just being plain awkward". It argues the [...] "small size and down-to-earth-ness" [...] of the show adds to its charm, by saying [...] "a commercial version of the show would be way too polished and just wouldn't feel right". It ended its review by saying [...] "all in all, Good Game is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> [...] the reviews are quite good".

2500|$|WrestleMania XX was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed critical reception. Robert Leighty, Jr. of 411mania gave the event an overall score of 7.3 out of 10.0 and noted that [...] "This is a very long show {{with a lot of}} filler to get {{as many people as possible}} involved, but the Main Matches all delivered in some way. The 2 Main Title matches were fantastic, and the handicap match was a blast. You throw in a strong Jericho/Christian match and the unique crowd response of Goldberg/Lesnar and you have a strong WrestleMania. Not the greatest ever thanks to a mediocre run in the middle, but <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> that could have been better." [...] The Triple Threat match between Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship has received critical acclaim with many wrestling publications and websites calling this match [...] one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time. Robert Leighty, Jr. of 411mania cited that the main event was [...] "The greatest three way match in the history of professional wrestling. Everything was perfect about this match including the finish." ...|$|E
2500|$|The varied song {{selection}} {{allowed the}} band {{to create a}} [...] "rotation" [...] of songs that was roughly repeated every 3 to 5 performances ("shows"). [...] The rotation created two phenomena. The first was that the desire of Deadheads to hear their favorite song or attend <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show</b> led many of them to begin following the band on its tour. [...] The second was that {{the large number of}} traveling fans empowered the band to perform multiple shows in each venue with the assurance that the performances would be mostly sold out, as almost all were from the mid [...] 1980s on. In this way, the Deadheads were one of the main driving forces keeping the band going. [...] With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed out of the familiarity. As generations turned from the Acid Tests to the 1970s (and onward), tours became a time to revel with friends at concerts, old and new, who never knew the psychedelic age that spawned the band they loved. As with any large community, Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang which is amply illustrated in books about the Grateful Dead such as the Skeleton Key.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of his first book, My Story in 1975, he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks. In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>show.</b> My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!" ...|$|E
