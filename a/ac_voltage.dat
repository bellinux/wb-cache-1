5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal <b>AC</b> <b>voltage</b> output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

For gate voltages in phase opposition we find quantum destructive interferences analogous to the interferences in closed-loop undriven triple dots. As the voltages oscillate in phase, interferences between multiple paths give rise to dark states. Those totally cancel the current, and could be experimentally resolved.

25|$|The {{standardized}} {{measuring method}} is too time consuming for manufacturers to use during production {{for each individual}} component. For industrial produced capacitors the capacitance value is instead measured with a faster low frequency <b>AC</b> <b>voltage</b> and a correlation factor is used to compute the rated capacitance.|$|E
25|$|The rated DC voltage VR is {{the maximum}} DC voltage, or peak value of pulse voltage, or {{the sum of}} an applied DC voltage and the peak value of a {{superimposed}} <b>AC</b> <b>voltage,</b> which may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature between the category temperature and the rated temperature.|$|E

30|$|Because slack {{terminals}} adopt DC <b>voltage</b> (<b>AC</b> frequency) droop control, {{as shown}} in Fig.  3, the DC <b>voltage</b> (<b>AC</b> frequency) will change with operation point variation, affecting power supply quality and stability when the DC <b>voltage</b> (<b>AC</b> frequency) deviates from its rated value.

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors are polarized capacitors {{because of their}} anodization principle. They can only be operated with DC voltage applied with the correct polarity.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{condition}} assessment of the distribution power cables, which have a very critical part {{in the distribution of}} electrical power over regional distances. The majority of the outages in the power system is related to the distribution cables, of which for more than 60 % to internal defects. The material degradation in the power cables can be categorised into four local degradation processes, which are related to partial discharges. Partial discharge characteristics therefore provide sensitive parameters for detecting degradation processes. With partial discharge diagnostics, the insulation defects (discharge sources) can be pinpointed by "time domain reflectometry" to a specific component over the length of the cable system. To detect partial discharges external energising sources are required. In this thesis, damped <b>AC</b> <b>voltages</b> (temporarily attenuating <b>AC</b> <b>voltages</b> {{as a result of an}} oscillation obtained by means of an LC resonant circuit) are successfully investigated in this thesis as an effective energising method for partial discharge diagnostics. The compact and low weight measuring system results in a low noise level and high sensitivity in the field during the low power damped <b>AC</b> <b>voltages</b> with frequencies in the range of 100 - 500 Hz for 100 - 200 ms, for discharging defects in impregnated paper as well as polymeric cable insulation. The effects of the different test voltages on discharge activities are investigated by measuring different defect models in the laboratory and power cables in the field with 50 Hz <b>AC</b> <b>voltages,</b> damped <b>AC</b> <b>voltages</b> at various frequencies and 0, 1 Hz voltages. It is shown that the test voltage shapes and frequencies do not have major influence on the values for the partial discharge parameters. Knowledge rules for condition assessment of the different insulation systems are developed. Statistical analysis of large amounts of measurement data are for this an effective and reliable method to determine experience norms (standard based on experience) for condition assessment. The various partial discharge properties relate to different aspects of the condition of a cable system and its components. The weighted combination of the various knowledge rules results in a methodology for decision making of maintaining cable systems. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
