5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, Fairley joined the Australian Army Medical Corps in 1915. He investigated an epidemic of meningitis that was occurring in Army camps in Australia. While with the 14th General Hospital in Cairo, he investigated schistosomiasis (then known as bilharzia) and developed tests and treatments for the disease. In the inter-war period he became renowned as <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> tropical medicine.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} the events of Brood War, the shapeshifter reemerged in the Korpulu Sector, now going by the persona Dr. Emil Narud – an enigmatic {{scientist}} first introduced in Wings of Liberty and later appearing in Heart of the Swarm, voiced by Armin Shimerman. Narud {{was the head of}} the Moebius Foundation and was viewed as a genius on Zerg biology and <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> Protoss and Xel'Naga technology.|$|E

5|$|Horner, <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> the Hadrosauridae family, {{had less}} {{affinity}} for {{other kinds of}} dinosaurs. In 1987 and 1989, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening {{the case for the}} validity of a separate Styracosaurus ovatus, to be distinguished from Styracosaurus albertensis.|$|E
5|$|Mary Anning (1799–1847) {{lived in}} Lyme Regis and {{followed}} in her father's footsteps as a collector. She became <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> the fossils {{to be found}} in the Blue Lias around the town and discovered the first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton at The Spittles. Other important discoveries of ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and a pterosaur followed, as well as invertebrates such as cephalopods and their ink sacs.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an {{assistant}} professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior of atmospheric electricity, publishing in journals including the Physical Review, Journal of Applied Physics, Journal of Chemical Physics, and the Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism. He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter, a type of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both time-of-flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.|$|E

5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> Canada's honours, raised {{the concern that}} the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{superseded}} Rowell {{in command}} of New Guinea Force on 23 September. MacArthur visited Blamey in Port Moresby on 4 October 1942 and the two agreed to establish a Combined Operations Service Command (COSC) to co-ordinate logistical activities. To command it, MacArthur appointed Brigadier General Dwight Johns, the deputy commander of USASOS in SWPA, <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> airbase construction. He was given an Australian deputy, Brigadier Victor Secombe, who had directed the rehabilitation of the port of Tobruk in 1941. All Australian and American logistical units were placed under COSC, which also controlled a fleet of small craft and luggers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible {{that he was in}} overall command of this Persian offensive.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{knowledge}} of the region helped him to become <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> the West's natural history. Over the years he welcomed travelers, including those interested in natural history, to his home overlooking the Ohio River. Clark supplied details on the area's plant and animal life to John Pope and John James Audubon, and hosted his brother, William, and Meriweather Lewis, prior to their expedition to the Pacific Northwest. Clark also provided information on the Ohio Valley's native tribes to Allan Bowie Magruder and archaeological evidence related to the Mound Builders to John P. Campbell.|$|E
5|$|David Kinsley, <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> Hindu goddesses {{and former}} Professor of Religion at McMaster University, {{agrees with the}} Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless {{to focus on the}} display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E
5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two seats at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being left on the back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on {{embryonic stem cell research}} itself.|$|E
5|$|In the English Civil War, Thomas Bushell held Lundy for King Charles I, {{rebuilding}} Marisco Castle and garrisoning {{the island}} {{at his own}} expense. He {{was a friend of}} Francis Bacon, a strong supporter of the Royalist cause and <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> mining and coining. It was the last Royalist territory held {{between the first and second}} civil wars. After receiving permission from Charles I, Bushell surrendered the island on 24 February 1647 to Richard Fiennes, representing General Fairfax. In 1656, the island was acquired by Lord Saye and Sele.|$|E
5|$|Information {{gathered}} in Rennes, Paris, and Eindhoven pointed to Strasbourg {{as a place}} of particular interest. Physicists Rudolf Fleischmann and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were known to be working at the University of Strasbourg, as was Eugen von Haagen, <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> viruses whose work was of great concern to the Alsos Mission's Biological Warfare section. The Naval section was interested in the torpedo research being carried out there, and jet engine development was being undertaken at Strasbourg's Junkers plant.|$|E

5|$|Massino testified {{again in}} the 2012 {{extortion}} trial of Genovese capo Anthony Romanello, primarily to provide background as <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> the American Mafia. While Massino had not worked closely with Romanello, prosecutors decided to use him after another mobster-turned-witness was dropped; the case ended in an acquittal. Massino had also been considered as a witness in the 2013 murder trial of Colombo acting boss Joel Cacace, but was dropped after {{he was unable to}} fully remember the meeting where he claimed Cacace indicated his involvement in the murder of NYPD officer Ralph Dols.|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} of John Strong Perry Tatlock, a prominent Old English philologist and <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> Geoffrey Chaucer, Tatlock {{was a graduate}} of Vassar College and the Stanford Medical School, where she studied to become a psychiatrist. Tatlock began seeing Oppenheimer in 1936, when she was a graduate student at Stanford and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. As a result of their relationship and her membership of the Communist Party, she was placed under surveillance by the FBI, and her phone was tapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>on</b> South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, {{author of}} Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject}} of Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One invocation to her calls her the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with the severed head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E
