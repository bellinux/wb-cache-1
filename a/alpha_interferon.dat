For example, during research to produce a more efficient vaccine for smallpox, Yasu-ichi Nagano and Yasuhiko Kojima—two Japanese virologists working at the Institute for Infectious Diseases at the University of Tokyo—noticed inhibition of viral growth {{in an area of}} rabbit-skin or testis previously inoculated with UV-inactivated virus. [...] They hypothesised that some [...] "viral inhibitory factor" [...] was present in the tissues infected with virus and attempted to isolate and characterize this factor from tissue homogenates. Independently, Monto Ho, in John Enders's lab, observed in 1957 that attenuated poliovirus conferred a species specific anti-viral effect in human amniotic cell cultures. They described these observations in a 1959 publication, naming the responsible factor viral inhibitory factor (VIF). It took another fifteen to twenty years, using somatic cell genetics, to show that the interferon action gene and interferon gene reside in different human chromosomes. The purification of human beta interferon did not occur until 1977. Chris Y.H. Tan and his co-workers purified and produced biologically active, radio-labeled human beta interferon by superinducing the interferon gene in fibroblast cells, and they showed its active site contains tyrosine residues. Tan's laboratory isolated sufficient amounts of human beta interferon to perform the first amino acid, sugar composition and N-terminal analyses. They showed that human beta interferon was an unusually hydrophobic glycoprotein. This explained the large loss of interferon activity when preparations were transferred from test tube to test tube or from vessel to vessel during purification.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{molecular}} mechanisms mediating the antiproliferative {{effects of}} <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> on human pancreatic carcinoma cells are poorly understood. AIM: To characterise {{the effects of}} <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> on protein kinase C isoenzyme expression in <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> sensitive and resistant human pancreatic tumour cell lines. METHODS: The ductal human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines Capan 1 and Capan 2 were investigated. Anchorage dependent and independent growth was determined by cell number and a human tumour clonogenic assay. <b>Interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> receptor expression was examined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Protein kinase C isoenzyme expression was evaluated by western blotting using monospecific polyclonal antibodies. RESULTS: <b>Interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> treatment results in a time and dose dependent inhibition of anchorage dependent and independent growth in Capan 1 cells while Capan 2 cells were not affected by <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha.</b> Both cell lines express <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> receptor mRNA transcripts. Growth inhibition by <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> in Capan 1 cells was paralleled by a profound decrease of protein kinase C alpha and zeta expression while these isoenzymes were unaffected in the interferon resistant cell line Capan 2.

No detectable <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> was found in cultures of unstimulated intestinal and autologous peripheral mononuclear cells from controls and Crohn's disease whereas <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> was released in all cultures stimulated with the virus. In all 12 hours experiments in both groups, virus stimulated intestinal mononuclear cells yielded significantly less <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> than the autologous peripheral cells. The kinetics experiments showed that control intestinal mononuclear cells appeared to be poorly responsive to virus stimulation showing a release of <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> significantly {{lower than that of}} the autologous peripheral cells.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the serum levels of <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> in childhood-onset {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} patients, their first-degree relatives and healthy controls and to evaluate the associations between serum <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> and disease activity, laboratory findings and treatment features. METHODS: We screened consecutive childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus patients in a longitudinal cohort at the pediatric rheumatology unit of the State University of Campinas between 2009 and 2010. All patients demonstrated disease onset {{before the age of}} 16. Disease status was assessed according to the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI). <b>Interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. RESULTS: We included 57 childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus patients (mean age 17. 33 +/- 4. 50), 64 first-degree relatives (mean age 39. 95 +/- 5. 66), and 57 healthy (mean age 19. 30 +/- 4. 97) controls. Serum <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> levels were significantly increased in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus patients compared to their first-degree relatives and healthy controls. <b>Interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> levels were significantly increased in patients with positive dsDNA antibodies, patients with cutaneous vasculitis, patients with new malar rash and patients who were not receiving medication. <b>Interferon</b> <b>alpha</b> levels correlated with C 3 levels and systemic lupus erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a cost-utility study of adefovir, entecavir, <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha,</b> {{pegylated}} <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha,</b> lamivudine and tenofovir for chronic hepatitis B in the context of Brazilian Public Health Care System. A systematic review was carried out for efficacy and safety. Another review was performed to collect utility data and transition probabilities between health states. A Markov model was developed in a time horizon of 40 years with annual cycles for three groups of: HBeAg positive, HBeAg negative, and all patients. These strategies were compared to a fourth group that received no treatment. Discount rates of 5 % were applied and sensitivity analyses were performed. Tenofovir offered the best cost-utility ratio for the three evaluated models: U$ 397, U$ 385 and U$ 384 (per QALY, respectively, for HBeAg positive, negative, and all patients). All other strategies were completely dominated because they showed higher costs and lower effectiveness than tenofovir. The sequence of cost-utility in the three models was: tenofovir, entecavir, lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, pegylated <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha,</b> and <b>interferon</b> <b>alpha.</b> In the sensitivity analysis, adefovir showed lower cost-utility than telbivudine in some situations. The study has some limitations, primarily related to the creation of scenarios and modeling. In this study, tenofovir presented the best cost-utility ratio. The results obtained in this study will be valuable in decision-making and in the review of the clinical protocol, mainly involving the allocation of available resources for health care...|$|R
