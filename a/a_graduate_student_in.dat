5|$|Part I {{opens in}} 1972 Amsterdam. The narrator finds an old vellum-bound {{book with a}} woodcut of a dragon in the center {{associated}} with Dracula. When she asks her father Paul about it, he tells her how he found the handmade book in his study carrel when he was <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s. Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched Țepeș, the Dracula myth surrounding him, and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E
