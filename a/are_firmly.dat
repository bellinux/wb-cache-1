5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} depictions of Jesus at the Dura-Europos church <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> dated to before 256. Thereafter, {{despite the lack of}} biblical references or historical records, a wide range of depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other Early Christian art, {{the earliest}} depictions date to the late 2nd or early 3rd century, and surviving images are found especially in the Catacombs of Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E

25|$|To {{say that}} they have a key role to play is an understatement. Finance is {{connected}} to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> laid. So often they are the litmus test by which public confidence in the institution is either won or lost.|$|E
25|$|Back mount is {{the system}} where one or more {{cylinders}} <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> attached to a harness, usually with a buoyancy compensator jacket or wing, and carried on the diver's back. Back mount allows cylinders to be manifolded together as twins, or for special circumstances, trips or quads. It is a high profile arrangement and may be unsuited to some sites where the diver needs to pass through low openings. This is the standard configuration for single or twin cylinder recreational diving, and for much technical diving in open water.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{cylinders}} in {{these types of}} revolvers <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> attached at {{the front and rear}} of the frame, and the frame is typically full thickness all the way around, fixed cylinder revolvers are inherently strong designs. Accordingly, many modern large caliber hunting revolvers tend {{to be based on the}} fixed cylinder design. Fixed cylinder revolvers can fire the strongest and most powerful cartridges, but at the price of being the slowest to load and reload and they cannot use speedloaders or moon clips for loading, as only one chamber is exposed at a time to the loading gate.|$|E

25|$|After new {{segments}} of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if {{the temperature of}} the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with hydraulic equipment. They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, but because they <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are a bit like a piece of stretched elastic firmly fastened down.|$|E
25|$|As a result, White {{frequently}} championed {{nineteenth century}} evolutionists {{in a search}} for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> rooted in the writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While {{it can be argued that}} White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were firmly rooted in their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, his conception of evolution and progress remained firmly rooted in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Montevideo is {{the heartland}} of {{retailing}} in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought {{a major change in}} the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> established in Montevideo.|$|E

25|$|The volume {{contains}} five {{poems and}} six short stories, {{all on the}} theme of Christianity. Some of the poems can be taken as comments or epilogues on the short stories (e.g. Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh refers to the gifts in the stable which The Naughty Donkey in the preceding story attempts to eat). Although relatively unknown, this work, when referred to at all, is often stated as being for children; however the stories it contains <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> aimed at an adult audience and with adult themes, especially for 1965. For instance, in the story The Water Bus, Mrs Hargreaves's cleaner tries to offload her woes to her employer, the main one of which is that her daughter is dying in hospital after an illegal abortion went wrong.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} which Islam places {{upon the}} feminine/masculine polarity (and therefore complementarity) results, quite logically, in {{a separation of}} social functions. In general, a woman's sphere of operation is the home in which she is the dominant figureand a man's corresponding sphere is the outside world. However, this separation is not, in practice, as rigid as it appears. There are many examplesboth in {{the early history of}} Islam and in the contemporary worldof Muslim women who have played prominent roles in public life, including being sultanas, queens, elected heads of state and wealthy businesswomen Moreover, it is important to recognise that in Islam, home and family <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> situated at the centre of life in this world and of society: a man's work cannot take precedence over the private realm.|$|E
25|$|Recently, NASA has {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} 7 earth-like planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star 40 light-years away from our solar system. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has revealed the first known system of seven Earth-size planets around a single star. Three of these planets <b>are</b> <b>firmly</b> located in the habitable zone, {{the area around the}} parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to {{life as we know it}} – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.|$|E
