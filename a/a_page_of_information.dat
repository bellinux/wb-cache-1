We have designed information-rich 3 D worlds enhanced by lightweight interactions where users can navigate and interact with a specific datum (focus) in relation to the complete data set (context). To demonstrate feasibility and functionality, we have built three high-fidelity prototypes in desktopVR, expandable to portable immersive VR, populated with 3 D data artifacts extrapolated from actual image collections in the Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University (Perseus). The first prototype is an interactive London walkthrough constructed from an overlay of several building, plot and street maps.

The system, known as DAISY (Digital Automated Identification System) is a computer programme to assist people who may have little knowledge of insects. The only expertise required is the ability to detach a wing from the insect and place it on a slide. The image of the wing is transferred to a computer monitor through a microscope linked to a digital camera. An identification is quickly given together with <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about the insect. At present only three groups of insects, 11 species of parasitoid, five species of parasitic wasp and 40 species of biting midge are held in the system's memory.

The researchers responsible for DAISY are confident that it will soon be possible to transfer these images electronically to the Internet.

50|$|The {{game was}} again {{published}} as three core rulebooks which incorporated the expansions and revisions {{which had been}} published in various supplements over the previous decade.

It was intended that the loose-leaf binder would allow the book to be updated and customized as needed. This format proved highly susceptibile to wear and tear however, and presented difficulties in keeping alphabetic order when pages had been printed with monsters on each side. Subsequently, the loose leaf formatting was abandoned and the Compendium as a core book was replaced by single-volume hardcover Monstrous Manual in 1993, collecting popular monsters from the Compendium. The edition also greatly increases the power of dragons. This was done to counter the impression of relative weakness of the game's titular monster.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since {{the late}} 19 th century some new topics were {{integrated}} {{in the general}} information Spanish newspapers stimulated by the new ways of doing journalism that were offered by the new information technologies applied {{to the production of}} newspapers. One of the topics that was most welcome by the general public and caused new presentation layouts in newspapers was sport. And one of the first general information newspapers that dedicated not only great space but also typographical and formal attention to sport was El Debate (Madrid, 1910 - 1936). A structural and instrumental analysis of each piece of sport news published during the 26 years of history of the newspaper has shown that El Debate grouped the pieces of sport news in the same page and in 1922 began publishing <b>a</b> full <b>page</b> <b>of</b> sport <b>information</b> in <b>a</b> weekly basis. Moreover, already since 1919, El Debate started using two-column wide headlines instead of just one-column wide headlines. Thus, the sport <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> El Debate pioneered the gradual abandon of the vertical layout in order to break the column alleys with headlines and pictures, which became a constant feature from the 1920 s {{until the end of the}} newspaper...|$|R

40|$|This thesis, {{directed}} toward {{a wide variety}} of persons interested in energy efficiency issues with office technology, explores several issues relating to reducing energy use and improving energy efficiency of office equipment. Chapter 2 compares policies and programs in several European countries and the United States that could enhance the energy efficiency of office technology. Different programs are examined, including federal government programs where in some cases target values for power usage of office equipment have already been set. Large customer procurement programs, industry involvement, with emphasis on voluntary labeling programs, and research projects are also examined. Procedures that provide energy consumption measurements of various types of equipment are important for providing information to emerging procurement programs. Two sets of proposed test procedures for testing energy consumption of copiers, fax machines and printers are examined and compared. In Chapter 3, comparisons are made of the electrical power and energy used by computers, displays, copiers, printers and facsimile machines, both while operating and while idle. Technology options for reduced energy and power consumption and improved energy efficiency are examined. As the capability of office equipment has increased, there has been a trend toward increased electrical power requirements and energy consumption while equipment is in active operation. Computer power continues to grow rapidly. These factors will combine to exert an upward pressure for electrical power. However, some emerging technologies are lessening or in some cases reversing this trend, with little or no penalty in performance or production. The overall balance between increased service and efficiency is uncertain. Chapter 3 also examines the embodied energy of paper and office equipment. I compare it to the total energy required to produce <b>a</b> printed <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> or required over the lifetime of the machine. Many difficulties were encountered in collecting and comparing data on power requirements of various machines. Procedures for testing the energy usage of office equipment are needed to make valid comparisons between machines. This thesis describes in Chapter 4, modifications to the procedure issued by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to test energy consumption in copiers, to account for energy saver modes and double-sided copying. It also presents new procedures submitted to the ASTM committee for printers and fax machines. A fourth procedure is also presented here, one to test the energy consumption of personal computers. Typically, office equipment is not in use for much of the time it is turned on. Use of power management in office equipment can considerably decrease overall energy consumption. While energy saver modes are more prevalent in copiers, those printers that have incorporated this feature achieve more dramatic power reductions. Fax machines do not seem to utilize this technology at all, even though many have high power consumption when they are idle. How energy saving modes effect the overall energy consumption of machines is largely determined by operating profiles of the machines. The effect of operating profiles on energy usage with imaging equipment has not yet been examined. Methods of determining operating profiles of office equipment are presented in Chapter 5. A comparison is made between the energy use predicted by the ASTM procedures, energy use predicted by the ASTM procedures and actual operating profiles, and the actual energy usage of several copiers and printers. For copiers, the ASTM rated energy use per page was from 10 - 161 % different from the actual measured energy use per <b>page.</b> The use <b>of</b> the ASTM method with the measured operating profiles of the machine gave a 7 - 22 % difference in energy use per page. For printers, the rated values using the ASTM method gave 61 - 317 % difference from the actual measured energy use per page, while using actual usage profiles with the ASTM method gave 0 - 6 % difference. This thesis provides information on a variety of subject in the area of energy use and energy efficiency in office technology. The results provide information for emerging programs and provide a strong basis for a variety of further research. by Cyane Bemiss Dandridge. Thesis (M. S.)
