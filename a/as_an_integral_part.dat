5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E

Made <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E

In the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing {{role in the development of}} geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E

5|$|Animal supporters, {{standing}} {{on either side}} of the shield to hold and guard it, first appeared in English heraldry in the 15th century. Originally, they were not regarded <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of arms, and were subject to frequent change. Various animals were sporadically shown supporting the Royal Arms of England, but it was only with the reign of Edward IV that their use became consistent. Supporters fell under the regulation of the Kings of Arms in the Tudor period. The heralds of that time also prochronistically created supporters for earlier monarchs, and although these attributed supporters were never used by the monarchs concerned, they were later used to signify them on public buildings or monuments completed after their deaths, for instance at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor Castle.|$|E

He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would not only have been the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher {{was to take the}} centre instead of the altar, thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.|$|E

The debut album of the group, Jump and Jive with Hi-5, corresponded with the first series of the show and was released in September 1999 by Sony Music, reaching No.33 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The group also toured around Sydney in their first year. Throughout the early years, Hi-5 won five consecutive ARIA Awards for Best Children's Album, had their albums receive multiple sale accreditations, while four releases reached the top10 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The group also toured nationally every year, with sell-out national tours of their early stage shows, in venues such as the Sydney Opera House.|$|E
