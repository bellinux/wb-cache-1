5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk,</b> {{early detection}} and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment {{requires the use of}} multiple antibiotics {{over a long period of}} time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} population, {{screening}} of large groups is not currently considered effective, although newer techniques, and the screening of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated. Nevertheless, regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging {{is recommended for}} those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> from inherited genetics.|$|E
5|$|Screening is an {{important}} method in preventive medicine strategies. Screening programs exist to test the blood of children <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for lead exposure, such as those who live near lead-related industries.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{toxicity}} of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning. In China, prison labor was used by a private mining company {{as recently as the}} 1950s to develop new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels. Worker health in functioning mines is <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive use in {{developing}} countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met. These benefits are achieved by {{reducing the number of}} unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is usually}} treated with daily {{medication}} once a second seizure has occurred, while in those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk,</b> medication may be started {{after the first}} seizure. Supporting people's self management of their condition may be useful. In drug-resistant cases different management options may be looked at including a special diet, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.|$|E
40|$|Can statin therapy {{be used in}} hyperlipidemic {{patients}} with baseline transaminase elevations? Although <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for mild-moderate increases in transaminases, {{patients with}} elevated baseline transaminase values are not <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for severe elevations compared with patients normal at baseline (SOR: C, disease-oriented outcomes) ...|$|R

30|$|It is {{recommended}} for future study to incorporate more characteristics in violation data for identification of the groups <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of future violations and future crashes. The future study also could match more violation types as crash types to identify the groups <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> {{of each of the}} crash types.|$|R
5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Inhalation of volcanic ash, also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{is present}} in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma. Anyone who has {{undergone}} force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for other injuries also. In 44% of SCI cases, other serious injuries are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma. Other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic fractures, and long bone fractures.|$|E
5|$|The {{three factors}} of Virchow's triad—venous stasis, hypercoagulability, {{and changes in}} the endothelial blood vessel lining (such as {{physical}} damage or endothelial activation)—contribute to DVT and are used to explain its formation. Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation. Various risk factors contribute to DVT, though many <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> never develop it.|$|E
50|$|Uterine sarcoma are rare, {{out of all}} {{malignancies}} of the uterine body {{only about}} 4% will be uterine sarcomas. Generally, {{the cause of the}} lesion is not known, however patients with a history of pelvic radiation are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk.</b> Most tumors occur after menopause.Women who take long-term tamoxifen are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|R

5|$|Those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of {{infection}} {{should be tested}} as there is effective treatment {{for those who have}} the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, {{men who have sex with}} men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is closely}} linked to both {{overcrowding}} and malnutrition, {{making it one of}} the principal diseases of poverty. Those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> thus include: people who inject illicit drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g. prisons and homeless shelters), medically underprivileged and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving these patients.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening people who are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.|$|E

5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It {{was caused by a}} large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms {{may be difficult to}} distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E

50|$|Vaccination is {{especially}} important for people <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of serious influenza complications or people who live with or care for people <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for serious complications. In 2009, a new high-dose formulation of the standard influenza vaccine was approved. The Fluzone High Dose is specifically for people 65 and older; the difference is that it has four times the antigen dose of the standard Fluzone.|$|R

5|$|Estimates {{show that}} up to 500,000people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 {{individuals}} being considered to be <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Lahars {{pose a threat to}} the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk,</b> which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the most}} widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all {{children}} being vaccinated. The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years. As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's use in screening. A number of new vaccines are currently in development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background With {{improved}} {{childhood cancer}} cure rate, long term sequelae are becoming {{an important factor}} of quality of life. Signs of cardiovascular disease are frequently found in long term survivors of cancer. Cardiac damage {{may be related to}} irradiation and chemotherapy. We have evaluated simultaneous influence of a series of independent variables on the late cardiac damage in childhood cancer survivors in Slovenia and identified groups <b>at</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>risk.</b> Methods 211 long-term survivors of different childhood cancers, at least five years after treatment were included in the study. The evaluation included history, physical examination, electrocardiograpy, exercise testing and echocardiograpy. For analysis of risk factors, beside univariate analysis, multivariate classification tree analysis statistical method was used. Results and Conclusion Patients treated latest, from 1989 – 98 are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> for any injury to the heart (73 %). Among those treated earlier are <b>at</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> those with Hodgkin's disease treated with irradiation above 30 Gy and those treated for sarcoma. Among specific forms of injury, patients treated with radiation to the heart area are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> of injury to the valves. Patients treated with large doses of anthracyclines or concomitantly with anthracyclines and alkylating agents are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> of systolic function defect and enlarged heart chambers. Those treated with anthracyclines are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> of diastolic function defect. The time period of the patient's treatment is emerged as an important risk factor for injury of the heart. </p...|$|R
