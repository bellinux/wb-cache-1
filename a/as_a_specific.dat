5|$|After an {{incident}} in 1951, where a US Army inductee attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide but recovered fully after presenting to a hospital and being treated with vitamin K (by then known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> antidote), studies began {{in the use of}} warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant. It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plague of 1665/1666 was {{the last}} major {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the West of England and areas of the Midlands escaped altogether.|$|E

5|$|Early writers {{claimed the}} Mascarene parrot {{was found on}} Madagascar, an idea that led the French naturalist and ornithologist René Primevère Lesson to coin the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831. His new genus name prevailed and, when Tommaso Salvadori {{combined}} it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a tautonym (a scientific name {{in which the two}} parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The binomial name was emended from M. mascarinus to M. mascarin by the IOC World Bird List in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated.|$|E
5|$|Rage Software, {{developers}} of Incoming, were {{known for their}} cutting-edge graphics and effects. Incoming was no exception. The game utilized the 3dfx technology, and was included in some retail versions of the Voodoo2 graphics card. Critics were praising the game's visuals on its 1998 PC release. In particular, the explosions, similar special effects and cut scenes using the main game engine were noted for their quality. The Dolby Surround-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim. The reception, however, was less positive when the game was ported to the Dreamcast. A release title for Sega's console, critics complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range {{at the time of}} its late 1999 release, with the draw distance being cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> hindrance on gameplay. An arcade version followed in 2003, running on the Vortek V3 Global VR arcade board, utilising the system's unique virtual reality hardware interface.|$|E
