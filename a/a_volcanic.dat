5|$|Dr. Adam Pierce, a {{scientist}} at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, intercepts a visual transmission from Firewalker, a mobile robot sent by <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> research project on Mount Avalon near Bend, Oregon. Firewalker is broadcasting from inside <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> cave, where Pierce glimpses the dead body of the chief seismologist, Phil Erickson. He also sees a shadow moving in the cave, an impossibility due to the extremely high temperatures. Firewalker's camera is then destroyed, ending the transmission.|$|E
5|$|Fueguino is <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> {{field in}} Chile. The southernmost volcano in the Andes, it lies on Tierra del Fuego's Cook Island and also extends over nearby Londonderry Island. The field is formed by lava domes, {{pyroclastic}} cones, and a crater lake.|$|E
5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), {{and various}} gases are {{expelled}} from <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E
50|$|Mount Talbert is <b>an</b> <b>{{volcanic}}</b> {{cinder cone}} in Clackamas County, Oregon. It {{is part of}} the Boring Lava Field, a zone of ancient volcanic activity in the area around Portland. Its summit rises to an elevation of 740+ feet (226+ m).|$|R

5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. <b>A</b> <b>volcanic</b> pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E
5|$|Taftan {{is part of}} <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> arc in Iran, {{together}} with Bazman, also in Iran, and Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan. This volcanic arc has formed on Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary layers and has resulted from the subduction of the oceanic Arabian plate beneath Iran at the Makran trench.|$|E
5|$|Built {{on top of}} an {{alluvial}} fan that had been host to historic lahars, the town was previously destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> eruption in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptions produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.|$|E

5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{earthquake}} swarms can be dangerous, {{scientists are}} able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, {{a group of scientists}} investigated the possibility that <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon.|$|E

Volcanic ash deposits from the volcano were identified through an airborne radar survey, buried under later snowfalls in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E
5|$|La Reforma is a Plio-Pleistocene caldera on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. It is part {{of eleven}} volcanoes in Baja California, which formed with the Gulf of California during the Miocene, about ten million years ago. Previously, <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> arc had existed on the peninsula. The caldera's {{basement}} consists of granites and monzonites, formed between the Cretaceous and the Middle Miocene.|$|E

5|$|Pliny the Elder {{wrote about}} the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii. He {{documented}} Roman beliefs about the onion's ability to improve vision ailments, aid in sleep, and heal everything from mouth sores and toothaches, to dog bites, lumbago and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after it was buried in <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> explosion found gardens of Pliny's detailed narratives, where onions had grown.|$|E
5|$|Rugged {{mountains}} {{divided by}} rolling plains characterize the physiographically diverse watershed of the Snake River. The Snake River Plain {{was created by}} <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, where {{the headwaters of the}} Snake River arise. Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out many topographical features, including various canyons and ridges along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events significantly affected the river and its surrounds.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions—during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> vent or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists. These are often named after famous volcanoes where {{that type of}} behavior has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption {{during a period of}} activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.|$|E

5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in <b>a</b> <b>volcanic</b> ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E
