5|$|Thus, in {{the late}} 930s, Hasan, {{encouraged}} by his control over a large and rich domain, entered the intrigues of the Abbasid court, {{and became one of}} the main contenders for the title of amir al-umara. At first, Hasan tried to exploit the weakness of the Abbasid government to withhold his payment of tribute, but the Turk Bajkam, who had ousted Ibn Ra'iq in 938, quickly forced him to back down. Hasan then supported Ibn Ra'iq in the latter's quest to regain his lost position. Bajkam tried to forcefully evict Hasan from his Jaziran domains, but in vain, and was eventually killed in a skirmish with Kurdish brigands in early 941. Hasan's great chance came in early 942, when the Caliph al-Muttaqi (r. 940–944) and his closest aides fled Baghdad to escape the city's imminent fall to the Barids of Basra and sought refuge at Mosul. Hasan now made a direct bid for power: he had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated and succeeded him as amir al-umara, receiving the honorific laqab of Nasir al-Dawla ("Defender of the Dynasty"). He then escorted the Caliph back to Baghdad, which they entered on 4 June 942. To secure his position further, Nasir al-Dawla married his daughter to the Caliph's son. Along with their cousin, Husayn ibn Sa'id, Nasir al-Dawla's brother Ali was instrumental in the Hamdanid enterprise, taking the field against the Baridis, who still controlled the rich province of Basra and were determined to regain Baghdad. After scoring a victory over them, Ali was awarded the laqab of Sayf al-Dawla ("Sword of the Dynasty"), by which he became famous. This double award marked {{the first time that a}} laqab incorporating the prestigious element al-Dawla were granted to anyone other than the wazir, the Caliphate's chief minister, and was a symbolic <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military's predominance over the civil bureaucracy.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue, {{based on a}} {{comparison}} of Spinoza's and Descartes‟s discussion of error, that beliefs are <b>affirmations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> imagination that is not false in itself, only {{in relation to the}} object.

25|$|The {{construction}} of divergent ethnic “Tutsi” and “Hutu” identities was formulated during {{the era of}} European colonization from the late 1880s to the 1950s. German colonialism did little to alter the existing stratified social system. The Germans {{were not interested in}} disrupting social affairs – their sole concern was the efficient extraction of natural resources and trade of profitable cash crops. Colonial bureaucrats relied heavily on native Tutsi chiefs to maintain order over the Hutu lower classes and collect taxes. Thus, the German <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stratified social structure was utilized by the Tutsi aristocracy as justification for minority rule over the lower-class Hutu masses. Germany’s defeat in World War I allowed Belgian forces to conquer Rwanda. Belgian involvement in the region was far more intrusive than German administration. In an era of Social Darwinism, European anthropologists claimed to identify a distinct “Hamitic race” that was superior to native “Negroid” populations. Influenced by racialized attitudes, Belgian social scientists declared that the Tutsis, who wielded political control in Rwanda, must be descendants of the Hamites, who shared a purported closer blood line to Europeans. The Belgians concluded that the Tutsis and Hutus composed two fundamentally different ethno-racial groups. Thus, the Belgians viewed the Tutsis as more civilized, superior, but most importantly, more European than the Hutus. This perspective justified placing societal control {{in the hands of the}} Tutsis at the expense of the Hutus. Moreover, this Belgian <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hamitic theory provided a conceptual foundation for Tutsis and Hutus to start identifying themselves as different ethnic groups. The Belgians established a comprehensive race theory that was to dictate Rwandan society until independence: Tutsi racial superiority and Hutu oppression. The institutionalization of Tutsi and Hutu ethnic divergence was accomplished through administrative, political economic, and educational means.|$|E

40|$|Were <b>the</b> years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fundamentalist/Modernist Controversy (1890 - 1936) in the Presbyterian Church in <b>the</b> USA years <b>of</b> doctrinal development? This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} {{the answer to this question}} is both "yes" and ''no. " This dissertation, in exploring this particular era of modem American church history, takes its structure from well-known Catholic theologian, John Courtney Murray, and his contribution to <b>the</b> discussion <b>of</b> doctrinal development as it applied to <b>the</b> years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arian Controversy culminating in <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> Nicaea. Murray identified three factions in that struggle: the Futurists, the Archaists, and the Centrists. The Futurists, represented by Arius and his followers, sought to identify Christianity with <b>the</b> prevailing philosophies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, thereby reinterpreting and altering certain <b>affirmations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faith. The Archaists, as seen in <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> Eusebius of Caesarea, reacted strongly to the Arians' proposals by not admitting any doctrinal formulation not couched in <b>the</b> 'sacred words' <b>of</b> Scripture. <b>The</b> Centrists, representing more balanced judgment, as seen in St. Athanasius, prevailed in the end. He saw that doctrinal development, which is herein defined to mean further definition, clarification, and application of existing truths, does indeed take place but not at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> denying <b>the</b> historic <b>affirmations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faith. After investigating development, tradition (<b>the</b> results <b>of</b> doctrinal development over time) and historicism (the theory that doctrine develops out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical process itself), Murray's structure is then applied to the struggles in the Presbyterian Church in the early twentieth century. Beginning with Charles Briggs of Union Seminary in New York and his avocation of historical criticism as applied to the Scriptures, the Presbyterian Church in the USA was thrown progressively into turmoil regarding just what constituted <b>the</b> historic <b>affirmations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faith. Briggs and those who followed, the Liberals or Futurists, wanted to jettison or remold a sizeable portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historic Westminster Confession <b>of</b> Faith, <b>the</b> doctrinal heritage <b>of</b> Presbyterianism. Further events, such as <b>the</b> confessional revision <b>of</b> 1903 and <b>the</b> Cumberland reunion <b>of</b> 1906, helped to propel the entire church in a Futurist direction. Opposition from the beginning came primarily from Princeton Seminary. Princeton's professors sought to maintain the historic, confessional stance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. In this endeavor they were at times Archaists, Centrists, and even Futurists. <b>The</b> efforts <b>of</b> those who would preserve the traditional, confessional stance of Presbyterianism, however, were doomed to failure as the church moved steadily in a Futurist direction. After some brief insights into the more prominent Futurist personalities and <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> Fundamentalist opposition, <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dissertation is taken up with <b>the</b> exploits <b>of</b> J. Gresham Machen and his expulsion from an increasingly Futurist church. Machen was viewed as a trouble maker for opposing this trend. Those of more moderate sentiments often sided with the Liberals/Futurists over against Machen. After much anguish and a lengthy trial, Machen was deposed from <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> minister in <b>the</b> Presbyterian Church in the USA. He immediately proceeded to found a new Presbyterian denomination. Into this new church came both Archaist and Centrist alike, who had previously formed an uneasy alliance in opposition to the Futurism in the mother church. The coalition, however, did not last, and after a short time fragmented into smaller constituencies. Although things did not change all at once in the Presbyterian Church in the USA, Liberalism/Futurism became the norm and remains so until this day. This dissertation argues that <b>the</b> confessional revision <b>of</b> 1903 and <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> J. Gresham Machen can be classified as doctrinal development and, thus, Centrist endeavors. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other events <b>of</b> significance that characterize the Fundamentalist/Modernist Controversy were either Archaist in character or Futurist endeavors more concerned with changing <b>the</b> historic <b>affirmations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faith than developing them.
