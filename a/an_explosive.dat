5|$|On February 3, 1969, Eduardo Mondlane {{was killed}} by {{explosives}} smuggled into his locale. Many sources state that, {{in an attempt to}} rectify the situation in Mozambique, the Portuguese secret police assassinated Mondlane by sending a parcel to his office in Dar es Salaam. Inside the parcel was a book containing <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> device, which detonated upon opening. Other sources state that Eduardo was killed when <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> device detonated underneath his chair at the FRELIMO headquarters, and that the faction responsible was never identified.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{is invited}} to the White House for lunch with the President. However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane {{carrying}} Bond there. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> decompression. Goldfinger is blown out of the cabin through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore and they parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Bond is recaptured {{after hearing}} {{the details of the}} operation, but he {{subsequently}} seduces Pussy Galore, Goldfinger's private pilot and convinces her to inform the American authorities. Goldfinger's private army break into Fort Knox and access the vault, where Bond fights and kills Oddjob, while American troops battle with Goldfinger's army outside. Bond's plane is hijacked by Goldfinger, but Bond struggles with him, and shoots out a window, creating <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> decompression, killing Goldfinger.|$|E

5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} would at least be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. The plan was to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> to the ship’s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War three Asian Americans {{received}} the Medal of Honor, {{all of them}} posthumously. Elmelindo Smith, although wounded multiple times was killed while fighting with his unit. Terry Kawamura sacrificed his life by jumping on <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> charge, saving the lives of two other soldiers, and Rodney Yano sacrificed his life by throwing burning ammunition off of a helicopter after a grenade exploded prematurely.|$|E

5000|$|The UKRA has {{negotiated}} {{an exemption}} so that model rocket fliers can obtain some AP motors in limited quantities {{without the need}} for <b>an</b> <b>explosives</b> licence. Since 4 December 2007, model rocketeers have been able to purchase AP motors with a net weight less than 1 kg of propellant without <b>an</b> <b>Explosives</b> Licence. They can also store motors up to a total net weight of 5 kg without needing <b>an</b> <b>Explosives</b> Licence or Registered Store Certificate. They will still require an RCA document. This can be obtained from the UK HSE by writing an appropriate letter to them requesting an exemption for model rocket motors. This document is currently issued free of charge, although this may change.|$|R
5|$|However it was {{not until}} the Wujing Zongyao that the exact {{chemical}} formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed. The Wujing Zongyao contains three formulas for gunpowder: one for <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> bomb launched from a trebuchet, another for a similar bomb with hooks attached so that it could latch on to any wooden structure and set it on fire, and another formula specified for a poison-smoke bomb used for chemical warfare.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, {{planning}} for the test was assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a {{professor of physics at}} Harvard, working under Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge selected the bombing range near Alamogordo Army Airfield as the site for the test. Bainbridge worked with Captain Samuel P. Davalos on the construction of the Trinity Base Camp and its facilities, which included barracks, warehouses, workshops, <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> magazine and a commissary.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive {{compression of}} plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. Hypothetically, as little as 4kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could {{be used to make}} a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.|$|E

5|$|The ironclad age saw the {{development}} of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons, which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets. The first torpedoes were static mines, used extensively in the American Civil War. That conflict also saw {{the development}} of the spar torpedo, <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat. For the first time, a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one—and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads, the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously. The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864–5, but these vessels never saw action. Another proposal, the towed or 'Harvey' torpedo, involved <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> on a line or outrigger; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotating}} low continued {{along its}} northward path into the evening, bringing its counterclockwise winds in phase with the northwesterly winds already hitting Lakes Superior and Huron. This resulted in <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> increase in northerly wind speeds and swirling snow. Ships on Lake Huron that were south of Alpena, Michigan—especially around Harbor Beach and Port Huron in Michigan and Goderich and Sarnia in Ontario—were battered with massive waves moving southward toward St. Clair River.|$|E
5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which uses <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E

5|$|After {{tracking}} the Brittles to the Tennessee plantation {{of the wealthy}} Spencer Bennett and killing them, the liberated Django partners with Dr. Schultz and becomes his apprentice. Later that evening, the duo are hunted by Spencer Bennett and a large gang of white supremacists (a reference to the early Ku Klux Klan), but Dr. Schultz deceives and kills most of Bennett's gang with <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> and Django kills Bennett. Dr. Schultz explains that he feels responsible for Django since Django is the first person he has ever freed, and feels morally obliged to help Django reunite with Broomhilda. Now fully trained, Django collects his first bounty, keeping the flyer for good luck.|$|E
5|$|As the 1970s progressed, {{silencing}} {{technology in}} submarines rendered acoustic-band sonobuoys and trigger devices ineffective. During 1961 and 1962, the Soviet Union conducted {{research and development}} into <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> sound system (ESS) – used to locate deep-diving submarines – under the name Udar (Blow). In 1965, work had started on sonobuoy systems using ESS to be integrated with the Berkut radar. The programme was postponed {{when one of the}} aircraft intended to carry it, the Ilyushin Il-38, was found to be incompatible. The developments instead resulted in the Udar-75, which was featured in a new search and targeting system (STS) of the Taganrog-built Tu-142Ms.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding <b>an</b> <b>explosive</b> charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
