5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

Should the DG not have such a factual basis, {{he would not be able}} to request for the duty to be paid, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> he would have acted upon an incorrect basis of fact.|$|E
25|$|In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from Friuli, Italy, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines, by some 197 years. However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{there is no reason}} to think that he celebrated mass.|$|E

2500|$|This {{record of}} Hodge's {{literary}} life is suggestive {{of the great}} influence that he exerted. But properly to estimate that influence, {{it must be remembered}} that 3,000 ministers of the Gospel passed under his instruction, and that to him was accorded the rare privilege, {{during the course of a}} long life, of achieving distinction as a teacher, exegete, preacher, controversialist, ecclesiastic, and systematic theologian. As a teacher he had few equals; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not display popular gifts in the pulpit, he revealed homiletic powers of a high order in the [...] "conferences" [...] on Sabbath afternoons, where he spoke with his accustomed clearness and logical precision, but with great spontaneity and amazing tenderness and unction.|$|E
2500|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{first-class}} cricket for Derbyshire against Surrey when he sensationally dismissed Andy Sandham {{with his first}} ball. However, his record {{for the rest of}} the season was moderate. In 1933, Copson became a regular member of the Derbyshire side, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not, in spite of his short run-up, possess the build to undertake as much work as fast bowlers were expected to then, he was consistently good in a summer unfavourable to bowlers. In the following two summers, Copson was so plagued by injury that there were serious worries about his long-term health. [...] When he did play he developed so well that he headed Derbyshire's averages in 1935, for a team that recorded more victories than any other Derbyshire side before or since.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Penske's {{slate of}} drivers {{included}} Rick Mears, Danny Sullivan, and Danny Ongais. Al Unser Sr. was {{dropped from the}} team, and entered the month of May without a ride. During {{the first week of}} practice, Al Sr. spent much of the week shopping for a ride, and a few offers were made by owners. Al Sr., however, refused the offers, as he insisted on landing a ride in a competitive, well-funded car only. Unser planned on staying through the week, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have a ride {{by the end of the}} first week of time trials, he was planning to return home. Coincidentally, his son Al Unser Jr. (driving for Shierson Racing) was having difficulty with his car's handling. At the end of the first weekend of time trials, Al Jr. surprisingly had not yet qualified. Al Sr. agreed to stay through the week in order to help his son get his car up to speed.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2005, {{representatives of}} Juventus met with Arsenal {{with a view}} to signing Vieira. The player, {{according}} to The Guardian, accepted that Arsenal were [...] "ready to let him go" [...] before agreeing in principle to join Juventus. On 15 August 2005, Vieira signed a five-year contract, in a deal worth £13.75 million. In a later interview with the Daily Mail, Wenger explained the departure of Vieira was to serve Cesc Fàbregas' career: [...] "When Cesc Fàbregas was 18, 19, I would play him in a 4–4–2 with Patrick Vieira and I saw it did not work. Then I had the decision to make about letting Patrick go, because Gilberto Silva and Vieira worked, Fàbregas and Silva worked, but I could not play Fàbregas and Vieira. But Fàbregas was 19 <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not play I knew he would want to go, so we risked destroying everything, all the work we had put into this player." ...|$|E
2500|$|From this Letter {{we learn}} that Henry VIII sent Cromwell money while in the Tower and {{it appears to have}} given him more than a hope of life. Moreover, Thomas Cromwell was granted the {{extraordinary}} 'privilege' of being told of the charges against him and who his accusers were. When Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk was himself arrested in 1546, he [...] "prayed the lords to intercede with the king, that his accusers might be brought face to face, to say what they had against him and he did not doubt but it should appear he was falsely accused. He desired to have no more favour than Cromwell had, he himself being present when Cromwell was examined." [...] He added that Cromwell [...] "desired, if he might not see his accusers, that he might at least know what the matters were <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not answer truly to every point, he desired not to live an hour longer. He had always been pursued by great enemies about the king so that his fidelity was tried like gold." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, the total US ground forces in Vietnam were {{increased}} to 82,000 or by 150 percent. That same month, Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective, and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse. Gen. Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82,000 to 175,000. After consulting with his principals, Johnson, desirous of a low profile, chose to announce {{at a press conference}} an increase to 125,000 troops, with additional forces to be sent later upon request. Johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices—between sending Americans to die in Vietnam and giving in to the communists. If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not he thought he risked being impeached. He continued to insist that his decision [...] "did not imply any change in policy whatsoever". Of his desire to veil the decision, Johnson jested privately, [...] "If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye, and she has it in the center of her forehead, you don't keep her in the living room". By October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam.|$|E

Therefore it is said: [...] "To see if his soul would offer itself in restitution" [...] (Isaiah 53:10). Even as the trespass-offering must be brought by consent, so also the sufferings must be endured with consent. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> accept them, what is his reward?

2500|$|On 5 October 1375 Pope Gregory XI granted faculties to Cardinals Pierre de Salue de Monteruc and Jean de Cros {{to proceed}} with the {{organization}} and founding of the Collège de Périgord at Toulouse, for which Cardinal Talleyrand had provided in his Testament. [...] As Pope Gregory ordered, based on Talleyrand's wishes, there were to be twenty students who were to be poor clerics; they were to be provided with four chaplains, and were to be served by seven domestics. Ten of the clerics were to study Civil Law, and ten were to study Canon Law. Ten of the students were to be chosen from the diocese of Périgueux, the other ten from elsewhere. [...] They were chosen by the Count of Périgueux, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not fill a vacancy within three months, the choice was to be made by the Chancellor of the University of Toulouse. [...] Every candidate was subject to approval by the Chancellor and by a majority of the current students. The students could stay in the college from twelve to fifteen years, according to the statutes of the University of Toulouse for a doctorate in Law. [...] The chaplains were chosen by the students. More than 34,000 livres tournois were invested on behalf of the College by the Cardinal's executors.|$|E
