5|$|After {{collecting}} {{all four}} <b>artefacts,</b> Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers that Dr. Willard {{had been using}} the knowledge gained from the meteorite to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the <b>artefacts</b> and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the <b>artefacts,</b> and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating the treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four <b>artefacts</b> to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteorite by recovering the <b>artefacts,</b> kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a {{discourse}} on the conceptualisation of the IT <b>artefact.</b> It is commentary paper based on the prior papers of Goldkuhl (2013), Silver & Markus (2013) and Purao et al (2013). It especially addresses the issues of how demarcate the IT <b>artefact</b> and how to concep-tualise it in relation to the social and the technical. As a part of this conceptual inquiry, the paper investigates the notion of the <b>artefact.</b> An <b>artefact</b> has always functions and it has always a context where the use of the <b>artefact</b> and its functions is intended to contribute to some goals. As soon as we speak of an <b>artefact,</b> some use context is implied. Based on these premis-es, the paper articulates a view on the IT <b>artefact</b> to be a social <b>artefact.</b> Social does not mean that there are any humans as part of the artefact; humans appear as the users in the implied context of the <b>artefact.</b> Social means that the IT <b>artefact</b> is a semiotic <b>artefact</b> intended for communication between people. The IT <b>artefact</b> is sociotechnical <b>artefact,</b> which means that it is a combined technical and semiotic <b>artefact</b> and the use of it (by a user) implies combined technical and communicative actions. As a consequence of this view the paper also argues for co-design of IT <b>artefact</b> and work context. This is done in opposition to a techno-centric de-sign of the IT <b>artefact,</b> which will imply a restricted design of context purely through <b>artefact</b> design...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to chart {{different}} paths that users can follow to reduce the environmental impact that occurs during the use of an <b>artefact.</b> Through comparing sustainable behaviours found in own studies and literature, five pathways of sustainable behaviour were identified: Changed use, Mediated use, Regulated <b>artefact,</b> Maintenance and repair, and Choice of <b>artefact.</b> In Path 1 the user starts using an <b>artefact</b> in a more sustainable way. In Path 2 the user invests in a secondary <b>artefact</b> to mediate the use of a primary <b>artefact.</b> In Path 3 the users invest in an <b>artefact</b> that regulate a primary artefacts’ resource use. In Path 4 the user maintains an <b>artefact</b> in good condition and in Path 5 the user invests in an <b>artefact</b> that offers less resource consumption by default...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{involved the}} development of a range of Colour Doppler Twinkle <b>Artefact</b> phantoms to characterise and quantify the “Twinkle” <b>artefact</b> which is often present when an irregular structure is encountered in the imaged field of view. The <b>artefact</b> occurs in both colour and power Doppler ultrasound imaging and manifests as a false depiction of colour velocity information in stationary soft tissue and therefore can cause significant misdiagnosis of areas of flow within the patient. It has been hypothesised that it is generated due to a strongly reflecting medium composed of individual reflectors and therefore becomes a clinical concern when parenchymal calcifications are encountered. (Tsao et al., 2006). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the occurrence and magnitude of this <b>artefact</b> across a range of ultrasound scanners and to monitor the effects on the <b>artefact</b> of varying image acquisition parameters. A range of phantoms were produced that could reproducibly recreate the Twinkle <b>artefact,</b> the presence of which was quantified in a range of scanners (Zonare, Siemens Antares, Philips HDI and IU 22). These phantoms included both fine and coarse structures as well as a flow channel in one of the phantoms, through which blood mimicking fluid was pumped. A semi-quantitative grading system was implemented and instrument controls such as pulse repetition frequency (PRF), colour write priority, greyscale gain and depth of focal zone were varied in order to determine their impact on the Twinkle <b>artefact.</b> Instrument control settings were found to significantly affect the intensity of this <b>artefact,</b> predominantly PRF showed a significant increase in the presence of this <b>artefact.</b> Furthermore, the extent of the <b>artefact</b> varied greatly across the range of scanners with Siemens Antaries and Zonare being most sensitive to the <b>artefact.</b> The implication of this study has shown the Twinkle <b>artefact</b> to be dependent on scanner specifications and instrumental parameters. With careful image optimisation, a reduction or elimination of the <b>artefact</b> can be achieved...|$|R
5|$|On 24 March 2009, it was {{revealed}} that the fate of 5,900 <b>artefacts</b> retrieved from the wreck would rest with a U.S. District Judge's decision. The ruling was later issued in two decisions on 12 August 2010 and 15 August 2011. As announced in 2009, the judge ruled that RMS Titanic Inc. owned the <b>artefacts</b> and her decision dealt with the status of the wreck as well as establishing a monitoring system to check future activity upon the wreck site. On 12August 2010, Judge Rebecca Beach Smith granted RMSTitanic, Inc. fair market value for the <b>artefacts</b> but deferred ruling on their ownership and the conditions for their preservation, possible disposition and exhibition until a further decision could be reached. On 15 August 2011, Judge Smith granted title to thousands of <b>artefacts</b> from the Titanic, that RMS Titanic Inc. did not already own under a French court decision concerning the first group of salvaged <b>artefacts,</b> to RMS Titanic Inc. subject to a detailed list of conditions concerning preservation and disposition of the items. The <b>artefacts</b> can be sold only to a company that would abide by the lengthy list of conditions and restrictions. RMS Titanic Inc. can profit from the <b>artefacts</b> through exhibiting them.|$|E

5|$|Twenty Palaeolithic {{sites have}} been {{identified}} in the Mendips, of which eleven represent faunal remains and lithic <b>artefacts</b> recovered from caves. The remaining eight sites refer to surface lithic discoveries, and the <b>artefacts</b> found include points, scrapers, and handaxes. Twenty-seven Mesolithic finds are represented by flint and chert lithics. Large numbers of <b>artefacts</b> have been found near Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features, such as the barrows and forts around Priddy and at Dolebury Warren. The caves of Cheddar Gorge have yielded many archaeological remains, as flood waters have washed <b>artefacts</b> and bones into the caves and preserved them in silt. The Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, was found in Gough's Cave, part of the Cheddar Complex.|$|E
5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline <b>artefacts,</b> one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the <b>artefacts.</b> The four <b>artefacts</b> were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the <b>artefacts</b> by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E

30|$|Colour Doppler {{twinkling}} <b>artefact</b> [15, 26, 27]. This <b>artefact</b> is {{a mixture}} of red and blue pixels on colour Doppler secondary to the “noise” produced from rough interfaces composed of sparse reflectors such as urinary stones. It is very useful to confirm findings of grey-scale, especially in doubtful cases due to small size of the stone [22] or located in difficult-to-visualise ureteral portions [27]. In the study by Moore et al. [15], the sensitivity of US improved from 47.6 to 86  % when the twinkling sign was used. In the recent study by Ripolles et al., [27] which analysed the specific value of the twinkling <b>artefact,</b> the sensitivity of US using the twinkling <b>artefact</b> for detecting lithiasis was 90  % and the specificity 100  %. A total of 78  % of the lithiases showed the twinkling <b>artefact,</b> including three stones not identified by B-mode US, and in 68  % of these stones, the <b>artefact</b> was detected before the stone itself with B-mode.|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} of gears is {{a serious}} problem for machines. The characteristics of the vibration of gears are affected by tooth flank form deviation of submicrometre order. The quality of product gears is controlled by a gear-measuring instrument, which is calibrated by an involute <b>artefact</b> with high precision. A highly precise method for measuring the involute <b>artefact</b> by rolling has been proposed. However, this method does not yield sufficient accuracy. In this research, a novel rolling method for the involute <b>artefact,</b> a 'nonslip driving method', is proposed to achieve high accuracy. This method is compared with the conventional driving method by theoretical analysis of <b>artefact</b> motion. Moreover, its accuracy and effect are evaluated experimentally. The results show that this method is more stable on the basis of measurement results than the conventional driving method. Therefore, it is confirmed that the highly precise measurement of the involute <b>artefact</b> can be realized by incorporating the nonslip driving method into the rolling <b>artefact</b> method. In addition, measurement results for the involute <b>artefact</b> are compared among the proposed method and the methods involving the use of a coordinate measuring machine and a gear-measuring instrument...|$|R

40|$|MSc (Computer Science), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 Structured data {{stores have}} been the {{dominating}} technologies {{for the past few}} decades. Although dominating, structured data stores lack the functionality to handle the ‘Big Data’ phenomenon. A new technology has recently emerged which stores unstructured data and can handle the ‘Big Data’ phenomenon. This study describes the development of an <b>artefact</b> to aid in the analysis of NoSQL document data stores in terms of relational database model constructs. Design science research (DSR) is the methodology implemented in the study and it is used to assist in the understanding, design and development of the problem, <b>artefact</b> and solution. This study explores the existing literature on DSR, in addition to structured and unstructured data stores. The literature review formulates the descriptive and prescriptive knowledge used {{in the development of the}} <b>artefact.</b> The <b>artefact</b> is developed using a series of six activities derived from two DSR approaches. The problem domain is derived from the existing literature and a real application environment (RAE). The reviewed literature provided a general problem statement. A representative from NFM (the RAE) is interviewed for a situation analysis providing a specific problem statement. An objective is formulated for the development of the <b>artefact</b> and suggestions are made to address the problem domain, assisting the <b>artefact’s</b> objective. The <b>artefact</b> is designed and developed using the descriptive knowledge of structured and unstructured data stores, combined with prescriptive knowledge of algorithms, pseudo code, continuous design and object-oriented design. The <b>artefact</b> evolves through multiple design cycles into a final product that analyses document data stores in terms of relational database model constructs. The <b>artefact</b> is evaluated for acceptability and utility. This provides credibility and rigour to the research in the DSR paradigm. Acceptability is demonstrated through simulation and the utility is evaluated using a real application environment (RAE). A representative from NFM is interviewed for the evaluation of the <b>artefact.</b> Finally, the study is communicated by describing its findings, summarising the <b>artefact</b> and looking into future possibilities for research and application.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{position}} paper is to raise issues concerning aesthetic experience in relation to an ongoing work of designing an <b>artefact</b> encouraging video reporting of personal experiences. The work serves {{as an example of}} a design experiment where aesthetic qualities are emphasized, but where the resulting interactions have not yet been analyzed in relation to these qualities. Our position is that the aesthetics of an interactive <b>artefact</b> evolves in the interactive zone between people who use it and the <b>artefact</b> itself. The aesthetic qualities are, thus, crystallized in the use of the <b>artefact</b> – whether it ranks high on a usability scale or not. Just as usability qualities, the aesthetic qualities contain contextual factors of its users, such as their pre-comprehension of the <b>artefact,</b> their cultural background and their emotional states. Furthermore, they include the context of the <b>artefact,</b> such as its physical design and the environment of its use. Our standpoint is consistent with Shusterman’s pragmatist approach to aesthetics, as related by Petersen et al. [2]. This approach promotes aesthetics of use rather than aesthetics of appearance. The experience of aesthetics lies in the interaction with the <b>artefact</b> rather than merely in the visual perception of it. LIF...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of the vibration and noise of gears {{is an important issue}} in mechanical devices such as vehicles and wind turbines. The characteristics of the vibration and noise of gears are markedly affected by deviations of the tooth flank form of micrometre order; therefore, a strict quality control of the tooth flank form is required. The accuracy of the lead measurement for a gear-measuring instrument is usually evaluated using a master gear or a lead master. However, it is difficult to manufacture masters with high accuracy because the helix is a complicated geometrical form. In this paper, we propose a method of evaluating a gear-measuring instrument using a wedge <b>artefact,</b> which includes a highly precise plane surface. The concept of the wedge <b>artefact</b> is described and a mathematical model of the measuring condition of the wedge <b>artefact</b> is constructed. Theoretical measurement results for the wedge <b>artefact</b> are calculated. The wedge <b>artefact</b> is designed and produced {{on the basis of the}} theoretical measurement results. A measurement experiment using the wedge <b>artefact</b> is carried out and its effectiveness is verified...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets the}} basis for a {{research}} project focused on collaborative social network’s genesis and dynamics. It introduces a research framework for the empirical investigation of a network focused on the design of a shared <b>artefact,</b> the so-called "Web services Architecture". Our hypothesis is that network <b>artefact’s</b> characteristics, seen as the final outcome of a collaborative process, influence and drive the genesis and the structure of the social network that is designing it. We embraced this view in order to avoid a limitation of the traditional perspectives that consider the network structure as exogenous and stable. We consider the reciprocal influence between the <b>artefact</b> and the social network structure, with a phase in which the desired <b>artefact</b> may shape the network genesis and a phase in which the emergent network’s structure may drive the <b>artefact</b> design...|$|R
