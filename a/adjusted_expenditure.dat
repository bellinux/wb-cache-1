Poverty causes millions of people to fulfill the needs of food, clothing and shelter are limited. The poverty rate in Central Java is the highest compared to other provinces in Java Island. The purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of economic growth rate, life expectancy at birth, literacy rates, long school average, <b>adjusted</b> <b>expenditure</b> per capita and total population to the poverty rate in Central Java. Analytical model is use panel data with the Fixed Effect Model (FEM) or the Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) model approach, using time series data for five years (2005 - 2009) and cross section data for 35 districts / cities in Central Java. LSDV models are expected to obtain a more efficient estimation. This is because the high number of observations that have implications on the data more informative, more varied, and increased degrees of freedom (df).

The standard of living has been approximated by a private consumption measure, comparisons in real terms have been made possible by household specific statistical consumer price indices, and the heterogeneity of the household population has been taken into account by means of several parametrisations of the weight to be given to household size, or to children needs relative to those of adults. Social or aggregate evaluations have been performed by scalar indicators which permit to summarise judgements about an entire distribution by means of two statistics: the mean and an index of either relative or absolute inequality. Standard restrictions, as well as the requirement of additive separability, lead to a member of the General Entropy family of social evaluation functions in the relative case, and to several members of the Kolm-Pollack family in the absolute case.

This article evaluates {{the validity of}} the principal methods that have been used in the estimations of the potential savings. Three estimation approaches were identified. The first approach uses <b>adjusted</b> <b>expenditures</b> to calculate avoidable costs, but <b>adjusted</b> <b>expenditures</b> can be independent of avoidable costs, and measurement errors are not controlled. The second approach uses an outcome variable to replace its causal factors, and is not acceptable because the association between the outcomes and the causes is untestable. The final approach uses surveys to directly measure physician beliefs and patient preferences, but the sole study using this approach is weakened by sample selection biases and incomplete controls. A development of reliable measures and a switch of observation from clinic settings to geographic contexts could make the estimations more convincing...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of using routine Hospital Episode Statistics, census data, and vital statistics to derive weights for an equitable capitation formula for setting general practitioner fundholding budgets for buying acute hospital services. DESIGN [...] Analysis of a routine dataset of 9 million hospital episodes in 1991 - 2, extracting elective general practitioner fundholding procedures, combined with 1991 census variables, vital statistics, and data on supply of health care at ward level. Costs were attached to each procedure according to the average cost of the relevant "Mersey" band category. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Variation in age and sex <b>adjusted</b> <b>expenditure</b> per head on fundholding procedures across wards modelled for the impact of health and social needs variables after adjusting for variations in supply. RESULTS [...] No sensible simple model including determinants of use other than age and sex could be derived. The most parsimonious but statistically acceptable model showed that though standardised mortality ratio and self reported illness and several social class variables were associated with utilisation, the signs {{and the size of the}} coefficients were contradictory. The most important explanation of variation was provided by age and sex differences between wards. CONCLUSIONS [...] An equitable system of setting general practitioner fundholders' budgets is needed. In the short term age and sex weighted capitation should form the principal basis of fundholder budgets. Utilisation data at ward level are inadequate for developing a formula which adequately adjusts for the differences in the health care needs of populations. A capitation formula based on information derived from individual cohort data may be the only means of promoting equity and efficiency and of avoiding discriminating against patients with known high cost health problems...|$|E

This is done by running {{different}} static analyses, time series analysis and an analysis on the effects of cutting production based on elasticity of supply. We find that Saudi Arabia run out of money if they continue without financial and strategic adjustments. However, our findings show that other analysts overestimate when Saudi Arabia run out of money, since they do not account for return on their foreign reserves. Furthermore, we find that Saudi Arabia will decrease the possibility of running out of money as long as they introduce a stricter budget policy. Lastly, we find that Saudi Arabia has something to gain from reducing their production. However, exclusively focusing on production cuts will not solve the initial problem with running out of money. Therefore, we find that Saudi Arabia will have their primary focus on <b>adjusting</b> <b>expenditures,</b> and production cuts will only be used as a secondary measure. We conclude that Saudi Arabia will not run out of money as they will <b>adjust</b> their <b>expenditures</b> and tighten their budget policies. We also believe that Saudi Arabia will try to delay the usage of production cuts as long as possible. Our findings indicate that the oversupply of oil will continue and that we will observe a persisting low oil price. nhhma...|$|R

However, {{there was no difference in}} aggressive behavior when females guarded large (10 -egg) or small (4 -egg) clutches.

40|$|Comparing {{absolute}} {{levels of}} unit labor costs across countries entails translating labor compensation rates and productivity measured in national currencies into a common currency (e. g., U.

50|$|A {{significant}} portion of this tax differential is due to spending {{differences between the two}} countries. While the US is running deficits of about 4% of GDP, Canada's Federal government posted a budget surplus of around 1% of GDP per year from the mid-1990s until 2008, and under Stephen Harper's Conservative Party reached surplus again in 2015. During the 2015 election now incumbent Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party of Canada pledged to run $40,000,000,000 in deficits {{over the next four years}} of his leadership, although after three months in office he has predicted his government will exceed this amount and won't reach surplus by 2019. The deficit patterns and indebtedness of Canada's individual provinces vary as they do in the US among different states. Considered in a revenue-neutral context, the differential is much smaller - Canada's total governmental spending was about 36% of GDP vs. 31% in the US. In addition, caution must be used when comparing taxes across countries, due to the different services each offers. Whereas the Canadian healthcare system is 70% government-funded, the US system is just under 50% government-funded (mostly via Medicare and Medicaid); adding the additional healthcare-spending burden to the above figures to obtain comparable numbers (+3% for Canada, +7% for the US) gives <b>adjusted</b> <b>expenditures</b> of 38-39% of GDP for each of the two nations.|$|R

40|$|The authors discuss {{when and}} how to <b>adjust</b> <b>expenditures</b> derived from {{household}} surveys to reflect the consumption of basic services. They discuss simple adjustment methods for markets that are subsidized, rationed, or subject to increasing marginal tariff pricing. Using Ecuador as an example, they show how incorporating adjustments in markets for water, electricity, and cooking gas can significantly alter estimates of poverty and are therefore important to comprehensive measure of welfare. For Ecuador, adjustments must be made for water, for example, because the nonpoor urban population often has access to subsidized public water and the poor depend on the private market; adjustments must be made for electricity because increasing marginal tariff rates lead to different prices per kilowatt-hour (kwh). Adjustments need not be made for cooking gas, which is highly subsidized in Ecuador, because the amount consumers use is not rationed. The authors compare the sensitivity of poverty indicators and the poverty profile in Ecuador to adjustments in nominal expenditures for basic services in Ecuador. The poverty indicators (headcount and the poverty gap for extreme poverty) showed changes that were statistically significant. The results dramatize {{how important it is to}} carefully analyze markets for basic services when deriving welfare measures from household surveys. Such adjustments, by improving the measure of welfare, can also encourage wider acceptance and use of consumption as welfare indicator and a guide for developing public policy.

40|$|Excerpt] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) {{is celebrating}} {{the first anniversary}} of {{experimental}} disease-based price indexes, which <b>adjust</b> <b>expenditures</b> on disease for inflation. Statistical agencies have long collected price information on medical procedures, drugs, equipment, and services, but the cost of treating a patient is typically some combination of these goods and services. Many users of the Federal Statistical System have asked that medical care spending be reported on a disease basis. Creating price indexes on a disease basis helps provide greater understanding of the cost of care for a given condition. The indexes are the result of a long-term research effort by staff in the BLS Office of Prices and Living Conditions. Using existing data products, we met the need for a new product, without incurring more data collection expenses. We construct the experimental indexes using two publicly available datasets: 1) the monthly producer price index (PPI) and consumer price index (CPI) published by BLS and 2) the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. The monthly BLS data allow our experimental disease-based price indexes to be timely. MEPS supplies data on the use of medical service and products for the treatment of each disease. After a year of constructing the experimental disease-based index we reveal the wealth of information that the data show.

This study described total direct and out-of-pocket expenditures for adults with non-dialysis dependent CKD and compared expenditures with those for cancer or stroke. Methods This study used data from the 20112 ÃÜ 0132013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a national survey of healthcare expenditures in the U. S. population. Expenditures were determined for adults with the following chronic diseases: CKD defined by 585 ICD 9 codes (n 2 ÃÜ 009 = 2 ÃÜ 00952), cancer (colon, breast or bronchus/lung) (n 2 ÃÜ 009 = 2 ÃÜ 009870), or stroke (n 2 ÃÜ 009 = 2 ÃÜ 0091104). These represent adults who were aware of their conditions or visited a healthcare provider for the condition during the study period. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the marginal effects of CKD, cancer or stroke on <b>adjusted</b> <b>expenditures</b> compared to adults without CKD, cancer or stroke (n 2 ÃÜ 009 = 2 ÃÜ 00972, 241) while controlling for demographics and co-morbidities and incorporating the sample weights of the complex survey design. Results The mean age for group with CKD, cancer or stroke was 65. 5, 66. 1, and 68. 20 years, respectively, while mean age for group without CKD, cancer or stroke was 47. 80 years. Median values of total direct and out of pocket healthcare expenditures ranged from as high as 12, 877 (Interquartile Range [IQR] 5031 - 19, 710) and 1439 (6882 ÃÜ 0132732), respectively, with CKD, to as low as 1189 (IQR 196 - 4388) and 226 (IQR 20 - 764) in the group without CKD, cancer or stroke. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, the adjusted difference in total direct healthcare expenditures was 4746 (95...|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceutical productivity, as {{measured}} by annual output of new molecular entities and new therapeutic biologics, has fallen significantly since reaching a peak in 1996. According to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data, {{the number of new}} drug approvals (new molecular entities and new biologics) fell from 50 in 1996 to 29 in 2003 (FDA-BEP database 2004). Meanwhile, non-inflation <b>adjusted</b> <b>expenditures</b> for research and development have almost doubled (PhRMA 2004). This thesis uses time series analysis to characterize historical trends in new drug introductions. Linear modeling and ARIMA modeling are employed to show that the large increase in new drug approvals in 1996 is inconsistent with previous trends. The hypothesis that the 1996 increase in new drug approvals is the consequence of additional FDA processing capacity pursuant to the implementation of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) is considered and rejected, based on an analysis of the underlying causes of the increase. Next, approval trends before and after the implementation of PDUFA are compared. Notably, the percentage of new drug applications resulting in approval has increased since the implementation of PDUFA while the number of applications reviewed per year has not changed significantly. The relationship between the success ratio and drug withdrawal rates is examined, with inconclusive results. (cont.) Finally, seasonal trends in new drug application (NDA) submissions and approvals are described for years preceding and following PDUFA. A significant plurality of NDA approvals occur in the month of December before and after the implementation of PDUFA, while December NDA submissions increase in the post-PDUFA period. The ramifications of these observations on new review guidelines introduced in PDUFA II and PDUFA III, as well as the implications for NDA submission strategy, are discussed. by James B. Graham.

40|$|Excise duties are an {{important}} source of government revenue and their rates change relatively often in the Czech Republic. Reforms of excise duties change the prices of goods, a change to which households respond by <b>adjusting</b> their <b>expenditures.</b> I use detailed Czech Statistical Office data and estimates of own- and cross-price and income elasticities for individual households to create a microeconomic simulation model that enables me to simulate the impact of changes in excise duties on households' demands. I show the distributional impact of current excise duties and then I simulate the impact of hypothetical increases of 10 per cent in each of them. I further simulate impact of certain approved or proposed changes in excise duties including the unsuccessful 2012 proposal to introduce an excise duty on wine...|$|R

In this study we show that, after controlling for lifestyle factors known to influence semen quality, human males viewing images depicting sperm competition had a higher percentage of motile sperm in their ejaculates. Many lifestyle variables were confirmed to influence semen quality, including the recent suggestion that storage of mobile phones close to the testes can decrease semen quality...|$|R
