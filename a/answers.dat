Next, we analyze common approaches to two subproblems: term overlap for <b>answer</b> sentence identification, and <b>answer</b> typing for short <b>answer</b> extraction. We present general tools for analyzing the strengths and limitations of techniques for these subproblems. Our results quantify the limitations of both term overlap and <b>answer</b> typing to distinguish between competing <b>answer</b> candidates. ...|$|R

Inconsistent <b>answer</b> alternatives were dropped only if there remained other <b>answer</b> alternatives that targeted the same content. If <b>answer</b> alternatives were chosen by almost all students or no student (i.e., very high or very low solution rate), they were critically revisited and dropped if they were considered too easy or too difficult for secondary school students. The students’ pictures and comments enabled conclusions about students’ naïve conceptions. Frequent naïve conceptions that had not yet been included in the test were added. The students’ drawings and explanations indicated that students sometimes misinterpreted the information given in the <b>answer</b> alternatives or questions. Critical text passages were reformulated to avoid ambiguities.|$|R
