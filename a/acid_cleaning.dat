50|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>cleaning</b> has {{limitations}} {{in that it}} is difficult to handle because of its corrosiveness, and it is not applicable to all steels. Hydrogen embrittlement becomes a problem for some alloys and high-carbon steels. The hydrogen from the acid reacts with the surface and makes it brittle and causes cracks. Because of its high reactance to treatable steels, acid concentrations and solution temperatures must be kept under control to assure desired pickling rates.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{performing}} {{electroless nickel}} plating, {{the material to}} be plated must be cleaned {{by a series of}} chemicals; this is known as the pre-treatment process. Failure to remove unwanted [...] "soils" [...] from the part's surface results in poor plating. Each pre-treatment chemical must be followed by water rinsing (normally two to three times) to remove chemicals that may adhere to the surface. De-greasing removes oils from surfaces, whereas <b>acid</b> <b>cleaning</b> removes scaling.|$|E
50|$|Flame heating in {{a normal}} {{atmosphere}} causes oxidation, scaling and carbon build up on the parts.

A common example is a fig leaf being painted over a nude figure. Overly aggressive cleaning with acid can also cause damage. <b>Acid</b> <b>cleaning</b> is meant to remove insoluble salts and minerals {{from the surface of}} archaeological ceramics.

50|$|In an {{open loop}} system (also called a {{groundwater}} heat pump), the secondary loop pumps natural water from a well or body of water into a heat exchanger inside the heat pump. ASHRAE calls {{open loop system}}s groundwater heat pumps or surface water heat pumps, depending on the source. Heat is either extracted or added by the primary refrigerant loop, and the water is returned to a separate injection well, irrigation trench, tile field or body of water. The supply and return lines must be placed far enough apart to ensure thermal recharge of the source. Since the water chemistry is not controlled, the appliance {{may need to be}} protected from corrosion by using different metals in the heat exchanger and pump. Limescale may foul the system over time and require periodic <b>acid</b> <b>cleaning.</b> This is much more of a problem with cooling systems than heating systems. Also, as fouling decreases the flow of natural water, it becomes difficult for the heat pump to exchange building heat with the groundwater. If the water contains high levels of salt, minerals, iron bacteria or hydrogen sulfide, a closed loop system is usually preferable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate foulants in chemical cleaning solutions of membrane(CCSM). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), hydrochloric acid(HCl) were used as chemical agents respectively. Hydrophobicity, molecular weight distribution and metal ions of foulants in CCSM were analyzed as the major characters for membrane fouling. Results reveal that alkali cleaning can remove both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of natural organic matters(NOM), and <b>acid</b> <b>cleaning</b> mainly removes hydrophilic organic matters. Medium molecular weight of very hydrophobic acids (1 - 10 kDa) and different molecular weight of neutral hydrophilic acids (100 - 1000 Da &> 300 kDa) in NOM can lead to membrane irreversible fouling. <b>Acid</b> <b>cleaning</b> is relatively effective for the reduction of inorganic foulants.

50|$|Oxidation and {{impurities}} in {{the metal}} films affect the diffusion reactions by reducing the diffusion rates. Therefore, clean deposition practices and bonding with oxide removal and re-oxidation prevention steps are applied. The oxide layer removal can be realized by various oxide etch chemistry methods. Dry etching processes, i.e. formic <b>acid</b> vapor <b>cleaning,</b> are preferred based on the minimization of the immersion in fluids and the resulting etching of the passivation or the adhesion layer. Using the CMP process, which is especially for Cu and Al required, creates a planarized surface with micro roughness around several nanometer and enables the achievement of void-free diffusion bonds. Further, a surface treatment for organic removal, e.g. UV-ozone exposure, is possible.|$|R
