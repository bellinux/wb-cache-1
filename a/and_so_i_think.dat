500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Rollo, {{turning back}} to his father, again, [...] "he lent it to me for the whole walk, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> he had any right {{to take it back}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not unless ordered so to do, Captain. I like a bit {{of hunting}} well enough, but, with all three {{officers}} away, some one should mount guard over the stores <b>and</b> transport, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the dog Pharaoh and I had best stop behind." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{collaboration}} with SpaceX had ended by 2012. In a 2015 interview, former president Chuck Beames (2014–2016) explained, [...] "SpaceX was a partner, {{and like a}} lot of partnerships, it was just determined that it was best we went our separate ways – different ambitions. We were interested in their engines, but Elon and his team, they’re about going to Mars, and we’re just in a different place, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was a parting of the ways that was amicable".|$|E
2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} with George Stephanopoulos, Obama said, [...] "I think {{that over the}} last {{two and a half years}} there's been an effort to go at me in a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it presents a problem for them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Wikinews (a sister project of Wikipedia which is a news website) in 2007, {{she said she had}} been asked by other animal protection groups to condemn illegal acts. [...] "And I won't do it, because if it were my animal I'd be happy." [...] But she added that she does not support arson. [...] "I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> at some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that, but maybe that's wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing if they hurt anyone ... Why would you preserve [...] just so someone can make a profit by continuing to hurt and kill individuals who feel every bit as much as we do?" ...|$|E

"Mrs. Haney {{certainly}} is a quaint little thing," [...] he replied, quite soberly; [...] "she's like a quail--so bright-eyed, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> still. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> her devotion to her old husband very beautiful.

2500|$|Early in the 2012 presidential campaign, in June 2011, Romney said, [...] "I don't {{speak for}} the {{scientific}} community, of course, but I believe the world's getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read {{that the world is}} getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." [...] He expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions. In June 2012, Romney's domestic policy advisor Oren Cass told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "He's a supporter of renewable energy, as long as it's anything that would be economically competitive. He doesn't know the extent to which climate change is occurring or that human activity is causing it.... What you won't see are mandates or taxes or regulations that interfere with economic activity." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I might," [...] the boy said; [...] "but I have {{my doubts}} about it. There's one comfort. We shall {{be able to}} sleep all day tomorrow, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> sha'n't <b>think</b> about it. As the Indians did not find our tracks yesterday, they are not likely to do so today." ...|$|R
60|$|I wished {{we could}} have gone away at once and heard no more, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> must, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> the young preacher have felt; but he was {{surrounded}} with compliments. M.

5000|$|Walton was {{subsequently}} {{moved to the}} Marion Treatment Center, a Virginia Department of Corrections facility specially equipped to help mentally ill inmates. [...] "Percy Walton is extremely mentally ill and profoundly impaired, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> obviously <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the governor acted appropriately and compassionately in granting our clemency request," [...] attorney Jennifer Givens said.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{think we}} had better not," [...] said Lady Montfort to Myra. [...] "After all, {{there is nothing like}} 'my crust of bread and liberty,' <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we had better stay at the Bristol." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{think of}} myself, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{of all other}} human beings, as circles of thought and experience, each a little {{different}} from the others. Each human being I see as essentially a circle of thought between an internal and an external world.|$|E

"I prize my seat {{more than}} ever," [...] said the Russian, still {{addressing}} the ladies; [...] "I prize it incalculably, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> of going up upon the banquette.

6000|$|... "Until we get them," [...] Dr. Beddersley said, [...] "I don't {{know that}} we can do anything. But if you can once give me two {{distinct}} photographs of the real man, no matter how much disguised, I could tell you whether they were taken from one person; <b>and,</b> if <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could point out certain details in common which might aid us to go upon." ...|$|R

60|$|Quest. But is {{not this}} the way to make Christ to loath us? You know when {{children}} fall down in the dirt, they do usually before they go home make their clothes as clean as they can, for fear their parents should chide them; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> should we.|$|E

60|$|Yes, I think I {{love him}} merely {{because he is}} MINE and is MASCULINE.

6000|$|... "I hope <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so," [...] said Sergius. [...] "He {{believes}} in his star, and will leave everything to its influence. There {{are to be}} no more adventures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure they}} wouldn't say {{so if they}} weren't.

6000|$|... "Very true," [...] {{agreed the}} Wizard. [...] "But it {{is a long}} time since I have had any sleep, <b>and</b> I'm tired. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall lie down upon one of these hard glass benches and take a nap." ...|$|R
