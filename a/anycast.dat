40|$|<b>Anycasting</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} recently as an efficient communication method for asynchronous duty-cycled wireless sensor networks. However, the interdependencies between end-toend communication cost and the <b>anycasting</b> design parameters have not been systematically studied. In this paper, a statistical endtoend cost model is presented to capture the end-to-end latency and energy consumption of <b>anycasting</b> operation under a realistic wireless channel model. By exploring {{the relationship between the}} end-to-end cost efficiency and the forwarding decision dependent <b>anycasting</b> design parameters, two <b>anycasting</b> forwarding metrics are proposed for fully distributed forwarding decision. By exploring the relationship among the preamble length, the size of the forwarding set and the achievable end-to-end cost efficiency, a series of preamble length control guidelines are proposed for low and extremely low duty-cycled WSNs. According to our analytical results and simulation validation, the proposed forwarding metrics help reduce the end-toend latency and energy consumption by about 55 % for <b>anycasting</b> with moderate preamble length, compared with the existing heuristic forwarding metrics. The proposed preamble length control guidelines help reduce, by more than half, the end-to-end energy and latency costs in low and extremely-low duty-cycled WSNs...|$|R

2500|$|To allow a 6to4 host to {{communicate}} with the native IPv6 Internet, it must have its IPv6 default gateway set to a 6to4 address which contains the IPv4 address of a 6to4 relay router. To avoid the need for users to set this up manually, the <b>anycast</b> address of 192.88.99.1 has been allocated for the purpose of sending packets to a 6to4 relay router. Note that when wrapped in 6to4 with the subnet and hosts fields set to zero this IPv4 address (192.88.99.1) [...] becomes the IPv6 address 2002:c058:6301::. To ensure BGP routing propagation, a short prefix of 192.88.99.0/24 has been allocated for routes pointed at 6to4 relay routers that use this <b>anycast</b> IP address. Providers willing to provide 6to4 service to their clients or peers should advertise the <b>anycast</b> prefix like any other IP prefix, and route the prefix to their 6to4 relay.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{wireless}} multihop to {{an access}} point model {{appears to be}} a promising component of future network ar-chitectures, including multihop cellular networks and wireless access networks at the edges of mesh networks. Sophisticated software radios and core network protocols are being developed to support the integration of heterogeneous access networks. A challenge is managing diverse resources at access points (e. g., 3 G, WiFi or WiMax), as well as the distributed interference among the mobiles within a heterogeneous access network. We propose the use of a new <b>anycasting</b> protocol to guide access point discovery and path selection for balancing access point resource and routing packets to access points (APs). In addition, a hybrid proactive/reactive approach is used to reduce overhead of AP discovery. We use theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, to study the tradeoff of our hybrid <b>anycasting</b> protocol. The simulation study indicates that the use of the hybrid <b>anycasting</b> protocol for AP discovery, load balancing and routing, results in consistent performance improvements. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In the <b>anycasting</b> problem, {{a sensor}} wants to report event {{information}} {{to one of}} sinks or actors. We describe the first localized <b>anycasting</b> algorithms that guarantee delivery for connected multi-sink sensor-actor networks. Let S(x) be the closest actor/sink to sensor x, and |xS(x) | be distance between them. In greedy phase, a node s forwards the packet to its neighbor v that minimizes the ratio of cost cost(|sv|) of sending packet to v (here we specifically apply hop-count and power consumption metrics) over the reduction in distance (|sS(s) |−|vS(v) |) to the closest actor/sink. A variant is to forward to the first neighbor on the shortest weighted path toward v. If none of neighbors reduces that distance then recovery mode is invoked. It is done by face traversal toward the nearest connected actor/sink, where edges are replaced by paths optimizing given cost. A hop count based and two variants of localized power aware <b>anycasting</b> algorithms are described. We prove guaranteed delivery property analytically and experimentally. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{replication}} of digital content over the Internet makes {{the identification of}} the best server an interesting problem. In this paper, our aim is to reduce the content transfer time from a server to a client with avoiding network and server congestion using an efficient, scalable server selection scheme. First, we review the limitations of the <b>anycasting</b> schemes proposed in the literature. Then, we propose an application-layer <b>anycasting</b> scheme which is a scalable, transparent, and dynamic solution. Our <b>anycasting</b> scheme is based on a metric which can predict the transfer time of a content transmitted using TCP. Our metric considers the server load, the server's maximum sending window size, and the client's maximum receiving window size. Also, it considers the critical performance parameters on the path server - client (i. e., the available bandwidth, the round trip time, and the packet loss rate). Our empirical results show the weakness of the other prediction schemes. Moreover, the results show that our proposed function predicts the transfer time of a content with an 8. 13 % accuracy compared to the real transfer time...|$|R

Gallager 's theorem for necessary and sufficient conditions for minimum-delay routing is modified to include processing delays and changes of traffic levels at network nodes. The first distributed algorithm for load balanced <b>anycasting</b> and routing in computer networks is presented.

40|$|A {{wireless}} ad hoc {{network is}} formed {{by a group}} of wireless hosts, without the use of any infrastructure. To enable communication, hosts cooperate among themselves to forward packets on behalf of each other. A key challenge in ad hoc networks lies in designing efficient routing strategies. While several routing protocols have been proposed, most of them aim to select one optimal route between the source and destination. The MAC layer at each intermediate node is then required to forward packets to the next downstream node on that route. We argue that choosing a single optimal route at the network layer may not be sufficient. Knowledge of short-term channel conditions at the MAC layer can {{play an important role in}} improving end-to-end performance. Instantaneous interference, channel contention, power constraints and other considerations may be taken into account along with the network layer's long-term view.

A new approach for routing to multi-instantiated destinations is introduced, and MIDR (Multiple Instance Destination Routing) {{is presented as}} an example of the approach. MIDR uses only distance information to multi-instantiated destinations, without routers having to establish overlays, know the network topology, use complete paths to destination instances, or know about all the instances of destinations.  MIDR enables routers to maintain multiple loop-free routes to the nearest instances of any given destination, as well as to some or all instances of the same destination.  It is shown that MIDR provides multiple loop-free paths to destination instances, and that is orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional approaches based on routing to single-instance destinations.  MIDR can be used in name-based content routing, IP unicast routing, multicasting, and <b>anycasting...</b>|$|R
