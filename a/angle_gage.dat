40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{examples}} of devices which need information about tilt angle. Legged mobile robots need tilt information for locomotion stabilization. Coaxial two wheeled mobile devices and snake like robots need tilt information for vertical stabilization. Safety systems for monitoring of dangerous tilt angle are sometime needed. The calibration and testing process is very important before using of the tilt sensors. This paper deals with declination <b>angle</b> <b>gage</b> for testing of these tilt sensors. Declination <b>angle</b> <b>gage</b> allows setting any reference angle for testing of tilt sensor. Calibration and testing process explores the validity and uncertainty of measurement through the tested tilt sensor...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the behavior of an innovative post-tensioned (PT) top-and-seat-angle wide flange (WF) beam-to-column moment connection for steel moment resisting frames subjected to seismic loading conditions. Nine large-scale specimens were tested. Each specimen represented an interior connection and consisted of two WF beams attached to a column. The parameters investigated in the study include the angle size, <b>angle</b> <b>gage</b> length, beam flange reinforcing plates, connection shim plates, and post-tensioning force. The results of the test program demonstrate that post-tensioned connections possess exceptional cyclic strength and ductility. Energy dissipation occurs in the angles while other structural members remain elastic. The initial elastic stiffness is {{comparable to that of}} a welded connection, and following severe inelastic cycles of drift the connection has little permanent deformation...|$|E

The aperture <b>angle</b> is <b>gaged</b> symmetrically to the optical axis {{and has to be}} smaller than 180°. Large aperture angles are difficult to design and lead to high prices.|$|R
40|$|Tension and Compression force {{deformation}} {{data from}} laboratory tests of angle segments {{are used to}} generate moment rotation curves for the following bolted partially restrained connections: (1) top and seat angle, (2) double web angle, and (3) top and seat angle with double web angles. The force deformation and moment rotation curves are analytically described by a four parameter formula which provides {{the basis for the}} analytical connection model. These connection models consist of rigid bars and nonlinear springs representing the angle segments in either tension or compression. Design curves giving the four parameters of the moment rotation curves are generated for the double web angle connection. These parameters are primarily a function of the <b>angle</b> thickness, <b>gage</b> length of the angle legs in flexture, and the number of bolts in the connection. Comparisons of derived moment rotation curves are made with published results of full scale tests...|$|R
30|$|Nonlinear {{finite element}} (FE) static {{analyses}} of top- and seat-angle connections were performed using ABAQUS standard {{to investigate the}} influence of connection parameters and its properties on prying action developed due to the interaction between column flange and top angle’s vertical leg. Contact phenomenon between two interfaces with finite sliding and bolt pretension in the initial step of analysis was considered in the FE model. FE analysis results were compared with the experimental ones to examine {{the applicability of the}} FE model. Then, the location of plastic hinges in connection assemblages was investigated at the ultimate state of the connection and a parametric study was performed varying connection parameters, material properties of connection assemblages, and magnitude of bolt pretension to visualize their effects on prying force and on the position of prying force on top angle’s vertical leg. Current study shows that plastic hinges not only develop at top angle’s heel and bolt hole region but also in the bolt shank that differs from some assumptions of power model (Kishi and Chen 1990): (1) top <b>angle</b> thickness and <b>gage</b> distance from <b>angle</b> heel to bolt hole center line have an distinct effect on prying action; and (2) distributed prying force developed near the region of the top edge of tension angle’s leg adjacent to column flange can contribute to the failure of the connection. Finally, a mathematical formulation to identify the location of prying force action point is proposed.|$|R
