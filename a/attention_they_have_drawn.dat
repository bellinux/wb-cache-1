40|$|Despite the {{significant}} <b>attention</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>drawn,</b> big bucket lot-sizing problems remain notoriously difficult to solve. Previous work of Akartunali and Miller (2012) presented results (computational and theoretical) indicating that what makes these problems difficult are the embedded single-machine, single-level, multi-period submodels. We therefore consider the simplest such submodel, a multi-item, two-period capacitated relaxation. We propose a methodology that can approximate the convex hulls of all such possible relaxations by generating violated valid inequalities. To generate such inequalities, we separate two-period projections of fractional LP solutions from the convex hulls of the two-period closure we study. The convex hull {{representation of the}} two-period closure is generated dynamically using column generation. Contrary to regular column generation, our method is an outer approximation, and therefore can be used efficiently in a regular branch-and-bound procedure. We present computational results that illustrate how these two-period models could be effective in solving complicated problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) to replace conventional plastic materials justifies the increasing <b>attention</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>drawn</b> both at lab-scale and in industrial biotechnology. The improvement of large-scale productivity and biochemical/genetic properties of producing strains requires mathematical modeling and process/strain optimization procedures. Current models dealing with structurally diversified PHAs, both structured and unstructured, {{can be divided}} into formal kinetic, low-structured, dynamic, metabolic (high-structured), cybernetic, neural networks and hybrid models; these attempts are summarized in this review. Characteristic properties of specific groups of models are stressed in light of their benefit to the better understanding of PHA biosynthesis, and their applicability for enhanced productivity. Unfortunately, there is no single type of mathematical model that expresses exactly all the characteristics of producing strains and/or features of industrial-scale plants; in addition, the different requirements for modelling of PHA production by pure cultures or mixed microbial consortia have to be addressed. Therefore, it is crucial to sophisticatedly adapt and fine-tune the modelling approach accordingly to actual processes, as the case arises. For “standard microbial cultivations and everyday practices”, formal kinetic models (for simple cases) and “low-structured” models will be appropriate and of great benefit. They are relatively simple and of low computational demand. To overcome the specific weaknesses of different established model types, some authors use hybrid models. Here, satisfying compromises can be achieved by combining mechanistic, cybernetic, and neural and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Therefore, this hybrid modelling approach appears to constitute the most promising solution to generate a holistic picture of the entire PHA production process, encompassing all the benefits of the original modelling strategies. Complex growth media require a higherdegree of model structuring. For scientific purposes and advanced development of industrial equipment in the future, real systems will be modelled by highly organized hybrid models. All solutions related to modelling PHA production are discussed in this review...|$|E

6000|$|The {{truth of}} what is told us as to the life beyond can in its very nature never be {{absolutely}} established. It is far nearer to complete proof, however, than any religious revelation which has ever preceded it. We have {{the fact that these}} accounts are mixed up with others concerning our present life which are often absolutely true. If a spirit can tell the truth about our sphere, it is difficult to suppose that he is entirely false about his own. Then, again, there is a very great similarity about such accounts, though their origin may be from people very far apart. Thus though [...] "non-veridical," [...] to use the modern jargon, they do conform to all our canons of evidence. A series of books which have attracted far less <b>attention</b> than <b>they</b> deserve <b>have</b> <b>drawn</b> the coming life in very close detail. These books are not found on railway bookstalls or in popular libraries, but the successive editions through which they pass show that there is a deeper public which gets what it wants in spite of artificial obstacles.|$|R
