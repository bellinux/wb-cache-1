40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether bicultural competence {{served as a}} mediator (i. e., an apparent causal mechanism) or a moderator (i. e., a variable that describes for whom or under what situation) {{for the relationship between}} Acculturative Family Distancing (AFD) and two psychological outcomes (i. e., depression and psychological wellbeing). A total of 258 Latino college students attending large, predominantly White public universities in the Midwest completed two online surveys in the fall 2012 and spring 2013 semesters. Data were analyzed using path analysis to test for mediation and hierarchical regression analyses to test for moderation. For mediation, results indicated that bicultural competence <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 mediated the relations between AFD <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 and depression <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 and psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 above and beyond the effects of depression, psychological wellbeing, acculturation, and enculturation <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1. Moreover, about 26 % of the variance in bicultural competence <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 was explained by AFD, enculturation, acculturation, and psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1; 23 % of the variance in depression <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 was explained by bicultural competence <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, depression <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1, and psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1; and 32 % of variance in psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 was explained by bicultural competence <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 and psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1. For moderation, results demonstrated a main effect of AFD on psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 and a main effect of bicultural competence on both depression and psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2. The interaction of AFD and bicultural competence did not significantly predict depression <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 or psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 after the effects of depression, psychological wellbeing, acculturation, and enculturation <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 were statistically controlled.

Results suggested that male students had stronger unethical attitudes and had higher propensity to engage in unethical behavior than female students. Attitude <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 predicted Propensity <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 accurately for all five factors (concurrent validity) : If students consider it to be unethical, then, {{they are less likely}} to engage in that unethical behavior. Attitude <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 predicted only Factor Abuse Resources for Propensity <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2. Propensity <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 was significantly related to Propensity <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2. Attitude <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1, Propensity <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1, and Propensity <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 had achieved configural and metric measurement invariance across major (business vs. psychology).

40|$|Based on Berry 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) {{acculturation}} framework on {{acculturation and}} adjustment, {{this study examined}} the link from acculturation experience (i. e., acculturation and enculturation) through coping strategies (i. e., social connectedness) to long-term outcomes (i. e., future subjective well-being SWB). Two hypotheses were proposed. First, it was expected that social connectedness in mainstream society (i. e., Mainstream SC) would mediate the association between acculturation and future SWB (i. e., life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect). Second, it was expected that social connectedness in the ethnic community (i. e., Ethnic SC) would mediate the association between enculturation and future SWB. Using a longitudinal design, a total of 203 Chinese international students completed an online survey <b>at</b> two <b>time</b> points. General social connectedness <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 and SWB (i. e., life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect) <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 were controlled for in this study. The results partially supported the above two mediation hypotheses. First, Mainstream SC <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 partially mediated the association between acculturation <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 and life satisfaction and positive affect <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 (but not for negative affect <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2). Second, Ethnic SC <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 partially mediated the association between enculturation <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 and negative affect <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 (but not for life satisfaction and positive affect <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2). Furthermore, unexpectedly, Mainstream SC <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 partially mediated the association between enculturation <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 and life satisfaction and positive affect <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 (but not negative affect <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1).

40|$|Background and Objectives. The {{current study}} {{utilizes}} Skinner 2 ̆ 7 s framework {{to examine the}} unique contributions of internal locus of control, self-efficacy, and perceived outcome control over course performance on students 2 ̆ 7 academic experiences. Method. Undergraduate students (N = 225) {{took part in a}} longitudinal study and completed two surveys (Time 1 : just before their mid-term exams; Time 2 : just before their final exam in the same semester). Results. Both locus of control and self-efficacy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 predicted course-level perceived control over course performance <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2. Student-level perceived control over course performance <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 mediated the relationship between self-efficacy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 and course-level perseverance, course-specific stress, and course enjoyment <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2. For global perceived stress and life satisfaction measured <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, both locus of control and self-efficacy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 had only a direct effect on global perceived stress <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, but only self-efficacy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 predicted life satisfaction <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2. Conclusion. Both locus of control and self-efficacy uniquely contribute to students 2 ̆ 7 academic experiences.

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study examined deliberate self-harm and suicidal behaviors among adolescents in junior secondary schools in Hong Kong. With specific reference to adolescents in Grade 9, {{the prevalence of}} deliberate self-harm behavior was 21. 9 %, with preventing wounds from healing, self-scratching, and wrist cutting being the most prevalent self-harm behaviors; the prevalence of self- harm behavior was higher in girls than in boys. The prevalence of suicide attempts was 3. 4 %, with girls manifesting more suicidal behaviors than boys. A path model with family functioning (mutuality, communication, and conflicts) <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1, positive youth development qualities <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, and self-harm and suicidal behaviors <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 3 was tested. The following results were obtained: (a) mutuality and communication <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 predicted self-harm and suicidal behaviors <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 3 via positive youth development <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2; (b) mutuality <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 directly predicted self-harm behavior <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 3; (c) family conflicts <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 directly predicted suicidal behavior <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 3.

Particular contributions are, first, the focus upon both targets and perpetrators of workplace bullying, and second, the two-wave design with a 6 -month time lag. We assume that (a) workload <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> I associates positively with being a target/perpetrator <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, (b) job autonomy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> I associates negatively with being a target/perpetrator <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, and (c) the positive relationship between workload <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> I and being a target/perpetrator <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 is stronger under the condition of low (vs. high) job autonomy <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> I (i. e., interaction between workload and job autonomy).
