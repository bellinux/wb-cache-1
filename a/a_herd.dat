5|$|<b>A</b> <b>herd</b> of elk was {{introduced}} to the watershed shortly before November 2000. Black bears have also been observed in the watershed.

The Allegheny Wood Rat has the potential to inhabit much of the watershed except for the northwestern part.|$|E

5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from <b>a</b> <b>herd,</b> and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, the HT Ranch, {{located near}} Medora, North Dakota, bought 60 mares from <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> of 250 Native American-bred horses {{originally}} confiscated from the Lakota leader Sitting Bull and sold at Fort Buford, North Dakota in 1881.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>herd</b> {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is unclear whether the Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents who had used the islands to graze livestock. They are owned and managed {{by the state of}} North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource.|$|E

5|$|In 1525, {{after the}} Spanish {{conquest of the}} Aztec Empire, Hernán Cortés led an {{expedition}} to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom {{in what is now}} the northern Petén Department of Guatemala. His aim was to subdue the rebellious Cristóbal de Olid, whom he had sent to conquer Honduras; Olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory. Cortés had 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies.

5|$|In the book's opening, {{the title}} {{character}} and her mate ambush <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> of Astrodon, which are large herbivorous sauropods. The Astrodon are surprised, thinking that their bulk deters smaller predators. Utahraptor, however, are much larger than any resident raptor, and proceed to take down an Astrodon with teamwork. When Red's mate climbs onto the dead Astrodon, the corpse rolls in the mud, trapping the male under {{the bulk of the}} animal. Despite Red's best efforts, her mate suffocates. Despondent, Red wanders around the floodplain, nearly starving since a Utahraptor cannot successfully hunt big game on its own.|$|E
5|$|Some {{events and}} their timing are unclear during this early period. Sources {{disagree}} {{on whether he}} brought his family to California from Illinois in 1852 or 1854. Carranco dates Seth's first return to Illinois starting in 1850, with his return to California in August 1852, his arrival in Humboldt County in February 1853, another return to Illinois in September 1853, and a trip back to California starting in May 1854 with his mother, two children, and <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> of cattle. Thus, {{in the course of}} the six years 1849-1854, he is believed to have crossed the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains five times, travelling mostly on foot.|$|E

5|$|Some prey {{animals such as}} zebra {{are marked}} with high-contrast {{patterns}} which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as lions, during a chase. The bold stripes of <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> of running Zebra have been claimed {{make it difficult for}} predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Since dazzle patterns (such as the Zebra's stripes) make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between dazzle and camouflage. Another theory is that the zebra's stripes could provide some protection from flies and biting insects.|$|E
5|$|We want a {{national}} literature commensurate with our mountains and rivers... We want {{a national}} epic that shall {{correspond to the}} size of the country...

5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed {{almost half a century}} later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> that died catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorizing that Plateosaurus were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of the}} Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard explanation on most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E

5|$|After {{their initial}} {{founding}} with one milk supplier, Beecher's production system {{has had to}} expand several times to include more suppliers. As of 2006, Beecher's {{was in the process}} of purchasing their own farms in Eastern Washington for additional milk production, which will also give them full control over their entire product's creation. The principal milk supplier is Green Acres Farm in Duvall, Washington, using only hormone-free and antibiotic-free milk. When consistent milk production first became a problem, Beecher's purchased <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> of 200 cows. The entire dairy herd at Green Acres Farm is owned by Beecher's, who leases them back to the farm. For the New York production, all Holstein and Jersey milk come directly from Dutch Hollow Farms in upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|At school, Cartman begins farting fire, and Kyle unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{convince}} his teacher, Mr. Garrison, to excuse him from class to find his brother. When Chef learns that Kyle's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman's anus, he helps the boys escape from school by pulling the fire alarm. Once outside, Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream, when suddenly he is hit by a beam, causing him to begin singing and dancing to I Love to Singa. Soon afterward, a spaceship appears. Kyle throws a stone and the spaceship fires back, propelling Kenny into the road. As he gets back up, he is trampled over by <b>a</b> <b>herd</b> of cows, but survives. A police car then runs Kenny over and kills him.|$|E
