5|$|Persuaded by the European {{football}} body, UEFA, to take action, the FA summoned Hackett and {{the other}} match officials for their accounts of the brawl. Three days after the match, both clubs were formally charged. A five-man disciplinary committee later studied three video tapes of how the brawl came about <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defence presented by club representatives. In November 1990, Arsenal and Manchester United were fined £50,000 each and deducted league points; Arsenal lost two points and United one.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy who said that his parents were murdered on his bus became the story's base. Mahesh met Sukumar {{on the set of}} Businessman (2012) in Goa, <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> script for 25 minutes. Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in the noisy restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour. Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for two months, and considered it his dream project.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland {{to listen to}} a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone {{at the base of the}} flagpole <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E

25|$|Then, in the 1982-83 season, with Oviedo as Coach and Contesti as President, {{the team}} earned its fourth {{promotion}} to the Primera Division. That happened with three weeks {{remaining in the}} season, when RCDM went to Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu stadium to play “Castilla” (Real Madrid B), needing only a draw to secure promotion. But after conceding 1-0 to Castilla, the RCDM players and 5,000 Bermellone fans waited <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio broadcast of the remaining eight minutes of the Coruña-Rayo Vallecano game on the Bernabeu turf.

However, after the ensuing season Mallorca dropped back down to the second tier in a difficult season with coach Marcel Domingo. In that season, RCDM employed its first Northern Irish player, Gerry Armstrong.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Notre Dame {{reflected}} rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied {{up around the}} team <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist and anti-catholic movement, in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame {{was seen as a}} symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.|$|E

The following year, Harding was one of many orators who spoke across Ohio as part of the campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, that state's former governor, William McKinley. According to Dean, [...] "while working for McKinley [...] began making a name for himself through Ohio".|$|E

500|$|After the album's {{sessions}} were done, Dulli {{was inspired to}} write and record an additional track {{on the day of}} Miles Davis' death, September 28, 1991. He received two messages on his answering machine from music executive David Katznelson, the first providing directions to a cookout and the second informing Dulli that Davis had passed, saying that [...] "Miles is dead. Don't forget the alcohol." [...] Working at Ultrasuede in Cincinnati, Dulli incorporated Katznelson's line as a lyric and, with a guitar riff from Rick McCollum, hastily recorded [...] "Miles Iz Ded", which was included as a hidden track on the album. Congregation was mastered by Jack Skinner at K Disc Mastering in Hollywood. Dulli subsequently took a drive in his car <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album while observing his scenery, a practice he continued with future albums.|$|E
500|$|As a music critic, Cardus's romantic, instinctive {{approach}} {{was the opposite}} of Newman's objective school of musical criticism. Initially in awe of Newman's reputation, Cardus soon discovered his own independent, more subjective voice. A fellow critic wrote that Newman [...] "probed into Music's vitals, put her head under deep X-ray and analysed cell-tissue. Cardus laid his head against her bosom <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beating of her heart." [...] Despite their different approaches, the two writers held each other in considerable regard; at times, Newman's own prose showed the influence of Cardus's style. Among leading musicians who have paid tribute to Cardus, Yehudi Menuhin wrote that he [...] "reminds {{us that there is}} an understanding of the heart {{as well as of the}} mind... in Neville Cardus, the artist has an ally". Colin Davis highlighted [...] "the quality and verve of Cardus's writing", which had made him a household name.|$|E

He borrowed from the library Segments II (Orchestra Of Two Continents) by pianist Cecil Taylor's band while at high school, but found separating the various elements of the music too difficult. After attending a Last Exit concert (a loud free jazz band of Peter Brötzmann, Bill Laswell, Ronald Shannon Jackson and Sonny Sharrock), he went home <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Taylor album again: [...] "It was more manageable {{in terms of being}} able to hear detail and listen to content.

Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left.

After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, [...] "When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom." [...] After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.|$|E
500|$|When Bart {{reaches for}} the cupcakes and collapses, it is a parody of a scene in A Clockwork Orange, where the main {{character}} Alex reaches for a woman's breasts. The Duff clock is a parody of the [...] "It's a Small World" [...] clock. In the Duff TV advertisement, {{a group of women}} were leading an anti-sexism protest in front of the McMahon and Tate building, a reference to the advertising agency from Bewitched. The scene toward the end where Moe points toward individual customers declaring they will [...] "be back" [...] before pointing toward and addressing the viewer (later revealed to be Barney via a cutaway) is a parody {{of the end of the}} film Reefer Madness. The final scene, where Homer and Marge cycle into the distance while [...] "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" [...] plays is a reference to the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Homer's song [...] "It was a Very Good Beer" [...] is sung to the tune of the 1961 song [...] "It Was a Very Good Year"; one of its lyrics is Homer stating he stayed up <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music of the British band Queen. Bart sitting in the chair, stroking the hamster is a reference to James Bond character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who strokes a cat in his chair.|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E

500|$|In 1962 Sellers {{played a}} retired British army general in John Guillermin's Waltz of the Toreadors, {{based on the}} play of the same name. The film was widely criticised for its slapstick {{cinematic}} adaption, and director Guillermin himself considered the film an [...] "amateurish" [...] effort. However, Sellers won the San Sebastián International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA award nomination for his performance, and it was well received by the critics. Stanley Kubrick asked Sellers {{to play the role}} of Clare Quilty in the 1962 film Lolita, opposite James Mason and Shelley Winters. Kubrick had seen Sellers in The Battle of the Sexes <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album The Best of Sellers, and was impressed by the range of characters he could portray. Sellers was apprehensive about accepting the role, doubting his ability to successfully portray the part of a flamboyant American television playwright who was according to Sellers [...] "a fantastic nightmare, part homosexual, part drug addict, part sadist". Kubrick encouraged Sellers to improvise and stated that he would often reach a [...] "state of comic ecstasy". Kubrick had American jazz producer Norman Granz record portions of the script for Sellers to listen to, so he could study the voice and develop confidence, granting Sellers a free artistic licence. Sellers later claimed that his relationship with Kubrick became one of the most rewarding of his career. Writing in The Sunday Times, Dilys Powell noted that Sellers gave [...] "a firework performance, funny, malicious, only once for a few seconds overreaching itself, and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy". Towards the end of 1962, Sellers appeared in The Dock Brief, a legal satire directed by James Hill and co-starring Richard Attenborough.|$|E

[...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible.
