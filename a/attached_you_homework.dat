If Tippoo comes down from the hills, {{he will not be}} able to take the field against him, and will need all his forces to defend Arcot, Vellore, and his smaller forts, and cavalry would be of no real use to him. Your troop would be of much greater utility to the battalions from Bengal, when they arrive. They will be here in three weeks or so, and as soon as they come, I will <b>attach</b> <b>you</b> to them. I will write to the Nabob, saying that you were about to join him, but that, in the {{interest}} of the general defence, I have thought it better, at present, to <b>attach</b> <b>you</b> to the Bengal contingent. You see, they will be entirely new to the country, and it will be a great advantage to them to have a troop like yours, many of whom are well acquainted with the roads and general geography of the country.

5000|$|Franco-Défi : A {{program for}} {{students}} that wish to give themselves a challenge from Grade 7 to 10 {{that will take}} them {{to a new level}} in courses like French, Social Studies, Mathematics and Sciences. It's a scam. They promise field trips, but you only get 1 in 9th grade and 1 in 10th grade. Also, they say it's different but it's not. The only challenge is that they give <b>you</b> more <b>homework.</b> <b>You</b> learn the exact same things as everyone else. In a poor attempt to cover up the lie that Franco-Défi is, they make you do a project that isn't graded and they make you waste more time that you don't have because you have other classes with other teachers that don't care that you are in Franco-Défi.|$|R
