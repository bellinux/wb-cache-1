5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is <b>abrasion</b> to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. <b>Abrasion</b> of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes <b>abrasion</b> damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E

5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and <b>abrasion</b> damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found {{on the sides of}} the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by <b>abrasion</b> with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E

5|$|Pneumothorax was {{described}} in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a student of René Laennec, who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819. While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis (then the most common cause), the concept of spontaneous pneumothorax {{in the absence of}} tuberculosis (primary pneumothorax) was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932. In 1941, the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural <b>abrasion</b> for the treatment of pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash plumes {{can form}} above {{pyroclastic}} density currents, these are called co-ignimbrite plumes. As pyroclastic density currents travel {{away from the}} volcano, smaller particles are removed from the flow by elutriation and form a less dense zone overlying the main flow. This zone then entrains the surrounding air and a buoyant co-ignimbrite plume is formed. These plumes tend to have higher concentrations of fine ash particles compared to magmatic eruption plumes due to the <b>abrasion</b> within the pyroclastic density current.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ashfall {{is likely}} to have major effects on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause <b>abrasion</b> damage to pumps and block pipes, {{settling}} ponds and open filters. High levels of turbidity are very likely to interfere with disinfection treatment and doses may have to be adjusted to compensate. It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the use of white label manual toothbrushes and a greater increase in inquiries for discomfort of the gingiva and mucosa. Material and Methods: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical trial was made of four white brand toothbrushes versus a control brush (Vitis Suave®), with the recording of plaque index, bleeding upon probing, and gingival <b>abrasions</b> following utilization of the different brushes. Results: All the brushes except Deliplus® were equally effective in terms of plaque removal (p < 0. 05). Vitis Suave® and Veckia® were the brushes associated to the greatest increase in minor <b>abrasions</b> (p < 0. 01), while Veckia®, Carrefour® and Deluxe® significantly increased the number of medium intensity <b>abrasions</b> (p < 0. 05). These brushes also increased the number of large <b>abrasions,</b> though statistical significance was not reached in this case. Conclusions: The white brand brushes proved effective in controlling bacterial plaque, but were associated to more intense soft tissue abrasio...|$|R

5|$|A concave line of <b>abrasion</b> and {{polishing}} {{can be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural <b>abrasion</b> are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E

5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural <b>abrasion</b> (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Pyroclastic density {{currents}} can also produce ash particles. These are typically produced by lava dome collapse or {{collapse of the}} eruption column. Within pyroclastic {{density currents}} particle <b>abrasion</b> occurs as particles {{interact with each other}} resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow. These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which is removed from pyroclastic density currents in co-ignimbrite ash plumes.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a schizocarp {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by <b>abrasion</b> during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.|$|E

5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an <b>abrasion,</b> though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few hundred}} feet. Because the ice over the valleys would be thicker than the ice over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys. The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and <b>abrasion</b> by the ice.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from <b>abrasion</b> and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
