5|$|In 1956, MD32 was {{extended}} east on Guilford Road from US1 to the Howard <b>Anne</b> <b>Arundel</b> county line at Annapolis Junction. The state highway was relocated to its present alignment from Glenelg to Clarksville between 1961 and 1964, bypassing Ten Oaks Road. MD32 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in West Friendship when its interchange with I-70 was reconstructed as a diamond interchange in 1973. MD32 {{was extended}} east into <b>Anne</b> <b>Arundel</b> County in 1969 when the designation {{was extended to}} {{just east of the}} BaltimoreWashington Parkway on the edge of Fort George G. Meade. The first two sections of what would become the Patuxent Freeway opened in 1972. A short section of divided highway opened from just west of Oakland Mills Road in Guilford to a turnaround just west of Vollmerhausen Road that included MD32's modern interchange with I-95. The other section was a two-lane road from MD175 in Odenton northeast along Sappington Station Road and then east along the current alignments of MD32 and I-97 to MD178 just east of I-97 Exit 5 in Crownsville. The eastern section, which from 1972 to 1977 was one of the three disjoint sections of mainline MD32 between Crownsville and Taneytown, included an interchange with MD3 in Millersville. As of 1978, MD32's interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway was a partial cloverleaf interchange with four ramps {{on the north side of}} MD32due to the state highway closely paralleling the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's spur to the military baseand a fifth ramp from the northbound Parkway to eastbound MD32. The MD3 interchange included the ramps to and from MD32 in the direction of Fort Meade plus a ramp from westbound MD32 to northbound MD3. All other movements were made via MD178 or Millersville Road.|$|E
5|$|Outside the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, {{the parkway}} comes to MD197 (Laurel–Bowie Road) south of Laurel. Near this exit of the parkway is the Montpelier Mansion, a Georgian mansion built by Major Thomas Snowden in 1783. Past MD197, the road {{passes through the}} western edge of the Patuxent National Wildlife Research Refuge, a {{wildlife}} center established in 1936 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, crossing the Patuxent River into <b>Anne</b> <b>Arundel</b> County. Here the parkway continues northeast through dense woodland and comes to the exit for MD198 (Fort Meade Road) to the east of Laurel, which itself is a suburb that originated in the 1830s as a mill town that contains many historical sites such as the Laurel Railroad Station (still used today by MARC Train), an 1844 Queen Anne house, and an 1840s millworkers house that is home to the Laurel Museum.|$|E

5|$|MD 198 curves {{northeast}} and meets {{the northern end}} of MD 197 (Laurel Bowie Road) before crossing the Patuxent River, where the route leaves the city of Laurel and enters <b>Anne</b> <b>Arundel</b> County. The highway, now named Laurel Fort Meade Road, passes one of the main entrances to Laurel Park Racecourse and passes through Maryland City. MD 198 drops to four lanes at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and then becomes a two-lane road a short distance east of the interchange. The state highway crosses the Little Patuxent River, then curves southeast and expands to a four-lane divided highway as it parallels MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). At the entrance to Tipton Airport, MD 198 curves north and meets MD 32 at a dumbbell interchange. The highway passes through an S-curve then reaches its northern terminus at an entrance to Fort Meade. The road continues into the military installation as Mapes Road.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction of the MD 3 {{divided highway}} from Millersville to MD 3 Business began in 1987 over two sections. The first section, from north of MD 3 Business to north of Benfield Boulevard, began in 1987. The work {{included}} {{the construction of}} the flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to Veterans Highway just south of MD 3 Business. The section from north of Benfield Boulevard to MD 178 at Dorrs Corner was reconstructed starting in 1989. The second section included construction of the Benfield Boulevard interchange. The southbound MD 3 roadway was rebuilt in place as the southbound lanes of I-97. New northbound lanes were built immediately to the east of the southbound lanes. In February 1991, the new northbound lanes opened and access from I-97 to Veterans Highway was removed at Dorrs Corner. The old northbound lanes were reconstructed and re-purposed as a two-lane road, Veterans Highway, later that year. <b>Anne</b> <b>Arundel</b> County agreed to accept Veterans Highway for maintenance after the I-97–related construction concluded in a road transfer agreement on July 21, 1988. MD 3 was truncated at Millersville after I-97 opened in October 1991; signage for MD 3 on I-695 was removed by 1993.|$|E
