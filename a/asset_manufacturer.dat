50|$|As {{with any}} capital <b>asset,</b> <b>manufacturers</b> {{typically}} include the standard maintenance practices and procedures {{needed to keep}} the asset functioning properly and within design specifications. In many cases, scheduled maintenance routines are based on laboratory or design parameters and do not necessarily represent the optimum. MFM supports proper maintenance on marine engines and generators by using the actual fuel burned or hours operated as the basis for performing maintenance routines. This condition-based maintenance program more accurately reflects the operating environment of the engine, but more importantly, reduces or eliminates unnecessary maintenance work.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIncreasing connectivity, use {{of digital}} computation, and {{off-site}} data storage provide potential for dramatic improvements in manufacturing productivity, quality, and cost. However, {{there are also}} risks associated with the increased volume and pervasiveness of data that are generated and potentially accessible to competitors or adversaries. Enterprises have experienced cyber attacks that exfiltrate confidential and/or proprietary data, alter information to cause an unexpected or unwanted effect, and destroy capital <b>assets.</b> <b>Manufacturers</b> need tools to incorporate these risks into their existing risk management processes. This paper establishes a framework that considers the data flows within a manufacturing enterprise and throughout its supply chain. The framework provides several mechanisms for identifying generic and manufacturing-specific vulnerabilities and is illustrated with details pertinent to an automotive manufacturer. In addition to providing manufacturers with insights into their potential data risks, this framework addresses an outcome identified by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework...|$|R

40|$|Industries {{of today}} {{experience}} increased competition and cost pressure, further the trends Industry 4. 0 and servitization have emerged. A technology that could facilitate for the necessary business transformation, further support the increased amount of digital content, is Augmented Reality. This report aims {{to give a}} comprehensive understanding of what, positively or negatively, influences the adoption of AR amongst <b>asset</b> intensive <b>manufacturers,</b> from an external environment-, organizational-, and a technological perspective. Furthermore, different use-cases for AR have been evaluated {{in order to determine}} whether these are applicable today, or rather in the future. The research was of qualitative nature and both primary- and secondary data sources have been used. The primary data were collected from interviews with industry experts, AR experts, and managers or employees involved in AR initiatives. The secondary data were mainly collected from consultancy reports, but also from panel discussions and seminars. It was found that AR is a communication and visualization tool, that has great potential to deliver business value due to its ability to support a mixed reality, in other words the merge of the realand the digital world. Furthermore, by the usage of a head-mounted-display (HMD) device, additional value propositions could be received, such as hands-free. Therefore, it is believed that AR by the usage of HMD brings the highest business potential, further that it will become the next computer platform. However, there are many technical limitations that must be solved in order for AR to achieve its full potential. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} current AR-market is highly fragmented, and there are no standards regarding hardware, platforms, and how to describe information. Similarly, companies are uncertain regarding AR’s capabilities, and the cost and benefits of an AR investment. Therefore, these concern must be solved in order for AR to take off. Ten different use-cases were found valuable for <b>asset</b> intensive <b>manufacturers,</b> and a common theme amongst these were that AR facilitated for increased understanding and collaboration. The focus in a short time-horizon should be on applications that solves a critical problem, as well as providing high business value. Furthermore, the current focus should be on applications with low technical requirements, and where it is possible to reuse existing content. Therefore, the most valuable use-areas from a short time-horizon are: remote guidance, visualization of 3 D models, and dashboarding. However, several of the other use-cases will become beneficial in a near future, further new applications will arise in the future...|$|R

40|$|Medical devices {{today are}} more {{effective}} and connected than ever before, saving more patient lives and making healthcare practitioner’s jobs more efficient. But with this interconnectedness comes inherent concerns over increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Medical device cybersecurity has become an increasing concern for all relevant stakeholders including: patients, regulators, manufacturers, and healthcare practitioners. Although cybersecurity in medical devices has been covered in the literature, there is a gap in how to address cybersecurity concerns and assess risks {{in a way that}} brings value to all relevant stakeholders. In order to maximize the value created from cybersecurity risk mitigations, we review literature on the state of cybersecurity in the medical device industry, on cybersecurity risk management frameworks in the context of medical devices, and on how cybersecurity {{can be used as a}} value proposition. We then synthesize the key contributions of the literature into a framework that integrates cybersecurity value considerations for all relevant stakeholders into the risk mitigation process. This framework is subsequently applied to the hypothetical case of an insulin pump. Using this example case, we illustrate how medical device manufacturers can use the framework as a standardized method that can be applicable to medical devices at large. Our ultimate goal is to make cybersecurity risk mitigation an exploitable <b>asset</b> for <b>manufacturers</b> rather than a regulatory obligation...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} inventory models {{focus on}} characterizing replenishment policies {{in order to}} maximize the total expected profit or to minimize the expected total cost over a planned horizon. However, for many companies, total inventory costs could be accounting for a fairly large amount of invested capital. In particular, raw material inventories should be viewed as a type of invested <b>asset</b> for a <b>manufacturer</b> with suitable risk control. This paper is intended to provide this perspective on inventory management that treats inventory problems within a wider context of financial risk management. In view of this, the optimal inventory problem under a VaR constraint is studied. The financial portfolio theory has been used to model the dynamics of inventories. A diverse portfolio consists of raw material inventories, which involve market risk because of price fluctuations as well as a risk-free bank account. The value-at-risk measure is applied thereto to control the inventory portfolio's risk. The objective function is to maximize the utility of total portfolio value. In this model, the ordering cost is assumed to be fixed and the selling cost is proportional to the value. The inventory control problem is thus formulated as a continuous stochastic optimal control problem with fixed and proportional transaction costs under a continuous value-at-risk (VaR) constraint. The optimal inventory policies are derived by using stochastic optimal control theory and the optimal inventory level is reviewed and adjusted continuously. A numerical algorithm is proposed and the results illustrate how the raw material price, inventory level and VaR constraint are interrelated. © 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The Icing Branch at NASA Glenn Research has {{developed}} a computer program to simulate ice formation {{on the leading edge}} of an aircraft wing during flight through cold, moist air. As part of the branch's current research, members have developed software known as LEWICE. This program is capable of predicting the formation of ice under designated weather conditions. The success of LEWICE is an <b>asset</b> to airplane <b>manufacturers,</b> ice protection system manufacturers, and the airline industry. Simulations of ice formation conducted in the tunnel and in flight is costly and time consuming. However, the danger of in-flight icing continues to be a concern for both commercial and military pilots. The LEWICE software is a step towards inexpensive and time efficient prediction of ice collection. In the most recent version of the program, LEWICE contains an algorithm for droplet splashing. Droplet splashing is a natural occurrence that causes accumulation of ice on aircraft surfaces. At impingement water droplets lose a portion of their mass to splashing. With part of each droplet joining the airflow and failing to freeze, early versions of LEWICE without the splashing algorithm over-predicted the collection of ice on the leading edge. The objective of my project was to determine whether the revised version of LEWICE accurately reflected the ice collection data obtained from the Icing Research Tunnel (IRT). The experimental data from the IRT was collected by Mark Potapczuk in January, March and July of 2001 and April and December of 2002. Experimental data points were the result of ice tracings conducted shortly after testing in the tunnel. Run sheets, which included a record of velocity, temperature, liquid water content and droplet diameter, served as the input of the LEWICE computer program. Parameters identical to the tunnel conditions were used to run LEWICE 2. 0 and LEWICE 3. 0. The results from IRT and versions of LEWICE were compared graphically. After entering the raw experimental data and computer output into a spread sheet, I mapped each ice formation onto a clean airfoil. The LEWICE output provided the data points to graphically depict ice formations developed by the program. weather conditions of runs conducted in January 2001, it was evident that the splashing algorithm of LEWICE 3. 0 predicts ice formations more accurately than LEWICE 2. 0. Especially at conditions with droplet size between 80 and 160 microns, the splashing algorithm of the new LEWICE version compensated for the loss of droplet mass as a result of splashing. In contrast, LEWICE 2. 0 consistently over-predicted the mass of the ice in conditions with droplet size exceeding 80 microns. This evidence confirms that changes made to algorithms of LEWICE 3. 0 have increased the accuracy of predicting ice collection...|$|R
