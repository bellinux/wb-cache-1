40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted during kharif 2008, {{to assess the}} pattern of morphological variations through metroglyphtechnique in local land races of Sorghum collected {{from different parts of}} Tamil Nadu. Based on this technique, geneticvariability was evaluated for five characters viz., <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> / plant (g), fodder yield / plant (g), grain size (g), 1000 grainweight and ear head compactness among 63 accessions. The mean values were used for plotting the accessions in agraph. All accessions were grouped into eight distinct groups, which differed amongst themselves. Group II was thelargest comprising 25 accessions followed by Group V having 13 accessions with moderate <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> and fodder yield. Group VI consisted of 3 accessions with high yield and medium fodder yield besides moderate 1000 grain weight andear head compactness. Group VIII had 3 accessions classified into <b>medium</b> <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> with high fodder yield consistingof compact ear head and bold grains. Land races are the primitive cultivars which are selected and cultivated by farmersfor many generations. Land races have more genetic diversity, wider adaptability and high degree of resistance to bioticand abiotic stresses and even respond to selection for high yield. In the present world of research, great strides in sorghumimprovement have been made by transforming the local land races into more productive forms through hybridization toevolve highly adapted hybrids. Since, sorghum is the dual purpose crop, the germplasm lines of Group III, VI, VII andV could be helpful in future breeding programme for achieving higher <b>grain</b> <b>yield,</b> yield components and fodder yield. The study, therefore, indicated the possibility of producing dual purpose sorghum hybrids by combining desirablegermplasm accessions...|$|R

The materials developed are characterized by a pronounced structural homogeneity <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> <b>grain</b> sizes near the submicron range, a minimum residual porosity #=# 4. 5 MPa m"-" 1 "/" 2, a specific electrical resistance of 10 "-" 3 ohm/cm for electrical discharge machining, and a good machinability (cutting properties, edge tear resistance, buffability). Positive results were obtained applying Al_ 2 O_ 3 TiC composite ceramics as thin-film magnet head substrates. The substitution of Al_ 2 O_ 3 by Y-ZrO_ 2 improved the wear resistance, edge stability, and microstructure characteristics.

40|$|Water {{is a major}} cost (20 - 30 %) for Australian rice {{production}} as the industry water use is very high (12. 3 ML/ha) due to flood irrigation. Developing appropriate rainfed rice varieties provide alternatives for the rice industry to maintain growth while the cost for water is increasing and availability is decreasing. However, maintaining high grain quality from rainfed production systems may pose challenges. Thirteen dryland rice genotypes (7 long 6 <b>medium</b> <b>grain</b> lines) were tested during the summer rainy season in Alton Downs, QLD under rainfed and strategic irrigation management in the 2013 / 14 season. Measured grain quality parameters only differ due to varieties but not due to water management practice (rainfed vs strategic irrigation). Four of the <b>medium</b> <b>grain</b> varieties (Lasix XB, Inaminka XD, Linklaer A 1 and Laski VII) produced <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> of 4 – 5 t/ha with strategic irrigation but were compromised with low amylose and grain protein.

The main constraint of acid soil is phosphor (P) deficiency and aluminum (Al) toxicity which decrease plant productivity.

Sorghum has been reported to have wide adaptability to various agro-ecology and can be used as food and animal feed. Unfortunately, sorghum is not Indonesian origin so its genetic variability is still low. From previous breeding works with induced mutation, some promising mutant lines have been developed. These mutant lines were included in the experiment carried out in Tenjo with soil condition was classified as acid soil with pH 4. 8 and exchangeable-Al content 2. 43 me/ 100 g. The objectives of this experiment were to study the magnitude of genetic variability of agronomy and grain quality characters in sorghum in order to facilitate the breeding improvement of the species. Plant materials used in this study were ten genotypes, including 6 mutant lines and 4 control varieties. The randomized block design with three replications was used in the experiment.

However, due to its complex nature, little is known regarding the genetic control of <b>grain</b> <b>yield.</b> A doubled-haploid population, comprising 182 individuals, produced from a cross between two cultivars ‘Trident’ and ‘Molineux’, was used to construct a linkage map based largely on microsatellite molecular makers. ‘Trident’ represents a lineage of wheat varieties from southern Australia that has achieved consistently high relative <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> across a range of environments. In comparison, ‘Molineux’ would be rated as a variety with low to moderate <b>grain</b> <b>yield.</b> The doubled-haploid population was grown from 2002 to 2005 in replicated field experiments at a range of environments across the southern Australian wheat belt.

However, rice yield not only depends on the genetic characteristics but also on the agronomic practices. No-tillage and direct seeding (NTDS) is a simplified cultivation technology that greatly simplifies both land preparation and crop establishment. Aiming to determine the <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> performance of super hybrid rice under NTDS and to identify critical factors that determine <b>grain</b> <b>yield,</b> field experiments were conducted in Nanxian, Hunan Province, China in 2009 and 2010. Two super hybrid cultivars, Liangyoupeijiu and Y-liangyou 1, were grown under conventional tillage and transplanting (CTTP) and NTDS. <b>Grain</b> <b>yield,</b> yield components, biomass production, crop growth rate and biomass accumulation during sowing to heading (HD) and HD to maturity were measured for each cultivar. There was no difference in <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> under NTDS and CTTP. However, <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> differed with cultivar and year. Y-liangyou 1 produced 4 % higher <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> than Liangyoupeijiu in 2009, whereas in 2010 both cultivars <b>yielded</b> similarly. <b>Grain</b> <b>yields</b> of both cultivars were higher in 2009 than in 2010.

The <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> of bread wheat in dryland condition depended {{on the effect of}} plant height, days to maturity, agronomic score and 1000 kernel weight, whereas in supplemental irrigation was mainly related to plant height, spike length, 1000 kernel weight and test weight. The influence of 1000 kernel weight on <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> in both environments seems to cause from the fact that <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> in wheat is frequently the sink limited, and for this reason, the 1000 kernel weight has been reported as a promising trait for increasing <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> in wheat under different conditions. The nearly equal value of correlation and path coefficients of plant height and <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> showed plant height had positive and direct effect on <b>grain</b> <b>yield,</b> in both conditions and suggesting a criteria trait for improving of <b>grain</b> <b>yield.</b> The results showed that genotype 12 (CS/TH.

40|$|Corn (Zea mays L.) <b>grain</b> <b>yields</b> {{are known}} to vary from plant to plant, but the extent of this {{variability}} {{across a range of}} environments has not been evaluated. This study was initiated to evaluate by-plant corn <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> variability over a range of production environments and to establish the relationships among mean <b>grain</b> <b>yield,</b> standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and yield range. A total of forty-six 8 - to 30 -m corn transects were harvested by plant in Argentina, Mexico, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Virginia, and Oklahoma from 2002 to 2004. By-plant corn <b>grain</b> <b>yields</b> were determined, and the average individual plant yields were calculated. Over all sites in all countries and states, plant-to-plant variation in corn <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> averaged 2765 kg ha- 1 (44. 1 bu ac- 1). At the sites with the highest average corn <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> (11 478 and 14 383 kg ha- 1, Parana Argentina, and Phillips, NE), average plant-to-plant variation in yield was 4211 kg ha- 1 (67 bu ac- 1) and 2926 kg ha- 1 (47 bu ac- 1), respectively. As average <b>grain</b> <b>yields</b> increased, so did the standard deviation of the yields obtained within each row. Furthermore, the yield range (maximum corn <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> minus the minimum corn <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> per row) was found to increase with increasing yield level. Regardless of yield level, plant-to-plant variability in corn <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> can be expected and averaged more than 2765 kg ha- 1 over sites and years. Averaging yield over distances 3 ̆e 0. 5 m removed the extreme by-plant variability, and thus, the scale for treating other factors affecting yield should be less than 0. 5 m. Methods that homogenize corn plant stands and emergence may decrease plant-to-plant variation and could lead to increased <b>grain</b> <b>yields...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the tropics, maize (Zea mays L.) {{is often}} grown under low N conditions. Information on the {{respective}} role of N uptake and partitioning at anthesis in determining <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> under low N is scarce. Senescence traits have been proposed as secondary traits to select for low N tolerance, but the stability of their association with yield under different environmental conditions has been rarely described. In the present study we analyzed the associations between <b>grain</b> <b>yield,</b> N uptake and partitioning at anthesis, dry matter matter partitioning, and senescence traits during two seaons in QPM (quality protein maize) hybrids. Association between <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> and N uptake at anthesis, when found, was mainly explained by a close relationship between <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> and above-ground biomass. No relationship was found between <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> and N partitioning at anthesis.

Trials were conducted on the experimental field of the Agricultural Institute Osijek during five years (1996 - 2000) and involved 14 soybean cultivars: Kaja, Una, Iva, Ilova, Lika, Drina, Tisa, Vuka, Nada, Podravka 95, Kuna, Ika, Anica, Kruna. All tested cultivars were created in soybean breeding programme at the Agricultural Institute Osijek. Data for <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> were subjected to analysis of variance followed by LSD test. Stability of <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> for each cultivar was estimated by three parameters: regression coefficient (bi), ecovalence (Wi) and portion of genotype x environment variance due to the contribution of each genotype to total variance of genotype x environment interaction (S 2 GxY). Correlations between <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> and stability parameters as well as among stability parameters were calculated. The summarised results indicate significant variation in level and stability of <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> and adaptability of cultivars. Among 14 tested cultivars, six cultivars: Ika, Podravka 95, Anica, Kuna, Tisa and Drina had high and stable <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> and wide-general adaptability. Correlation between <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> and stability parameters has indicated that simultaneous selection on high and stable <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> is possible.

A 12 -yr {{study was conducted to}} determine the effects of tillage system [conventional-till (CT), minimum-till (MT), and no-till (NT) ],N fertilizer rate (34, 67, and 101 kg N ha- 1), and cultivar (Butte 86 and Stoa) on spring wheat yields within a dryland spring wheat (SW) –winter wheat (WW) –sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) (SF) rotation. <b>Grain</b> <b>yield</b> responses varied with tillage system, N fertilizer rate, cultivar, and year as indicated by significant tillage x N rate x year and N rate x cultivar x year interactions. In years with. 260 mm total plant available water (TPAW) but TPAW, NT <b>grain</b> <b>yields</b> were greater than those with CT at the highest N rate, with similar trends <b>at</b> the <b>medium</b> and low N rates. When TPAW exceeded 400 mm, <b>grain</b> <b>yields</b> for CT were generally greater than for NT <b>at</b> the <b>medium</b> N rates. The greatest 12 -yr average <b>grain</b> <b>yield</b> (1727 kg ha- 1) was obtained with NT and application of 101 kg N ha- 1. <b>Grain</b> <b>yields</b> were lowest during years when TPAW was 3 ̆c 300 3 ̆emm, with only small responses to tillage and N treatments.
