5|$|The British Armed Forces use CS gas {{annually}} {{to test their}} CBRN equipment. During initial training they introduce recruits to CS gas by introducing them into a small enclosed space known as a Respirator Testing Facility (RTF) and igniting chemical tablets to induce CS production. After recruits have carried out their CBRN drills, they must remove their respirators so that they <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CS for up to 20 seconds to experience its effects and become confident their respirators work.|$|E
5|$|Artyom {{finds the}} Dark One, a child, but is {{captured}} by {{soldiers of the}} Fourth Reich. Pavel Morozov, a captured Red Line soldier, and Artyom escape through the Metro tunnels and across the devastated surface. When they reach the Red Line, however, Pavel is revealed to be a high-ranking officer; he detains Artyom {{to learn more about}} the Rangers and the Dark One. Artyom escapes and races Pavel's forces to locate the Dark One and Anna, who has been kidnapped by Lesnitsky, an ex-Ranger and Red Line spy. En route, he finds a contingent of Red Line forces massacring the inhabitants of a station, supposedly to contain a mysterious epidemic. It was the Red Line that introduced the virus to the station – weaponized Ebola acquired from the D6 vault by Lesnitsky. Artyom finds Anna and frees her but they <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> virus and are quarantined after rescue. Afraid that she will die, Anna seduces Artyom.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E

5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus {{could not}} be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells {{in order to provide}} increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.|$|E

25|$|A study {{issued in}} 2002 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization {{concluded}} that non-smokers <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same carcinogens {{on account of}} tobacco smoke as active smokers. Sidestream smoke contains 69 known carcinogens, particularly benzopyrene and other polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and radioactive decay products, such as polonium-210. Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in second-hand smoke than in mainstream smoke.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco use leads most {{commonly}} to diseases affecting {{the heart and}} lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), emphysema, and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, esophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer). Cigarette smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease as well as the severity of the course of the disease. It is also the number one cause of bladder cancer. The smoke from tobacco elicits carcinogenic effects on the tissues of the body that <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smoke.|$|E
25|$|Vitiligo is a {{long term}} skin {{condition}} characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. The patches of skin affected become white and usually have sharp margins.

Often the patches begin on areas of skin that <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sun. It is more noticeable in people with dark skin. Vitiligo may result in psychological stress and those affected may be stigmatized.|$|E

It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated tank, which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed with a rubber gasket so that the patient's face (and airway) <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room air.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of a year-long self-imposed investigation in November 2015, Nestlé disclosed that seafood products sourced in Thailand were produced with forced labour. Nestlé is not a major purchaser of seafood in Southeast Asia, but does some business in Thailand – primarily for its Purina cat food. The study found virtually all U.S. and European companies buying seafood from Thailand <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same risks of abuse in their supply chains. This type of disclosure was a surprise to many in the industry because international companies rarely acknowledge abuses in supply chains.|$|E

25|$|In {{almost three}} decades of {{high-speed}} operation, the TGV has not recorded a single passenger fatality due to accidents while running at high speed. There have been several accidents, including three derailments at or above , but in only one of these—a test run on a new line—did carriages overturn. This is credited {{in part to the}} stiffness that the articulated design lends to the train. There have been fatal accidents involving TGVs on lignes classiques, where the trains <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same dangers as normal trains, such as level crossings. These include one terrorist bombing, which could as well have occurred at high speed as not.|$|E
25|$|TSMC and {{the rest}} of the foundry {{industry}} <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities. As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.|$|E
25|$|Wakka {{lost his}} younger brother Chappu to Sin {{a year before the}} events of Final Fantasy X, and he never fully {{recovered}} from it. He forms a close brotherly relationship with Tidus, partially fueled by his resemblance to Chappu, though Lulu constantly has to remind him that Tidus is not Chappu. As a devout follower of Yevon's teachings, Wakka believes that anyone who does not believe in Yevon, like the Al Bhed, are evil heathens, and is staunchly against the use of machina. However, he begins to question both his faith by the time Yevon's true colors <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world. Near the game's ending, Wakka denounces his prior beliefs entirely.|$|E
