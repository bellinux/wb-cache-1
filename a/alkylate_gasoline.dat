50|$|A common {{example of}} a {{catalytic}} reactor is the catalytic converter following an engine. However, most petrochemical reactors are catalytic, and are {{responsible for most of}} industrial chemical production in the world, with extremely high-volume examples such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, reformate/BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) and <b>alkylate</b> <b>gasoline</b> blending stock.|$|E
25|$|When the {{transmission}} of generated wind power to nearby land is not economical, the power {{can be used in}} power to gas applications to produce hydrogen gas, ammonia / urea, reverse osmosis water desalination, natural gas, LPG, <b>alkylate</b> / <b>gasoline,</b> etc. on floating platforms which can be easily transported to nearby consuming centres.|$|R
2500|$|Alkylate is a {{component}} of choice in gasoline, because it is free of aromatics and olefins. About 11% of the gasoline winter pool in the U.S. {{is made up of}} <b>alkylate.</b> In the <b>gasoline</b> summer pool, the content of alkylate can be as high as 15% because lower RVP reduces the possibility to blend butane.|$|R
50|$|The {{word root}} alkyl is {{encountered}} in several contexts. Alkylation {{is an important}} operation in refineries, for example {{in the production of}} high-octane <b>gasoline.</b> <b>Alkylating</b> antineoplastic agents refer to a class of compounds that are used to treat cancer. In such case, the term alkyl is used loosely. For example, nitrogen mustards are well-known alkylating agents, but they are more complex than a mere hydrocarbon. In chemistry, alkyl refers to a group, a substituent, that is attached to other molecular fragments. For example, alkyl lithium reagents have the empirical formula Li(alkyl), where alkyl = methyl, ethyl, etc. A dialkyl ether is an ether with two alkyl groups, e.g., diethyl ether (O(C2H5)2).|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} of three major gasoline blending components (reformate, <b>alkylate</b> and cracked <b>gasoline)</b> to potential environmental impacts (PEI) are assessed. This study estimates losses of the gasoline blending components due to evaporation and leaks through their life cycle, from petroleum refining to vehicle refuelling. A sensitivity analysis {{is performed using}} different weighting factors for each potential environmental impact category, {{in order to assess}} the effect of each blending component on the total potential environmental impacts. The results indicate that reformate and cracked gasoline mainly contribute to photochemical oxidation followed by aquatic toxicity, terrestrial toxicity and human toxicity by ingestion. On the other hand, alkylate contributes mostly to aquatic toxicity but very little to photochemical oxidation. From the sensitivity analysis, a high weighting on the impact categories for aquatic toxicity, terrestrial toxicity and human toxicity by ingestion leads to alkylate having the largest potential impacts of the three blending components, whereas other combinations of weighting factors indicate that alkylate has the lowest potential impacts...|$|R
40|$|Le surplus de butadiène {{au niveau}} mondial {{contraint}} les pétrochimistes à recycler la coupe C 4 au vapocraqueur. De plus en plus, le butadiène est hydrogéné avant de recraquer toute la coupe. Une fois hydrogénée, cette coupe peut être beaucoup mieux valorisée, soit en MTBE avec isomérisation des n-butènes (procédé ISO- 4), soit en propylène et MTBE en utilisant le procédé META- 4. L'étude technico-économique montre que cette dernière voie offre la meilleure rentabilité (TRI = 21, 5 %). Si le vapocraqueur est intégré à une raffinerie, les butènes peuvent également être transformés en alkylats ou en MTBE, pour répondre à une demande en octane ou en oxygénés pour les carburants. Ces diverses voies de valorisation sont plus intéressantes que la production de MTBE à partir des butanes via la déshydrogénation de l'isobutane ou que la production du propylène par déshydrogénation du propane. Une étude de sensibilité aux différents prix des produits envisagés permet d'établir des courbes d'isorentabilités, délimitant des zones de prix favorables à l'un ou l'autre des produits, pris deux à deux. The {{evolution of the}} outlets for C 4 cuts from steam cracking shows quite contradictory results. On one hand, European and Asian petrochemists are more constrained to recycle this type of effluent, which contains butadiene and isobutene, to the steam cracker. Likewise, the demand for isobutene for MTBE production is such {{that it has to}} be produced by the dehydrogenation of isobutane. This situation is effectively caused by the surplus of butadiene, a by-product of ethylene, and for which the demand is not increasing as fast as the demand for ethylene. To improve cracking performances during the recycling of the C 4 Cut, butadiene is more and more selectively hydrogenated. Under these conditions, rather than cracking it, the new processes could make it possible to better upgrade it. Indeed, after selective hydrogenation, most of the cut can be transformed into MTBE by implementing the new n-butene isomerization process. Another upgrading scheme consits in transforming isobutene into MTBE and n-butenes into propylene by metathesis with ethylene. These new route may find competition in the transformation of butenes into <b>alkylates,</b> for automotive <b>gasoline,</b> with or without MTBE production. After a brief review of the different markets for the products involved, a technico-economic study serves to classify the different upgrading routes of the C 4 cut from steam cracking, by comparing both the minimum profitable selling prices for a discounting rate of 12 % and the discounted cash-flow rate of return for fixed selling prices. Calculations are performed within a context in which the C 4 cut is devalorized in relation to naphtha with a price of $ 152 /t. When butadiene no longer finds any outlets, and when its price is at a very low level such as $ 270 /t, its extraction is hardly profitable, and propylene production by methatesis proves to be more advantageous. However, if the steam cracker is integrated in a refinery, butenes may also be advantageously transformed into alkylates or MTBE, more especially to meet a demand for octane or oxygenated products for fuels. These different routes for upgrading MTBE are more advantageous than MTBE production from butanes, requiring heavy investments for the separation of butanes, the isomerization of n-butane and the dehydrogenation of isobutane. Likewise, the transformation of butenes into propylene is more profitable than obtaining propylene by the dehydrogenation of proprane. A sensitivity study, for the price of butadiene and also for the price of other products, enables isoprofitability curves to be plotted, which delimite price zones favorable to one or the other of the products considered, taken two by two...|$|R
