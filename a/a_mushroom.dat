It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. It has been the subject of much research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is α-amanitin, which damages the liver and kidneys, causing hepatic and renal failure that can be fatal.|$|E

5|$|Use of this {{mushroom}} as a {{food source}} also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of A.muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into <b>a</b> <b>mushroom</b> sauce for steak. It is also consumed {{as a food}} in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} {{the toxic}} heavy metal arsenic {{from the soil}} {{in the form of}} the compound methylarsonic acid. Although less toxic than arsenic trioxide, it is still relatively dangerous. Concentrations over 1000mg/kg (dry weight) are often reached. As reported in one 2004 publication, a mature specimen collected near the town of Český Šternberk in the Czech Republic was found to have an arsenic content of 7090mg/kg dry weight, the highest concentration ever reported in <b>a</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Typically, the arsenic content of mycorrhizal mushrooms collected from unpolluted areas is lower than 1mg/kg. In a 2007 Turkish study of 23 wild edible mushroom species (collected from areas not known to be polluted), S.coronaria had the highest concentration of arsenic at 8.8mg/kg dry weight, while the arsenic concentration of the other tested mushrooms ranged from 0.003mg/kg (in Sarcodon leucopus) to 0.54mg/kg (in Lactarius salmonicolor).|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} forms in North America {{that tend to}} intergrade with A.pantherina. In 2005, mycologist Rod Tulloss described Amanita aprica, a species that has been confused with A.gemmata {{several times in the}} past. According to mycologists Pierre Neville and Serge Poumarat, the Mediterranean species A.amici (synonymous with A.gemmata f. amici) is similar in appearance to A.gemmata but is larger. According to Tulloss however, their measurements of the cap and stem dimensions of A.amici fell within the range expected for A.gemmata, and for this reason, the two taxa should be considered conspecific. Neville and Poumarat suggest that the name A.gemmata still persists for Mediterranean collections because of its frequent historical misapplication to the native Italian species A.gioiosa, which had not been described as a distinct species until 2004. A.orientigemmata, <b>a</b> <b>mushroom</b> ranging from Japan to China, is a lookalike, but has clamps, unlike A.gemmata. Other differences between the two species include the slightly smaller spores of A.orientigemmata, and differences in the microstructure of the cap warts.|$|E

5|$|Boletellus ananas, {{commonly}} known as the pineapple bolete, is <b>a</b> <b>mushroom</b> in the family Boletaceae, and the type species of the genus Boletellus. It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, often at the base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the cap that are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface {{on the underside of the}} cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages to a deep olive-brown color. Microscopically, B.ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross striae on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae and flesh of the stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is not recommended for consumption.|$|E
