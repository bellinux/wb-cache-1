5|$|Jack {{eventually}} married Polly in 1915, {{after they}} had moved to Elmore Street, Everton. One of the witnesses at the wedding was Polly's sister, Catherine Seddon. Daughter Edith Lennon was born that year and then Charles (21 November 1918 – 26 May 2002). The Lennons moved back to Toxteth Park, and Jack died in 1921, at 57 Copperfield Street. He was buried on 6th August 1921 at Allerton Cemetery. His grave, number 206 in Roman Catholic section 4, is an unmarked public grave. Polly could not read or write, but {{was reported to be}} very humorous and supposedly had psychic abilities. After Jack died, Polly did not have enough money to keep the whole Lennon family together, so she placed two of her children, Alf and Edith, in the Blue Coat School Orphanage.

5000|$|The Trueheart House is an {{approximately}} [...] Queen Anne style residence sitting atop {{a foundation}} and support walls made of native stone with sand and lime mortar upholding 18 inch cm double-brick plastered adobe walls which hold deep openings for imported milled wood-frame doors, windows, and roofing. Two chimneys vent four fireplaces within the house. The eastward-facing frontal facade features a northeast bedroom extending {{outward from the}} rest of the home's interior. At <b>the</b> southeast <b>corner</b> of <b>the</b> home is a circular balcony above a round exterior turret. The balcony extends into a central veranda ending at the wall of the northeast bedroom, accessed by a stairway directly across from the main entrance to the house from a sidewalk across the front lawn accessed from an additional stairway leading <b>from</b> <b>the</b> street. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of <b>from</b> <b>the</b> veranda on the circular balcony, a stairway descends nearly 8 ft to a stone patio between the house and the porte-cochère, which itself has steps leading to the drive. A series of planters behind a stone retaining wall extend from the porte-cochère to <b>the</b> southwest <b>corner</b> of <b>the</b> house. The veranda is elevated 6 - 8 ft above the ground due to the slope of the surrounding property. The front roofing features a gable over the northeast bedroom, a larger gable over the veranda, and a conical, shingled [...] "Chinese" [...] cupola over the turret. The back of the house features a stone porch outside the kitchen with doorways to the kitchen and northwest bedroom as well as steps leading to ground level on the south beyond the boulder field.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} promise of that Open Educational Resources (OER) would democratise access to {{education}} and ennui of many within the movement as the revolution is always just <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> It develops <b>from</b> earlier work which asked whether OER is a challenge to, or a product of, neoliberalism within education, which questioned the reification of the self in OER and the focus on particular types of content which seemed to create open education {{in the image of}} the academy. The paper uses the idea of digital labour to explore digital inclusion, who does digital labour, who has the skills to perform digital labour and who and how do people benefit from digital labour. It suggests seeing education as an exchange of labour and reward makes visible the hidden aspects of work, in particular it highlights the skills required to do education as digital labour and the unequal access and distribution of those skills contributes to unequal access to education, even when it is freely available and openly licensed online. Uncovering the hidden tariff within OER allows us to see where and how might address these inequities. In particular how we can learn from older traditions of open education which see it as a common good.

40|$|We {{present a}} minimal {{left-right}} dark matter framework that can simultaneously explain the recently observed 3. 55 keV X-ray line from several galaxy clusters and gauge coupling unification at high energy scale. Adopting a minimal dark matter strategy, we consider both {{left and right}} handed triplet fermionic dark matter candidates which are stable by virtue of a remnant Z_ 2 ≃ (- 1) ^B-L symmetry arising after the spontaneous symmetry breaking of left-right gauge symmetry {{to that of the}} standard model. A scalar bitriplet field is incorporated whose first role is to allow radiative decay of right handed triplet dark matter into the left handed one and a photon with energy 3. 55 keV. The other role this bitriplet field at TeV scale plays is to assist in achieving gauge coupling unification at a high energy scale within a non-supersymmetric SO(10) model while keeping the scale of left-right gauge symmetry <b>around</b> <b>the</b> TeV <b>corner.</b> Apart <b>from</b> solving <b>the</b> neutrino mass problem and giving verifiable new contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay and charged lepton flavour violation, the model with TeV scale gauge bosons can also give rise to interesting collider signatures like diboson excess, dilepton plus two jets excess reported recently in the large hadron collider data.

40|$|Modern {{power systems}} {{worldwide}} {{are facing a}} rising appeal for the upgrade to a highly intelligent generation of electricity networks {{commonly known as the}} Smart Grid. Advanced monitoring and control systems like Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems have been widely deployed and management based on them provides more exible and achievable optimal control of power generation, transmission and distribution. However, the growing integration of power system with communication networks also brings increasing challenges to the security of the modern power grid, from both cyber and physical space. Malicious attackers {{can take advantage of the}} increased access to the monitoring and control of the system and exploit some of the inherent structural vulnerability of power grids. Motivated by these security challenges, the goal of this thesis is to facilitate the understanding of power grid outages and blackouts triggered by these attacks, to analyze the cascading process that leads to the impactful events, and to support the decision making in defense and protection for a reliable and secure Smart Grid <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> Simulation results <b>from</b> real-world power system benchmarks have been analytically discussed from both the spatial and temporal perspectives and important decision-support information have been revealed through several chapters of the thesis.

His property included a stable with two horses and some cows. He grew mulberry trees, a widower acted as his housekeeper and cook, and her son-in-law worked as his gardener. Greenleaf also owned a small farm of perhaps an acre or less situated at 6th Street and Virginia Avenue SW.

The house sheltered Major General William Tecumseh Sherman and some of his officers after the Second Battle of Bull Run in 1862. It was razed around 1870.|$|E
25|$|At that time, the Wicking Library was the school's newest wing. The {{library in}} the parking lot did not satisfy {{educators}} who thought that a library could be the center of instructional activity. In addition, many classrooms in the school needed upgrading and the music facilities were poor. The plan to solve these problems showed a small addition on the left, a new hallway across the rear of the plant, and rooms surrounding the library. The music department would get two big practice rooms and a classroom. A large two-story structure was planned to surround the library. When the plans were revealed, everyone was happy that the definitely modern building would be <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> the traditional Georgian Facade.
