5|$|Saudi Arabia {{uses the}} bench trial system. Its courts observe few formalities. The country's first {{criminal}} procedure code {{was introduced in}} 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from Egyptian and French law. Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that judges were either ignorant of the criminal procedure code or were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> but routinely ignored the code.|$|E
5|$|Lody's {{controllers}} realised {{that his}} mission {{was not going}} according to plan and attempted {{to get in touch}} with him to provide assistance. A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, but he never collected it, and may never have been <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E

50|$|When Western Approaches Command became <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Leuthen, <b>it</b> {{was decided}} to {{reinforce}} ONS 18; the following convoy, ON 202 was ordered to close up, and a support group, SG 9, sent to join.|$|R
5|$|Some {{truck drivers}} {{have used the}} pass despite the prohibition. They are {{generally}} either unaware of the restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices, or <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and willing to risk the fine {{for the sake of}} the time and distance saved. The resulting accidents have forced the closure of the pass. CDOT has put in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction. Aspen officials have suggested the fines be increased as well.|$|E
5|$|While {{married to}} Hayfron, in 1987 Mugabe began an extra-marital affair with his secretary, Grace Marufu; she was 41 {{years his junior}} {{and at the time}} was married to Stanley Goreraza. In 1988 she bore Mugabe a daughter, Bona, and in 1990 a son, Robert. The {{relationship}} was kept secret from the Zimbabwean public, although Hayfron was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, the Alsos Mission reached Algiers, where Pash {{reported}} to the Chief of Staff at Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ), Major General Walter B. Smith, and his British Chief of Intelligence, Brigadier Kenneth Strong. This was awkward as Pash's instructions were not to give the British information about the Alsos Mission, {{but it turned out}} that Strong was already fully <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It was arranged that Pash would deal with Strong's American deputy, Colonel Thomas E. Roderick. The Alsos Mission then moved on to Italy, where it was assigned to Major General Kenyon A. Joyce's Allied Control Commission. Pash met with Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio, the man who had negotiated Italy's surrender to the Allies, and was now head of the Italian Provisional Military Government, who gave him a letter of introduction addressed to Italian civil and military authorities.|$|E
5000|$|In psychology, {{apprehension}} (Lat. ad, [...] "to"; prehendere, [...] "to seize") {{is a term}} {{applied to}} a model of consciousness in which nothing is affirmed or denied of the object in question, but the mind is merely <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> ("seizes") <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|Specific {{knowledge}} of the application's code/internal structure and programming knowledge in general is not required. The tester is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what the software {{is supposed to do}} but is not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how <b>it</b> does it. For instance, the tester is aware that a particular input returns a certain, invariable output but is not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how the software produces the output in the first place.|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s Utopia became {{well known}} for the design and {{production}} of batiks. By 1981 there were 50artists at Utopia creating batik works; 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. Although several sources comment that artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and only later moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests {{that she did not}} participate in the making of batik, but she was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|The friends, {{followers}} of the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, were self-taught mathematical astronomers who had worked methodically to correct and improve Kepler's Rudolphine tables by observation and measurement. In 1639, Horrocks was the only astronomer to realise that a transit of Venus was imminent; others became <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> only after the event when Horrocks's report of it was circulated. Although the friends both died within five years of making their observations, their ground-breaking work was influential in establishing {{the size of the}} Solar System; for this and their other achievements Horrocks and Crabtree, along with their correspondent William Gascoigne, are considered to be the founding fathers of British research astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Although The Landlord's Game was patented, {{and some}} hand-made boards were made, {{it was not}} {{actually}} manufactured and published until 1906. Magie and two other Georgists established the Economic Game Company of New York, which began publishing her game. Magie submitted an edition published by the Economic Game Company to Parker Brothers around 1910, which George Parker declined to publish. In the UK, {{it was published in}} 1913 by the Newbie Game Company under the title Brer Fox an' Brer Rabbit. Shortly after the game's formal publication, Scott Nearing, a professor in what was then known as the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, began using the game as a teaching tool in his classes. His students made their own boards, and taught the game to others. After Nearing was dismissed from the Wharton School, he began teaching at the University of Toledo. A former student of Nearing, Rexford Guy Tugwell, also taught The Landlord's Game at Wharton, and took it with him to Columbia University. Apart from commercial distribution, it spread by word of mouth and was played in slightly variant homemade versions over the years by Quakers, Georgists, university students (including students at Smith College, Princeton, and MIT), and others who became <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Leger {{looked at}} him in astonishment. [...] "I'm not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> having done <b>it,</b> but if it pleases him to come there why shouldn't he?" ...|$|R
60|$|Alec {{started at}} the sound of his mocking. He seemed again to become <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> himself. <b>It</b> was {{interesting}} to observe the quite visible effort he made to regain his self-control. In a moment he had mastered his excitement, and he turned to Dick with studied nonchalance.|$|R

5|$|Anderton and Agatha go to Crow's {{hotel room}} as the 36-hour time nears, finding {{numerous}} photos of children, including Sean's. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him of being a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him {{that he has the}} ability to choose his future now that he is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Crow however begs to be killed, having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family's financial well being. Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger, killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha's drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha, but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively's existence and her connection to Agatha.|$|E
5|$|Areobindus {{was murdered}} by Guntharic, but Artabanes secured {{guarantees}} of his safety and pledged himself to Guntharic's service. In secret, however, he began planning to overthrow him. Soon after, Artabanes was entrusted, alongside John and Ulitheus, with an expedition against Antalas's Moors. He marched south, along with an allied Moorish contingent under Cutzinas. Antalas's men fled before him, but Artabanes did not pursue them and turned back. According to Procopius, he considered leading his men to join the loyalist imperial garrison that held out at Hadrumetum under Marcentius, but {{decided to return to}} Carthage and go on with his plan to assassinate Guntharic. Artabanes kept his plan in absolute secrecy for a long time, confiding only with his two closest Armenian friends: even his Armenian unit of hand-picked and completely loyal veteran soldiers was not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> until the very last moment. Such a perfect concealment was achieved, not least thanks to the fact that during both planning and implementation stages of this assassination the communication between the exclusively Armenian conspirators was in their mother tongue, an incomprehensible language for other ethnic elements of the imperial army in Africa.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, {{during the}} second phase of Case White, Lukačević and his Chetniks jointly held the town of Konjic on the Neretva river {{alongside}} Italian troops. After being reinforced by German and NDH troops and some additional Chetniks, the combined force held the town against concerted attacks by the Partisans over a seven-day period. The first attack was launched by two battalions of the 1st Proletarian Division on 19 February and was followed by repeated attacks by the 3rd Assault Division between 22 and 26 February. Unable to capture the town and its critical bridge across the Neretva, the Partisans eventually crossed the river downstream at Jablanica. Ostojić was aware of Lukačević's collaboration with the Germans and NDH troops at Konjic but, at his trial, Mihailović denied that he himself was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> claiming that Ostojić controlled the communications links and kept the information from him. During the fighting at Konjic, the Germans also supplied Lukačević's troops with ammunition. Both Ostojić and Lukačević were highly critical of what they described as Mihailović's bold but reckless tactics during Case White, indicating that Mihailović was largely responsible for the Chetnik failure to hold the Partisans at the Neretva.|$|E

5|$|On Sunday 20May in {{the well-to-do}} Strand {{district}} of London, Catesby met Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy and Guy Fawkes, at an inn called the Duck and Drake. Percy {{had been introduced}} to the plot several weeks after Wintour and Fawkes's return to England. Alone in a private room, all swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book, and then in another room celebrated Mass with the Jesuit priest (and friend to Catesby) John Gerard. Robert Keyes {{was admitted to the}} group in October 1604, and was charged with looking after Catesby's Lambeth house, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored. Two months later Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and by March 1605 three more were admitted: Thomas Wintour's brother Robert, John Grant and John Wright's brother Christopher.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} malapportionment {{had grown to}} a level in excess of 3:1 in favour of rural areas, and Hall, having won the 1968 state {{election}} on 46 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote, committed himself to a fairer electoral system. Previously 39 members were elected: 13 from metropolitan Adelaide and 26 from the country. Hall's first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from the country; this proposal received scorn from both Labor and the rural councillors, and was seen as not going far enough by the former and going too far by the latter. A second proposal, for 47 seats with 19 in the country, was adopted with bipartisan support in the House of Assembly, but encountered opposition in the Legislative Council. The new system would make an LCL win near-impossible at the coming 1970 state election, and Hall and the LCL were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> For his weakening of rural constituencies, Hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of the previous system. Hall saw the political situation as untenable and felt the LCL needed reform {{to cope with the}} removal of an artificial situation.|$|E

50|$|As of Turn Coat, Ebenezar McCoy {{has begun}} forming a Grey Council, members {{of which are}} wizards and non-wizards whose {{identity}} only McCoy is <b>aware</b> <b>of.</b> <b>Its</b> formation {{is a response to}} the Black Council, which secretly exists within the magical community, and its intention is to be an even more secret council. Of the thirteen members, only three are known as of Changes: Harry Dresden, the current Winter Knight; Ebenezar McCoy, current Blackstaff; and Donar Vadderung, (a current identity of the Norse god Odin), CEO of Monoc Securities. Due to her involvement in Changes, it is highly likely that the Leanansidhe is, if not a member of this Council, a willing ally.|$|R
5000|$|A {{rock concert}} is [...] "kicking television." [...] If you're {{out of the}} house and with a bunch of people enjoying {{something}} together, that's kicking television to me.
