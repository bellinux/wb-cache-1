40|$|ABSTARCT Fatigue {{experiments}} with funneled-shape specimens of 2 A 12 -T 4 aluminum alloy {{were carried out}} to study the multi-axial high-cycle fatigue failure behavior under torsion loading. The torsion S-N curves under different mean shear stress were obtained, including mean shear stressτm= 0 MPa, 25 MPa, 50 MPa, 75 MPa, 100 MPa. Experiment results showed fatigue life under the same shear stress amplitude reduced gradually {{with the increase of}} mean shear stress. However, the reduction of fatigue life when mean shear stressτm= 75 MPa andτm= 100 MPa was not obvious. The micro analysis of specimen fracture appearance was conducted in order to obtain the fracture characteristics under torsion fatigue loading. Fatigue crack initiated in specimen surface and there are clear source region, extension region and final region in the fracture appearance.

40|$|Abstract. Fuel rods {{in nuclear}} power plants, made of Zr-alloy is {{immersed}} in pure water, and surging of this coolant causes fretting for the rods and spacer. In this paper fretting wear and fretting corrosion {{test of the}} Zr-alloy against Al 2 O 3 placed respectively in air, pure water and Na 2 SO 4 solution is carried out. The lost volume is measured with 3 D Measuring instruments andthe relationship between the fresh surface fretting wear produces and lost surface is evaluated with the potential pulse method. The result shows that the fresh surfacing area is smaller than <b>abrasion</b> <b>mark</b> area, and bigger than actual contact area. The wear extent of Zr-alloy against Al 2 O 3 in Na 2 SO 4 solution is ten times higher than that in air and pure water, but the coefficient of friction is smaller. The wear extent of Zr- alloy against Al 2 O 3 in pure water {{is equal to the}} numeric value of the Zr-alloy against Al 2 O 3 in Na 2 SO 4 solution given the- 2000 mv potential. When Zr-alloy is in corrosion environment, the wear extent increases in proportion to the increase of the potential, and the fretting wear and fretting corrosion result from mainly electrochemical action...|$|E

40|$|The study {{presents}} the experimental investigation of surface grinding of superalloy Inconel 718. The grinding performance {{in terms of}} grinding force, surface roughness and surface topography were examined by conducting statistical experiments. The parameters that have been chosen as control factors are: table speed, infeed, grit size {{and the type of}} lubricant. An L 27 orthogonal array experiments were conducted. The results show that the grit size and infeed are the most significant parameters on surface roughness Ra measured across the table feed direction. The interaction effect between lubricant and grit size is relatively important as compared to the individual effect of the latter variable. As far as the grinding forces are concerned, the grit size and table speed have largest contribution among the chosen parameters.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess - using {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM) - the effectiveness of two abrasive discs, one made from silicon and one from aluminum oxide, in removing adhesive remnants (AR) after debonding orthodontic brackets. METHODS: Ten randomly selected bovine teeth were used, i. e., 2 in the control group, and the other 8 divided into two groups, which had orthodontic brackets bonded to their surface with Concise Orthodontic Adhesive (3 M). The following methods were employed - in one single step - to remove AR after debracketing: Group A, Optimize discs (TDV) and Group B, Onegloss discs (Shofu), used at low speed. After removing the AR with the aforementioned methods, the teeth were prepared to undergo SEM analysis, and photographs were taken of the enamel surface with 50 x magnification. Six examiners evaluated the photographs applying the Zachrisson and Årtun enamel surface index (ESI) system (1979). RESULTS: Group A exhibited minor scratches on the enamel surface as well as some AR in some of the photographs, while Group B showed a smoother surface, little or no AR and some <b>abrasion</b> <b>marks</b> in the photographs. No statistically significant differences were found between the two methods and the control group.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{performance}} of hosiery made from a new fiber, polypropylene, with the performance of hosiery made from a better known fiber, nylon, and to get some indication of consumer reaction to a new textile product. Information was obtained through two wear tests and selected laboratory tests using different brands of hosiery with both fiber types represented. Two questionnaires were used as part of the wear tests. The first obtained information about the subjects and about some of their opinions concerning hosiery wear in general. The second questionnaire obtained information about the subjects' opinions concerning the hosiery worn in the wear tests. Thirty subjects participated in the first wear test with each wearing one pair of hosiery made of each fiber. Ten subjects participated in the second wear test, six of whom had also been part of the first test. The performance of the hosiery was checked by considering the number, severity and position of faults which occurred in relation to the number of days worn and by measuring to find the amount of stretch found in the worn hosiery. Laboratory tests were conducted to verify certain information obtained about the hosiery during the wear tests as well as to obtain further information about the hosiery. The questionnaires were analyzed by using percentages of the number responding to each part of each question. In this way, a general picture of the majority could be made to find out something about the subjects as a group and about their opinions of the hosiery. The wear life of the hosiery as shown by the number of days worn was related to the number of total faults found in the test hosiery. In addition, each type of fault, snags, runs, and <b>abrasion</b> <b>marks,</b> was considered. The two fiber types of hosiery were compared by testing to find if the differences between means were significant using F ratios. An additional check was made for covariance between the number of runs and the total days worn, and between the number of <b>abrasion</b> <b>marks</b> and the total days worn. All hosiery increased in width and decreased in length during the wear periods. The average amounts of dimensional change were analyzed by comparing the mean differences of the two fiber types of hosiery. The results were verified in the laboratory using a stretch and recovery test under controlled conditions. The differences in the means found in the laboratory test were checked for significance using F ratios. The rates of recovery were plotted on a time graph. An evaluation of the degree of fading was made by a panel of judges using a ranking system. The amount of, and the deviation from linear regression was found. Hosiery of both fiber types were washed in the laboratory and used as control groups to check with hosiery worn and washed by the subjects. Four laboratory tests were conducted to help describe the hosiery used in the study and to supply further information as to the differences in performance of hosiery made of polypropylene and of nylon. The yarn numbers and the course and wale counts were found. Yarn breaking strengths and the percents of elongation were analyzed by using a t test. Standard deviations checked the amounts of variation from the means. The same types of analyses were done to compare the two fiber types of hosiery as to the differences found in the bursting strengths of the knee and toe areas of the hosiery. In addition the F ratios were also found...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare torsional strength, distortion angle, and toughness of various nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary files. Methods: Five NiTi rotary instruments with different cross-sectional geometries were selected: TF and RaCe with equilateral triangle, ProTaper with convex-triangle, ProFile with U-shape, and Mtwo with S-shape. The size 25 /. 06 taper of TF, RaCe, ProFile, and Mtwo and the ProTaper F 1 files were tested, all with the same diameter at D 5. A metal mounting block with a cubical hole was constructed in which 5 mm of the file tip was rigidly held in place by filling the mold with a resin composite. The files were subjected to clockwise rotation at 2 rpm in a torsion tester. The torque and angular distortion were monitored until the file failed. The data were compared statistically for the yield and ultimate strengths, plastic hardening period, and toughness. Results: TF and RaCe had significantly lower yield strength than other systems. TF had a significantly lower ultimate strength than other files, whereas Mtwo showed the greatest. ProFile showed the highest distortion angle at break, followed by TF. ProFile also showed the highest toughness value, whereas TF and RaCe both showed a lower toughness value than the others (P <. 05). Fractographic examination revealed typical pattern of torsional fracture for all brands, characterized by circular <b>abrasion</b> <b>marks</b> and skewed dimples near the center of rotation. Conclusions: Under the limitations of the present study, the 5 tested NiTi rotary files showed a similar mechanical behavior under torsional load, with a period of plastic deformation before actual torsional breakage but with unequal strength and toughness value.

40|$|Introduction: The cyclic fatigue of nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary {{instruments}} {{has been studied}} extensively, {{but there is little}} information available on torsional fracture. Moreover, a clinical repeated locking effect was not considered in previous studies that evaluated torsional resistance of NiTi instruments. Thus, this study was aimed to compare the repetitive torsional resistance of various NiTi instruments with clinical relevance. Materials and Methods: Five brands of NiTi {{rotary instruments}} were selected: Twisted File (TF; SybronEndo, Orange, CA) and RaCe systems (FKG Dentaire, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland), both with an equilateral triangular cross-section, and the ProTaper (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaignes, Switzerland), Helix (DiaDent, Chongju, Korea), and FlexMaster (VDW, Munchen, Germany), which had a convex triangular cross-section. Five millimeters of the tip of each file was embedded in composite resin block, and uniform torsional stresses (300 rpm, 1. 0 N. cm) were applied repetitively by an endodontic motor with auto-stop mode until the file succumbed to torsional failure. The number of load applications leading to fracture was recorded. All fracture surfaces were examined under the SEM. Results were analyzed nonparametrically with α = 0. 05. Results: Under the mode of load applications in this study, TF had the lowest and FlexMaster the highest torsional resistance among the groups (p < 0. 05). Scanning electron microscopy examination revealed a typical pattern of torsional fracture for TF, RaCe, and ProTaper that was characterized by circular <b>abrasion</b> <b>marks</b> and skewed dimples near the center of rotation. In addition to these marks, Helix and FlexMaster presented a rough, torn-off appearance. Conclusion: It was concluded that files of same cross-sectional design may exhibit different resistance to fracture probably {{as a result of the}} manufacturing process. © 2010 American Association of Endodontists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber {{elastomers}} {{are widely}} used in seal and tire industries. Physiochemical, surface and tribological properties of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exposed to a lubricant in a sealed mechanical contact may gradually change, in particular, at elevated temperatures. In this study, industrial-grade acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber elastomers were aged in two model non-additivated base oils, namely non-polar hexadecane and polar diethylene glycol dibutyl ether at both ambient (298 [*]K) and elevated (398 [*]K) temperatures from 1 to 168 [*]h. Mass changes of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber before and after ageing indicated that acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber had distinct ageing dynamics in different model base oils and at different temperatures. For acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in nonpolar hexadecane, the rate of weight loss of the rubber was larger at 398 [*]K compared to that at 298 [*]K. On the contrary, distinct weight-gaining (swelling) dynamics were observed for acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in polar diethylene glycol dibutyl ether at 298 and 398 [*]K. Based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, liquid and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses, {{it was found that}} aldehydes and sulfur- and zinc-containing compounds were leached out from acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in both hexadecane and diethylene glycol dibutyl ether. The results of tribological studies showed that the non-aged acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has a good wear-resistance. Acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber samples had a very similar surface topography before and after tribo-tests. However, the worn surfaces of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber samples were characterized by fine scoring (<b>abrasion)</b> <b>marks</b> after ageing in both model base oils. This has been attributed to changes in the steel–rubber contact environment during the sliding process and degradation of mechanical properties of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber after ageing.

40|$|Microtextures in quartz {{attributed}} to aeolian transport, principally bulbous edges and abrasion fatigue have seldom {{been tested in}} the laboratory under controlled conditions. A wind tunnel experiment was conducted, using glass spheres (> 70 % SiO 2) {{as a proxy for}} quartz, with the objective of determining the extent of mechanical damage to silica/glass transported in a mixture with quartz beach sand. The microspheres were microscopically imaged prior to transport in a wind tunnel, subjected at velocities ranging from 4 to 13 m/s in sequential runs of 10 min. The range in velocity is capable of lifting grains into the air column or saltating quartz grains and silica/glass spheres to produce mechanical impact, i. e. abrasion commonly experienced in aeolian transport. With increasing velocity silica/glass spheres, which displayed minor imperfections prior to transport, began to show significant grain damage exhibiting increasing depth into the silica/glass fabric – a result of mechanical contact – as well as increasing frequency of craters, dislodged plates and abrasion fatigue. While pits appear earlier in the experiment (8 m/s), dislodged plates and abrasion fatigue need a threshold velocity of near 10 m/s to become more frequent. Bulbous edges on the grain surface, often considered the hallmark of aeolian transport, are not seen in the grain population analyzed, possibly because of the initial near-perfect sphericity of the silica/glass spheres. The experiment proved that aeolian transport throughout short distances and during {{a relatively short period of}} time is enough to imprint significant <b>abrasion</b> <b>marks</b> in microspheres. In fact, the microtextures produced were fresh surfaces, fractures and abrasion that imprinted areas of different sizes.

50|$|Scratches, <b>abrasions,</b> cinch <b>marks</b> {{caused by}} {{rewinding}} a film too tightly, and other blemishes {{are a common}} problem with films that are candidates for restoration. Most of these scratches are in {{the back side of}} the film in the transparent substrate that forms the film base, rather than in the photographic emulsion on the front that holds the film's actual image. In the normal process of duplicating a film in an optical printer, collimated light passes through the film base on its way to illuminate the emulsion. Any scratches, abrasions, etc., in the film base cause the light to bend such that the duplicated film ends up with bright or dark (depending on whether copying from a negative or positive original) copies of the scratches. This bending of the light is being caused by the difference in the refraction index of the substrate and the air.|$|R

40|$|Cette double approche de la {{conservation}} d'assemblages osseux du Pléistocene supérieur de la grotte ouest du Portel met en évidence le rôle prédominant des conditions géochimiques et taphonomiques sur la conservation du fossile et établit un lien entre structure anatomique de l'os et potentiel de conservation des protéines. Les résultats complémentaires obtenus permettent de faire le lien entre les différents modes d'altération osseuse, au-delà de la conservation différentielle classique. The {{study of}} the pleistocene's faunas shows clearly the descremenating charts of the animals skeleton elements. It {{stands to reason that}} the bones conservating procedures act directly on the assemblage representativity. Therefore we choose to joint both methods in conservation study: in one hand, there is the archaeozoological study and in the other hand the biochemical study witch consists in organic material preserved quantification. Both methods procede on a research all along the stratigraphy (fig. 1). Three complexes result of the proteins quantity analysis (tab. 2). Layers F and Fl results individualised clearly and anatomical sampling values obtained are almost similar, in exception of layer F longs bones case (tab. 1). We can generally say that a good correlation exists between the stratigraphy and the protéine study results when we put aside the middle biochemical complex. It's probable that the silly clay and stenl E layer domiciliate above the complex were obstacle of all perturbations which favorised organic matter conservation. The anatomical results show that this well conservation phenomenon is specific for long bones and don't act on other layers. It's difficult to imagine that only geochemical and fossil's age are responsible of this difference. It seems reasonnable to attribuate these phenomena to biological and taphonomical agents intervention (human kind and carnivorous). Transportation frequency (<b>abrasion</b> <b>marks)</b> is more important in upper layers (fig. 2); it prove many perturbations caused by carnivorous. Moreover bone's surface rounded frequency show an important linching that maybe caused by amino acids ruins. Layers from Fl to G (fig. 3) are specially characterized by human occupation (scratches and fracturation impacts). Condition of bones alteration seems to be a specific anthropic action. Horses anatomical samples come from F, F 2 and F 3 layers. We propose a global representation where long bones are most representated in the population than short and plat bones (tab. 1). Bones surronded with flesh are selected by human, whereas carnivorous have involved a diminution the distal extremity of bone, particulary in the F layer. The amino acids' rates which are homogène (fig. 4, 5, 6) from one layer to another confirm the role of taphonomical agents in the bones conservation's process. These results clearly prove that there are several conservations (anatomical, archaeological, paleontological and geochemical). El Fouikar Abderrahamane, Gardeisen Armelle.

40|$|Sojourner rover showing Lewis' wheel {{abrasion}} experiment. The Mars Pathfinder spacecraft soft-landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. Among {{the many}} experiments on its small Sojourner rover are three technology experiments from the NASA Lewis Research Center, including the Wheel Abrasion Experiment (WAE). The WAE was designed, built, delivered, and operated on Mars {{by a team}} of engineers and scientists from Lewis' Photovoltaics and Space Environments Branch. This experiment collected data to assess wheel surface wear on the Sojourner. It used a specially designed rover wheel, with thin films (200 to 1000 angstroms) of aluminum, nickel, and platinum deposited on black, anodized aluminum strips attached to the rover's right center wheel. As the wheel spun in the Martian soil, a photovoltaic sensor monitored changes in film reflectivity. These changes indicated abrasion of the metal films by Martian surface material. Rolling wear data were accumulated by the WAE. Also, at frequent intervals, all the rover wheels, except the WAE test wheel, were locked to hold the rover stationary while the test wheel alone was spun and dug into the Martian regolith. These tests created wear conditions more severe than simple rolling. The WAE will contribute substantially to our knowledge of Martian surface characteristics. <b>Marked</b> <b>abrasion</b> would indicate a surface composed of hard, possibly sharply edged grains, whereas lack of abrasion would suggest a somewhat softer surface. WAE results will be correlated with ground simulations to determine which terrestrial materials behave most like those on Mars. This knowledge will enable a deeper understanding of erosion processes on Mars and the role they play in Martian surface evolution. Preliminary results show that electrostatic charging of the rover wheels sometimes caused dust to accumulate on the WAE wheel, making interpretation of the reflectance data problematic. If electrostatic charging is the mechanism for dust attraction, this indicates that the Martian dust has a size somewhat smaller than 40 microns in diameter. The WAE experiment has detected electrostatic charging in the Martian environment for the first time; however, under conditions when the wheel is relatively clean of Martian dust, flight data now indicate that abrasion has also been detected. Crude limits so far place the hardness of the Martian dust at harder than aluminum but softer than nickel, and place the grain size at somewhat smaller than 40 microns...|$|R
