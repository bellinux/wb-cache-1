In traditional DC control, {{the speed of the}} train is determined by the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> supplied to the rails.

Since the end of the 20th century, an increasing number of enthusiasts have started using digital train control systems to determine the speed and direction of their trains. This has in part been made possible by surface mount technology and new motors that draw very little current (typically 0.2 amps). The most popular digital control systems used in N scale model railways are NMRA-DCC and Selectrix.|$|E
40|$|Voltage {{stabilizers}} {{have only}} been used as an electrical tree retardant in commercial polyolefin high voltage cables to a very small extent. A reason for this could be their lack of solubility {{and in many cases}} limited efficiency. The low solubility has led to migration <b>of</b> the <b>voltage</b> stabilizers from the bulk of the material to evaporate on the surface. However, in this article it will be shown {{that it is possible to}} incorporate small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> stabilizers to increase the resistance to electrical treeing of polyethylene significant and that the stabilizers added to the polymeric matrix will not migrate in any large extent. These properties are crucial to ensure the long term properties of the insulation system.

2500|$|Because of what {{happened}} in Quebec in the winter of 1998, Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie created a De-icing machine to insure that another event like this wouldn't happen again. The De-icer is a [...] machine that runs a high direct current (DC) into a selected transmission line in order to melt the ice on it. However, because the operation in this mode may be very infrequent, when the installation is not being used as a De-icer it is used as a Static Var Compensator, SVC for short, by using the HVDC valves as a Thyristor Controlled Reactor. An innovative design is used, minimizing the power losses of the valves in SVC mode. The reason an AC current wasn't used is because AC current requires a lot of reactive support. It would take a much higher <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>voltage</b> to push the necessary current through the line.The high voltage system in Quebec runs in two transmission corridors, one high voltage system runs in the north-west from the main load centres of Montreal and Quebec and the other runs north-east along the Saint-Lawrence river. It is the latter corridor that is mainly in an area prone to ice storms that deposit ice on the transmission lines.|$|E

In this simulation through the study of Double Gate Tunnel FET, device parameters are studied to meet the requirements of the technological developments. The scaling of large devices is done to fabricate more no. of devices on a single structure. The integration of large devices into small chip provides efficient advantages with a smaller area.
