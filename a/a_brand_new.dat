5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves the creation of <b>a</b> <b>brand</b> <b>new,</b> self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E

Although the depression went into Newark, most {{of the debate over}} localities of stations was basically into the Oranges.

The new station built during the track depression was of similar style, with the station {{in the middle of the}} five-track interlocking, with one platform servicing the Montclair Branch's two tracks and one for the Main Line's two tracks. Rather than crossing at-grade, Roseville Avenue was bridged over the tracks with <b>a</b> <b>brand</b> <b>new</b> street-level interlocking tower present at the intersection of Roseville and Seventh Avenues.|$|E
