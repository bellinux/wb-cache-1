The main {{thoroughfares}} are styled blue, white, pink, yellow, orange, purple and green where street furniture and coloured <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> will be colour-coded to match. A stylised map of the site has been devised. Landscape architects, Gillespies regenerated the brownfield site to create public spaces. The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal around which the buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 people. In front of The Studios there is a free-standing big screen, which is viewable from the piazza.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E

40|$|Ambient systems provide {{information}} in the periphery of a user’s attention. Their aim is to present information as unobtrusively as possible to avoid interrupting primary tasks (e. g. writing or reading). In recent years, light {{has been used to}} create ambient systems to display information. Examples of <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> systems range from simple notification systems such as displaying messages or calendar event reminders, to more complex systems such as focusing on conveying information regarding health activity tracking. However, for <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> systems, there is a broad design space that lacks guidelines on when to make use of light displays and how to design them. In this paper we provide a systematic overview of existing <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> systems over four identified information classes derived from 72 existing <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> systems. The most prominent encoding parameters among the surveyed <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> systems are color, brightness, and their combination. By analyzing existing <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> systems, we provide a first step towards developing guidelines for designing future <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> systems...|$|R
50|$|Levels of <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> {{are most}} {{frequently}} considered relative to additional lighting used as fill light, {{in which case the}} <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> is normally treated as the key light. In some cases, <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> may be used as a fill, in which case additional lighting provides the stronger light source, for example in bounce flash photography. The relative intensity of <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> and fill light is known as the lighting ratio, an important factor in calculating contrast in the finished image.|$|R
25|$|In general, two {{different}} light sources {{are needed in}} an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> for interventional procedures. Particular attention should {{be paid to the}} possibility to dim the lights. This is frequently needed during fluoroscopy or endoscopy. For the surgical lights it is most important that they cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the OR table. If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the OR table. Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the angiography system determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head clearance height for the OR-light may be an issue. This makes lights a critical item in the planning and design process. Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required. Sometimes even a third light may be required, in cases where more than one surgical activity takes place at the same time, e.g. vein stripping of the legs.|$|E
500|$|A Full Scale arcade {{version was}} {{released}} alongside the standard arcade version in 1993. This version {{was designed to}} give the player a more realistic driving experience. Players (a passenger could sit in the car next to the driver) sat inside an adapted red Eunos Roadster, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Mazda MX-5 Miata, and controlled the same car on-screen. The game was played {{in front of a}} [...] wide, front-projected triple screen (which benefited from dimmed <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting),</b> with the wheel, gear stick and pedals functioning as the controls. The ignition key was used to start, the speed and RPM gauges were functional, and fans blew wind on the player from inside the air vents. Speakers concealed inside the car provided realistic engine and tyre sounds; overhead speakers provided surround music. The P.C.B. was located under the bonnet of the car.|$|E
500|$|Circadian rhythm effects {{describe}} {{the tendency for}} humans to experience a normal cycle in attentiveness and sleepiness through the 24-hour day. Those with a conventional sleep pattern (sleeping for seven or eighthours at night) experience periods of maximum fatigue {{in the early hours}} of the morning and a lesser period in the early afternoon. During the low points of this cycle, one experiences reduced attentiveness. During the high points, it is difficult to sleep soundly. The cycle is anchored in part by <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> (darkness causes a person's body to release the hormone melatonin, which induces sleep), and by a person's imposed pattern of regular sleeping and waking times. The influence of the day-night cycle is never fully displaced (standard artificial lighting is not strong enough to inhibit the release of melatonin), and the performance of night shift workers usually suffers. Circadian rhythms are persistent, and can only be shifted by one to twohours forward or backward per day. Changing the starting time of a work shift by more than these amounts will reduce attentiveness, which is common after the first night shift following a [...] "weekend" [...] break during which conventional sleep times were followed.|$|E
40|$|Object’s color {{information}} is not invariant information but is affected by surrounding environments including <b>ambient</b> <b>lights.</b> In this paper, we propsed a new method to acquire intrinsic color information without being affected by <b>ambient</b> <b>lights.</b> In our method, we use a projector as a light source, then capture multiple images with varied color of illumination. Combining these multiple images, we eliminate the influence of <b>ambient</b> <b>lights</b> with avoiding the dark current problem of CCD camera. We show how we treat with other problems caused by specular reflection and interreflection. In the experiments, we show that using our method we can acquire intrinsic diffuse color information without being affeted by <b>ambient</b> <b>lights.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Unframed laser harps {{benefit from}} the use of higher-power lasers, as they {{facilitate}} easier detection by the sensor system. As the sensor is exposed to all <b>ambient</b> <b>light,</b> it can be swamped by stage lighting behind the artist if the sensitivity is too high. To avoid this, the system can use <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> sensors to reject <b>ambient</b> <b>light.</b> The player may use white or light-coloured gloves to improve performance by scattering more light off the player's hands to provide the sensor with a higher signal-to-noise ratio with respect to <b>ambient</b> <b>light.</b> Furthermore, the gloves protect the player's skin from potentially hazardous laser radiation and give audiences a more visual impression of the instrument.|$|R
40|$|For today’s {{vehicles}} several advanced {{driver assistance}} systems {{are on the}} market supporting the driver in critical driving situations or automating parts of the driving tasks. In the future there will be even more. Currently, those assistance systems do not use a common and consistent interaction strategy {{to communicate with the}} driver. The goal of the present study is to present and to evaluate a concept using <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> for presenting information of different assistance systems in an integrated way. Research on visual peripheral warnings showed positive effects on driver reaction times in demanding situations. This paper presents results of a driving simulator experiment, in which an <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> concept using peripheral visual perception were tested. A 360 ° LED stripe was installed around the driver in a fixed-based driving simulator providing interaction signals via peripheral vision. The developed <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> display should support the driver in different driving situations by a consistent colour-coded interaction design. In a between-group design 41 participants (21 with and 20 without <b>ambient</b> <b>light)</b> drove eight different highway scenarios to test the display. Results of the <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> interaction design regarding driver reactions and subjective evaluation regarding comprehensibility of the <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> concept are reported and discussed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} how <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> affects the diagnostic accuracy of dental carious lesions on monitors used in dental practice. Specifically, {{the aim was}} to evaluate whether a monitor hood for blocking excess <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> increases practitioners' ability to accurately diagnose carious lesions on digital radiographs under bright <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> conditions. METHODS: 7 observers evaluated approximal carious lesions on standardized digital radiographs of 100 teeth under 3 <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> conditions: bright light (> 1000 lx) and dim light (< 50 lx) with no monitor hood; and bright light with a hooded monitor. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted for all observations. The criterion standard was a histological examination of the teeth. A paired t-test compared the effects of the three lighting conditions. The level of significance was set to p < 0. 05. Weighted kappa statistics estimated intraobserver agreement. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy for dentine lesions was significantly higher in <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> 1000 lx. For all observers, diagnostic accuracy of dentine lesions under bright light was higher on a hooded monitor than on a monitor without a hood, but this difference was not significant. Intraobserver agreement varied from moderate to good. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic accuracy of those carious lesions that reached into the dentine was significantly higher in <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> 1000 lx. A hooded monitor in bright light was not as effective as a monitor without a hood in dim ligh...|$|R
