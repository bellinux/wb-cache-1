5|$|In an {{interview}} with Misako Aoki in 2015, Kurosaki discussed the influence of lolita fashion on her work. Her life changed when she encountered lolita fashion, and modeling in the style would broaden her world <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a sense of comfort. Kurosaki {{was inspired by the}} film Legally Blonde because of the film's main character always wearing what she wants to wear, and how the main character's bedroom is colored pastel pink, a color scheme that Kurosaki liked.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting {{that she is a}} witch who must be burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen, though a postscript adds that she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|In Sorceria, {{the party}} learns {{that this is}} Ashlynn's home. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is {{watching}} her <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him. The party also learns {{that the only way}} to get to the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself to be faithful to his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver had done.|$|E
5|$|Lioba's emotionless state causes her to act less rationally and as {{a result}} the {{corporation}} stop her. It is deemed that she has to be deleted. Before this happens, John manages to find her <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> back her emotions. They agree to leave Planet B and meet up in real life. However, after they do, Lioba becomes ill and goes into a hospital, where John discovers that Medley is one of the staff. John discovers that not only is he still in Planet B, but Lioba has no physical body so she cannot leave. Lioba's illness comes from a patch designed to delete the rogues. John and Medley help to cure Lioba, and they unite in order to prevent more rogues from being destroyed. Cerberus then confronts them and battles with Medley, while John and Lioba flee to safety.|$|E
5|$|Dan and Gretta {{meet with}} Saul, Dan's {{business}} partner {{and co-founder of}} their record label, {{but he does not}} see the same potential in Gretta and turns her away. Undeterred, Dan proposes that he and Gretta produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Gretta's best friend Steve, Dan sets out to make an album worthy of being published by his label. During this time, Dan and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and Gretta takes Dan's teenage daughter Violet, a fledgling guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album. When the album is finished, Dan and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is very impressed with their collaboration. Gretta demands that Saul give Dan his job back <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but Dan feels confident that Saul will eventually sign Gretta to the label.|$|E

5|$|From 15 to 20 November, Sydney {{and three}} other cruisers transported 4,000 Allied {{soldiers}} and their equipment from Alexandria to the Piraeus as reinforcements for the Greek military. On returning to Alexandria, Sydney deployed {{with the majority of}} the Mediterranean fleet to cover multiple convoys across the sea: the Australian cruiser spent the remainder of the month operating throughout the eastern and central Mediterranean, and was bombed by Italian aircraft on 24 November at Souda Bay, but escaped damage. Sydney started December in the Aegean, where she escorted convoys and shelled the port of Valona, then proceeded to Malta for a refit and repairs to her rudder, which lasted {{until the end of the}} year. During this refit, the cruiser was fitted with degaussing equipment. The ship rejoined the fleet on 8 January 1941, when she was instructed to head home after proceeding along the north coast of Africa and linking up with any Australia-bound merchant ships she encountered. The recall was attributed to the need to bring Sydney in for a major refit <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> personnel leave, a plan to spread combat experience throughout the RAN by trading the cruiser with her sister ship, , and a need to protect Australia against the German merchant raiders operating in the area, particularly following the attacks on Nauru.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{conditions}} were deteriorating on Königsberg. There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although {{safe from the}} British, the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments. Generally {{cut off from the}} outside world, the morale of the sailors fell. However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a fighting chance to return home. A captured British merchant ship, Rubens, was renamed Kronborg. It was given a Danish flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, Königsberg prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, Königsberg was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. Hyacinth intercepted Kronborg as she approached, and chased her to Manza Bay. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Michèle Mouton {{was born}} 23 June 1951 in Grasse, a {{town on the}} French Riviera known for its perfume industry, close to the {{mountain}} stages famously featured in French rallies. Her parents grew roses and jasmine on their large property. After graduating from high school, Mouton began law studies, but would soon drop out and concentrate on a career in rallying. Although Mouton began driving her father's Citroën 2CV when she was 14 years old, she did not turn her interest to rallying until 1972, when her friend Jean Taibi asked her to practise the Tour de Corse with him. Mouton later co-drove {{for him in the}} 1973 Monte Carlo Rally, the first-ever World Rally Championship (WRC) event. After a few more rallies, Mouton's father suggested a switch to driving if she wanted to continue in rallying, and promised to buy her a car <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> one-year to prove herself. Driving an Alpine-Renault A110, she debuted at the Critérium Féminin Paris-Saint-Raphaël and then tackled the Tour de France Automobile. In the Île de Beauté, a complementary event to the Tour de Corse at the end of 1973, Mouton finished eighth overall.|$|E

5|$|Ripley 8 (Sigourney Weaver), {{also known}} as Number 8, is a human-Alien hybrid cloned from the DNA of Ellen Ripley and the {{embryonic}} Alien Queen recovered from Ripley's blood samples taken from Fury 161. The DNA's integrity has been compromised {{by the process of}} infestation and the human and Alien DNA in Number 8 is mixed, creating a humanoid organism with Alien traits such as an empathic link {{with the rest of the}} hive, acidic blood, enhanced strength and reflexes and genetic memories. After United Systems Military researchers extract the Alien Queen from Number 8 on the ship USM Auriga in the year 2381, they keep her alive and confined <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a rudimentary education. When the Aliens breach their containment, Number 8 joins the crew of the mercenary vessel Betty to attempt an escape; she is captured by the Aliens, who bring her to their nest. Number 8's Alien Queen gives birth to a Newborn, a hybrid which identifies Number 8 as its mother after it kills the Alien Queen. Number 8 escapes from the Auriga on the Betty and again encounters the Newborn, which she jettisons into space. After the Betty lands on Earth, Number 8 looks around with the other survivors and wonders about their uncertain future.|$|E

25|$|In {{his poem}} Ludovico Ariosto relates how Marphise, the woman warrior, knocks the knight Pinabello off his horse after his lady had mocked Marphise's companion, {{the old woman}} Gabrina. In Marphise by Eugène Delacroix, Pinabello lies on the ground, and his horse gallops off in the distance. The knight's lady, meanwhile, is forced to disrobe <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> fancy {{clothing}} to Gabrina. Marphise's horse, undisturbed by the drama, nonchalantly munches on the leaves overhead.|$|E
25|$|Although Luisa Moreno {{is a major}} {{figure in}} the pre-Chicano Movement and the American labor movement, her role is often overlooked. Since the 1970s, activists and historians have {{attempted}} to reconstruct {{her role in the}} movements <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> appropriate credit. Among them are the muralist and professor Judy Baca, who memorialized the organization of Cal San workers in her Great Wall of Los Angeles. The wall, a visual representation of the history of Los Angeles, pays tribute to Moreno by including an image of her face surrounded by images of strikers.|$|E

In 1975, Majida released her first single “Am Behlamak” (Im dreaming of you, Lebanon) with collaboration with Lebanese poet Said Akl and musician Elias Rahbani. The song made a huge spreading in Lebanon as it kicked off with the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in April 1975.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eminent {{among the}} saints is the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. In Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the {{fulfillment}} of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the Ark of the Covenant (because she carried the New Covenant {{in the person of}} Christ) and the burning bush that appeared before Moses (symbolizing the Mother of God's carrying of God without being consumed). Accordingly, the Orthodox consider Mary to be the Ark of the New Covenant <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the respect and reverence as such. The Theotokos was chosen by God and she freely co-operated in that choice to be the Mother of Jesus Christ, the God-man.|$|E
