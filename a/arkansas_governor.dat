5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as <b>Arkansas</b> <b>governor</b> (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E

5|$|The 1899 Rock Island Railroad Bridge {{across the}} Arkansas River, {{originally}} leading to Choctaw Station, {{has been converted}} into a pedestrian bridge connecting to North Little Rock. On the fifth anniversary of the library's opening, Clinton said that construction on the project would begin in 2010, but full funding had not yet been secured, as the project was still short about $3 million. The Clinton Foundation had originally planned to renovate the bridge for $4 million in exchange for a $1-a-year land lease from the state.
