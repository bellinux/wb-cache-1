The username {{is the most common}} form of identification on computer systems today and the password is {{the most common form of}} authentication.

50|$|Because of the {{important}} to take measures against covert observation {{in order to prevent}} <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> from being stolen, Secret tap method proposes a technique that do not expose the <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> during entry, even if other individuals try to view the input process. Additionally, {{it should be noted that}} the risk of covert observation is not restricted to direct observation by other individuals, camera recordings also pose a threat. Therefore, it is necessary to make the authentication process more complex in order to prevent <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> from being stolen even if cameras and/or other individuals observe the information input process numerous times. There are two types of shoulder-surfing attack: direct observation attacks, in which <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> is obtained by a person who is directly monitoring the authentication sequence, and recording attacks, in which the <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> is obtained by recording the authentication sequence for later analysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Network {{security}} and identity authentication is confirmed the true identity whether the user and the claimed identity is consistent or not, {{in order to}} prevent the illegal user access the system for resources by identity fraud. The one-time password authentication technology with high safety, convenient for using, easy for management and lower cost is applied widely and has bright prospection. The one-time password authentication technology support to add uncertain factors in the login process, so that the login <b>authentication</b> <b>informations</b> are not the same each time. It is useful to improve the security of the login process. In this paper, a new system which is based on the the one-time password authentication technology called biometric system is first introduced.
