Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E
