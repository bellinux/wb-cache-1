40|$|Direct {{internal}} reforming of hydrocarbon fuels such as {{gasoline and}} diesel has been problematic due to coking on Ni-based SOFC anodes. This paper describes stable direct internal reforming SOFCs (Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM-YSZ) using anode reforming catalysts. Button cells were tested {{with a separate}} catalyst piece placed against the <b>anode.</b> <b>Button</b> cell power densities of ~ 0. 5 W/cm 2 at ~ 800 oC have been demonstrated with n-dodecane and n-tridecane mixed with H 2 O-CO 2 -air. Life tests with n-dodecane showed stable operation for> 140 h. Flattened-tube segmented-in-series modules with 14 cells on each side were tested with a catalyst layer coating on the fuel side of the zirconia support tube. For iso-octane mixed with either air or H 2 O-CO 2 -air, a stable maximum power density of ~ 0. 6 W/cm 2 was obtained at ~ 800 oC...|$|E
40|$|The high {{sintering}} temperature of Yttrium doped barium zirconate (BZY), {{the most promising}} high temperature proton conductor (HTPC) for Intermediate Temperature (400 - 750 °C) Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFCs), has been reduced by using ZnO as a sintering aid. Obtaining a dense electrolyte at a reduced temperature allows conventional fuel cell preparation methods. A reproducible spin coating method to fabricate highly performing <b>anode</b> supported <b>button</b> cells with dense micrometric BZYZn electrolyte layers has been developed. The electrochemical characterization of button cells at 600 °C shows promising performance, {{higher than that of}} comparable fuel cells from literature. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|The General Electric Tungar {{rectifier}} was a mercury vapor (ex.:5B24) or argon (ex.:328) gas-filled electron tube {{device with}} a tungsten filament cathode and a carbon <b>button</b> <b>anode.</b> It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the {{gas in the}} tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much lower forward voltage drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for battery chargers and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost metal rectifiers, and later semiconductor diodes, supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an incandescent lamp with an additional electrode.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} is used to predict and evaluate performance of an <b>anode</b> supported SOFC <b>button</b> cell. The flow field is calculated using 2 D Navier–Stokes equations (momentum, species and energy equations). The electrical and electrochemical processes are simulated coupled with heat and mass transfer model. To account for the ohmic losses and joule heating of the current that passes through the cell body, a descretized network circuit is adopted. The model predicts the cell output voltage, the local EMF and the state variables pressure, temperature and species concentrations. The local electrical parameters are calculated based on the local pressure, temperature and concentration of the species. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data and good agreement is observed. The SOFC operations are simulated at different input fuel flow rates and humidification. The results show how the input {{fuel mass flow rate}} affects the button cell SOFC performance. Also influences of the anode thickness on cell performance are investigated...|$|R
