40|$|Abstract Background In a {{previously}} conducted Health Impact Assessment of a well-water dependent southwest community, arsenic (<b>As)</b> <b>levels</b> {{greater than the}} EPA Maximum Contaminant Level (10  μg/L) were identified in home water samples. The goals {{of this study were}} to test whether children from the previously studied well-water dependent community (Community 1) had higher blood <b>As</b> <b>levels</b> than children from a demographically similar and geographically nearby community dependent on a municipal water supply (Community 2); to test whether home water <b>As</b> <b>levels</b> predicted child <b>As</b> blood levels; and to examine how child <b>As</b> blood <b>levels</b> changed over time. Methods This was an observational study of 252 children aged 4 to 12  years from two communities. Children were recruited through elementary schools and tested during the school day; 204 children participated in follow-up testing. Home water samples were collected according to U. S. Environmental Protection agency recommended procedures. Child heavy metal blood levels and home water sample heavy metal levels were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. General linear regression analysis was used to test the influence of community on child <b>As</b> <b>levels,</b> and to examine the contribution of home water <b>As</b> <b>levels</b> to child blood <b>As</b> <b>levels.</b> Results Arsenic was detectable in all children tested. Blood levels ranged from 0. 09 – 2. 61  μg/dL; approximately 31 % of children tested at Time I (79 / 252) had blood As values above the current acceptable limit (1. 2  μg/dL). Approximately 8 % of household water samples (6 / 76) had <b>As</b> <b>levels</b> higher than 10  μg/L. Community did not predict child blood As levels; seasonal effects differed by Community. At Time II, child blood <b>As</b> <b>levels</b> were higher in Community 2 than in Community 1. Conclusion A large proportion of children in the communities tested had As exposure. Home water <b>As</b> <b>levels</b> did not predict child blood <b>As</b> <b>levels.</b> Fluctuating child blood <b>As</b> <b>levels</b> by season and over time suggested the contribution of multiple factors and the need for further studies...|$|R

40|$|Activin A {{released}} from epicardial adipose tissue {{has been linked}} to contractile dysfunction and insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes. This study investigated the role of activin A in clinical diabetic cardiomyopathy by assessing whether circulating activin <b>A</b> <b>levels</b> associate with cardiometabolic parameters in men with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes (T 2 D), and the effects of treatment with pioglitazone versus metformin on these associations. Seventy-eight men with uncomplicated T 2 D and fourteen healthy men with comparable age were included, in this randomized, double-blind, active comparator intervention study. All T 2 D men were on glimipiride monotherapy, and randomized to a 24 -week intervention with either pioglitazone or metformin. Cardiac dimensions and -function were measured using magnetic resonance imaging, whilst myocardial glucose metabolism (MMRglu) was determined using [18 F]- 2 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Circulating activin <b>A</b> <b>levels</b> were comparable in T 2 D men and controls. Activin <b>A</b> <b>levels</b> were independently inversely associated with MMRglu, and positively with left ventricular mass/volume (LVMV) -ratio in T 2 D men. Intervention with metformin decreased activin <b>A</b> <b>levels,</b> whereas pioglitazone did not alter activin <b>A</b> <b>levels.</b> The changes in plasma activin <b>A</b> <b>levels</b> were not correlated with the changes in MMRglu following either pioglitazone or metformin treatment. A borderline significant correlation (p = 0. 051) of changes in plasma activin <b>A</b> <b>levels</b> and changes in LVMV-ratio was observed after pioglitazone treatment. Circulating activin <b>A</b> <b>levels</b> are associated with impaired myocardial glucose metabolism and high LVMV-ratio in patients with uncomplicated T 2 D, reflecting a potential detrimental role in early human diabetic cardiomyopathy.
