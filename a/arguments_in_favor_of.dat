5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic treatment should be {{balanced by the}} consideration of possible side effects, and {{it is reasonable to}} suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> the {{construction}} of I-68 was that the freeway would improve the poor economic conditions in western Maryland. The economy of the surrounding area has improved since {{the construction}} of the freeway, especially in Garrett County, where the freeway opened up the county to tourism from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. Correspondingly, Garrett County saw a sharp increase in population and employment during and after {{the construction of}} the road, with full- and part-time employment increasing from 8,868 in 1976 to 15,334 in 1991. However, economic difficulties remain in Allegany and Garrett counties. There were concerns over loss of customers to businesses that have been cut off from the main highway due to {{the construction of the}} new alignment in the 1980s, leading to protests when then-Governor Harry Hughes visited the Sideling Hill road cut when it was opened.|$|E

25|$|Although governments {{must spend}} money on tax {{collection}} activities, some of the costs, particularly for keeping records and filling out forms, are borne by businesses and by private individuals. These are collectively called costs of compliance. More complex tax systems tend to have higher compliance costs.

25|$|Various <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> God {{establish}} God as {{a useful}} or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some atheists hold firmly {{to the belief that}} assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit). Taking a nuanced position, philosopher Del Ratzsch suggests that the application of the razor to God may not be so simple, least of all when we are comparing that hypothesis with theories postulating multiple invisible universes.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> {{integrated}} tug barge systems is {{the small number of}} crew required to operate such vessel — whereas a conventional vessel with capacity in par with the Finnpusku pusher-barge combination would require a crew of 16–17, the integrated tug-barge unit can be operated by a crew of only 9. In some cases an integrated system is adopted only for this reason and the pusher is rarely, if ever, decoupled from the barge.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{international}} status and nationhood of the Confederate States of America, in 1869 the United States Supreme Court in Texas v.

25|$|The {{argument}} {{was made in}} the nineteenth century by a scholar hostile to what the Malleus stood for that the approbation was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger {{had nothing to do with}} the composition.

Nonetheless, once the {{argument was}} put forward, it took on a life of its own, and people continue to advance <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this argument was vitiated from the start.|$|E

25|$|Vaillant {{returned}} to Paris, where he continued publicizing his <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> Wallachian and Moldavian causes. On August 2, 1844, {{he spoke in}} front of the Société Orientale, of which he had been made a member, protesting against censorship imposed by Russia in the Danubian Principalities (he expanded on this perspective in La Roumanie). At the time, he became close to Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys, President of the Société Orientale, whose support for the cause of ethnic Romanians he consequently enlisted. He also contacted the poet Alphonse de Lamartine, who, in 1846, became head of Societatea Studenţilor Români (the Society of Romanian Students).|$|E
25|$|Proponents of {{the view}} that the prayer is {{secondary}} argue that (1) the context requires a prayer of illumination and not a communal confession of sin, and (2) {{the beginning and end of}} the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams. However, these considerations have not proved decisive, and <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced. In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20-27 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by the same author(s).|$|E
25|$|Until recent times, Shebitku {{was placed}} within the 25th Dynasty between Shabaka and Taharqa. Although the {{possibility}} of a switch between the reigns of Shabaka and Shebitku had already been suggested before by Brunet and Baker had outlined nine reasons for the reversal, it was Michael Bányai in 2013 who first published in a mainstream journal many <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> such a relocation. After him, Frédéric Payraudeau and Gerard P. F. Broekman independently expanded the hypothesis. The archaeological evidence now in 2016/2017 firmly favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession. Gerard Broekman's GM 251 (2017) paper shows that Shebitku reigned before Shabaka since the upper edge of Shabaka’s NLR #30 Year 2 Karnak quay inscription was carved over the left-hand side of the lower edge of Shebitku's NLR#33 Year 3 inscription. This can only mean that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of John the Baptist {{within the same}} time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Josephus and {{the overwhelming majority of}} modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. One of the <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.|$|E
25|$|Craig {{examines}} arguments {{aimed at}} showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal. He defends the coherence of a timeless and personal being, but {{says that the}} arguments for divine timelessness are unsound or inconclusive. By contrast, he gives two <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> divine temporality. First, he says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality. Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing temporally. Second, Craig says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know tensed facts about the world, such as what is happening now, which Craig argues is sufficient for his being temporally located. Craig argues that, since a temporal world does exist, it follows that God exists in time.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationists {{believe that}} the flood {{described}} in Genesis 6–9 did occur, was global in extent, and submerged all dry land on Earth. Some Young Earth Creationists go further and advocate a kind of flood geology which relies on the appropriation of late eighteenth and early nineteenth century <b>arguments</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> catastrophism made by such scientists as Georges Cuvier and Richard Kirwan. This approach which {{was replaced by the}} mid-nineteenth century almost entirely by uniformitarianism was adopted most famously by George McCready Price and this legacy is reflected in the most prominent YEC organizations today. YEC ideas to accommodate the massive amount of water necessary for a flood that was global in scale included inventing such constructs as an orbiting vapor canopy which would have collapsed and generated the necessary extreme rainfall or a rapid movement of tectonic plates causing underground aquifers or tsunamis from underwater volcanic steam to inundate the planet.|$|E
