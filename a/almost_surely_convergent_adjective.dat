40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with identifying the best decision among a set of possible decisions {{in the presence of}} uncertainty. We are primarily interested in situations where the objective function value at any feasible solution needs to be estimated, for example via a ``black-box' simulation procedure. We develop adaptive random search methods for solving such simulation optimization problems. The methods are adaptive {{in the sense that they}} use information gathered during previous iterations to decide how simulation effort is expended in the current iteration. We consider random search because such methods assume very little about the structure of the underlying problem, and hence can be applied to solve complex simulation optimization problems with little expertise required from an end-user. Consequently, such methods are suitable for inclusion in simulation software. We first identify desirable features that algorithms for discrete simulation optimization need to possess to exhibit attractive empirical performance. Our approach emphasizes maintaining an appropriate balance between exploration, exploitation, and estimation. We also present two new and <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent</b> random search methods that possess these desirable features and demonstrate their empirical attractiveness. Second, we develop two frameworks for designing adaptive and <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent</b> random search methods for discrete simulation optimization. Our frameworks involve averaging, in that all decisions that require estimates of the objective function values at various feasible solutions are based on the averages of all observations collected at these solutions so far. We present two new and <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent</b> variants of simulated annealing and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of averaging and adaptivity in the context of simulated annealing. Finally, we present three random search methods for solving simulation optimization problems with uncountable feasible regions. One of the approaches is adaptive, while the other two are based on pure random search. We provide conditions under which the three methods are convergent, both in probability and <b>almost</b> <b>surely.</b> Lastly, we include a computational study that demonstrates the effectiveness of the methods when compared to some other approaches available in the literature.

3000|$|... 2 is very {{important}} for achieving optimal solutions to clustering and coverage problems that we have addressed in this work. The weight factors correspond to complex multivariable functions, and their optimal values are dynamic depending on the time-varying network environment parameters. Therefore, the problem can be modeled as a simulation optimization problem, where the objective function cannot be evaluated exactly. Adaptive random search methods for the simulation optimization problem, which can maintain balance among exploration, exploitation, and estimation, are more effective [30, 31]. However, the development of an adaptive and <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent</b> search method for our problem leads to a new research work. Therefore, we have gone for the estimation based on performing a lot of simulation runs (transient simulation) for a substantially longer period of time.

40|$|In this paper, we {{developed}} a model-based and a data-driven estimator for directed information (DI) to infer the causal connectivity graph between electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals recorded from brain and to identify the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epileptic patients. Directed information, an information theoretic quantity, is a general metric to infer causal connectivity between time-series and is not restricted to a particular class of models unlike the popular metrics based on Granger causality or transfer entropy. The proposed estimators are shown to be <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent.</b> Causal connectivity between ECoG electrodes in five epileptic patients is inferred using the proposed DI estimators, after validating their performance on simulated data. We then proposed a model-based and a data-driven SOZ identification algorithm to identify SOZ from the causal connectivity inferred using model-based and data-driven DI estimators respectively. The data-driven SOZ identification outperforms the model-based SOZ identification algorithm when benchmarked against visual analysis by neurologist, the current clinical gold standard. The causal connectivity analysis presented here {{is the first step}} towards developing novel non-surgical treatments for epilepsy.

40|$|Linear Fractional Stable Motion (LFSM) of Hurst {{parameter}} H and {{of stability}} parameter, {{is one of}} the most classical extensions of the well-known Gaussian Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM), to the setting of heavy-tailed stable distributions SamTaq,EmMa. In order to overcome some limitations of its areas of application, coming from stationarity of its increments as well as constancy over time of its self-similarity exponent, Stoev and Taqqu introduced in stoev 2004 stochastic an extension of LFSM, called Linear Multifractional Stable Motion (LMSM), in which the Hurst parameter becomes a function H(·) depending on the time variable t. Similarly to LFSM, the tail heaviness of the marginal distributions of LMSM is determined by; also, under some conditions, its self-similarity is governed by H(·) and its path roughness is closely related to H(·) - 1 /. Namely, it was shown in stoev 2004 stochastic that H(t_ 0) is the self-similarity exponent of LMSM at a time t_ 0 ≠ 0; moreover, very recently, it was established in hamonier 2012 lmsm, that the quantities _t∈ I H(t) - 1 /, and H(t_ 0) - 1 /, are respectively the uniform Hölder exponent of LMSM on a compact interval I, and its local Hölder exponent at t_ 0. The main goal of our article, is to construct, using wavelet coefficients of LMSM, strongly consistent (i. e. <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> <b>convergent)</b> statistical estimators of _t∈ I H(t), H(t_ 0), and; our estimation results, are obtained when ∈ (1, 2), and, H(·) is a Hölder function smooth enough, with values in a compact subinterval [H,H̅] of (1 /, 1) ...|$|R

Such processes are first constructed as <b>almost</b> <b>surely</b> uniformly <b>convergent</b> sums of Poisson type summands, that immediately yield information on sample function properties of versions. The constructions employed, which include a generalized version of the Ferguson-Klass construction with uniform convergence, are new even in the simpler setting of processes in one-dimensional time. Following these constructions, or representations, an analogue of the Lévy-Ito decomposition for Lévy processes is developed, which then enables a number of simple sample function properties of these processes to be read off from the Lévy measure in their characteristic functionals.
