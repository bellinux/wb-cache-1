Company manager Felicity arrives and scolds them {{for using the}} room. While Jim is absent, Felicity flirts with Laura. Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's payslip to see for herself. She is determined for Jim to appear as Macbeth, which {{would allow them to}} save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> on the floor grow into a large puddle. When he looks again, it has gone.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Gary Leiterman {{was convicted}} of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a law student at the University of Michigan, after DNA found on Mixer's pantyhose was matched to Leiterman. DNA in <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> on Mixer's hand was matched to John Ruelas, who was only four years old in 1969 and was never {{successfully}} connected to the case in any other way. Leiterman's defense unsuccessfully argued that the unexplained match of the blood spot to Ruelas pointed to cross-contamination and raised doubts about {{the reliability of the}} lab's identification of Leiterman.|$|E
25|$|In Rabbinic Judaism, {{the laws}} of {{conversion}} {{are based on the}} classical sources of Jewish law, especially discussions in the Talmud, and the law as codified in the Shulkhan Arukh. This corpus of traditional Jewish law (halakha) is regarded as authoritative by the Orthodox and Conservative movements. The traditional halakhic requirements for conversion are instruction in the commandments, circumcision (if male), and immersion in an acceptable body of water before valid witnesses, and acceptance of the commandments before a rabbinical court. If a male is already circumcised, <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> is drawn from the penis.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Napoleon I plotted {{to replace}} the royal family of the Kingdom of Spain. Pursuant to his design, he ordered several key points, {{including}} Barcelona, to be seized in February 1808. On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's Imperial French troops were marching through Barcelona, ostensibly to help fight Portugal. Lechi staged a military review, {{but it was a}} cover for gaining control of the citadel. As the soldiers marched past the main gate of the fortress, they suddenly turned left and rushed inside. Without spilling <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> the Imperial troops herded the baffled Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other key points, the French also grabbed San Sebastian, Pamplona and Figueras. On 2 May 1808, the infuriated Spanish people rose in rebellion against their French occupiers.|$|E

25|$|When {{the people}} of Quanzhou, Fujian could not raise enough money to build a bridge, Guanyin changed into a {{beautiful}} maiden. Getting on a boat, she offered to marry any man who could hit her {{with a piece of}} silver {{from the edge of the}} water. Due to many people missing, she collected a large sum of money in her boat. However, Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals, helped a merchant hit Guanyin in the hair with silver powder, which floated away in the water. Guanyin bit her finger and <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> fell into the water, but she vanished. This blood was swallowed by a washer woman, who gave birth to Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑) or Lady Linshui (臨水夫人); the hair was turned into a female white snake and sexually used men and killed rival women. The snake and Chen were to be mortal enemies. The merchant was sent to be reborn as Liu Qi (劉杞).|$|E
25|$|Some animists also view {{plant and}} fungi life as persons and {{interact}} with them accordingly. The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has {{to be carried out}} respectfully. Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer karakia invocations to sweet potatoes as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in Aotearoa together in the same canoes. In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable. Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a wand; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can {{come in the form of}} libations of mead or ale, <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from a finger, or a strand of wool.|$|E
500|$|Among Waugh's {{neighbours}} in Stinchcombe was Diana Oldridge, {{known in}} the Waugh family as [...] "Tanker". She was an organiser of local music festivals, and the possessor of a contraption known as [...] "the Box". This device was reputed to cure all ills, by means of [...] "sympathetic life-waves" [...] working on some physical part of the victim—hairs, nail-clippings, or <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Waugh himself was generally sceptical, even scornful of these powers, but some of his acquaintances {{claimed to have been}} cured by the Box, as apparently had one of Laura Waugh's cows. In letters to Laura from Cairo and Colombo, Waugh ascribed the voices he was hearing {{to the power of the}} Box, and instructs Laura to tell [...] "Tanker" [...] that he now believes in it.|$|E

500|$|In 1913, his 14-year-old brother Renato died {{suddenly}} during a football game; Andrade left the Conservatory {{to stay at}} Araraquara, where his family had a farm. [...] When he returned, his piano playing was afflicted intermittently by trembling of his hands. [...] Although he ultimately did receive a degree in piano, he gave no concerts and began studying singing and music theory {{with an eye toward}} becoming a professor of music. [...] At the same time, he began writing more seriously. [...] In 1917, the year of his graduation, he published his first book of poems, Há uma Gota de Sangue em Cada Poema (There is <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in each poem), under the pseudonym Mário Sobral. [...] The book contains hints of Andrade's growing sense of a distinctive Brazilian identity, but it does so {{within the context of a}} poetry that (like most Brazilian poetry of the period) is strongly indebted to earlier European—particularly French—literature.|$|E

2500|$|DNA {{analysis}} of blood discovered {{on a pair}} of Simpson's socks found in his bedroom identified it as Brown's. The blood had DNA characteristics matched by approximately only one in 9.7billion, with odds falling to one out of 21billion when compiling results of testing done at the two separate DNA laboratories. Both socks had about 20 stains of blood. The blood made a similar pattern {{on both sides of the}} socks. Defense medical expert Dr. Henry Lee of the Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory testified that the only way such a pattern could appear was if Simpson had a [...] "hole" [...] in his ankle, or <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> was placed on the sock while it was not being worn. Lee also testified that the collection procedure of the socks could have caused contamination.|$|E
2500|$|A brit milah is {{more than}} circumcision, it is a sacred ritual in Judaism, as {{distinguished}} from its non-ritual requirement in Islam. One ramification is that the brit is not considered complete unless <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> is actually drawn. The standard medical methods of circumcision through constriction {{do not meet the}} requirements of the halakhah for brit milah, because they cause hemostasis, i.e., they stop the flow of blood. Morever, circumcision alone, {{in the absence of the}} brit milah ceremony, does not fulfill the requirements of the mitzvah. Therefore, in cases where a Jew who was circumcised outside of a brit milah, an already-circumcised convert, or an aposthetic (born without a foreskin) individual, the mohel draws a symbolic drop of blood ( [...] , [...] ) from the penis at the point where the foreskin would have been or was attached.|$|E
