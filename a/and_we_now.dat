25|$|French {{philosopher and}} {{mathematician}} René Descartes {{was the first}} to propose a model for the origin of the Solar System in his Le Monde (ou Traité de lumière) which he wrote in 1632 and 1633 and for which he delayed publication because of the Inquisition and it was published only after his death in 1664. In his view, the Universe was filled with vortices of swirling particles and the Sun and planets had condensed from a particularly large vortex that had somehow contracted, which explained the circular motion of the planets and was on the right track with condensation and contraction. However, this was before Newton's theory of gravity <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> know matter does not behave in this fashion.|$|E

Gehry was also quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying: [...] "We had the wrong executive architect doing the drawings. I helped pick him, I'm partly responsible. It brought us to a stop."" [...] Gehry told Los Angeles magazine in 1996 that he [...] "no longer speaks to his former friend (Dworsky)". Gehry continued his public attacks on Dworsky: [...] "He (Dworsky) made a lot of money. He begged me for the job. I'd like to shoot him." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{ending his}} playing career for good, Motley asked Brown about a {{coaching}} {{job with the}} team. Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill – the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, {{he worked as a}} whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant. [...] "When I heard of the hiring of a new assistant, I began to wonder if the full reason {{is whether or not the}} time is ripe to hire a Negro coach in Cleveland on the professional level," [...] he wrote. Art Modell, the Browns' owner, responded by saying the team filled its coaching positions based on ability and experience, not race. [...] "We are represented by scouts at every major Negro school. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> have 12 Negroes signed for the 1965 season," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2014, {{interview}} with The A.V.

I was doing a Q somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t really know the answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> have such an amazing company involved, and that's the really big announcement that hasn’t been made yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|There was {{controversy}} when Huckabee {{was asked}} about responses he gave on a questionnaire during his 1992 race for the U.S. Senate.

[...] He also suggested that AIDS patients should be [...] "isolated from the general population." [...] He stuck by those comments in December 2007 when asked if homosexuality is sinful. He replied, [...] "Well I believe it would be—just like lying is sinful and stealing is sinful. There {{are a lot of}} things that are sinful. It doesn't mean that a person is a horrible person. It means that they engage in behavior that is outside the norms of those boundaries of our traditional view of what's right and what's wrong. So, I think that anybody who has, maybe a traditional worldview of homosexuality would classify that as an unusual behavior that is not traditional and that would be outside those bounds." [...] He also defended his statements about isolation of AIDS patients, claiming that in 1992 [...] "we were still learning about the virus that causes AIDS." ...|$|E
