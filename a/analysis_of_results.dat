25|$|In {{a simple}} random sample (SRS) {{of a given}} size, all such subsets of the frame are given an equal probability. Furthermore, any given pair of {{elements}} has the same chance of selection as any other such pair (and similarly for triples, and so on). This minimizes bias and simplifies <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> In particular, the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population, which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results.|$|E
25|$|According to the Ministry of Environment, 97.9% of {{the tests}} {{complied}} with drinking water quality standards. An <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> since 1989, when disinfection of groundwater was first introduced, has shown a constant improvement {{in the quality of}} drinking water, with the percentage of violations decreasing from 8.4% in 1989 to 2.1% in 1999. In 2000, the Minister of Health signed an amended version of public health regulations which raise chemical standards for water quality to very stringent standards. Maximum levels for 38 new chemical substances—including pesticides, organic solvents and petroleum products—were set for the first time while existing standards for nitrates, lead, cadmium and zinc were tightened.|$|E
2500|$|Many grooves and streaks also {{cover the}} oddly shaped surface. The grooves are {{typically}} less than [...] deep, [...] wide, {{and up to}} [...] in length, and were originally assumed {{to have been the}} result of the same impact that created Stickney. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> from the Mars Express spacecraft, however, revealed that the grooves are not in fact radial to Stickney, but are centered on the leading apex of Phobos in its orbit (which is not far from Stickney). Researchers suspect that they have been excavated by material ejected into space by impacts on the surface of Mars. The grooves thus formed as crater chains, and all of them fade away as the trailing apex of Phobos is approached. They have been grouped into 12 or more families of varying age, presumably representing at least 12 Martian impact events.|$|E
