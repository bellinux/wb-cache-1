5|$|Each {{division}} comprised three infantry brigades, {{and each}} brigade contained four battalions (later reduced to three in 1918). Australian battalions initially included eight rifle companies; however, this {{was reduced to}} four expanded companies in January 1915 to conform with the organisation of British infantry battalions. A battalion contained about 1,000 men. Although the divisional structure evolved {{over the course of}} the war, each formation <b>also</b> <b>included</b> <b>a</b> range of combat support and service units, including artillery, machine-gun, mortar, engineer, pioneer, signals, logistic, medical, veterinary and administrative units. By 1918 each brigade <b>also</b> <b>included</b> <b>a</b> light trench mortar battery, while each division included a pioneer battalion, a machine-gun battalion, two field artillery brigades, a divisional trench mortar brigade, four companies of engineers, a divisional signals company, a divisional train consisting of four service corps companies, a salvage company, three field ambulances, a sanitary section and a mobile veterinary section. These changes were reflective of wider organisational adaption, tactical innovation, and the adoption of new weapons and technology that occurred throughout the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).|$|E
