5000|$|... 1979: Konica FS-1 (Japan): first SLR with {{built-in}} motorized autoloading. Also had autowinding (motorized single frame or continuous up to 1.5 {{frames per second}} film advance), but not <b>auto-rewind.</b> A snapshooter's great dislike (and Kodak bugbear) of 135 film was the need to manually thread the film leader into the camera's take-up spool. Built-in, motorized, automated film-transport systems (auto-load/wind/rewind) arrived with the Canon T70 (Japan) in 1984. Completely automated film handling systems appeared when automatic [...] "DX" [...] film speed setting was added to auto-transport in the Minolta Maxxum 7000 (Japan; see below) in 1985 and became standard in virtually all 35 mm SLRs by the late 1980s. This is, of course, a non-issue in modern digital SLRs. Although Konishiroku has a rich history including several first rank camera innovations, it {{was never able to}} establish Konica as a first tier brand and quit the SLR business in 1988.|$|E
