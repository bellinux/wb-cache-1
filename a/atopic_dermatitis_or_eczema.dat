One of these diseases is <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>or</b> <b>eczema.</b> When biopsy samples of patients with atopic dermatitis were compared to samples from patients without atopic dermatitis, levels of IL-31 were elevated in patients with atopic dermatitis. IL-31 plays a role in this disease by inducing chemokine genes CCL1, CCL17, and CCL22. The chemokines transcribed from these genes recruit T-cells to the irritated skin where they secrete more IL-31. This cycle is the current understanding of IL-31's role in atopic dermatitis.

Clarification of research question and scope <b>Atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (<b>or</b> <b>eczema)</b> is a skin condition characterised by inflammatory lesions of very varied manifestations including redness, dryness, itching, thickening {{of the skin}} and scaling. Lesions may be limited to small isolated patches resolving {{within a short time}} or can evolve into widespread persistent disease or recurrent flares, sometimes complicated by bacterial or viral skin infections. Objective measurement of eczema severity is difficult. Standard measurement scales exist (such as the Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index, ADSI, and many others) 1 encompassing the extent of areas affected and the intensity or spectrum of symptoms, including erythema (redness), pruritus (itching), exudation (weeping), excoriation (peeling) and lichenification (skin thickening).

40|$|Background: <b>Atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (AD <b>or</b> <b>eczema)</b> often {{precedes the}} develop-ment of asthma and {{allergic}} rhinitis in atopic subjects, a {{phenomenon known as}} atopic march. An important role of epicutaneous (e. c.) sensitization has been recognized in the atopic march; however, the factors involved in e. c. sensiti-zation remain poorly understood. Our previous studies using mouse models have shown that induced overexpression of Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) in keratinocytes not only triggers an AD [Li, M. et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006; 103 : 11736 – 11741] but also aggravates experimental asthma induced by systemic sensitization and airway challenge of ovalbumin (OVA) [Zhang Z, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009; 106 : 1536 – 1541], suggesting that TSLP represents an important factor linking AD to asthma. However, whether keratinocytic TSLP is essentially required for developing e. c. sensiti-zation and triggering the atopic march remained to be determined. Methods: We develop a mouse model in which e. c. sensitization of OVA through tape-stripped skin is followed by intranasal challenge to induce a...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAimThe aim of {{this paper}} was to present {{diagnostic}} methods helping in the recognition of mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS). BackgroundMycosis fungoides is {{the most common form of}} primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. It is characterized by a distinctive long-term course and malignant T-cell proliferation. MF diagnosis is not easy, mainly due to the atypical clinical presentation of the disease at an early stage. Materials and methodsLow specific changes, which can be observed at the histopathological examination. Initially, the skin lesions may resemble psoriasis, <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>or</b> chronic <b>eczema.</b> Patients are qualified according to the available, and generally accepted WHO-EORTC classification, based on a combination of clinical and histopathological markers. From a clinical point of view, it is also important to carry out the qualification according to the TNMB assessment, which allows to specify the stage of the disease, and is helpful in the monitoring of the course of disease and therapeutic effects. ResultsIn this paper we try to present currently available diagnostic methods. ConclusionDiagnosis of MF and SS still causes many problems due to less characteristic changes in the early stage of disease and requires wide interdisciplinary knowledge...|$|R
40|$|For {{at least}} half a century, noninvasive {{techniques}} have been available to quantify skin barrier function, and these have shown that a number of human skin conditions and disorders are associated with defects in skin permeability. In the last decade, several genes responsible for skin barrier defects observed in both monogenetic and complex, polygenic disorders have been elucidated and functionally characterized. This has led to an explosion of work {{in the last six years}} that has identified pathways connecting epidermal barrier disruption and antigen uptake as well as the quality and/or magnitude of the antigen-specific adaptive immune response. This review will introduce the notion that diseases arise from the dynamic crosstalk that occurs between the skin barrier and immune system using <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>or</b> <b>eczema</b> as the disease prototype. Nevertheless, the concepts put forth are highly relevant to a number of antigen-driven disorders for which skin barrier is at least transiently compromised such as psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis and blistering disorders.

40|$|Of the Australian {{children}} who start {{their first year}} of formal full-time school each year, the majority start with their development on track and ready to take advantage of everything that school has to offer.  About four per cent of children will start school with a significant developmental delay or disability that has been clearly identified; these children are likely to receive some assistance, such as a classroom aide, to help them participate to the fullest at school. However, Australian Early Development Index (AEDI) data have shown that there is up to 20 per cent of {{children who}} start at school with some level of special healthcare need that may not yet have been formally identified, and for which they may not receive any formal special assistance at school. The 2013 ‘Acting Early, Changing Lives’ report from the Benevolent Society highlighted that many children are at risk of being left behind. The authors noted 2 ̆ 7 Evidence indicates worsening or unacceptably high levels of problems amongst Australia’s children and young people 2 ̆ 7 (Moore & McDonald, 2013). By the time children reach school, many are already showing developmental vulnerabilities, often without any formal supports to help them to catch up.

40|$|Abstract Tinea pedis is {{a chronic}} fungal {{infection}} of the feet, very often observed in patients who are immuno-suppressed or have diabetes mellitus. The practicing allergist may {{be called upon to}} treat this disease for various reasons. Sometimes tinea infection may be mistaken for <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>or</b> allergic <b>eczema.</b> In other patients, tinea pedis may complicate allergy and asthma and may contribute to refractory atopic disease. Patients with recurrent cellulitis may be referred to the allergist/immunologist for an immune evaluation and discovered to have tinea pedis as a predisposing factor. From a molecular standpoint, superficial fungal infections may induce a type 2 T helper cell response (Th 2) that can aggravate atopy. Th 2 cytokines may induce eosinophil recruitment and immunoglobulin E (IgE) class switching by B cells, thereby leading to exacerbation of atopic conditions. Three groups of fungal pathogens, referred to as dermatophytes, have been shown to cause tinea pedis: Trychophyton sp, Epidermophyton sp, and Microsporum sp. The disease manifests as a pruritic, erythematous, scaly eruption on the foot and depending on its location, three variants have been described: interdigital type, moccasin type, and vesiculobullous type. Tinea pedis may be associated with recurrent cellulitis, as the fungal pathogens provide a portal for bacterial invasion of subcutaneous tissues. In some cases of refractory asthma, treatment of the associated tinea pedis infection may induce remission in airway disease. Very often, protracted topical and/or oral antifungal agents are required to treat this often frustrating and morbid disease. An evaluation for underlying immuno-suppression or diabetes may be indicated in patients with refractory disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sophie Seite, 1 Thomas Bieber 2 1 La Roche-Posay Dermatological Laboratories, Asnières, France; 2 Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Friedrich-Wilhelms-University, Bonn, GermanyAbstract: <b>Atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (AD) <b>or</b> <b>atopic</b> <b>eczema</b> is {{the common}} {{inflammatory}} skin disorder, the prevalence of which has considerably increased during the last 30 years. It affects 15 %– 30 % of children and 2 %– 10 % of adults. AD characteristically alternates between periods of exacerbation or flares and periods of remission, which may be therapeutically induced or spontaneous. Current knowledge about AD includes abnormalities of the skin barrier (physical and chemical), the immune barrier, and more recently, the microbial barrier or microbiota. There is growing evidence for a tight relationship between them. To obtain satisfactory control of this condition, the clinical strategy to manage AD involves prescribing both anti-inflammatory medications and dermocosmetic products. The role of the physician is therefore to advise the patient with regard to hygiene measures aimed to help to improve these three barriers or to prevent any further deterioration.

40|$|Background: There have {{recently}} been reports suggesting that sensitization to food allergens may occur outside the intestinal tract, especially through the skin. To clarify the role of epicutaneous sensitization in food allergy, we investigated the clinical characteristics of adult patients with food allergies preceded by contact urticaria due to the same foods. Methods: We investigated clinical characteristics of 15 patients (20 – 51 years of age; 5 men and 10 women), who had food allergies preceded by contact urticaria. Results: Fourteen patients were contact urticaria due to the causative foods during occupationally cooking, whereas 1 patient during face pack. In the occupational group, causative foods included rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables, fish, shrimp and cuttlefish; in the fresh cucumber paste case the cause was cucumber. In the 15 patients, the causative foods were fresh, not processed, and were tolerated by most (9 / 15, 60 %) after heating. Regarding to symptoms after ingestion of the causative foods, the most frequently induced symptoms was oral symptoms (14 / 15, 93. 3 %), followed by urticaria (4 / 15, 26. 7 %), abdominal symptoms (3 / 15, 20 %). The duration between the start of jobs or face pack, and the onset of contact urticaria was from 1 month to 19 years (mean, 8. 7 years). The duration between the onset of contact urticaria and the onset of food allergy was from {{a few weeks to}} 6 years (mean, 11 months). One sushi cook experienced severe anaphylactic shock after ingestion of fish. In the occupational group, 13 of 15 patients (86. 7 %) had <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>or</b> hand <b>eczema,</b> indicating that the impaired skin barrier might be a risk for food allergies induced by epicutaneous sensitization.

40|$|<b>Atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (AD) <b>or</b> <b>atopic</b> <b>eczema,</b> is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin disease characterized by dry skin, itching and recurrent red and scaly skin lesions. It {{is a relatively}} common skin disease with an estimated prevalence of 10 - 20 %. The majority of patients show their first clinical symptoms in infancy or early childhood, with reported percentages of 60 % {{before the age of}} 1 year and 85 % before the age of 5 year. The pathogenesis of AD is characterized by a complex interaction between a genetic background and different environmental factors. Over the last years genome wide linkage mapping as well as selective region specific linkage mapping based on candidate genes, has revealed many possible AD related loci on different chromosomes. Summarizing there seem to be two major groups of genes present within the genetic background of AD: genes encoding for epidermal or other epithelial structural proteins and genes encoding for major elements of the immune system. The term “atopic dermatitis” was coined by Wise and Sulzberger in 1933 and reflects the association between AD and other so-called atopic disorders, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. The diagnose is based on clinical criteria, with the extensive criteria of Hanifin and Raijka as the classical starting point published in 1980. In the years to follow several modifications were proposed, leading to publications on different new sets of criteria. For our own research purposes we currently use the diagnostic criteria formulated by the UK working party on AD, which have been extensively validated in the past and are widely accepted as a diagnostic tool (figure 1) ...|$|R

This trial evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of silk garments (in addition to standard care) for the management of eczema in children with moderate to severe disease. Methods and findings: This was a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, observer-blind trial. Children aged 1 to 15 y with moderate to severe eczema were recruited from secondary care and the community at five UK medical centres. Participants were allocated using online randomisation (1 : 1) to standard care or to standard care plus silk garments, stratified by age and recruiting centre. Silk garments were worn for 6 mo. Primary outcome (eczema severity) was assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo, by nurses blinded to treatment allocation, using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), which was log-transformed for analysis (intention-to-treat analysis). A safety outcome was number of skin infections. Three hundred children were randomised (26 November 2013 to 5 May 2015) : 42 % girls, 79 % white, mean age 5 y. Primary analysis included 282 / 300 (94 %) children (n = 141 in each group). The garments were worn more often at night than in the day (median of 81 % of nights [25 th to 75 th centile 57 % to 96 %] and 34 % of days [25 th to 75 th centile 10 % to 76 %]). Geometric mean EASI scores at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo were, respectively, 9. 2, 6. 4, 5. 8, and 5. 4 for silk clothing and 8. 4, 6. 6, 6. 0, and 5. 4 for standard care. There was no evidence of any difference between the groups in EASI score averaged over all follow-up visits adjusted for baseline EASI score, age, and centre: adjusted ratio of geometric means 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 85 to 1. 07, (p = 0. 43). This confidence interval is equivalent to a difference of − 1. 5 to 0. 5 in the original EASI units, which is not clinically important. Skin infections occurred in 36 / 142 (25 %) and 39 / 141 (28 %) of children in the silk clothing and standard care groups, respectively. Even if the small observed treatment effect was genuine, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year was £ 56, 811 in the base case analysis from a National Health Service perspective, suggesting that silk garments are unlikely to be cost-effective using currently accepted thresholds.

40|$|<b>Atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (AD, <b>or</b> <b>atopic</b> <b>eczema)</b> is an {{inflammatory}} itchy skin disease. AD patients often have high serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, T-cell activation and eosinophilia in peripheral blood. The dermal infiltrate of AD contains mainly T-cells, eosinophils and dendritic cells. Epicutaneous patch tests with aeroallergen application for 24 - 48 h can induce eczematous lesions in sensitized patients with AD. This is named the atopy patch test (APT). The APT {{is used as}} in vivo research model to study the mechanisms involved in the induction of eczema by inhalant allergens. AD treatment consists of application of emollients and topical corticosteroids. Other topical treatment strategies are the relatively new topical calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. For more severe forms of AD, local phototherapy can be prescribed, but also oral use of ciclosporin A, corticosteroids, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate several therapeutic options for AD patients. We have focussed on two different systems to determine clinical efficacy 1) improvement of lesional, active AD skin and 2) inhibition of the APT as in vivo provocation model for allergic inflammation in AD. In chapter 2, medium-dose ultraviolet (UV) A 1 (340 - 400 nm) was compared with narrow-band UVB (311 nm) phototherapy. We demonstrate that both treatment modalities are clinically equal effective. This {{is supported by a}} decrease in inflammatory cell infiltrate in both treatment groups. Based on practical advantages of NB UVB, as well as patient-friendliness, which are less heat load and shorter duration of phototherapy, the preferred choice of phototherapy for AD should be NB UVB. In chapter 3, the clinical effect of the newly developed drug mepolizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody to interleukin 5 (IL- 5) aimed at eosinophil depletion, is investigated. We conclude that short-term intravenously administered treatment with mepolizumab has no clinical effect in AD patients, despite a significant decrease in peripheral blood eosinophils. Moreover, in chapter 5 we observe no inhibitory effect on the APT after mepolizumab therapy. So, despite a reduction of blood eosinophils, remaining blood eosinophils are able to migrate into the skin. Future studies are necessary to investigate if prolonged anti-IL- 5 therapy (> 3 months) results in a more rigorous depletion of blood eosinophils and consequently in a decrease of tissue eosinophils. In chapter 4, two frequently used APT methods were compared. It was concluded that both APT methods can be used as in vivo model to study the initiation of allergic inflammation in AD. In chapter 6 the influence of pretreatment with topical tacrolimus 0. 1 % on the APT was studied and compared with pretreatment with a topical corticosteroid and with placebo. Tacrolimus was not capable to inhibit the APT reaction, in contrast to the suppressive effect of pretreatment with topical corticosteroids. This suggests that preventive treatment of non-lesional skin with tacrolimus will not be effective in AD, in contrast to topical corticosteroids...|$|R

40|$|The {{aetiology}} of vesicular eruptions on {{the palms}} {{and on the}} sides of the fingers (pompholyx) is unclear. The present study was undertaken to establish whether tinea pedis, <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>or</b> nickel allergy is a risk factor for development of vesicular eruptions. Three-hundred-and-ninety-eight individuals (included from an ongoing population study on hand eczema in twins) were included. A history of previous hand eczema and <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> was taken, and a clinical examination including a patch test with nickel was performed. A test sample for tinea pedis was taken from the fourth interdigital space on the right foot. The relative risk for vesicular eruptions present in individuals with tinea pedis was 3. 58 (confidence limits 1. 19 – 10. 82, pv 0. 05). For individuals with <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> relative risk was 1. 44 (confidence limits 0. 34 – 6. 07, n. s.) and for those with nickel allergy it was 0. 45 (confidence limits 0. 06 – 3. 36, n. s.). A relationship between tinea pedis and vesicular eruptions on the hands was statistically confirmed in the present study. In this part of the population study material, no association with <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>or</b> nickel allergy was observed.

The purpose of this paper was to perform a meta-analysis of the existing studies regarding the role of birth weight in the occurrence of <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> We carried out an extensive search in the international databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge). We selected the cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies which analyzed the role of birth weight in the occurrence of <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> We performed a meta-analysis of the selected studies, and calculated the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). We included 10 studies in the final meta-analysis, which comprised 110974 patients. Weight classification was in compliance with Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) Health Indicators. In the first meta-analysis, we selected patients with low weight (below 2500 g) and <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and compared them with those with normal weight (2500 – 4000 g) and <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The analysis showed that low birth weight represents a protective factor in the occurrence of <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (<b>OR</b> = 0. 68, CI: 0. 63 – 0. 75, P< 0. 0001). In the second meta-analysis, we compared patients with high weight (over 4000 g) and <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> with those with normal weight and <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The results indicated that increased birth weight represents a risk factor for <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (<b>OR</b> = 1. 1; CI: 1. 02 – 1. 17; P = 0. 01) Thus, low birth weight represents a protective factor for the occurrence of <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and high birth weight represents a risk factor for the occurrence of this disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cutaneous {{homeostasis}} and {{defenses are}} maintained by permanent cross-talk among particular epidermal keratinocytes and immune cells residing or recruited in the skin, through {{the production of}} cytokines. If required, a coordinated inflammatory response is triggered, relayed by specific cytokines. Due to numerous reasons, troubles in the resolution of this phenomenon could generate a cytokine-mediated vicious circle, promoting skin chronic inflammation, the most common being <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and psoriasis. In this paper, we discuss the biological effects of cytokine on keratinocytes, more particularly on specific or shared cytokines involved in <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>or</b> psoriasis. We report and discuss monolayer or 3 D in vitro models of keratinocytes stimulated by specific sets of cytokines to mimic <b>atopic</b> <b>dermatitis</b> <b>or</b> psoriasis. IL- 22, TNFa, IL- 4, and IL- 13 combination is able to mimic an “atopic dermatitis like” state. In psoriasis lesions, over expression of IL- 17 is observed whereas IL- 4 and IL- 13 were not detected; the replacement of IL- 4 and IL- 13 by IL- 17 from this mix is able to mimic in vitro a “psoriasis like” status on keratinocytes. We conclude that specific cytokine environment deregulation plays a central role on skin morphology and innate immunity, moving towards specific pathologies and opening the way to new therapeutic strategies...|$|R
