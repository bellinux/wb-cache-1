500|$|Critical {{response}} to On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{has become much}} more positive in recent years. Film critic James Berardinelli summed this up in his review of the movie: [...] "with the exception of one production aspect, [...] is by far the best entry of the long-running James Bond series. The film contains some of the most exhilarating action sequences ever to reach the screen, a touching love story, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> subplot that has agent 007 crossing (and even threatening to resign from) Her Majesty's Secret Service. The problem is with Bond himself... George Lazenby is boring, and his ineffectualness lowers the picture's quality. Lazenby can handle the action sequences, but that's about all he masters." ...|$|E
500|$|The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first {{printed in}} Vogue in 1959, and {{included}} in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way – and I shan't – my Christmas Day {{eating and drinking}} would consist of an omelette and cold ham <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich {{with a glass of}} champagne on a tray in bed in the evening." [...] The pattern of the book follows that of earlier ones, with recipes interspersed with more discursive essays on subjects such as avocado pears, persimmons, historical menus, and Christmas hampers, and extracts from prose by writers whom David admired, including Sybille Bedford and George Eliot.|$|E

500|$|The single was {{released}} by Sony Music Entertainment Japan on June 16, 2005, containing four versions of the song. It reached #15 in the Oricon charts upon release and remained in the charts for six weeks. Opinions on the song have been generally positive. In his review of the soundtrack, Game-OSTs Simon Smith called it [...] "a soft jazz song with sultry smooth vocals <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> tune", and praised it despite it not becoming one of his favorites. Mike Wilson, writing for RPGFan, {{referred to it as}} [...] "possibly the most beautiful vocal I've ever heard in a video game." [...] Chris Greening of Game Music Online called it [...] "a strong rival to every single pop ballad released from Square Enix, proving rich yet accessible." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly took 3/164 on a batting paradise in the First Test at Trent Bridge as England scored 8/658 {{and forced}} Australia to follow on {{and hold on}} for a draw. In the Second Test at Lord's O'Reilly took 4/93 in the first innings and trapped Eddie Paynter for 99 to end a 222-run {{partnership}} with Hammond. In reply to England's 494, Australia {{were in danger of}} being forced to follow on; O'Reilly came in and made 42, featuring in a partnership of 85 in only 46 minutes with Bill Brown that enabled Australia to save the match: having been dropped by Paynter, he hit Hedley Verity for consecutive sixes to take Australia past the follow-on mark. [...] Brown recalled [...] "It was a nice day, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> wicket. O'Reilly came in, and I told him I'd take the quicks—Wellard and Farnes—and Tiger [...] took Verity." [...] Australia reached 422 and O'Reilly took 2/53 in the second innings as the match petered into a draw.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV {{stated that}} the video manages to combine {{elements}} from her previous music videos, such as the style of [...] "Everytime" [...] and the attitude of [...] "Stronger". He also {{referred to it as}} [...] "a pretty amazing amalgamation of all things Brit, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> primer of her entire career up to this point". Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps compared the party in the video to the 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut and added that [...] "this may be the first Spears video ever crafted strictly with the morally-lax Internet in mind, a brazen clip that doesn't have to tone down its explicit nature lyrically and visually in order to get airplay". Chris Johnson of the Daily Mail compared Spears' housewife style to one of her looks in a 2001 Pepsi commercial. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "it's kind of difficult to believe the song's real meaning will get past even the thickest listener, the video itself is pretty tame...almost disappointingly so". The reviewer also compared the hairstyle of Spears during the housewife scenes to Marilyn Monroe.|$|E

500|$|Reviews were positive, {{though most}} critics {{found that the}} {{character}} of Eko was killed too soon in the show. Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that while [...] "The Cost of Living" [...] was the best episode of season 3 thus far with [...] "an illuminating flashback, some heavy island juju <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> mix of the campers and the Others", the death of Eko removed from Lost [...] "one of its most compelling characters and best actors, which just flat-out sucks." [...] Kristin dos Santos of E! Online called Mr. Eko [...] "the best character of the show", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated that she would miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and found Juliet's message {{to be the best}} part of the episode, that like the rest of season three [...] "answered a few questions (whose tumor?), raised a few questions (who's the eye-patch guy?), and ignored many long-standing questions (how did Yemi and Eko crash on the same island?)." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, critics {{gave the}} song {{generally}} positive reviews. MacKenzie Wilson, {{in his review}} from Allmusic, notes, [...] "Coldplay's indie rock inclinations are also obvious, especially on songs such as 'Don't Panic' and 'Shiver'." [...] In the Pitchfork Media review, Spencer Owen writes, [...] "This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of 'We live in a beautiful world,' which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record." [...] Robert Christgau alleged that, along with [...] "Yellow", the song {{was one of only}} two good ones on all of Parachutes. Critic Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, compliments, [...] "Both the vocals and guitar are utterly beautiful. It's a song to take solace from, draw comfort from, be quietly awed by." [...] David DeVoe of Hybridmagazine.com wrote: [...] "It is a wonderful song that echoes the promise of what is to come {{on the rest of the}} record. 'Don’t Panic' is filled with excellent guitar tones <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> grooving back beat, and I love the way the song ends." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode premiered to near {{universal}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave it 9.6/10, {{and thought}} it was [...] "one of the most balanced and well-executed episodes of the series, Fringe fans get action, suspense, emotion, and best of all, some revelations!... This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But {{the most important thing is}} that the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a pretty damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off. Pretty interesting stuff. It's nice to finally have a reason to point at for Walter's craziness".|$|E

500|$|Other {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic}} about the season. Peter Bowes of BBC News felt the season was simply a [...] "soap opera" [...] with [...] "pretty young people". Bowes believes the season suffered from the [...] "sentimental boy-girl storyline", but that die-hard Superman fans would still be taken in by this incarnation of the character's early years. A common criticism for the first season {{was the use of}} [...] "villain of the week" [...] storylines. By the time the first seven episodes aired, at least one journalist had had enough of the villain of the week format. Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen stated the series works best with its [...] "character interaction <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> performance by John Schneider as Pa Kent", but that the show needs more than the [...] "'monster of the week' stories seen so far". Jordan Levin, president of The WB's Entertainment division, recognized the concerns that the show had become a villain of the week series. Levin announced that season two would see more [...] "smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes, to get away from some of the formulaic storytelling structure" [...] the series has fallen into.|$|E
500|$|Todd Martens {{from the}} Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Celebration" [...] {{works as a}} throwaway, midsummer dance pop number. However, {{he felt that the}} song had modest goals, [...] "at least by Madonna's standards. Even when it gets a bit risque [...] silliness rules the day. She invites us 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus." [...] He went on to add that the song [...] "is an {{effective}} look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [...] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter." [...] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "unapologetically dance-y" [...] but felt [...] "disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme for the umpteenth time without even the slightest bit of linguistic flair." [...] Chris Williams from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots." [...] It further added that [...] "'Celebration' [...] a score for Madonna's retro-futuristic fan base <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> bookend to her collection of chart glories." ...|$|E
500|$|The last of {{the books}} planned by David was Elizabeth David's Christmas (2003). She and Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as the}} 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out the author's papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. The Christmas recipes David had most often been asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page work. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks. The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first printed in Vogue in 1959, and included in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way—and I shan't—my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a glass of champagne on a tray in bed in the evening." ...|$|E

500|$|The stereo {{version of}} the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono {{version of the}} song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very {{prominent}} during the first 50 seconds of the mono version—along with some special effects—but inaudible in the stereo mix until the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967, with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, {{in an attempt to}} create a shorter version, with overdubs in June of that year, the Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>Nice</b> Pair. Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length to something more manageable, Smith relented for [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", as Jenner recalled: [...] "It was definitely the deal that—hey, here you can do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you can do what you like, you can do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit [...] [...] [...] and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that." [...] A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song. After the drum roll, the opening riff is played with severe stereo panning.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it {{four out of}} five stars. Forcella praised the Jim–Dwight dynamic in the episode and wrote, [...] "Jim and Dwight, and especially the latter, were terrific." [...] In addition, Forcella positively compared the character growth of Nellie Bertam to Michael Scott, noting [...] "the most heartwarming moment [...] her scene with Pam, in which Nellie was so happy to have made a friend, reminded me of so many Michael Scott moments of the past." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger from The California Literary Review wrote moderately positive of the episode, saying, [...] "Tonight's episode worked for the most part thanks to the ever reliable Robert California and the usually reliable Jim and Dwight: Partners." [...] However, he did retroactively criticize season eight for not elaborating on the problems facing Dunder Mifflin until [...] "Turf War". In addition, he called the premise of Andy seeking Wallace's help [...] "iffy ... even if it was predictable". Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave wrote, [...] "The immediate, don't over-analyze opinion here is that 'Turf War' is a top three episode of season 8, with a chance of it being number one." [...] Furthermore, he concluded that the episode [...] "was good, very good, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> way to get set for the season/series finale. ... The Office can still bring it when it wants to." ...|$|E
500|$|The West Indian tour of England in 1928 {{included}} the team's first Test matches. However, all three Test matches were lost by an innings {{and the poor}} overall results led commentators to judge the team unsuccessful. The review of the tour in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack suggested: [...] "Everybody was compelled to realise that the playing of Test Matches between England and West Indies was a mistake". The batsmen in particular struggled {{to adapt to the}} unfamiliar conditions and the wet summer. The Wisden report singled out Roach as a success, and the best of the batsmen who had not toured England before: [...] "Possessed of strong defence <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> variety of stroke—especially on the off-side—he created a distinctly favourable impression, and he added to his abilities as a run-getter the further qualifications of being a brilliant fieldsman—especially at cover point." [...] In total, Roach scored 1,222 first-class runs during the tour at an average of 26.56. Although he did not score a century, he passed fifty nine times, with a highest score of 92 against the Minor Counties. He finished fifth in the first-class batting averages for the team, and also took two wickets. Making his Test debut in the first Test match, Roach scored 0 and 16. In the second match, promoted to open the batting, he scored 50 and 0, and in the final game had scores of 53, part of an opening partnership of 91 in 70 minutes with George Challenor, and 12. He was fourth in the West Indian Test batting averages, but only one other player, Joe Small, reached fifty in the series, and he only did so once.|$|E

500|$|Brown's {{most celebrated}} innings {{came in the}} Second Test at Lord's, {{carrying}} his bat to score 206 in the first televised Test match. England batted first and amassed 494, largely {{on the back of}} Wally Hammond's 240. Brown featured in an opening stand of 69 before Fingleton was dismissed. Hedley Verity then bowled Bradman for 18, leaving the score at 101, before Stan McCabe fell after a quickfire 38 with the score at 3/152. Brown registered his century in 193 minutes, during an innings highlighted by his driving {{on both sides of the}} wicket. After Lindsay Hassett was dismissed for 56 following a 134-run partnership, Australia reached stumps at 5/299, with Brown on 140. The following day, Brown set about ensuring that Australia would avoid the follow on, featuring in an aggressive eighth-wicket stand with tailender Bill O'Reilly. The pair added 85 runs in just 46 minutes, with Brown recalling [...] "It was a nice day, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> wicket. O'Reilly came in, and I told him I'd take the quicks—Wellard and Farnes—and Tiger [...] took Verity." [...] Brown continued past his double century and remained unbeaten on 206 from just 375 minutes when his last partner fell, leaving Australia all out for 422. Brown's innings was the 100th century by an Australian against England, and the highest Test score for batsman carrying his bat; it stood until Glenn Turner made an unbeaten 223 in 1972. Ray Robinson quipped that Brown's performance [...] "did not cause smoke to rise from the back of those [...] sets but the charm of his style gave viewers a favourable impression of Australian batsmanship". They went on to draw the match, which was crucial in Australia's eventual retention of the Ashes. Brown's uninterrupted batting meant that he was on the field from the first morning until late on the fourth day.|$|E
