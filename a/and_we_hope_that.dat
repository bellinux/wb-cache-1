500|$|During the {{beginning}} of season three, Chris Carabott from IGN described Ben as [...] "one of the best 'villains on television', due to his 'eerie manner' and 'methodical delivery'". Later in the season Carabott {{had a problem with}} Ben being so deceptive, as [...] "anything he imparts must be taken with a grain of salt". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also noted this, saying [...] "I don't trust Ben. I have no idea when he's lying and when he's telling the truth. The only thing I'm reasonably sure of is that everything he says is for the purpose of impacting a character — and the audience". Ben's father issues revealed towards the end of season three are described as [...] "not the most original Lost character trait by any means but it is the thrust behind Ben's development into the genocidal maniac he eventually becomes". Following the penultimate episode of the season, Carabott stated [...] "Even with his limited screen time, Michael Emerson's performance shines through <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> he survives the events of the finale because we love seeing his character every week." [...] Erin Martell from TV Squad picked the Others as one of her season three highlights, partly due to the development of Ben, adding [...] "I cannot even picture the final three seasons without Ben". Martell also gave six reasons to look forward to season four, one of which was Ben Linus.|$|E

"The sublime {{character}} of this amphibian seemed to us an admirable example to idealistic poets, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> in our 'holy pond' {{we should be able}} to armour ourselves against the base prosaic world, just as we always used to, minding nothing except maybe changes in temperature."

[...] "...in essence our relations are relations between two states <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> under the new presidential term the Turkish-U.S. relations will be much better. That is our expectation. I saw an intense campaign for Hillary Clinton's victory. Artists, sportsmen, all personalities worked for Clinton's victory. But in elections, it is important to embrace the people. No one has won elections through newspaper headlines, opinion polls or television (campaigns)." ...|$|E

We feel pretty good about where we are." [...] Quartz reported that stock was up by 30 percent, compared to the same period in the previous year, while Chen expressed enthusiasm for the release of two new handsets, both with keyboards and touch screens, in the second half of 2014. Chen did not provide sales figures for the Z3 phone in Indonesia.|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 2010, Pixie Lott {{returned}} to Brentwood County High School unannounced to students {{to perform a}} small concert in the school's main sports hall and answer questions from students. Past headteacher, Mrs. Carol Mason said “We are very proud to have had Pixie Lott come to our school. Brentwood County High School has an active extra-curricular music programme <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> Pixie Lott’s visit on Friday will encourage even more students {{to get involved with}} music and possibly take up a musical instrument.

2500|$|Armenian {{authorities}} {{responded to}} {{comments made by}} Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan during his official visit to Baku that, [...] "There is a relation {{of cause and effect}} here. The occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh is the cause, and the closure of the border is the effect. Without the occupation ending, the gates will not be opened," [...] with a statement from the office of Armenian President Sarksyan that read, [...] "The president said that, as he repeatedly pointed out during Armenian-Turkish contacts, any Turkish attempt to interfere in the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem can only harm that process." [...] Armenian Foreign Minister Nalbandian reiterated that, [...] "Concerning the Armenian-Turkish normalisation process, over the past year, following the initiative of the Armenian President together with our Turkish neighbours {{and with the help of}} our Swiss partners, we have advanced toward opening one of the last closed borders in Europe and the normalisation of our relations without preconditions. The ball is on the Turkish side now. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> they will find the wisdom and the courage to make the last decisive step. We wish to be confident that the necessary political will can eventually leave behind the mentality of the past." ...|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} she stood over her dead cubs, Umslopogaas hanging from her mouth, and looked at them as though she wondered; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> she might let him fall. Then, hearing our cries, she turned and bounded away towards the bush, bearing Umslopogaas in her mouth. We seized our spears and followed; but the ground grew stony, <b>and,</b> search as <b>we</b> would, we could find no trace of Umslopogaas or of the lioness. They had {{vanished}} like a cloud.

60|$|The lecture was {{listened to}} with great {{attention}} {{by a large}} audience, and was certainly most attractive.
