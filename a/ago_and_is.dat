5|$|Mauna Kea {{is one of}} five hotspot volcanoes {{that form}} the island of Hawaii, the largest and {{youngest}} island of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Of these five volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago. Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000years <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> currently dormant. Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit. A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.|$|E
5|$|The Anatolian peninsula, {{comprising}} most {{of modern}} Turkey, {{is one of}} the oldest permanently settled regions in the world. Various ancient Anatolian populations have lived in Anatolia, from at least the Neolithic period until the Hellenistic period. Many of these peoples spoke the Anatolian languages, a branch of the larger Indo-European language family. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European Hittite and Luwian languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical centre from which the Indo-European languages radiated. The European part of Turkey, called Eastern Thrace, has also been inhabited since at least forty thousand years <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> known to have been in the Neolithic era by about 6000 BC.|$|E

5|$|As {{they reach}} the lobby, Denham and Shaw return, {{revealing}} the Thanksgiving court date as a ruse. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and, for violating his bail by not declaring the latter, has him remanded back into federal custody until his real court date. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts {{on the condition that}} Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior. Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5billion years <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.|$|E
5|$|The {{demise of}} the once {{thriving}} canal and maltings businesses brought about a serious decline in Banagher's fortunes, including a significant population decrease. However, a number of businesses kept {{many people in the}} locality employed during lean times. The most notable of these was Bord na Móna, a semi-state company founded in 1946 to manage the harvesting of peat from Ireland's bogs, the most extensive of which are located in the midlands. However, the advancement of mechanised harvesting, the exhaustion of the bogs and the closure of a number of peat-fired power stations, means that this is no longer a significant employer in the region. Green Isle Foods had a facility just outside Banagher and provided good employment during the 1970s and 1980s. It was taken out of production some years <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> now used as a storage facility only. The largest industry in Banagher these days is Banagher Precast Concrete Limited, a company specialising in precast concrete structures. The company employs approximately 150 people {{and was one of the}} largest concrete firms in the country, employing over 400 people at its peak in 2008. It has supplied components for many major projects, including the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park, Channel Tunnel, the Dublin Port Tunnel, Thomond Park and the Limerick Tunnel, and most recently Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. Other notable employers include Banagher Sawmills and the cruise liner businesses located at the marina.|$|E

25|$|These {{researchers}} therefore {{speculate that}} the putative impact and associated crater {{may have contributed to}} this separation by weakening the earth's crust at this location. These bracketing dates also make it possible that the site could be associated with the Permian–Triassic extinction event. The Permian–Triassic extinction occurred 250 million years <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> believed to be the largest extinction event since the origin of complex multicellular life.|$|E
25|$|The {{aardwolf}} (Proteles cristata) {{can trace}} its lineage directly back to Plioviverrops 15 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> the only {{survivor of the}} dog-like hyena lineage. Its success is partly attributed to its insectivorous diet, for which it faced no competition from canids crossing from North America. Its unrivaled ability to digest the terpene excretions from soldier termites is likely a modification of the strong digestive system its ancestors used to digest fetid carrion.|$|E
25|$|The female {{component}} of GSI in the Solanaceae {{was found in}} 1989. Proteins {{in the same family}} were subsequently discovered in the Rosaceae and Plantaginaceae. Despite some early doubts about the common ancestry of GSI in these distantly related families, phylogenetic studies and the finding of shared male determinants (F-box proteins) clearly established homology. Consequently, this mechanism arose approximately 90 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> the inferred ancestral state for approximately 50% of all plants.|$|E

It is characterized by ice marginal formations and glaciolacustrine plains, the latter of which are now mostly covered by extensive bogs and, to a much lesser extent, fens.

25|$|In humans, the {{preferentially}} expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) {{gene family}} is expanded. It is actively expressed in cancers, but normally is testis-specific, possibly involved in spermatogenesis. The PRAME family has 26 members on human chromosome 1. In the macaque, it has eight, {{and has been}} very simple and stable for millions of years. The PRAME family arose in translocations in the common mouse-primate ancestor 85 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> expanded on mouse chromosome 4.|$|E
25|$|The breed {{falls under}} the {{mitochondrial}} DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia.

Subclade d1 originated 480-3,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia and its branch on the phylogenetic tree is rooted in the same sequence as the 33,000 year-old Altai dog (not a direct ancestor).|$|E
