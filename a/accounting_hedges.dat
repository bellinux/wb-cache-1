40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{a change in}} accounting treatment for derivative instruments used to hedge firms 2 ̆ 7 market risk exposures affects corporate risk-management and if so, which factors {{increase the likelihood that}} a change in accounting treatment will affect risk-management. I analyze a sample of firms that restated their financial statements due to the misclassification of economic hedges as <b>accounting</b> <b>hedges,</b> both of which are derivative instruments used to reduce firms 2 ̆ 7 market risk exposures and differ only in accounting treatment. Economic hedges are accounted for under fair value accounting whereas <b>accounting</b> <b>hedges</b> receive hedge accounting treatment, the preferred method because it avoids the increase in earnings volatility associated with fair value accounting. ^ I first examine why certain firms use hedge accounting treatment following the restatement and other firms do not. I find that the type of hedging instrument used, the market risk that was being hedged, and the disclosed reason for the restatement affect the likelihood that firms will apply hedge accounting following the restatement. Firms that do not use hedge accounting following the restatement face a trade-off between continuing the economic hedge which increases earnings volatility, and discontinuing the hedge which avoids the increase in earnings volatility but increases market risk exposure. I find that dividends, tax benefits and firms 2 ̆ 7 historic patterns of reporting positive earnings are associated with the likelihood that firms discontinue economic hedges, increasing market risk exposure. I also find that leverage, growth, distress and analyst following are associated with the likelihood that firms continue economic hedges, maintaining market risk exposure but increasing earnings volatility. This study provides an example of how a change in accounting treatment affects firm behavior and results of this study contribute to our understanding of firm characteristics which influence managers to focus on accounting earnings versus market risk exposure. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the controversy surrounding the inability of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 (SFAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to portray the economics of hedging. This research examined whether or not the possibility of increased volatility evolved from economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 prompted Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) to adjust their corporate risk management strategy to one that is more accounting responsive. Based on the results of {{this research}}, BHCs’ which increased the level of <b>accounting</b> <b>hedges</b> and decreased the level of economic hedges experienced a significant decrease in earnings volatility relative to pre-SFAS 133. The findings suggest that BHCs ’ ability to reduce earnings volatility and increase earnings smoothing to meet analysts ’ expectations after the 2008 amendment of SFAS 133 has an adverse impact on BHCs ’ continual use of economic hedges. Analysts and investors are recommended to evaluate further BHCs ’ risk strategies to gain a better representation of their risk paradigm with derivatives. This study extends prior research on corporate risk management activities of BHCs and contributes to social change by presenting new affirmation to investors of the influence of SFAS 133 economic hedges on earnings volatility...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{economic}} consequences of alternative <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> rules {{in terms of}} managerial hedging decisions and wealth effects for shareholders.

40|$|Abstract US GAAP {{as well as}} IAS (IFRS) contain {{specific}} <b>accounting</b> {{regulations for}} <b>hedging</b> activities. Basically the <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> rules ensure that an offsetting gain or loss from a hedging instrument affects earnings {{in the same period}} as the gain or loss from the hedged item. However, due to the way <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> rules are set up, their application turns out to be an option rather than an obligation for firms. Recognizing this fact, the paper analyses corporate incentives for <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> {{in the presence of a}} moral hazard problem. We consider a two-period LEN-type agency model with a risk averse agent and a risk neutral principal. The principal decides upon hedging and motivates effort through an incentive contract based on accounting income. We find that in such a setting the principal strictly prefers hedging as opposed to no hedging. Whether he prefers <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> or not depends on how the firm's overall risk exposure is allocated over periods. If risk exposures differ largely over periods the principal prefers <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting.</b> Otherwise no <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> is preferred. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis did not expose specific weaknesses with <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> {{in the same}} way as it is claimed for classification measurement and impairment. The <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> model in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 has been criticised as being complex, rule-based, and failing to reflect companies’ activities related to risk management. <b>Hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> is a controversial topic in financial reporting and has long been an area of difficulty both for companies seeking to inform investors about what they are doing and for standard-setters in their attempt to apply the appropriate regulation. Some consider that it causes profit or loss volatility from what might be regarded as ‘artificial’ hedge ineffectiveness which is not representative of the entity’s risk management activities. To improve financial reporting and better reflect risk management activities the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) decided that comprehensive changes were needed. As a result, the new IFRS 9 Financial Instruments develop a model for <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> that is more representative of the risk activities.

40|$|Since January 1, 2005 all {{publicly}} traded companies within the EU must prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

This applied in particular to <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting,</b> i. e. the accounting for financial instruments held with the purpose of reducing exposures to various kinds of risks. Prior to the transition to IFRS, <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> was a virtually unregulated area in Sweden.

40|$|Este trabalho investiga, no mercado acionário brasileiro, o efeito da contabilidade de hedge na qualidade das informações contábeis divulgadas, no {{disclosure}} dos instrumentos financeiros derivativos e na assimetria de informação. Para medir a qualidade da informação contábil, foram utilizadas as métricas de relevância da informação contábil e informatividade dos lucros contábeis. Para a execução deste trabalho, foi constituída uma amostra geral com empresas brasileiras, não financeiras, listadas na Bolsa de Valores de São Paulo, compreendendo as 150 empresas com maior valor de mercado em 01 / 01 / 2014. A partir da amostra geral, foram constituídas amostras para a aplicação dos modelos de value relevance, informativeness, disclosure e assimetria de informação. A amostra para relevância contou com 758 observações firmas-anos, para o período de 2008 a 2013. A amostra para informatividade contou com 701 observações firmas-anos, para o período de 2008 a 2013. A amostra para disclosure contou com 100 observações firmas-anos, para o período de 2011 a 2012. A amostra para assimetria de informação contou com 100 observações firmas-anos, para o período de 2011 a 2012. Para as análises dos dados, utilizou-se regressões com errospadrão robustos com abordagem POLS e Efeitos Fixos, aplicadas sobre dados em painel. Complementarmente, para as análises do efeito do <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> sobre o disclosure e assimetria de informação, foi aplicado o método de Propensity Score Matching. As evidências encontradas para a influência da contabilidade de hedge na relevância da informação contábil apontaram uma relação positiva e significante na interação com o LL. Na análise da informatividade dos lucros contábeis, a pesquisa evidenciou uma relação negativa e estatisticamente significante do lucro quando interagido com a variável dummy de <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting.</b> Quanto às evidências encontradas para a influência do <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> sobre o disclosure dos derivativos, verificou-se uma relação positiva e estatisticamente significante da dummy de <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> com o indicador de evidenciação dos derivativos.

Adicionalmente, incorporamse às análises econométricas uma análise descritiva, na amostra geral, da utilização do <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> no Brasil, para o ano de 2013. Dentre as 150 empresas da amostra, 49 empresas utilizaram <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting,</b> onde 41 empresas adotam apenas 1 tipo de hedge.

This work investigates, in the Brazilian stock market, {{the effect}} of <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> {{on the quality of}} accounting information disclosed, in the disclosure of derivative financial instruments and information asymmetry. To measure the quality of accounting information, the metrics of relevance of accounting information and accounting earnings informativeness were used. For the execution of this work, a general sample consisted of non-financial Brazilian companies, listed on São Paulo’s Stock Market, comprising 150 companies with the highest market value in 01 / 01 / 2014. From the overall sample, samples were set up for the implementation of models of value relevance, informativeness, disclosure and information asymmetry. The relevance sample included 758 firms–years observations for the period ranging from 2008 to 2013. The sample for informativeness included 701 firms–years observations for the period from 2008 to 2013. The sample for disclosure had 100 firms–year observations, for the period from 2011 to 2012. The sample for information asymmetry had 100 firms–years observations for the period 2011 to 2012. For the statistical analysis, we used regressions with robust standard errors with POLS approach and Fixed Effects, applied to panel data. In addition to the analysis of {{the effect of}} <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> on the disclosure and information asymmetry, we applied the method of propensity score matching. The evidence for the influence of <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> on the relevance of accounting information showed a positive and significant relationship in the interaction with earnings. In the informativeness of accounting earnings analysis, the research showed a negative and statistically significant relationship between earnings when interacted and the <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> dummy variable. As for the evidence found for the influence of <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> on the disclosure of derivatives, there was a positive and statistically significant relationship between the <b>hedge</b> <b>accounting</b> dummy and the disclosure indicator of derivatives.

We adopt a model introduced by Frey and Stremme and show that, under the original assumptions of the model, pinning is driven by two effects: a hedging-dependent drift term that pushes the stock price toward the strike price and a hedging-dependent volatility term that constrains the stock price near the strike as it approaches it.
