40|$|A brief {{outline of}} <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> {{research}} is presented and {{is followed by}} a discussion of large scale wind tunnel test results for a swept <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> configuration. The results show that the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> can be applied to high speed swept wing designs with little adverse effect on either the basic performance of the augmentor or the longitudinal characteristics, including maximum lift and stall. Three lateral control devices were shown to be effective and ground effect was measured for several complete aircraft configurations...|$|E
40|$|The STOLAND system {{includes}} air data, navigation, guidance, {{flight director}} (including a throttle flight director on the <b>Augmentor</b> <b>Wing),</b> 3 -axis autopilot and autothrottle functions. The 3 -axis autopilot and autothrottle control through parallel electric servos on both aircraft {{and on the}} <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing,</b> the system also interfaces with three electrohydraulic series actuators which drive the roll control surfaces, elevator and rudder. The system incorporates automatic configuration control of the flaps and nozzles on the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> and of the flaps on the Twin Otter. Interfaces are also provided to control the wing flap chokes on the <b>Augmentor</b> <b>Wing</b> and the spoilers on the Twin Otter. The STOLAND system has all the capabilities of a conventional integrated avionics system. Aircraft stabilization is provided in pitch, roll and yaw including control wheel steering in pitch and roll. The basic modes include altitude hold and select, indicated airspeed hold and select, flight path angle hold and select, and heading hold and select. The system can couple to TACAN and VOR/DME navaids for conventional radial flying...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of separation in corners of thrust <b>augmentor</b> <b>wings</b> having Coanda jets was investigated using hot film surface sensors and pressure transducers. Separation {{on the test}} augmentor began at a corner {{very close to the}} augmentor exit and then rapidly proceeded upstream. Measurements of the pressure fields in the corner region indicated that a modified form of the Stratford criterion could be used to predict the onset of separation. Testing was conducted over a range of nozzle pressure ratios, aspect ratios, diffuser angles, and designs of the boundary layer and Coanda nozzles...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{research}} on advanced augmentors are discussed. Research concerned with performance has indicated that: (1) augmentors with lobe-type nozzles give higher thrust augmentation than those with slot-type primary nozzles, (2) the thrust of <b>augmentor</b> <b>wings</b> at forward speed is {{greater than that of}} internally blown flaps for the speed range of interest, and (3) the optimum augmentor geometry at forward speed may be different from the optimum static geometry. Analysis of augmentor-wing data has shown that the data may be correlated by accounting for the augmentation and entrainment in defining a net thrust coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in the Ames 40 by 80 foot wind tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a large-scale V/STOL aircraft model with thrust augmentors. The model had a double-delta wing of aspect ratio 1. 65 with augmentors located in the wing root and the wing trailing edge. The supply air for the augmentor primary nozzles {{was provided by the}} YJ- 97 turbojet engine. The airflow was apportioned approximately 74 percent to the <b>wing</b> root <b>augmentor</b> and 24 percent to <b>wing</b> <b>augmentor.</b> Results were obtained at several trailing-edge flap deflections with the nozzle jet-momentum coefficients ranging from 0 to 7. 9. Three-component longitudinal data are presented with the agumentor operating with and without the horizontal tail. A limited amount of six component data are also presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} and economics of a twin-engine <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> airplane were evaluated in two phases. Design {{aspects of the}} over-the-wing/internally blown flap hybrid, <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing,</b> and mechanical flap aircraft were investigated for 910 m. field length with parametric extension to other field lengths. Fuel savings achievable by application of advanced lift concepts to short-haul aircraft were evaluated {{and the effect of}} different field lengths, cruise requirements, and noise levels on fuel consumption and airplane economics at higher fuel prices were determined. Conclusions and recommendations are presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} mission {{study was}} made of the range and jet noise of an advanced supersonic transport (AST) employing an <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> and four duct burning turbofan engines. The airplane weight and aerodynamic characteristics of the Boeing 2707 - 300 airplane with a gross weight of 750, 000 pounds and 234 passengers was used for the study. Engine thrust was fixed at 58, 000 pounds per engine and engine size was increased to obtain the required thrust at reduced power settings for jet noise reduction. Turbofan engine core noise was reduced to FAR 36 noise levels and lower by proper selection of turbine inlet temperature, bypass ratio and fan pressure ratio. The study showed that an <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> can reduce the bypass jet noise sufficiently so that total noise levels below FAR 36 can be attained without significant range penalties if the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> can be designed without severe weight and performance penalties...|$|E
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{investigations}} of the acoustic characteristics of the externally blown jet flap (EBF) and <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> STOL concepts are dicussed. The large-scale EBF model was equipped with a triple-slotted blown by four JT 15 D turbofan engines with circular, coannular exhaust nozzles. The large-scale <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> model was equipped with an unlined augmentor blown by a slot primary nozzle. The effects of airspeed and angle of attack on the acoustics of the EBF were small. At a forward speed of 60 knots, the impingement noise of the landing flap was approximately 2 db lower than in the static tests. Angle of attack increased the impingement noise approximately 0. 1 decibels per degree. Flap deflection had a greater effect on the acoustics of the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> than did airspeed. For a nozzle pressure ratio of 1. 9, the peak perceived noise level of the landing flap was 3 to 5 PNdb {{higher than that of}} the takeoff flap. The total sound power was also significantly higher for landing indicating that turning in the augmentor generated acoustic energy. Airspeed produced a small aft shift in acoustic directivity with no significant change in the peak perceived noise levels or sound power levels...|$|E
40|$|A {{project to}} develop an {{experimental}} aircraft for use as an inflight demonstrator of the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing,</b> short takeoff concept is discussed. The required modifications were made on a de Havilland C- 8 A aircraft. The modifications to the aircraft are explained {{and the performance of}} the modified aircraft is reported...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{principles}} {{relating to}} the accomplishment of V/STOL flight are reviewed as they pertain to current prototype developments. Particular consideration {{is given to the}} jet flap, flow augmentation and circulation control separately and in combination. Configurations as the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing,</b> upper-surface blown flaps, externally blown flaps and the circulation-controlled rotor are also examined...|$|E
40|$|The direct {{operating}} costs and noise impacts {{of a wide variety}} of Externally Blown Flap and <b>Augmentor</b> <b>Wing</b> STOL short haul transport aircraft designs were evaluated to study the costs of noise reduction for these types of aircraft. The "two-stream" <b>Augmentor</b> <b>Wing</b> designs were found to be capable of the greatest noise reductions, and to have the lowest direct {{operating costs}} at all levels of noise impact. Sideline noise levels of 81 PNdB at 500 feet were attainable for an 80 seat aircraft with an 8 to 15 percent increase in direct operating cost over an aircraft designed with no constraints on noise.

S. thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1973 Includes bibliographical references (p. 69 - 71) Supported by the Transportation Systems Center of the Department of Transportatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} gained in {{over four years}} of STOL operations with the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> research aircraft and the background of operation of other STOL powered-lift aircraft indicate that the use and percent of lift achieved by powered lift have significant effects on the operational characteristics of STOL aircraft and, therefore, on the performance that can be achieved. A {{brief description of the}} <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> including the means by which it achieves its powered lift is presented. Specific problem areas relating to the control of longitudinal flight path are discussed as well as the consequences these might have on the design and operation of this class of aircraft. Particular emphasis is given to the approach and landing phase of flight where the consequences of the powered lift are most pronounced, and the resultant characteristics most different from those of conventional aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{simulations}} of powered-lift STOL transport aircraft having either an externally blown flap configuration or an <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> configuration were conducted. The following types of simulators of varying sophistication were used: (1) a simple fixed-base simulation {{with a simple}} visual display, (2) a more complex fixed-base simulation using a realistic transport cockpit and a high-quality visual display, and (3) a six-degree-of-freedom motion simulator that had a realistic transport cockpit and a sophisticated visual display. The unaugmented flying qualities determined from these simulations were rated as unacceptable for both the externally blown flap and <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> configurations. The longitudinal, lateral-directional, and single-engine-failure characteristics were rated satisfactory with extensive augmentation, including pitch and roll command systems, flight-path (or speed) augmentation, turn coordination, and effective yaw damping. However, the flare and landing characteristics from any approach glide-path angle in excess of 4 deg were rated as unsatisfactory but acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Static {{noise and}} {{performance}} {{tests were conducted}} on a 1 / 4 -scale jet flap model with a multilobe nozzle of array area ratio of 2. 7. The model nozzle and flap tested were a two-dimensional section of a distributed blowing system similar to previously investigated <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> systems without the upper shroud and intake door. Noise data were measured with the nozzle alone and also during attached flow conditions with the flap at two turning angles representing takeoff and approach conditions. The noise data are scaled to a 200, 000 -lb TOGW four-engine airplane and are presented in terms of perceived noise level and one-third octave band sound pressure level. Comparisons are made with the noise levels produced by an <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> airplane fitted with a three-element acoustically lined augmentor flap. The static performance is presented in terms of thrust recovery and effective turning angle...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulator}} {{study of}} STOL airworthiness was conducted using {{a model of}} an <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> transport. The approach, flare and landing, go-around, and takeoff phases of flight were investigated. The simulation and the data obtained are described. These data include performance measures, pilot commentary, and pilot ratings. A pilot/vehicle analysis of glide slope tracking and of the flare maneuver is included...|$|E
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the nature, strength, and variation with airspeed of the acoustic sources of the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> propulsive-lift concept. The <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> overall noise {{is dominated by the}} high frequency jet mixing noise characteristic of the lobed primary nozzle. The augmentor modifies the intensity and propagation characteristics of the jet sources, especially those that exist inside the augmentor. The interaction of the turbulent flow with the augmentor creates low-frequency, low-intensity surface noise and trailing edge noise. These sources dominate any jet mixing noise that is present at the low frequencies and could become significant if the jet noise was suppressed by treating the augmentor with a lining tuned to the jet noise source location. The far-field noise of the untreated augmentor is unaffected by airspeed; however, {{this may not be the}} case when the jet noise is suppressed, because the trailing edge surface pressure and correlations with far-field noise do show a reduction with forward speed...|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} and {{the characteristics of}} quiet, clean propulsion systems for STOL aircraft are discussed. Engines are evaluated for <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> and externally blown flap STOL aircraft with the engines located both under and over the wings. Some supporting test data are presented. Optimum engines are selected based on achieving the performance, economic, acoustic, and pollution goals presently being considered for future STOL aircraft. The data and results presented were obtained {{from a number of}} contracted studies and some supporting NASA inhouse programs, most of which began in early 1972. The contracts include: (1) two aircraft and mission studies, (2) two propulsion system studies, (3) the experimental and analytic work on the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing,</b> and (4) the experimental programs on Q-Fan. Engines are selected and discussed based on aircraft economics using the direct operating cost as the primary criterion. This cost includes the cost of the crew, fuel, aircraft, and engine maintenance and depreciation...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic and {{aerodynamic}} {{data were}} obtained for a full-scale section of an <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing.</b> Features of the design included a single-row, multielement nozzle array and acoustically tuned panels placed on the interior surfaces of the augmentor. When the data were extrapolated to a 91, 000 -kilogram aircraft, the calculated sideline perceived noise levels were approximately the same for either the takeoff or approach condition...|$|E
40|$|Navigation and {{guidance}} sensor error characteristics were measured during STOL approach-flight investigations. Data {{from some of}} the state sensors of a digital avionics system were compared to corresponding outputs from an inertial navigation system.

Data were recorded with the <b>Augmentor</b> <b>Wing</b> Jet STOL Research Aircraft parked and in flight...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in sonic inlet technology {{are presented with}} particular emphasis on STOL propulsion systems. Inlet noise reduction requirements are considered for an <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> and an upper surface blowing type of propulsion system.

An acoustic and aerodynamic performance comparison is presented for several inlet configurations based on experimental results...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} go-around {{control system}} was evaluated on the <b>Augmentor</b> <b>Wing</b> Jet Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) Research Airplane (AWJSRA) {{as part of}} a study of an automatic landing system for a powered-lift STOL airplane. The results of the evaluation indicate that the go-around control system can successfully transition the airplane to a climb configuration from any initiation point during the glide-slope track or the flare maneuver prior to touchdown...|$|E
40|$|Techniques were {{developed}} for the unified design of multimode, variable authority automatic flight-control systems for powered-lift STOL and VTOL aircraft. A structure for such systems is developed {{to deal with the}} strong nonlinearities inherent in this class of aircraft, to admit automatic coupling with advanced air traffic control, and to admit a variety of active control tasks. The aircraft being considered is the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> jet STOL research aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> {{concept is}} being studied as one means of {{attaining}} short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance in turbofan powered aircraft. Because of the stringent noise requirements for STOL operation, the acoustics of the <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> are undergoing extensive research. The {{results of a}} wind tunnel investigation of a large-scale swept augmentor model at forward speed are presented. The augmentor was not acoustically treated, although the compressor supplying the high pressure primary air was treated to allow the measurement of only the augmentor noise. Installing the augmentor flap and shroud on the slot primary nozzle caused the acoustic dependence on jet velocity to change from eighth power to sixth power. Deflecting the augmentor at constant power increased the perceived noise level in the forward quadrant. The effect of airspeed was small. A small aft shift in perceived noise directivity was experienced with no significant change in sound power. Sealing the lower augmentor slot at a flap deflection of 70 deg reduced the perceived noise level in the aft quadrant. The seal prevented noise from propagating through the slot...|$|E

40|$|A {{flight control}} system concept is defined for {{approach}} flightpath control of an <b>augmentor</b> <b>wing</b> (or similar) powered-lift STOL configuration. The proposed STOL control concept produces aircraft transient and steady-state control responses that are familiar to pilots of conventional jet transports, and has potential for good handling qualities ratings in all approach and landing phases.

The results provide a data base for future STOL airworthiness requirements and a preliminary indication of potential problem areas. The results are also compared to the results from an earlier simulation of the Breguet 941 S. Where possible, airworthiness criteria are proposed for consideration...|$|E
40|$|Flight {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} {{as part of a}} program to assess requirements for flight-path control for glide-slope tracking and for control of the flare and landing for STOL aircraft. The <b>Augmentor</b> <b>Wing</b> Research Aircraft was used to perform landing approaches on a 7. 5 deg glide slope to landings on a 30 x 518 m STOL runway.
