5|$|At one time, Bond Street {{was best}} known for top-end <b>art</b> <b>dealers</b> and antique shops that were {{clustered}} around the London office of Sotheby's auction house, which has been at Nos.34–35 Bond Street since 1917, and the Fine Art Society, founded in 1876. The sculpture over the entrance to Sotheby's is from Ancient Egypt and is believed to date from around 1600 BC. It is the oldest outdoor sculpture in London.|$|E
5|$|Pistrucci's early clients {{included}} two of Rome's major <b>art</b> <b>dealers,</b> Ignazio Vescovali and Angelo Bonelli, and Napoleon's three sisters, Elisa, Pauline and Caroline. Pistrucci gained prominence by winning a competition {{to make a}} cameo of Elisa (the Grand Duchess of Tuscany), working nearly nonstop for eight days to complete it. The Grand Duchess was so impressed by his work that she gave him studio space at her palace. Pistrucci felt secure enough with this patronage that in 1802, he married Barbara Folchi, daughter of a well-to-do merchant; they had nine children together. He continued working in Rome, turning out portrait cameos and engraved gems, until 1814.|$|E
5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for <b>art</b> <b>dealers</b> and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, {{the club}} was located west of Michigan Avenue and behind the 620 {{building}} which was home to many of Chicago's finest <b>art</b> <b>dealers</b> including Richard Gray and Richard L. Feigen & Co. The Arts club did not own the land upon which their famous Mies clubhouse was built; instead, the club held the land in a longterm leasehold. In 1990, the owner of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to sell. At first the Arts Club hoped {{to raise the money}} to purchase its land along with the 620 N. Michigan Avenue property in an effort spearheaded by Richard Gray, but it quickly became apparent that the club would lose a bidding war over this valuable land. A developer bought the property and demolished the entire block {{to make way for a}} movie complex and shopping center.|$|E
5|$|Vincent Willem van Gogh {{was born}} on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the {{predominantly}} Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Van Gogh was given {{the name of his}} grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became <b>art</b> <b>dealers.</b> This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).|$|E
5|$|As well, {{ordinary}} {{middle class}} Dutch people began buying art {{for the first}} time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous <b>art</b> <b>dealers</b> organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, {{it is not known}} whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, Modigliani befriended the Polish {{poet and}} <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> Léopold Zborowski {{and his wife}} Anna. Zborowski became Modigliani's primary <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> and friend during the artist's final years, helping him financially, and also {{organizing}} his show in Paris in 1917.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is assumed}} that he {{operated}} a big workshop with a large output to supply the export market. As a result, {{a large number of}} his paintings can be found in Spain. He was recorded in the archives of the prominent Antwerp <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> Guillam Forchondt in 1669 and also worked for the <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> Matthijs Musson. [...] He was active as an <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> himself. He had two apprentices, respectively in the years 1651/52 and in 1654/55.|$|R

5|$|In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent {{obtained}} a position {{for him at}} the <b>art</b> <b>dealers</b> Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as {{the degree to which the}} firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation {{took control}} of the case {{on the grounds that the}} artwork could likely cross state lines. They have {{conducted}} hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving Scotland Yard, Japanese and French authorities, private investigators, museum directors, and <b>art</b> <b>dealers.</b> The FBI believes the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid-Atlantic and New England, and that the stolen paintings were moved through Connecticut and the Philadelphia area in the years following the theft. Some of the art may have been offered for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s, including The Storm on the Sea of Galilee; however, their knowledge of what happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited. The FBI stated it believed to know the identity of the thieves in 2013, but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased. They have declined to identify the individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the painting}} is unclear, and there is doubt as to which painting is referred to in some early inventories. An Anhalt prince, likely Leopold Friedrich Franz (d.1817) of Wörlitz, near Dessau, Germany, held it in the early 19th century, after which {{it is likely to}} have passed to Leopold Friedrich (d.1871). The painting was loaned for exhibition in 1902, when it was shown at the Hôtel de Gouvernement Provincial, Bruges at the Exposition des primitifs flamands et d'art ancien. It was held by a Duke of Anhalt until 1926 when he sold it to the <b>art</b> <b>dealers</b> Duveen Brothers. They in turn sold it that year to Andrew W. Mellon. It was loaned the following year to the Royal Academy of Arts, London, for an exhibition covering six centuries of Flemish and Belgian art. Mellon willed the work to his Educational and Charitable Trust in 1932, which in 1937 donated it to the National Gallery of Art where it is on permanent display.|$|E

5|$|Brundage {{engaged the}} French scholar René-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argencé, then {{teaching}} at the University of California, as full-time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was Huizong, 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, it was most likely because he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a financial statement prepared for Brundage listed {{the value of his}} collection as more than $1million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage for The New Yorker, noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always found time to visit <b>art</b> <b>dealers,</b> and stated that the collection was valued at $15million.|$|E
