25|$|The first opening title sequence, used in {{the first}} five seasons, shows a slow-pan camera move over Ra's mask. The Stargate SG-1 {{producers}} had run out of time before the premiere of Season 1 and simply re-used the accelerated opening title sequence of the feature film. Ra's mask had been created in the feature film's model shop and had originally been filmed with a motion-control camera. Partly because Ra's mask looked cross-eyed, Brad Wright approached the art department in the following years to produce a new opening title sequence; however, the sequence remained the same until the show's move to the Sci-Fi Channel. During the first five seasons when the show was syndicated, a separate introduction was used; this intro is still used by Sci-Fi for Seasons 1-5. This version uses <b>action</b> <b>shots</b> of the original cast.|$|E
500|$|Orbison did not {{authorize the}} use of the song or know {{it was going to be}} used, but {{the use of}} [...] "In Dreams" [...] proved {{beneficial}} to his career, which had stalled in the 1970s. BAM magazine called the song [...] "the emotional epicenter of the film". Orbison biographer Ellis Amburn called [...] "In Dreams" [...] deceptively simple and that it is used to significant effect in Blue Velvet because it suggests dreaming is preferable to waking, and power and control are the real themes of the song, instead of love, longing, and loss. The film made the song a cult favorite, and after seeing it a few times, Orbison reconsidered his stance on its use. Footage of the film is featured in the 1987 music video of [...] "In Dreams", and interspersed with live <b>action</b> <b>shots</b> of Orbison's image projected over a filmy linen cloth blowing in the wind.|$|E

500|$|To {{maintain}} the rapid shooting pace Eastwood demanded, Owens chose to mostly avoid using bluescreen technology, {{as the process}} can be time-consuming and difficult to light. He instead used rotoscoping, the process whereby effects are drawn directly onto live <b>action</b> <b>shots.</b> Rotoscoping is more expensive than bluescreen, but the technique had proved reliable for Eastwood when he made extensive use of it on Flags of Our Fathers(2006) to avoid shooting against bluescreen on a mountaintop. For Owens, the lighting was better, and he considered rotoscoping to be [...] "faster, easier and more natural". Owens used bluescreen {{in only a few}} locations, such as at the ends of backlot streets where it would not impact the lighting. The Universal Studios backlot had been used for so many films that Owens thought it important to disguise familiar architecture as much as possible, so some foreground and middle distance buildings were swapped. One of his favorite effects shots was a scene in which Collins exits a taxi in front of the police station. The scene was filmed almost entirely against bluescreen; only Jolie, the sidewalk, the taxi cab and an extra were real. The completed shot features the full range of effects techniques used in the film: digital extras in the foreground, set extensions, and computer-generated vehicles.|$|E
500|$|Wishing {{to shoot}} the film in France, Besson could not find {{suitable}} facilities and [...] "with a heavy heart" [...] filmed in London. It was primarily filmed at Pinewood Studios on seven soundstages including the 007 Stage. Construction of sets began in October 1995. The opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House. Scenes depicted as being in Egypt were filmed in Mauritania; the first shoot for the film, a background shot of the desert, occurred there on 5 January 1996. Filming with actors began in late January, and was completed 21 weeks later. Willis finished filming on 16 May, while Oldman only commenced filming the following week; the film's protagonist (Korben) and antagonist (Zorg) never actually share any screen time. Despite being filmed in London, The Fifth Element was a French production, {{and went on to}} become the costliest European film ever made at the time. The buildings in New York were derived from both metabolist-inspired masses of modular apartments from the 1960s, and the futuristic designs of architect Antonio Sant'Elia in the 1910s. Besson demanded that most of the <b>action</b> <b>shots</b> in the film take place in broad daylight, as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science fiction films, and wanted a brighter [...] "cheerfully crazy" [...] look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one. Gaultier designed every one of the 900 costumes worn by extras in the film's Fhloston Paradise scenes, and checked each costume every morning. His designs, described as [...] "intellectually transgressive", were said to challenge sexuality and gender norms. A single jacket he designed for the film cost $5,000.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first volume}} of Viz Media's English edition has sold well enough to rank on the New York Times Manga Best Seller List. The first volume was in 7th place in its first week of publication, fell to 10th place in the second, and stayed in 10th place for another week. Reviews of the {{first volume of}} the English version were {{generally}} positive. Leroy Douresseaux of the Comic Book Bin gave the volume an A-, suggesting that fans of Tanemura were sure to like the series, but that it's darker than many of her other works. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime calls the volume [...] "enthralling," [...] also noting the darker tone of the work. Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart gave the first volume a 7 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty standard shojo" [...] but seeming to enjoy that [...] "There is excellent detail in the art, as well as a variety of good <b>action</b> <b>shots</b> to balance the [...] "pretty" [...] shojo shots." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} used high-quality panorama {{photos of}} the San Francisco skyline, and built a three-dimensional map of the city. The map was used in [...] the background of sequences shot on the bridge set in Vancouver. According to Jim Rygiel, “this technique gives you a real city that is accurate down to every piece of mortar in a brick building, so, using that, {{we were able to}} composite the live <b>action</b> <b>shots</b> with the key frame-animated monsters destroying digital buildings into a seamless whole.” Army vehicles, including tanks were provided by CGI and are not real vehicles. The studio digitized actual military equipment from the 7th Infantry Division of the Army. The film's title sequence was designed by Kyle Cooper, who had done the title sequence for [...] The film's sound was mixed at Warner Bros.' studio in Burbank, California. The tracks were mixed by Gregg Landaker in the Dolby Atmos surround-sound format for exhibition in theaters with Atmos-equipped sound systems.|$|E
