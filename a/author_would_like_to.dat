2500|$|Many of {{the novels}} from the #25-#52 range {{were written by}} ghostwriters. Typically, K. A. Applegate would write a {{detailed}} outline for each book, and a ghostwriter, usually one of Applegate's former editors or writing protégés, would spend {{a month or two}} writing the actual novel. After this, Applegate, and later her series editor, Tonya Alicia Martin, would edit the book to make it fit in with the series' tight continuity. Ghostwriters are credited for their help in the book's dedication page: [...] "The <b>author</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> thank [...] for his/her help in preparing this manuscript." ...|$|E
60|$|It was in vain {{that her}} mother told her that Charley's story would amuse her twice as much when she should read it printed; it was in vain that Mrs. Woodward assured her that Charley should come up to her room door; and hear her thanks as {{he stood in the}} passage, with the door ajar. Katie was {{determined}} to hear the story read. It must be read, if read at all, that Saturday night, as it was to be sent to the editor {{in the course of the}} week; and reading 'Crinoline and Macassar' out loud on a Sunday was not to be thought of at Surbiton Cottage. Katie was determined to hear the story read, and to sit very near the author too during the reading; to sit near him, and to give him such praise as even in her young mind she felt that an <b>author</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear. Charley had pulled her out of the river, and no one, as far as her efforts could prevent it, should be allowed to throw cold water on him.|$|E

They approached Bradbury, author of Fahrenheit 451, for permission to reprint one of his stories. When it was granted, they sent the author {{a copy of the}} magazine. ‘He liked it,’ Clark said.

50|$|The first prologue {{was written}} by Castiglione and {{introduces}} this new comedy, the audience {{is about to be}} performed. The speaker states that it will be performed in prose not verse. The title of the play is named after Calandro, a great fool we are soon to meet. The explanation for the prose instead of verse is that the play deals with common every day issues. The subject matter is material the audience would be familiar with so the language used should be the language the audience uses on a daily basis. Furthermore, the speaker assures that the play will not be performed in Latin since it must be played for large and numerous audiences who are not all equally educated and the <b>author</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> please the most amount of people.|$|E
