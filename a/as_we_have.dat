5|$|In applied mathematics, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done here, {{the delta}} {{function}} is often manipulated {{as a kind}} of limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions, each member of which has a tall spike at the origin: for example, a sequence of Gaussian distributions centered at the origin with variance tending to zero.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us. You see as well as I that {{we can no longer}} supply our needs, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done from our brothers, the French.... Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.|$|E
5|$|There is extant also an epistle of his to the Emperor Philip, {{and another}} to Severa his wife, with several others to {{different}} persons. We have arranged in distinct books {{to the number of}} one hundred, so that they might be no longer scattered, as many of these <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been able to collect, which have been preserved here and there by different persons.|$|E
60|$|We drifted {{down the}} Devolution's side, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> drifted down her sister's; and {{we dealt with}} her in that dense gloom <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> dealt with her sister.|$|R
60|$|Oscar and I {{met at the}} stairs, {{at eleven}} o'clock, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> arranged.|$|R

5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no abstract idea of existence (apart from {{as part of}} our ideas of other objects), we cannot claim that the idea of God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E
5|$|These three works {{which we}} have {{composed}} we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E

5|$|This wall is {{visited by}} all our {{brothers}} on every feast and festival; {{and the large}} space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a very old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.|$|E
5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done in the past... I wanted to try and take everything we {{have done in the past}} and put it to the side.|$|E
25|$|Heller also {{authored}} {{a memoir}} called Megilat Eivah, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> mentioned.|$|E

6000|$|At length [...] "Wilbur" [...] said: [...] "Good-night." [...] I rose, and Miller, eagerly, expectantly, {{turned the}} light slowly on. Mrs. Smiley sat {{precisely}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> last seen her. Her eyes were closed, her head {{leaning against the}} back of her chair. Her hands were fastened exactly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> left them, and, strangest thing of all, the table was pushed away from her so that the silk threads were tight.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen, Hachiman {{played an}} {{important}} role in the evolution of temple-shrines, and is still the tutelary kami of many important temples, among them Tōdai-ji, Daian-ji, Yakushi-ji and Tō-ji.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{some believe}} there is a {{difficulty}} in fitting them into Paul's biography <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> it. They, like Colossians and Ephesians, were written from prison but suppose Paul's release and travel thereafter.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> stated, {{the dual}} group of a locally compact abelian {{group is a}} locally compact abelian group {{in its own right}} and thus has a Haar measure, or more {{precisely}} a whole family of scale-related Haar measures.|$|E

60|$|I myself {{returned}} at once, {{and set the}} signallers to work {{to spread}} amongst our own people such news <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had.</b>|$|R

25|$|If we use regular subdivisions and {{left-hand}} or right-hand Riemann sums, {{then the}} two terms on the left are equal to zero, since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational, but <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen the term on the right will equal 1.|$|E
25|$|According to {{traditional}} Islamic scholarship, {{all of the}} Quran was written down by Muhammad's companions while he was alive (during AD 610-632), but it was primarily an orally related document. The written compilation of the whole Quran in its definite form <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> it now was not completed until many years {{after the death of}} Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|One part {{of space}} {{is not by}} itself and in the {{absolute}} {{sense of the word}} equal to another part of space, for if it is so for us, it will not be so for the inhabitants of the universe B, and they have precisely as much right to reject our opinion <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to condemn theirs.|$|E

25|$|Just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> co-adaptation, {{there is}} also co{{extinction}}. Coextinction {{is the loss of}} a species due to the extinction of another with which it is coadapted, as with the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their hosts, or when a flowering plant loses its pollinator, or when a food chain is disrupted.|$|E
25|$|The {{responsible}} government minister, King O'Malley, {{drove the}} first survey peg in the Canberra area on 20 February 1913 to mark commencement {{of work on}} the new city. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen, on 12 March that same year, the city was formally named by the Governor-General's wife, Lady Denman, at a ceremony held on Capital Hill, the site of Australia's current Parliament House.|$|E
25|$|It is {{well known}} that the axiom of choice is {{equivalent}} to the ability to well-order every set. Being able to well-order the proper class V (<b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done here with L) is equivalent to the axiom of global choice, which is more powerful than the ordinary axiom of choice because it also covers proper classes of non-empty sets.|$|E
