500|$|Some initial {{reports of}} mass chaos, {{particularly}} in {{stories about the}} Superdome, were later found to be exaggerated or rumor. In the Superdome for example, the New Orleans sex crimes unit investigated every report of rape or atrocity and found only two verifiable incidents, both of sexual assault. The department head told reporters, [...] "I think it was urban myth. <b>Any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> put 25,000people under one roof, with no running water, no electricity and no information, stories get told." [...] Based on these reports, government officials expected hundreds of dead {{to be found in}} the Superdome, but instead found only six dead: four natural deaths, one drug overdose, and one suicide. In a case of reported sniper fire, the [...] "sniper" [...] turned out to be the relief valve of a gas tank popping every few minutes.|$|E
500|$|The second verse of {{the song}} adds accompaniment from {{acoustic}} guitar and tambourine. Tim Riley writes that, with the [...] "restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill" [...] that introduces the drum part, [...] "the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> feel the pain)." [...] At {{the end of each}} bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase ("Na-na-na na …"), supported by an electric guitar fill, before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to [...] "reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.|$|E
500|$|Commander (originally {{known as}} Elder Dragon Highlander or EDH) is a casual format, {{but can be}} played competitively. In this format each player {{constructs}} a 100 singleton deck that has a legendary creature {{that acts as a}} commander. The deck construction is limited to the colors that are represented by the chosen commander and there cannot be two or more cards with the same name with the exception of basic lands. The legendary creature chosen as commander is kept in a special [...] "command zone" [...] and may be cast at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> can afford to cast the creature. If the commander card would enter any zone other than the battlefield from anywhere, its owner has the choice to return that card to the [...] "command zone", where it can be cast again for an additional two generic mana to its regular cost. The banned list and unique rules are governed by an [...] (not by Wizards of the Coast). [...] Wizards of the Coast releases [...] on a yearly basis.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman's {{primary goal}} {{was to create a}} simpler and more {{accessible}} gameplay model than those presented in previous Lucasfilm titles. Gilbert had conceived the main designs and puzzles before production began, which resulted in the bulk of the designers' work to flesh out his ideas. He was frustrated by the adventure games that Sierra On-Line was releasing at the time, and later said that [...] "you died <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> did anything wrong". Gilbert considered such gameplay as [...] "a cheap way out for the designer". He had previously applied his design ideas to the 1987 graphic adventure title Maniac Mansion, but committed a number of mistakes during development, such as dead-end situations that prevented the player from completing the game and poorly implemented triggers for cutscenes. Gilbert aimed to avoid such errors in The Secret of Monkey Island. The team decided to make it impossible for the player character to die, which focused gameplay primarily on world exploration. The Sierra game-over screen was parodied, when Guybrush falls off a cliff only to be bounced back up by a [...] "rubber tree".|$|E
500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. <b>Any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E
2500|$|After Challenger, Greene {{chose to}} retire as a flight director. In October 1987, {{after a short}} period working with a study group on lunar exploration, he was {{appointed}} head of NASA's safety division. The division had been created after the Challenger accident at {{the recommendation of the}} Rogers Commission, which saw its establishment as key in creating a new, more vigorous [...] "safety culture" [...] at NASA. However, Greene feared that too much introspection by NASA engineers could lead to a damaging loss of confidence. In an interview a year later, he said that NASA had been on [...] "a fantastic guilt trip," [...] adding that [...] "I believe NASA has been overly eager to defend itself against all critics. <b>Any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> have an independent panel, you {{ought to be able to}} name a defense attorney for the status quo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spells {{that are}} permanents {{that end up}} on the battlefield; sorcery spells; and {{abilities}} that say [...] "activate this ability only <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> could cast a sorcery" [...] cannot be cast or activated as responses. They can only be cast or activated when the stack is empty, only on the turn of whoever casts or activates them, and only in a main phase. In contrast, activated abilities, instant spells, and spells that have the ability [...] can be played on anybody's turn and in most steps of the game, go on the stack [...] "on top of" [...] anything that is already there, and will resolve first. Many players refer to this difference as [...] "speed", but that is a misleading term, because neither is [...] "faster" [...] than the other; the only difference is when they can be played.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hotel California" [...] and its lyrics {{have become}} {{absorbed into the}} wider culture around the world, and {{have been used by}} various writers and {{commentators}} to reflect on issues ranging from politics to social media and welfare, or as an observation on a particular situation. The lines [...] "We are programmed to receive / You can check out <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> like / But you can never leave!" [...] were used by an economist to refer to how the appeal of an attractive [...] "Hotel California"-type host country to foreign investors may be countered by the cost of exit on leaving the country. A term [...] "The Hotel California Effect" [...] was then used to refer to the negative effect of financial regulations on investment, and the problems foreigner investors faced when getting their money out of China. It has also applied to other ideas such as leaving a service provider or social media network. [...] A book titled Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War Inside Iraq was written about the clandestine operation named after the song title by CIA–US Special Forces teams in Iraqi Kurdistan in the lead-up to the Iraq War.|$|E
