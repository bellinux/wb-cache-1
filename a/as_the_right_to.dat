5|$|Early in the Act's {{enforcement}} history, the Supreme Court {{addressed the}} constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), the Court upheld {{the constitutionality of}} Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico. Although the Court had earlier held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in Morgan the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional. After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970).|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{arrived in}} Strasbourg in October 1553, {{where he was}} {{restored}} to his position at the Senior School and began lecturing on Judges as well as Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Vermigli often gathered with other Marian exiles for study and prayer in his home. His lectures on Judges often addressed the political issues relevant for the exiles, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> resist a tyrant. Since Vermigli's departure {{and the death of}} Bucer in 1551, Lutheranism had gained influence in Strasbourg under the leadership of Johann Marbach. Vermigli had been asked to sign both the Augsburg Confession and the Wittenberg Concord as a condition of being reinstalled as professor. He was willing to sign the Augsburg Confession, but not the Concordat, which affirmed a bodily presence of Christ in the Eucharist. He was retained and reappointed anyway, but controversy over the Eucharist as well as Vermigli's strong doctrine of double predestination continued with the Lutherans. Another professor in Strasbourg, Girolamo Zanchi, who had converted to Protestantism while under Vermigli in Lucca, shared Vermigli's convictions regarding the Eucharist and predestination. Zanchi and Vermigli became friends and allies. Vermigli's increasing alienation from the Lutheran establishment led him in 1556 to accept an offer from Heinrich Bullinger to teach at the Carolinum school in Zürich. John Jewel, a fellow Marian exile, came along with him.|$|E

25|$|The {{right of}} abode in Hong Kong {{is the right to}} legally reside in Hong Kong without any limit or {{condition}} of stay being imposed by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the People's Republic of China stood to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, the nationality of Hong Kong people as well as their {{right of abode}} in the territory was formalised prior to the 1997 handover. Since Hong Kong has never been an independent country, there is no provision for its own citizenship status. Hong Kong Permanent Resident is the legal status for those who have the right of abode in Hong Kong, which is the de-facto citizenship status in Hong Kong. Most citizen rights in Hong Kong (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote) are granted to all permanent residents, while some (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> hold a HKSAR passport, or becoming a high-rank public officer such as the Chief Executive) are restricted to permanent residents who are also Chinese citizens.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{rights are}} defined in {{numerous}} ways, including {{a wide spectrum}} of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.

These have been labeled as the right of empowerment and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> protection.|$|E
25|$|Many {{animal welfare}} groups, campaigners and activists believe that fox hunting is unfair and cruel to animals.

25|$|They {{asserted}} that rights {{are of a}} negative nature, which require other individuals (and governments) to refrain from interfering with the free market, opposing social liberals who assert that individuals have positive rights, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote, the right to an education, the right to {{health care and the}} right to a living wage. For society to guarantee positive rights requires taxation over and above the minimum needed to enforce negative rights.|$|E
25|$|Police {{vehicles}} are often fitted with audible and visual warning systems to alert other motorists of their approach or {{position on the}} road. In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as a yield sign) and may also suggest a duty on other motorists {{to move out of}} the direction of passage of the police car or face possible prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{society was}} graded into several citizen and non-citizen classes and ranks, {{ruled by a}} {{powerful}} minority of wealthy, landowning citizen-aristocrats.

In tradition and law, an individual's place in the citizen-hierarchy - or outside it - should be immediately evident in their clothing. The seating arrangements at theatres and games enforced this idealised social order, {{with varying degrees of}} success.|$|E
