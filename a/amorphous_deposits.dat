The objectives of the experiments were 1) to determine whether coating the abraded intramammary devices prevented <b>amorphous</b> <b>deposits</b> and bacterial adherence on the devices, 2) to determine whether addition of weight to devices increased the concentration of somatic cells in milk, and 3) to evaluate milk production and response of mammary epithelial cells to the devices.

Macrophages were the predominate cell type in quarter milk before insertion and neutrophils after insertion. Moderate to heavy deposits of amorphous material were observed on all devices, regardless of time residing in the gland. Approximately 50 % of the devices were colonized after intramammary inoculation with Corynebacterium bovis. Milk production in control quarters and in quarters with devices were similar.

40|$|Today, many {{valuable}} proteins can {{be obtained}} in sufficient amounts using recombinant DNA techniques. However, frequently the expression of recombinant proteins results in the accumulation of the product in dense <b>amorphous</b> <b>deposits</b> inside the cells, called inclusion bodies. The challenge then is to transform these inactive and misfolded protein aggregates into soluble bioactive forms. Although a number of general guidelines have been proposed, the search for proper reconstitution conditions can be very laborious and time consuming. Hare, we suggest a new versatile approach for solubilization and refolding of inclusion body proteins using a water-sodium bis- 2 -ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate-isooctane reverse micellar system. Instead of amorphous aggregates, a transparent solution is obtained, where refolded protein is entrapped inside the micelles. The entrapped enzyme has native-like secondary structure and catalytic activity. This approach has been implemented with Fusarium galactose oxidase and Stigmatella aurantiaca putative galactose oxidase. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|E
