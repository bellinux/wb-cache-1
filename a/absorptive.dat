5|$|The {{penetration}} front propagates {{to minimize}} the surface energy until it reaches {{the edges of the}} drop, thus arriving at the Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an <b>absorptive</b> material due to its surface roughness, this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The contact angles at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and π/2.|$|E
25|$|Epithelium – {{innermost}} layer. Responsible {{for most}} digestive, <b>absorptive</b> and secretory processes.|$|E
25|$|Zone 5: This zone, located below Zone 4 {{and found}} only in S.purpurea, is smooth, glabrous, lacks glands, and does not serve as an <b>absorptive</b> zone. Its {{function}} is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Cogeneration {{is popular}} in new {{commercial}} buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or stirling engines powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an <b>absorptive</b> chiller.|$|E
25|$|A slowly eaten meal {{will enter}} the <b>absorptive</b> phase of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract more slowly than a rapidly eaten meal of similar composition. Many {{of the differences between}} low and high glycemic foods would disappear if a meal was eaten slowly.|$|E
25|$|Sphagnum moss {{has also}} been used for centuries as a {{dressing}} for wounds, including through World War I. Since it is <b>absorptive</b> and extremely acidic, it inhibits growth of bacteria and fungi, so it is used for shipping seeds and live plants.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{tweezers}} {{based on}} Laguerre-Gaussian beams have the unique capability of trapping particles that are optically reflective and <b>absorptive.</b> Laguerre-Gaussian beams also possess a well-defined {{orbital angular momentum}} that can rotate particles. This is accomplished without external mechanical or electrical steering of the beam.|$|E
25|$|A {{wall with}} porous surface {{material}} and sound-dampening content material can be <b>absorptive</b> where {{little or no}} noise is reflected back towards the source or elsewhere. Hard surfaces such as masonry or concrete {{are considered to be}} reflective where most of the noise is reflected back towards the noise source and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>absorptive</b> polarizers, beam {{splitting}} polarizers {{do not need}} to absorb and dissipate the energy of the rejected polarization state, and so they are more suitable for use with high intensity beams such as laser light. True polarizing beamsplitters are also useful where the two polarization components are to be analyzed or used simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|At {{moderate}} frequencies, {{the energy}} {{is too high}} to cause rotation, yet too low to affect electrons directly, and is absorbed {{in the form of}} resonant molecular vibrations. In water, this is where the <b>absorptive</b> index starts to drop sharply, and the minimum of the imaginary permittivity is at the frequency of blue light (optical regime).|$|E
25|$|The {{action on}} the distal tubules is {{independent}} of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance. Because of the large NaCl <b>absorptive</b> capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by development of acidosis, {{as it is with}} the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{simplest}} linear polarizers is the wire-grid polarizer (WGP), which consists of many fine parallel metallic wires that are placed in a plane. WGPs mostly reflect the non-transmitted polarization and can thus be used as polarizing beam splitters. The parasitic absorption is relatively high compared {{to most of the}} dielectric polarizers though much lower than in <b>absorptive</b> polarizers.|$|E
25|$|A modern type of <b>absorptive</b> {{polarizer}} {{is made of}} elongated silver nanoparticles {{embedded in}} thin (≤0.5mm) glass plates. These polarizers are more durable, and can polarize light much better than plastic Polaroid film, achieving polarization ratios as high as 100,000:1 and absorption of correctly polarized light as low as 1.5%. Such glass polarizers perform best for short-wavelength infrared light, and are widely used in optical fiber communications.|$|E
25|$|By {{breaking}} {{apart the}} soil macro structure, the hyphal network is rendered non-infective (Miller et al. 1995, McGonigle & Miller 1999). The {{disruption of the}} hyphal network decreases the <b>absorptive</b> abilities of the mycorrhizae because the surface area spanned by the hyphae is greatly reduced. This, in turn, lowers the phosphorus input to the plants that {{are connected to the}} hyphal network (Figure 3, McGonigle & Miller 1999).|$|E
25|$|Bass traps are {{acoustic}} energy absorbers which {{are designed to}} damp low frequency sound energy {{with the goal of}} attaining a flatter low frequency (LF) room response by reducing LF resonances in rooms. They are commonly used in recording studios, mastering rooms, home theatres and other rooms built to provide a critical listening environment. Like all acoustically <b>absorptive</b> devices, they function by turning sound energy into heat through friction.|$|E
25|$|The {{gallbladder}} wall {{is composed}} {{of a number of}} layers. The gallbladder wall's innermost surface is lined by a single layer of columnar cells with a brush border of microvilli, very similar to intestinal <b>absorptive</b> cells. Underneath the epithelium is an underlying lamina propria, a muscular layer, an outer perimuscular layer and serosa. Unlike elsewhere in the intestinal tract, the gallbladder does not have a muscularis mucosae, and the muscular fibres are not arranged in distinct layers.|$|E
25|$|The speaker {{mounting}} scheme (including cabinets) {{can also}} cause diffraction, resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding the front edges of the cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using <b>absorptive</b> material around a driver, {{or some combination of}} these and other schemes.|$|E
25|$|Storing {{bulbs and}} root crops: pour {{vermiculite}} around bulbs placed in container. If clumps are dug, allow to dry {{for a few}} hours in the sun and then place in cartons or bushel baskets and cover with vermiculite. The <b>absorptive</b> power of vermiculite acts as a regulator that prevents mildew and moisture fluctuation during the storage period. It will not absorb moisture from the inside of stored tubers, but it does take up free water from the outside, preventing storage rot.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{may cause}} changes in soil {{nutrients}} {{through a variety}} of mechanisms, including oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water. Temperatures must be very high, however, to cause a significant loss of nutrients, which are often replaced by organic matter left behind in the fire. Also, the minerals which were formerly part of slowly decaying plant matter become more soluble and available in the ash. Charcoal is able to counteract some nutrient and water loss because of its <b>absorptive</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} mutualistic association {{provides the}} fungus with relatively constant and {{direct access to}} carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose. The carbohydrates are translocated from their source (usually leaves) to root tissue {{and on to the}} plant's fungal partners. In return, the plant gains the benefits of the mycelium's higher <b>absorptive</b> capacity for water and mineral nutrients, partly because of the large surface area of fungal hyphae, which are much longer and finer than plant root hairs, and partly because some such fungi can mobilize soil minerals unavailable to the plants' roots. The effect is thus to improve the plant's mineral absorption capabilities.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two other}} types of hyphae that {{originate}} from the colonized host plant root. Once colonization has occurred, short-lived runner hyphae grow from the plant root into the soil. These are the hyphae that take up phosphorus and micronutrients, which are conferred to the plant. AM fungal hyphae have a high surface-to-volume ratio, making their <b>absorptive</b> ability {{greater than that of}} plant roots. AMF hyphae are also finer than roots and can enter into pores of the soil that are inaccessible to roots. The third type of AMF hyphae grows from the roots and colonizes other host plant roots. The three types of hyphae are morphologically distinct.|$|E
25|$|At low frequencies, {{molecules}} in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the microwave frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. The field does {{work against the}} bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as heat. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the <b>absorptive</b> index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.|$|E
25|$|Linear polarizers can {{be divided}} into two general categories: <b>absorptive</b> polarizers, where the {{unwanted}} polarization states are absorbed by the device, and beam-splitting polarizers, where the unpolarized beam is split into two beams with opposite polarization states. Polarizers which maintain the same axes of polarization with varying angles of incidence are often called Cartesian polarizers, since the polarization vectors can be described with simple Cartesian coordinates (for example, horizontal vs. vertical) independent from the orientation of the polarizer surface. When the two polarization states are relative to the direction of a surface (usually found with Fresnel reflection), they are usually termed s and p. This distinction between Cartesian and s–p polarization can be negligible in many cases, but it becomes significant for achieving high contrast and with wide angular spreads of the incident light.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the fossils}} are found as {{impressions}} of soft-bodied organisms {{in the shape}} of disks, ribbons or fronds. There are also trace fossils that provide evidence that some of these Precambrian organisms were most-likely worm-like creatures that were locomotive. Most of these fossils lack any recognizable heads, mouths or digestive organs, and are thought to have fed via <b>absorptive</b> mechanisms and symbiotic relationships with chemoautotrophs (Chemotroph), photoautotrophs (Phototroph) or osmoautotrophs. The ribbon-like fossils resemble tentacled organisms, and are thought to have fed by capturing prey. The frondose fossils resemble sea pens and other cnidarians. The trace fossils suggest that there were annelid type creatures, and the disk fossils resemble sponges. Despite these similarities, much of the identification is speculation since the fossils do not show very distinct structures. Other fossils do not resemble any known lineages.|$|E
25|$|Detected as {{enhanced}} <b>absorptive</b> or emissive {{signals in}} the NMR spectra {{of the reaction}} products, CIDNP has been exploited for the last 30 years to characterise transient free radicals and their reaction mechanisms. In certain cases, CIDNP also offers the possibility of large improvements in NMR sensitivity. The principal application of this photo-CIDNP technique, as devised by Kaptein in 1978, has been to proteins in which the aromatic amino acid residues histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine can be polarized using flavins or other aza-aromatics as photosensitisers. The key feature of the method is that only solvent accessible histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues can undergo the radical pair reactions that result in nuclear polarization. Photo-CIDNP has thus been used to probe the surface structure of proteins, both in native and partially folded states, and their interactions with molecules that modify the accessibility of the reactive side chains.|$|E
25|$|Tyndall {{explained}} {{the heat in}} the Earth's atmosphere {{in terms of the}} capacities of the various gases in the air to absorb radiant heat, also known as infrared radiation. His measuring device, which used thermopile technology, is an early landmark in the history of absorption spectroscopy of gases. He was the first to correctly measure the relative infrared <b>absorptive</b> powers of the gases nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, etc. (year 1859). He concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere has a Greenhouse Effect, but {{he was the first to}} prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation. Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters.|$|E

[...] The task called for an [...] "audio-visual display in a single, conical room of little more than 100 square feet."

500|$|Atmospheric lift {{will also}} {{generally}} produce cloud cover through adiabatic cooling once the air becomes saturated as it rises, although the low-pressure area typically brings cloudy skies, which act to minimize diurnal temperature extremes. Since clouds reflect sunlight, incoming shortwave solar radiation decreases, which causes lower temperatures during the day. At night the <b>absorptive</b> effect of clouds on outgoing longwave radiation, such as heat {{energy from the}} surface, allows for warmer diurnal low temperatures in all seasons. [...] The stronger the area of low pressure, the stronger the winds experienced in its vicinity. [...] Globally, low-pressure systems are most frequently located over the Tibetan Plateau and {{in the lee of}} the Rocky mountains. [...] In Europe (particularly in the United Kingdom), recurring low-pressure weather systems are typically known as [...] "depressions".|$|E
500|$|Atmospheric lift {{caused by}} {{low-level}} wind convergence into the surface low brings clouds and potentially precipitation.

500|$|Observations by the {{orbiting}} Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope initially {{limited the}} planet's albedo (or reflectivity) below 0.3, {{making it a}} surprisingly dark object. (The geometric albedo has since been measured to be 0.038 ± 0.045.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0.52. This would suggest that HD 209458 b's upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is Jupiter's, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth's dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between {{the top of its}} atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. [...] This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud; usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides like red dwarfs ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The Rayleigh-scattering heated hydrogen rests {{at the top of the}} stratosphere; the <b>absorptive</b> portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the publication of}} the Balfour Declaration, it was met with tactical responses from the Central Powers. Two weeks {{following the}} declaration, Ottokar Czernin, the Austrian Foreign Minister, gave an interview to Arthur Hantke, President of the Zionist Federation of Germany, promising that his government would influence the Turks once the war was over. On 12December, the Ottoman Grand Vizier, Talaat Pasha, gave an interview to the German newspaper Vossische Zeitung that was published on 31December and subsequently released in the German-Jewish periodical [...] on 4January 1918, in which he referred to the declaration as [...] "une blague" [...] (a deception) and promised that under Ottoman rule [...] "all justifiable wishes of the Jews in Palestine would be able to find their fulfilment" [...] subject to the <b>absorptive</b> capacity of the country. This Turkish statement was endorsed by the German Foreign Office on 5January 1918. On 8January 1918, a German-Jewish Society, the Union of German Jewish Organizations for the Protection of the Rights of the Jews of the East (VJOD), was formed to advocate for further progress for Jews in Palestine.|$|E
500|$|Armillaria luteobubalina uses [...] "an elaborate, {{sophisticated}} aeration system" [...] {{that enables}} it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments. When grown in culture, the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called [...] "air-pores" [...] near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere {{with the central}} canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth. This aeration system {{is thought to be}} an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be hypoxic. The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially (where lateral branches grow from a main stem). Although the structure of A.luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the <b>absorptive</b> surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.|$|E
