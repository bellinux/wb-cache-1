5|$|<b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary for stability, either.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> form of poetry {{seems to have}} taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
50|$|Michel Rocard and Alain Krivine {{stood as}} {{candidates}} expressing {{the ideas of}} the May 1968 movements, though the Trotskyist Krivine took <b>a</b> far <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> stance.|$|R
25|$|Massachusetts took <b>a</b> much <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> position. Its Supreme Court {{ruled in}} 1783, {{that a black}} man was, indeed, a man and {{therefore}} free under the state's constitution.|$|R
50|$|Many {{observers}} at {{the time}} {{felt that there was}} a place for <b>a</b> party <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> than Roosevelt and the Democrats but still non-Marxist in the political spectrum of the time.|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Protestant ideas first {{appeared}} {{in the middle of the}} 16th century. During Gáspár Heltai's service as preacher, Lutheranism grew in importance, as did the Swiss doctrine of Calvinism. By 1571, the Turda (Torda) Diet had adopted <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> religion, Ferenc Dávid's Unitarianism, characterised by the free interpretation of the Bible and denial of the dogma of the Trinity. Stephen Báthory founded a Catholic Jesuit academy in the city in order to promote an anti-Reform movement; however, it did not have much success. For a year, in 1600–1601, Cluj became part of the personal union of Michael the Brave. Under the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699, it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Revolution {{broke out}} on 25 August 1830, after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera (La muette de Portici) in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. To maintain order, several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical,</b> pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1961 Hammarskjöld flew to Ndola, {{just across}} the border in Northern Rhodesia, to attempt to broker a {{cease-fire}} between UN and Katangese forces. His aircraft crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and everybody else on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated American support for the UN mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-Émpain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation. In December 1961, South Kasai was finally overrun by ANC troops and Kalonji was arrested, ending the South Kasai secession.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 1986, 225 Polish {{political}} prisoners were released—the last of those connected with Solidarity, and arrested {{during the previous}} years. Following amnesty on September 30, Wałęsa created the first public, legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law—the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarność (Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność)—with Bogdan Borusewicz, Zbigniew Bujak, Władysław Frasyniuk, Tadeusz Janusz Jedynak, Bogdan Lis, Janusz Pałubicki and Józef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council {{was admitted to the}} International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on October 25, 1987, the National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarność (Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarność) was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, a rift between Wałęsa's faction and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> Fighting Solidarity grew as the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned for an anti-communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|The MNC's main rival was the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who {{advocated}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> ideology {{than the}} MNC, based around calls for immediate {{independence and the}} promotion of regional identity. ABAKO's stance was more ethnic nationalist than the MNC's; it argued that an independent Congo should be run by the Bakongo as inheritors of the pre-colonial Kingdom of the Kongo. The Confédération des Associations Tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), a localist party led by Moïse Tshombe, was the third major organisation; it advocated federalism and primarily represented the southern province of Katanga. These were joined by a number of smaller parties which emerged as the nationalist movement developed, including the radical Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA), and factions representing the interests of minor ethnic groups like the Alliance des Bayanzi (ABAZI).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{conspiracy}} failed during World War I, the movement being suppressed {{at the time}} and several of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, several prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand. The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably Subhas Chandra Bose who, towards the mid-1930s, began calling for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> approach towards colonial domination. During World War II, several of these leaders were instrumental in seeking Axis support to revive such a concept. Bose himself, {{from the very beginning of}} World War II, actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequently escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the Indische Legion, to fight in India against Britain. He later returned to Southeast Asia to take charge of the Indian National Army which was formed following the labour of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like Mohan Singh, Giani Pritam Singh, and Rash Behari Bose. The most famous of these saw the formation of the Indian Independence League, the Indian National Army and ultimately the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind in Southeast Asia.|$|E

50|$|The {{deaths of}} the most famous philosophes in the 1770s and 1780s {{signaled}} the end of the High Enlightenment. <b>A</b> new, <b>more</b> <b>radical,</b> less established generation of philosophers emerged in this period, filling the void in public discourse left by the philosophes.|$|R

25|$|The {{period of}} the potato blight in Ireland from 1845 to 1851 was full of {{political}} confrontation. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> Young Ireland group seceded from the Repeal movement in July 1846, and attempted an armed rebellion in 1848. It was unsuccessful.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the term}} [...] "fédérés" [...] as used by historians today almost always {{refers to the}} {{volunteer}} troops of 1792.

50|$|It {{allied with}} the Reform Club of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Civic Association, the two largest {{political}} groups for a further constitutional reform in Hong Kong.

25|$|Moojan Momen {{writes that}} the goal of {{achieving}} equality of women and men in the Bahá'í Faith does not amount to bringing women into power in masculine roles, but instead <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> change to the very nature of society, to make feminine qualities more valued.|$|E
25|$|The second {{prototype}} XG-20, following {{public display}} in early 1950 at Pope AFB during Exercise Swarmer, was taken aside for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> transformation, being fitted with two twin bomber engine pods containing J47 turbojets, and flying in early 1951 as the XC-123A, the United States' first jet-powered transport aircraft.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{aftermarket}} modifications and upgrades {{are available for}} 90 and 100 Series King Airs.

40|$|Quantum {{chemical}} investigations on symmetrical polyradicals of meta-xylylene {{chains are}} done using unrestricted DFT - broken symmetry formalism, {{to determine whether}} the polymers are quasi-linear or helical, and their possible magnetic characteristics. <b>As</b> <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> centers are added, successively placed phenyl rings become twisted in the same direction to form a coiled chain. Each polyradical possesses a high-spin ground state with large adiabatic as well as vertical coupling constants. The adiabatic coupling constant exponentially decays with an increasing number of radical centers. Also, the Heisenberg-Dirac-Van Vleck coupling constants are generally large. The polymers are predicted to be very strong paramagnets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
