25|$|In {{the event}} of an {{earthquake}}, an earthquake detection system can bring the train to a stop very quickly. A new <b>anti-derailment</b> <b>device</b> was installed after detailed analysis of the J≈çetsu derailment.|$|E
30|$|These {{results suggest}} that it is {{important}} to take into account site-specific characteristics of strong ground motions for reasonable safety assessment of <b>anti-derailment</b> <b>devices</b> for future large earthquakes. In future study, seismic response analysis of elevated bridges for bullet trains will be carried out using estimated strong ground motions.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{operator}} {{claimed to}} have applied the brakes as the train neared the curve, but {{it was discovered that}} many of the ride's brakes were either broken, missing, or not connected, and that most of the <b>anti-derailment</b> <b>devices</b> were missing. The speedometer was broken, along with the governor, which limits the speed of the train. The track was littered with broken ride parts.|$|R
5000|$|Beasley's {{first patent}} was granted in 1878. She had invented a barrel-hooping machine, which she showed at the World Industrial and Cotton Exposition in 1884. She also {{exhibited}} her improved life raft which was patented in 1882. Beasley's barrel-hooping machine made her {{quite a lot}} of money, with the Evening Star writing in 1889, that she [...] "made a small fortune out of a machine for the manufacture of barrels." [...] Her invention could make 1,500 barrels a day. Beasley's other inventions included foot warmers, cooking pans, <b>anti-derailment</b> <b>devices</b> for trains and two improved life raft designs, which were also patented in Britain. Her life rafts were used on the Titanic.|$|R
