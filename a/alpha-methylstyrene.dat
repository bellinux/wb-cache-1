Solvent polarity was found to have a large effect on polymer yield, molecular weight and tacticity for the more electron withdrawing p-chloro monomer but not for the p-fluoro monomer. These results were interpreted in terms of free ion and ion pair reaction mechanisms and carbenium ion stabilization by the p-fluoro group. Polymers with bimodal molecular weight distributions (MWD 2 ̆ 7 s) were fractionated by preparative gel permeation chromatography and analyzed for tacticity by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The two modes were postulated to have been formed by free ions and by ion pairs. Polymerization reactions producing polymers with very narrow MWD 2 ̆ 7 s were found not to be living polymerization systems on the basis of copolymerization and polymer conversion studies.

40|$|Thermal {{oxidative}} polymerization of <b>alpha-methylstyrene</b> (AMS) {{has been}} studied at various temperatures(45 - 70 degrees C) and pressures (50 - 400 psi).

Above 45 degrees C the rate of polymerization increases sharply at a particular instant showing an ''autoacceleration'' {{with the formation of}} a knee point. The ''autoacceleration'' is supported {{from the fact that the}} plot, of R-p vs T shows a rapid rise, and the plot of ln R-p vs 1 /T is non-Arrhenius. The occurrence of autoacceleration is explained on the basis of acetophenone-induced cleavage of PMSP during polymerization, generating more initiating alkoxy radicals, which subsequently leads to the rapid rise in the rate of polymerization.

The reactivity ratios indicate that STY forms an ideal copolyperoxide with AMS and the copolyperoxide is richer in AMS. The effect of temperature and oxygen pressure in the reactivity ratios of the monomers was studied. The rates of copolymerization (R-p) were used to determine the overall activation energies (E-a) and activation volume (DeltaV(#)) of copolymerization.

In the negative spectra, the normalized intensities of peaks characteristic of PVPy seem to be not affected by hydrogen bonding formation and can be used in quantitative analysis, whereas peaks characteristic of HFMS, such as a peak at m/z = 283, cannot be used in quantitative analysis due to enhancement of its {{secondary ion}} yield resulting from hydrogen bond formation...|$|E

Thermal decomposition of P alpha MSP in 1, 4 -dioxane follows first-order kinetics with an activation energy (E(a)) of 34. 6 kcal/mol. Polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene using P alpha MSP as an initiator {{was carried out in}} the temperature range 60 - 90 degrees C. The kinetic order with respect to the initiator and the monomer was close to 0. 5 and 1. 0, respectively, for both monomers.

The low efficiency of P alpha MSP was explained in terms of the unimolecular decomposition of the alkoxy radicals which competes with primary radical initiation. The presence of peroxy segments in the main chain of PMMA and polystyrene was confirmed from spectroscopic and DSC studies. R(i) '/ 2 I values for P alpha MSP compared to that of BPO at 80 degrees C indicate that P alpha MSP can be used as an effective high-temperature initiator...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} report on studies carried out in detail on {{high-pressure}} oxygen copolymerization (> 50 psi) of the vinyl monomers styrene and <b>alpha-methylstyrene</b> (AMS). The saturation pressure of oxygen for AMS oxidation, hitherto obscure, {{is found to be}} 300 psi. Whereas the ease of oxidation is more favorable for styrene, the rate and yield of polyperoxide formation are higher for AMS. This is explained {{on the basis of the}} reactivity of the corresponding alkyl and peroxy radicals. Below 50 degrees C, degradation of the poly(styrene peroxide) formed is about 2. 5 times less than that observed above 50 degrees C, so much so that it gives a break in the rate curve, and thereafter the rate is lowered. Normal free radical kinetics is followed before the break point, after which the monomer and initiator exponents become unusually high. This is interpreted on the basis of chain transfer to the degradation products. The low molecular weight of polyperoxides has been attributed to the (i) low reactivity of RO(2) (.) toward the monomer, (ii) chain transfer to degradation products, (iii) facile cleavage of O-O bond, followed by unzipping to nonradical products, and (iv) higher stability of the reinitiating radicals.

The epoxides 2 first produced in incubations carried out in the presence of an NADPH regenerating system were not detected, being rapidly hydrolyzed by mEH to diols 3. The enantiomeric composition of the latter showed that no enantioface selection occurred in the epoxidation of 1 c and 1 d, and a very low (8 %) ee of the (R) -epoxide was formed from 1 b. Incubation of racemic epoxides 2 b-d with the microsomal fraction showed that the mEH-catalyzed hydrolysis of 2 c and 2 d was practically nonenantioselective, while that of 2 b exhibited a selectivity E = 4. 9 favoring the hydrolysis of the (S) -enantiomer. A comparison of these results with those previously obtained for linear and branched chain alkyl monosubstituted oxiranes shows that the introduction of the second alkyl substituent suppresses the selectivity of the mEH reaction of the latter and reverses that of the former substrates.

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the dynamics}} of living polymers which can add and subtract monomer units at their live chain ends. The classic example is ionic living polymerization. In equilibrium, a delicate balance is maintained in which each initiated chain has a very small negative average growth rate (``velocity'') just sufficient to negate the effect of growth rate fluctuations. This leads to an exponential molecular weight distribution (MWD) with mean Nbar. After a small perturbation of relative amplitude epsilon, e. g. a small temperature jump, this balance is destroyed: the velocity acquires a boost greatly exceeding its tiny equilibrium value. For epsilon > epsilon_c = 1 /Nbar^{ 1 / 2 } the response has 3 stages: (1) Coherent chain growth or shrinkage, leaving a highly non-linear hole or peak in the MWD at small chain lengths. During this episode, lasting time taufast ~ Nbar, the MWD's first moment and monomer concentration m relax very close to equilibrium. (2) Hole-filling (or peak decay) after taufill ~ epsilon^ 2 Nbar^ 2. The absence or surfeit of small chains is erased. (3) Global MWD shape relaxation after tauslow ~ Nbar^ 2. By this time second and higher MWD moments have relaxed. During episodes (2) and (3) the fast variables (Nbar,m) are enslaved to the slowly varying number of free initiators (chains of zero length). Thus fast variables are quasi-statically fine-tuned to equilibrium. The outstanding feature of these dynamics is their ultrasensitivity: despite the perturbation's linearity, the response is non-linear until the late episode (3). For very small perturbations, epsilon < epsilon_c, response remains non-linear but with a less dramatic peak or hole during episode (1).

40|$|A new {{development}} {{in the field of}} internals in packed columns is the use of structured packing types. Recently, a new structured packing type coated with a thin alumina layer (KATAPAK(TM)) has been developed. In this report, the results of an experimental and theoretical study concerning the possible applicability of this new packing material for hydrogenation processes in a trickle-bed reactor is presented. The palladium catalyzed hydrogenation of <b>alpha-methylstyrene</b> is used as a model reaction to study hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics in a trickle-bed reactor under reactive conditions. Conversions at several process conditions are measured in a pilot plant in which 3 mm spheres as well KATAPAK(TM) is applied as packing materials. A comparison of the results of some physical absorption experiments with the results of hydrogenation experiments showed that the resistances in series model-in which the total resistance against mass transfer is calculated from the separate resistances-is not valid in systems where heterogeneous reactions at the solid surface can enhance the mass transfer-rate at the gas-liquid interphase. With the aid of a developed trickle-bed reactor model, based on liquid diffusion, simultaneous reaction at the solid surface and zero volume mixing points,the mass transfer phenomena in trickle-bed reactors in conditions where the resistances in series model fails can be explained and described. The numerically solved model calculates the hydrogen profiles in the liquid films of the reactor and over all single pass conversions at several process conditions. These conclusions are confirmed by the results of the simulation of a model reactor, i. e. the laminar film reactor with a catalytically active wall. From the results of the measurements it could be concluded that in trickle-flow conditions, the application of KATAPAK(TM) does not significantly improve on the overall performance of trickle-bed reactors. The increase of the physical absorption rate due to better mass transfer characteristics of structured packings compared to dumped packing types-as reported in literature-will be eliminated to a certain extent in reactive systems due to the enhancement effect of heterogeneous reactions in trickle-flow operation.

40|$|Glasses are {{amorphous}} materials {{which do}} not exhibit the long-range order or periodicity found in crystalline solids. A glass is formed by cooling a liquid at a sufficient rate such that crystallisation can be avoided. The structural disorder of glasses give them unique properties which make them suitable {{for a wide range}} of industrial, pharmaceutical or biological applications. Glass-forming materials generally exhibit several characteristic mechanisms of molecular motion. The physical origins and interrelation between these mechanisms are not well understood. In order to address this, detailed investigations of how glass-transition related dynamics are affected by systematic modification of the molecular structure are needed. This thesis concerns the measurement of the glass-forming properties of three series of molecular glass-formers. These series are comprised of samples which vary systematically in their structure: an alkylbenzene series involving the systematic variation of the length of an alkyl-tail attached to a phenyl-ring and two series involving the successive oligomerisation of styrene and <b>alpha-methylstyrene.</b> The glass forming properties of these series were analysed using Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Thermogravimetric Analysis was also employed in order to optimise the sample preparation procedure. The work in this thesis identifies and characterises the detailed molecular weight dependent behaviour of several key relaxation mechanisms in the glassy and supercooled state of three different glass-forming systems. Strong similarities between the relaxation behaviour of the two polymeric and the alkyl chain modified benzene series were found. This demonstrates that much of the observed phenomenology is remarkably general and the work forms a basis for developments of models to address the glass-transition and glassy behaviour. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the glass transition in the three different series of samples behave in a highly similar manner with regards to the system molecular weight and strong support is found for a link between the primary structural relaxation that exists in the supercooled state and the secondary relaxation mechanisms that persist within the glassy state. ...|$|E
