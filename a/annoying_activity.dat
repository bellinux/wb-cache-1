40|$|Purpose - To provide {{empirical}} evidence and {{explanation of the}} phenomenon that providers of home delivery of groceries are still of minor importance in highly concentrated retail markets. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a critical literature review three propositions were set up. A web based survey was conducted with two prospective consumer groups for home delivery providers: time starved consumers and consumers with Internet affinity. A structural equation modeling analysis was applied in addition to uni- and bivariate analysis. Findings - In contrast to some assumptions in the literature shopping in stores for groceries was not generally perceived to be an <b>annoying</b> <b>activity.</b> Respondents were aware of their own shopping logistics efforts in terms of spatial and temporal distance when shopping in stores but were unable to convert these efforts into costs. Any perceived inconvenience connected with shopping for groceries had no impact on respondents’ willingness to pay for home delivery services or their future intentions to use such services. Research limitations/implications - The study only investigated two specific consumer groups within highly concentrated urban grocery retail markets. However these groups may be considered typical of most western European countries and thus the study’s findings are of importance to retailers. Practical implications - The major findings suggest that in general home delivery service may {{not be considered a}} strategic competitive advantage in grocery retail markets. Other marketing issues such as pricing, assortment and store personnel still substantially affect a consumer’s choice of retail formats. This leads to the conclusion that home delivery providers should either appeal to niche markets and/or offer additional differential criteria compared to traditional retail formats. Originality/value - The paper argues for a different viewpoint for researchers investigating the topic of Internet-based distance retailing. Further, the reintegration of logistical tasks from consumers should not be considered detached from other format choice criteria...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Smartphone {{privacy and}} {{security}} work has focused mostly on malicious apps. We {{take a different}} angle by ques-tioning whether good apps suffer {{from a lack of}} judgment and interact with “bad ” websites. We use the term bad websites to refer to entities that engage in dangerous or <b>annoying</b> <b>activities</b> that range from distributing malware, to phishing and overly aggressive ad spamming. The focus of our work is this relatively neglected aspect of security: “Whom does an app talk to? ” In this paper, we design and implement AURA, a framework for identifying the hosts that an app talks to and evaluating the risks this communication entails. AURA makes use of both static and dynamic analysis. We studied 13, 500 popular free Android apps that connect to 254, 022 URLs and 1, 260 malicious Android apps that connect to 19, 510 URLs. Our main contribution is showing that good apps pose security risks as they contact at least one website that: (a) distributes malware (8. 8 % of apps), (b) are in a blacklist (15 % of apps) based on the classification by VirusTotal and Web of Trust. Our work can raise awareness that even good apps need to be carefully evaluated, especially as people become more concerned about smartphone security and privacy. I...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Presentation date: 1973 - 06 - 20 Conflict and {{competition}} between outdoor recreational activities is increasing in intensity. Thus, management agencies and persons responsible for regulation of outdoor recreation areas {{have become increasingly}} concerned and are seeking appropriate means for amelioration of the intensifying problem. This research was designed to seek better understanding of conflicts and incompatabilities as perceived by recreationists. The research utilized a questionnaire to develop a body of original data on participants' perception of compatibility or non-compatibility of outdoor recreational activities and their attitudes toward degree and kinds of existing and needed resource development. As the case study area for this investigation, the sand dunes coastal environment of Central Oregon was selected. Topics in the questionnaire covered perception of recreational development, attitudes toward recreational land and facility ownership, perception of pollution conditions and perception of and attitudes toward recreational activities in terms of conflict or harmony {{with each other and}} with the natural environment. Analysis of the 428 questionnaires completed revealed some surprising responses. Perhaps the single most important finding from the user survey was that the majority of the respondents viewed the coastal zone as underdeveloped. Additional development was desired, and the kinds preferred reflected the type of accommodation and recreational facilities that respondents were already using. Tent and trailer parks, picnic grounds and low-cost motels were the preferred kinds of developments based on responses to the questionnaire. The list of recreational activities reported as being enjoyed in this coastal zone was long and varied; however, the greatest number of preferred activities were environmentally-oriented and definitely related to the marine and sand dune environments. Motorbiking in particular, dune buggying, tavern or lounge visiting and nightclubbing, hunting and waterskiing were often mentioned as bothersome, <b>annoying</b> <b>activities.</b> Most respondents implied acceptance of regulation of user activities and zoning for land use. It was the consensus among respondents that motor vehicles should be restricted to prescribed areas of the sand dunes and beach. Different accommodational uses of campgrounds was not generally desired as long as vegetation buffers were used to separate sites. When perception of air, water or noise pollution was questioned and a combined pollution index developed, respondents indicated pollution to be only slight and lumbering and associated industries were reported as the major causes. Human factors, pollution and the weather were the most frequently mentioned unappealing features of this coastal zone. Throughout the littoral the numbers of people at recreation sites were reported as just about right. Increased recreational use and development appears to be inevitable and in some cases perhaps even desirable within this coastal zone. Consequently, viable management techniques need to be developed so as to minimize activity conflicts and to maintain natural environment harmony in the area...|$|R
5000|$|All {{traditional}} Bantu {{cultures have}} {{a notion of}} a [...] "creator god", a concept which was already established in the Niger-Congo cultures. [...] This creator god is usually seen as a remote deity, far and detached from men and living beings; in some cases, it {{is more of an}} impersonal [...] "creating force" [...] or a primum movens than a [...] "God" [...] in the usual sense of the word. [...] Even when described as a personal god, the Creator is believed to be far and detached from men and living beings; this detachment {{is the subject of a}} number of Bantu myths describing how the creator left the Earth, moving to the sky, as a consequence of him being upset with men or <b>annoyed</b> by their <b>activities.</b> It is thus a common trait of Bantu religions that no prayers, and usually no worship, is actually directed to the creator; men interact with lower-levels gods and spirits that are closer and more interested in human affairs. These general lines are common to traditional concepts of Mulungu as found in Kikuyu, Ruvu, and other cultures. [...] A Nyamwezi myth about the departure of Mulungu from the Earth involves Mulungu being upset of the fires set by men to the landscape, and asking the spider to weave a web for him to climb up to the sky.|$|R
40|$|One popular {{phenomenon}} in Taiwan’s massively multiplayer online role-playing gaming world (MMORPG) {{is the so-called}} ‘white-eyed’ players. The “white-eyed” refers to players who act in ways similar to that are known as ‘griefers’ in some online gaming communities. Grief players engage in playing that intend to disrupt or distress other players’ gaming experiences, and derives his/her enjoyment from such behavior. Although the ‘white-eyed’ playing in Taiwanese gaming culture seems to include {{a wider range of}} activities than that of “grief play”, both terms refer to a popular phenomenon that is at the core to the MMORPGs culture. Grief players are the deviants in gaming societies; they break the law (codes and rules of conduct) of their game worlds, violate the norms and etiquettes of their communities. This study is an attempt to analyze the white-eyed/griefer culture as a deviant subculture and explore its functions and meanings in maintaining the social order of online game world. Current studies on grief play are limited in quantity and scope. Usually, grief play is descriptively discussed from the perspectives of players’ anti-social behavior or alternative ways of bringing satisfaction. In other words, grief play is treated as a phenomenon engaging the griefers only and is relatively independent of other players’ action. However, the making and circulation of the “white-eyed” (or the griefer) as a popular concept and a widely recognizable category among game players suggest that it requires collective recognition and corresponding social reaction by all players, griefers or non-griefers alike. Game management also plays a role in shaping the grief play culture by defining and enforcing specific rules. Bring all players and game management into the focus of research allows us to see a complete deviance-making process in virtual communities and the roles varied agents of social control play in it. Following the issue of social control, the study of grief players can also contribute to our understanding of power emerged in social interaction. In online gaming world, power takes several forms: techno-power that is written in system design and embodied in codes of the game, administrative power held by the game master, and normative power enforced by social discipline from all participating agents. Among the three, the last one is the least explored dimension. Thus, we would like to take a close look on following questions in accordance with the normative power negotiation in online gaming communities: what are the processes involved in identifying certain act as grief play and an avatar as a griefer? What are the consequences of being labeled as a griefer? How players interact with griefers, individually and collectively? And how griefers react to social punishments and disciplines from others? This study explores the social process governing the nature, emergence, application, and consequences of the griefer label of the “white-eyed” players. Although the definitions and key components of grief playing are not without ambiguity and disagreement (Foo & Koivisto 2004), it usually covers a very broad range of disruptive and <b>annoying</b> <b>activities</b> ranging from verbal rudeness, ninja looting, scamming, to player killing (Salen& Zimmerman 2004; Mulligan & Patrovsky 2003). Some of the behaviors are clearly unacceptable by social standards, yet some others are harder to judge. How do players learn to draw the line of acceptable behaviors? And when the line is crossed, what players do to disciple the violator? Calling some avatar “the white-eyed” {{is not the end of}} the story. It is often followed by further actions of posting the griefer’s name on related forums, or other means of passing the words so as to make the griefer visible to the public. When a griefer is identified and made well known, further sanctions may follow, such as punishments from the game master, refusal of cooperation, interaction or transaction by other players, even direct retaliation. We believe that the whole process of identifying the griefer as a deviant and applying the rule to him/her serves important functions. First of all, by identifying what are bad and inappropriate behaviors, the norms of good and acceptable behaviors are confirmed and made clear. And thus, reduces the ambiguity of the moral “grey zone” in social interaction of virtual gaming communities. Secondly, by labeling the griefers, the bad players are distinguished from the good players. In so doing a group of “outsiders” is created, which not only makes special treatments upon the deviant legitimate, but also make them visible targets for social sanction. Finally, the grief play culture contributes to the collective knowledge of a community. Constructing, passing and practicing such knowledge help to uphold the order of social life. Besides, the griefer counter-culture serves as a fine illustration of the deviant group. The clans of the griefers develop their own identities and distinctive norms against that of the mainstream game community. Their self-perceptions and group identities offer us rich materials on another side of the deviance formation story. In addition to the griefer and players, the game master is another important agent for social control. How do they perceive the boundary of their administrative power in terms of imposing and reinforcing the rules is crucial to the understanding of a deviant culture in virtual community. To explore the above issues, the two most popular MMORPG games in Taiwan, namely “Lineage” and “Ragnarok Online” (RO), are chosen as our major targets of study. Data used for analysis are collected from several sources, including (1) interviews with griefers and non-grief players of the two games on their attitudes toward, and strategies regarding grief play; (2) interviews with the game masters as well as data of regulation policies and the Rules of Conduct announced in the official websites of the games; (3) website self-representation and the action reports of the griefer clans; (4) grief play related postings from discussion forums of the two games.
