The convoy cleared the Gulf of Florida but between 19 and 23 August they ran into a gale that did not fully abate until 25 August.

2500|$|It was claimed at {{the time}} by Mr. J. E. Burke, the {{governing}} director of John Burke, Limited shipping company that the Dorrigo [...] "was exceedingly sea worthy and we were perfectly satisfied, with her. I cannot understand how the <b>vessel</b> <b>foundered,</b> more particularly as last week {{she was in the}} cyclone that dealt severely with the Cooma, and she entered port only a few hours late. She was <b>a</b> speedy <b>vessel,</b> and invariably did the trip from Brisbane to Sydney in 41 or 42 hours. These facts, combined with the knowledge that she was on her second voyage since her last overhaul, leads me to believe that something very remarkable lies contributed to her destruction." ...|$|R
60|$|In calm {{weather the}} scene was simply amusing but, when the sea was high, it was {{exciting}} and even dangerous; indeed, {{in the course of}} a year more lives are lost, in the process of taking the fish from the smack to the steamer, than in <b>vessels</b> <b>foundered</b> by gales.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 August, the Jamaica Fleet, 109 vessels {{under the}} escort of four British vessels, left Jamaica for England, Golden Grove among them.

60|$|The time {{approached}} for the ship's return. She was daily expected, {{when the}} weather became dreadfully tempestuous. Day after day brought news of <b>vessels</b> <b>foundered,</b> or driven on shore, and the coast was strewed with wrecks.

50|$|The Murray Mouth is {{the point}} at which the Murray River empties into the sea, and the {{interaction}} between its shallow, shifting and variable currents and the open sea can be complex and unpredictable. During the peak period of Murray River commerce (roughly 1855 to 1920), it presented a major impediment to the passage of goods and produce between Adelaide and the Murray settlements, and many <b>vessels</b> <b>foundered</b> or were wrecked there.|$|R
25|$|City of Tokios {{service was}} to end prematurely. In {{the early hours}} of 24 June 1885, in {{conditions}} of poor visibility, City of Tokio was grounded on rocks at the entrance to Tokyo Bay. At first {{it seemed as if the}} ship could be refloated, but the onset of a typhoon rendered salvage impossible, and the storm damaged the ship beyond repair. Fortunately, all of the passengers and some of the cargo were safely removed before the <b>vessel</b> <b>foundered.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape had changed dramatically after the White Ship disaster. Around three hundred passengers – including Matilda's brother William Adelin {{and many other}} senior nobles – embarked one night on the White Ship to travel from Barfleur in Normandy across to England. The <b>vessel</b> <b>foundered</b> just outside the harbour, possibly {{as a result of}} overcrowding or excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew, and all but two of the passengers died. William Adelin was among the casualties.|$|R

There he met a fellow Swede, Olof Gustaf Hedström, who suggested that Olsson contact his brother, Jonas Hedström, who was living in Victoria, Illinois. Other followers were not so lucky as several <b>vessels</b> <b>foundered</b> during the voyage, consigning hundreds of Janssonists to the deep.

50|$|During 19th {{century with}} the {{discovery}} of gold, and the development of sheep and wheat farming along the Murray and its tributaries, the river became a major thoroughfare for the carriage of goods and produce. During the peak period of Murray River commerce (roughly 1855 to 1920) and before the development of rail and road transport, the Murray Mouth with its complex and unpredictable interaction between shallow, shifting and variable currents and the open sea, presented a major impediment to traffic between Adelaide and the Murray settlements, and many <b>vessels</b> <b>foundered</b> or were wrecked there.|$|R

6000|$|When Xavier was {{come back}} to Goa, and it was known that he {{designed}} a voyage to Japan, his friends made use of all their endeavours to divert him from it.

They said, [...] "That those impetuous hurricanes were used to whirl <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> round, and <b>founder</b> it at the same moment; or else drive it with fury against the rocks, and split it in a thousand pieces." [...] They added, [...] "If, by miracle, he should happen to escape the pirates, and avoid the tempests, yet he could promise no manner of safety to himself in the ports of China, from whence the Portuguese were expelled; and, for what remained, if he were possessed with an unsatiable zeal, there were other vast kingdoms of the East, where the light of the gospel had not shone; that even in the neighbourhood of Goa there were isles remaining, and territories, of idolaters: that he might go thither in God's name, and leave the thoughts of those remote islands, which nature seemed to have divided from the commerce of mortals; and where the power of the Portuguese not being established, Christianity could not be able to maintain itself against the persecution of the Pagans." ...|$|R

50|$|The 19th {{century was}} the {{pinnacle}} of Cooperage technology, the regulation of cask size and production had a streamlining effect on maritime trade and industry. The cask design was paramount to trade for two reasons; the ability to uniformly apply packing techniques to merchant vessels, and the efficiency of inspecting and calculating materials contained within stowed casks. At {{this time in the}} mid 19th century, cask had become a generic term for any type of wooden staved container, and could vary in both size and purpose. For example, cask sizes ranged from a 9-gallon keg to a 252-gallon tun and were designed in three ways depending on the properties of the goods being stored. The manifests of William Salthouse state there were at least 1000 casks of varying size stowed on board when the <b>vessel</b> <b>foundered</b> at Port Phillip Bay in 1841.
