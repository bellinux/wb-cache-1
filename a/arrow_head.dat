5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the <b>arrow</b> <b>head,</b> by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E

25|$|Methodical {{preparation}} of small attacks, with immediate consolidation was required and great economy {{of men and}} equipment necessary, to conduct another general attack in mid-September. The French XX Corps, was to be assisted by the capture of Falfemont Farm, Leuze Wood, Guillemont and Ginchy. Rawlinson altered the XIII Corps boundary, to concentrate it against Guillemont and the 55th and 2nd divisions sapped forward, to reduce the width of no man's land, which brought the British front line to <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse and about half-way from Trônes Wood to Guillemont.|$|E
25|$|Nodena Phase peoples traded {{with other}} groups {{to the west and}} {{northwest}} in the Crowley's Ridge and Ozark Highlands areas for usable stone to make tools. Because of the conditions of the floodplain geography where they lived, no stone was available locally. Chert, basalt, and sandstone were turned into a variety of tools such as celts, chisels, adzes, abraders, hammerstones, hoes, drillbits, mortar and pestles, spear points, and arrow heads. A popular <b>arrow</b> <b>head</b> style is known as the Nodena point, a delicate leaf like shape. Sandstone was also ground and polished into a discoidal shape for use in the game of chunkey.|$|E

The statue is mounted {{at the end of a}} winding brick pathway with a Union Flag patterned <b>arrow</b> <b>head</b> to reflect the opening credits of the TV series and the sculpture has been designed so that members of the public can sit beside Captain Mainwaring and have their photograph taken. The statue was vandalised not long after the unveiling by a 10-year-old boy, who kicked it for 10 minutes and broke off the statue's glasses, throwing them into a nearby river.

25|$|Gillemont and Ginchy lay on spurs, which {{constricted}} the British {{right flank}} and commanded {{the ground to}} the south, in the French Sixth Army area. During {{the time when the}} German third line and intermediate lines and redoubts, were being completed on the rear slopes of Bazentin Ridge, Allied attacks had become smaller and periods of wet weather, the terrain, supply and ammunition difficulties, combined with the German policy of unyielding defence and the reinforcements reaching the German 1st and 2nd armies, slowed the Anglo-French advance, particularly south of the Somme. The German second line ran north-west, from the French sector near Maurepas to Wedge Wood, behind <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse, in front of Guillemont, past the station and thence to Delville Wood and Longueval, before turning sharply west. The approaches to the village were bare and overlooked by German posts in Leuze Wood. A quarry west of the village and the ground to the south, from Maltzhorn Farm to Angle Wood and Falfemont Farm had been fortified.|$|E
25|$|A small {{attack on}} <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse failed, part of ZZ Trench {{into the village}} from the north was taken and the French {{captured}} Angle Wood. The attack on 21 August failed and the plan for 24 August, was changed late on 22 August. The French would attack from the Somme to Maurepas, the 35th Division would conform but stop short of the German second position and the 20th Division would take the north edge of Guillemont and the south-west of Ginchy. A German artillery bombardment and counter-attack late on 23 August, led to the cancellation of the XIV Corps attack, except {{on the right of}} the 35th Division, the French attack mostly being repulsed. On 25 August, Rawlinson announced a series of divisional reliefs, which delayed the attack to the end of August, when it was arranged that XIV Corps would attack the German second position, from Falfemont Farm to Guillemont. Heavy rain began to fall on 25 August and turned the ground into a swamp, preventing the digging of assembly trenches, blocking routes to the front line and severely slowing the flow of supplies. The bombardment opened in the morning of 29 August and the attack was postponed again to 1 September, then postponed again to 3 September, because of a thunderstorm on 29 August.|$|E

The Guyangan Cave System, {{situated at}} the boundary of Barangay Toctoc and Togbongan, has seven caves, {{some of which were}} inhabited during pre-colonial times, and is now an Important Cultural Treasure as declared by the National Museum. Guyangan Hill, where the caves are situated, also has a natural view deck called Manamyaw overlooking Barangay Poblacion and the Sibuyan Sea. On a clear day, the islands of Sibuyan, Romblon, and Tablas, as well as Burias Island, can be easily seen from Manamyaw. The island has several rock formations as well.

2500|$|In XIII Corps, the 35th Division was {{to attack}} at [...] on 20 July, to take {{trenches}} between Maltz Horn Farm and <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse, preliminary {{to the general}} attack on Guillemont and {{on the rest of}} the German second position, after a thirty-minute bombardment to cover a French attack on the right, which was then cancelled. Two companies of the 105th Brigade, attacked against massed machine-gun and artillery-fire and were shelled out of the few parts of the German front line they reached; an attack at [...] by a battalion of the 104th Brigade also failed. The Fourth Army artillery began to register targets (firing ranging shots) on 21 July but poor visibility, made aircraft observation impossible at times. Co-ordination of the combined attack, proved impossible for the three armies and the 35th Division and 3rd Division attacked Guillemont early on 22 July and were repulsed. The bombardment for the series of attacks due on [...] began at [...] on 22 July, which alerted the Germans but the non-moon period was expected to protect the British infantry.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of [...] French troops {{captured}} Angle Wood and gained touch with the British along the slope of Maurepas ravine. The 35th Division {{had taken over the}} right of the 24th Division, to the Trônes Wood–Guillemont track and at [...] on 21 August, failed to capture a German strong point opposite <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse. The 24th Division on the left was subjected to much German artillery-fire but parties from two battalions occupied the remainder of ZZ Trench leading into Guillemont unopposed. In attacks at [...] the 35th Division discharged a smoke screen to cover the right of the 24th Division, which attacked the quarry with a battalion of the 72nd Brigade, as two companies of the 17th Brigade attacked south-eastwards, from near Guillemont railway station. The attack on the quarry failed after a long bombing fight and the attack from the station was costly to both sides, the British being too depleted to hold the captured ground. The 20th Division relieved the 24th Division by dawn on 22 August and on {{the night of}} [...] the 35th Division took over Angle Wood from the French.|$|E
2500|$|A German {{attack at}} [...] was ordered, {{in which the}} rest of II Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 106 was to advance at [...] from Guillemont, to {{the west side of}} the wood and the troops in the wood were to attack south from the railway line, using flame-throwers to push the British out of the south end. Part of Infantry Regiment 178 was to attack Maltz Horn Trench from <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse but the {{movement}} of troops near Guillemont was seen at [...] by the crew of a 9 Squadron aircraft, who also saw a German barrage fall between Bernafay and Trônes Wood and called for a counter-barrage. The German infantry were scattered by the shelling, lost many casualties and the troops moving up for the attack on Maltz Horn Trench failed to reach their front line. The attack was abandoned and after dark, the survivors were sent to reinforce the troops in the wood. III Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 106 arrived overnight and sent a company to the north-western edge.

2500|$|Late on 17 August, the British withdrew {{during a}} {{bombardment}} by heavy howitzers on Lonely Trench, until [...] next day. After two hours, two battalions tried {{to capture the}} trench by surprise but were repulsed and another attempt by a composite battalion, at [...] on 18 August also failed. The 3rd Division attacked on the right with the 76th Brigade, which reached the first objective near the Hardecourt–Guillemont road {{on the right and}} Lonely Trench on the left, some troops also reaching the road beyond. A battalion of the 9th Brigade on the left advanced a short distance before being stopped, which exposed the troops further south to flanking fire from the north and forced them to withdraw. The troops on the right flank were engaged by German machine-gunners, firing up the slope from the right and began to dig in. French troops had taken more of Maurepas and advanced either side of the village, gaining touch with the British on their left. Attempts to capture the north end of Lonely Trench and a bombing attack from the north failed and the left battalion of the 9th Brigade was caught in cross-fire, when it attacked the German trenches south-east of <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse, only a few parties briefly reaching the objective. The second stage of the attack was suspended.|$|E
2500|$|Communication {{with the}} rear broke down again, as German artillery-fire cut {{telephone}} wires and visual signalling was obstructed by the fog, until about [...] Pigeons and runners carried a few messages and at [...] the divisional commander Major-General Shea, ordered {{a line from}} Maltz Horn Farm to {{the west side of}} Guillemont to be consolidated and held at all costs. In the afternoon, the party at the orchard withdrew with difficulty and troops on the Hardecourt–Guillemont road fell back later. On the right flank, the British held on around Maltz Horn Farm, as German infantry advanced through British heavy artillery fire on Leuze Wood, the crossroads east of Guillemont and Ginchy. Artillery-fire on Guillemont was impossible, because of the British party still holding out; all the British reserves had been committed, which left none to reinforce the troops in the village, who were overwhelmed around [...] On the left flank, the 2nd Division attacked with the 5th Brigade, from Waterlot Farm to Guillemont railway station, with protective machine-gun fire from Delville Wood on the left. Many German machine-gun posts were undamaged and few British troops crossed the German front-line to reach the vicinity of the station, where they were shot down, the survivors of the two battalions eventually being withdrawn, through a German bombardment. In the heat of the afternoon, the two brigades of the 30th Division reorganised and the 89th Brigade consolidated the only captured ground still held, from the French boundary near Maltz Horn Farm to the Hardecourt–Guillemont road and <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse. During the night the 30th Division and 35th Division were relieved by the 55th Division.|$|E
2500|$|German {{artillery}} behind Guillemont and Longueval bombarded {{the wood}} as II Battalion, Infantry Regiment 182 moved from Ginchy {{to the second}} line trench from Guillemont to Waterlot Farm. The move was spotted by the observers in British aircraft, from which a bombardment was called down {{on the east side}} of Guillemont, pinning down two of the II Battalion companies. The survivors of Reserve Infantry Regiment 51 were formed into two composite companies, behind two of the II Battalion companies which had arrived; two companies to attack north of the railway and two to the south. Packs were left behind because of the undergrowth in the wood and at [...] the [...] advance began; no British fire was encountered and the troops entered the wood in a line to keep touch. Some British troops in the undergrowth opened reverse fire until captured and at a strong point in the centre near the railway line, a British party held out until surrounded. The advance reached the west side of the wood at [...] and light signals directed the artillery to lift onto the east edge of Bernafay Wood. The companies trapped behind Guillemont arrived at [...] and relieved the exhausted troops of Reserve Infantry Regiment 51. Touch was gained on the right with Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16, near Longueval and Reserve Infantry Regiment 38 near <b>Arrow</b> <b>Head</b> Copse to the south-east. At [...] a British battalion from the 90th Brigade advanced from La Briqueterie; the Germans in the wood were on the west side and despite German artillery-fire the British reached the wood with few casualties.
