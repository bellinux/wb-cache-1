40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the hygrothermal performance and durability of well-insulated cold zinc roofs, {{a total of four}} cold zinc roofs with a low U-factor [U< 0. 25 W/(M- 2 &BULL;K) ] were constructed in a test building at the KU Leuven, Belgium. This paper presents the hygrothermal performances measured in the four roofs during an exposure period of 28 months. The zinc roofs with a specific design and careful workmanship exhibited a satisfactory thermal performance. The moisture content in the wood deck generally stayed below 20 % by weight. However, the moisture situation at the underside of zinc sheeting was bad in all four roofs studied. We found that the strong undercooling of the zinc sheeting was the main cause for the bad moisture situation observed. Even a combination of a low <b>air</b> <b>exfiltration</b> and a good roof cavity ventilation rate did not eliminate or reduce the condensation at the underside of zinc sheeting.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper [Zheng et al., Hygrothermal Performance, Part I; Const Building Mater, Vol. 18, Issue 1, pp. 49 - 59], the hygrothermal performances of four well-insulated cold zinc roofs were evaluated. This paper investigates the corrosion {{behavior of the}} zinc sheeting used in the roofs. The main corrosion products identified are Zn 5 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 6 and ZnO. Little corrosion occurred at the upside of the zinc sheeting. However, serious pitting corrosion developed at the underside. The maximum pit depths measured in the collected samples with an area of 0. 35 m 2 were between 167 and 273 ?m. The traditional measures to minimize condensation deposit, i. e. low <b>air</b> <b>exfiltration</b> and good roof cavity ventilation, clearly did not work effectively in reducing the underside corrosion of the zinc sheeting. The results show that new techniques and roofing systems should be developed and implemented. 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{the overall}} {{building}} envelope airtightness concerning energetic aspects, the condensation caused by <b>air</b> <b>exfiltration</b> is still a challenge today. For {{a better understanding of}} the processes inside lightweight constructions, hot-and cold-box experiments and airflow measurements on 14 different full-scale wall assemblies under realistic climatic conditions were performed. The influences of different mineral wool airflow permeabilities and leak configurations, as well as different pressure differences were analyzed. Despite a certain level of uncertainty, the results show some interesting aspects about the influencing factors of the convective moisture entry. The distributions of the water content between sheathing and insulation samples show that more water remains inside the mineral wool with low air permeability, while in case of the more air permeable mineral wool, more water accumulates in the sheathing. Moreover, the findings indicate that the moisture distribution over the height of the sheathing is more influenced by the pressure difference level than by insulation air permeability or arrangements of the small openings. For the tested configurations, a lateral flow due to openings near the studs shows the highest total moisture contents inside the assemblies. In contrast, we could not observe significant differences concerning the moisture content for the different leak arrangements and diameters with the same total leakage area under humidification test conditions, although differences in the flow behavior are clearly detected. However, another important finding of these experiments is that, despite good workmanship, a small amount of air and moisture seams to penetrate the sealing tape joints...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analytical approach to predict envelope air-pressure differential that was newly implemented into IRC's computer weather analysis tool for hygrothermal calculations WeatherSmart- 1. 1. In {{addition to its}} original features, this tool now allows obtaining in a user-friendly way yearly profiles of hourly envelope air-pressure differential for both low and high-rise buildings. Hourly envelope air-pressure profiles are derived from the knowledge of both indoor and outdoor hygrothermal design loads. WeatherSmart- 1. 1 is being used within the frame work of a research project to assess effects of adding supplementary insulation and air-sealing retrofit on the long-term hygrothermal performance of different wall types used in Canadian high-rise buildings. Within the frame work of this research project, the paper also introduces how effects of moist <b>air</b> infiltration and <b>exfiltration</b> across tall building envelopes are assessed using IRC's advanced HAM model hygIRC...|$|R
40|$|After {{world war}} two, cavity walls became a {{widespread}} external wall {{type in the}} cool but humid climate of North Western Europe. Moisture tolerance of the unfilled construction was excellent. Instead, calculation and testing underlined that the unfilled cavity walls of that era performed poorly from a thermal insulation point of view. After the energy crisis of 1973, cavity filling was therefore introduced as the main upgrade. Hence, extensive testing revealed upgrading was less simple than expected. <b>Air</b> in- and <b>exfiltration</b> through the wall, wind washing behind the fill, thermal stack induced air looping around the fill and thermal bridging all cooperated in lowering expected thermal quality of the filled walls. Anyhow, {{at the same time}} testing underlined that moisture tolerance remained outstanding in the cool, humid climate of North Western Europe also without cavity ventilation. That resulted in a set of recommendations how to construct high performing filled cavity walls. SAGE Publications 2007...|$|R
50|$|Protection against {{interstitial}} condensation {{is necessary}} in heated or cooled buildings depending on the climate where they are located and other factors. This is done primarily by means of preventing <b>exfiltration</b> (<b>air</b> leakage into the assemblies); controlling indoor moisture at its sources through ventilation, heating, insulation, dehumidification; and using an impervious vapour barrier (vapour check) on the warm side of the insulation, i.e., inside the assembly on a heated building and outside on a cooled building. Buildings that are both heated and cooled should not have vapour barriers {{on both sides of}} the assemblies. Vapour barriers are problematic because they difficult to install perfectly and greatly reduce the ability of a cavity to dry out when it does get wet. Vapour barriers are used in conjunction with a housewrap, a vapour permeable but water resistant membrane, so that one side of the cavity is permeable to allow drying. Spray foams may also act as a vapour barrier.|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} {{around a}} building affects its energy consumption primarily by influencing its requirement for space heating and cooling. The environmental variables influencing {{the amount of}} energy needed for heating and cooling are outside temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind. Wind influences building energy consumption by affecting the following: 1. <b>Air</b> infiltration and <b>exfiltration</b> from conditioned spaces, resulting from pressure gradients and the resulting mass transfer through surface. 2. The rate of heat transmission to or from external surfaces, partially determined by the turbulent mixing of air close to the building surface. 3. Mechanical systems efficiency. Air circulation around buildings affects the thermal efficiency of air-conditioning cooling towers, and can increase fan power requirements when ventilation inlets and exhausts are poorly located. 4. The necessity for enclosing and conditioning outdoor space. Buildings commonly have uncomfortable surroundings, and architects have responded to this by enclosing the surrounding in atria or malls which need to be heated or cooled. Such enclosures might not be necessary if the site and building were designed to control air movement to an acceptable level...|$|R
