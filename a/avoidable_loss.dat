40|$|A 15 -sec {{stimulus}} {{followed by}} unavoidable monetary loss {{was presented to}} human subjects who were avoiding loss on a free-operant schedule. As has been observed in studies where shock is the aversive event, initial reactions to the pre-loss stimulus were transient increases in overall and stimulus rates. Unlike shock studies, continued training produced decreased rates, {{in the presence of}} the 15 -sec stimulus, which were maintained in two of three subjects. Subsequent observations indicated that lowered rates were a function of the subject's rate of avoidance responding, the duration of the stimulus, and the scheduling of <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses.</b> Increasing the duration of the stimulus eliminated lowered rates {{in the presence of the}} stimulus and subsequent exposures to conditions which previously produced lowered rates did not result in recovery of the phenomenon. Introduction of the pre-loss stimulus on an extinction baseline (<b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> were omitted), however, reinstituted lowered rates. It is proposed that the pre-loss stimulus assumed discriminative control over low rates because responding in the presence of the stimulus was ineffective in avoiding the unavoidable loss. Recovery from lowered rates is attributed to the occurrence of <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> during the stimulus period, and maintenance of lowered rates on the extinction schedule to the omission of such <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Full Stop - On a clear Thursday afternoon, 28 May 1914, the RMS Empress of Ireland left Québec City on {{its journey}} to the English port of Liverpool. Early {{in the morning of}} 29 May, a thick fog rolled in over the St. Lawrence River. During a routine attempt to pass an {{approaching}} ship, poor visibility caused a Norwegian vessel named the Storstad to ram the Empress amidships, punching a deadly hole in its side. Icy water flooded the ship. In less than fifteen minutes, the gigantic Empress of Ireland sank. Out of almost 1500 people aboard, only 465 were rescued. Today the sinking of the Empress of Ireland ranks as one of the worst peacetime disasters ever to happen in Canada. // On 10 August 1957, Maritime Central Airways Flight 315 left London, England for Toronto. While flying over the St. Lawrence valley the following morning, the plane hit an unexpected storm which wrenched control out of the pilot’s hands and forced the plane towards the ground. The Douglas DC-4 came down at a speed of nearly 350 km/h and created a hole 8 meters deep in a field near the town of Issoudun, Québec. It is felt that because the crew had been on duty for nearly 20 hours at that time, their performances were drastically compromised. It was the first major civilian air disaster in Canadian history. From this tragic and <b>avoidable</b> <b>loss</b> of life, a Canadian standard has been developed to limit shift length and prevent future disasters of this magnitude.

40|$|AbstractA {{key element}} in making our food systems more {{efficient}} is the reduction of food losses across the entire food value chain. Nevertheless, food losses are often neglected. This paper quantifies food losses in Switzerland at the various stages of the food value chain (agricultural production, postharvest handling and trade, processing, food service industry, retail, and households), identifies hotspots and analyses the reasons for losses. Twenty-two food categories are modelled separately in a mass and energy flow analysis, {{based on data from}} 31 companies within the food value chain, and from public institutions, associations, and from the literature. The energy balance shows that 48 % of the total calories produced (edible crop yields at harvest time and animal products, including slaughter waste) is lost across the whole food value chain. Half of these <b>losses</b> would be <b>avoidable</b> given appropriate mitigation measures. Most <b>avoidable</b> food <b>losses</b> occur at the household, processing, and agricultural production stage of the food value chain.

40|$|Population {{dynamics}} of P. xylostella was studied on cauliflowers in Haripur, Peshawar and Swat districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, having different altitudes and climatic conditions, {{during the two}} seasons from June to November in 2012 and 2013. The highest population of larvae and pupae per cauliflower plant was recorded {{in the month of}} September in all areas whereas the lowest was measured during July in both years. The population dynamics was correlated with the weather parameters and it was found that there was statistically nonsignificant (P> 0. 05) associations with temperatures (maximum and minimum) whereas the interaction with the relative humidity (RH) was non-significant in Haripur (2012 & 2013) and Swat (2013) and significant in Peshawar (2012 & 2013) and Swat (2012). Rainfall (RF) had a negative and highly significant (P< 0. 01) association with the population of P. xylostella. Multiple Regressions displayed 87. 56 to 98. 06 % variability in population {{dynamics of}} P. xylostella in the studied areas due to weather parameters. To determine genetic variability among the populations of P. xylostella, 3 rd and 4 th instar larvae were collected from Haripur, Peshawar and Swat having distinct geographic conditions and altitudes and were investigated by using RAPD (DNA) primers technique. Seventeen primers were used that produced 64 bands at different loci within a range of between 250 to 1500 bp. The bands produced were all monomorphic and no polymorphisms were detected in the three populations. For the management of P. xylostella Lufenuron (5 % EC- 200 ml/Acre), Steward (15. 84 % EC 175 ml/Acre), Emamectine Benzoate (1. 9 % EC- 200 ml/Acre) and Arrivo (10 % EC 250 ml/Acre) pesticides were used in cauliflower. Lufenuron was found significantly more effective in terms of pest suppression, highest biological efficacy (B. E) and yield as well found safe for the parasitoids as compared to all other insecticides whereas Arrivo insecticide was found at par with the control. Similarly garlic, tomato, chilli and coriander were intercropped with cauliflower for two seasons to manage the infestation of P. xylostella. Garlic reduced the population significantly (P< 0. 01) as compared to other intercrops and likewise, the highest average yield, maximum percent gain over the control and <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> per plot was obtained in cauliflower + garlic plots whereas the lowest yield (30. 16 Kg/ 40 plants), minimum percent gain (7. 56 %) and percent <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> (7. 03 %) was attained from the cauliflower plots intercropped with the coriander. Synchronized study was conducted of the best insecticide (Lufenuron) and intercrop (garlic) obtained from the previous experiments against P. xylostella in cauliflower.

40|$|<b>Avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> and {{economic}} injury levels (EILs) {{were computed for}} the sorghum head bug, Calocoris angustatus Leth., on three cultivars during three rainy seasons (1985 – 1987) at ICRISAT. Grain yield in plots protected with 2 – 5 insecticide sprays (carbaryl at 500 g a. i. /ha) between the half-anthesis and the dough stage {{was significantly higher than}} in untreated plots, with cost-benefit ratios > 1. Plots that were not protected at half-anthesis and/or complete-anthesis, and at milk and dough stages, suffered a significant loss in yield. Bug damage spoiled the grain quality in terms of germination, 1000 -grain mass, grain hardness and percentage floaters. Three to four sprays between complete-anthesis and the dough stage prevented a significant reduction in grain quality. Head bug density at half-anthesis, complete-anthesis, milk and dough stages was significantly and negatively associated with grain yield. Bug density at different stages explained 43 – 94 % of the variance in yield. Direct effects of bug numbers at the milk stage and the indirect effects of head bug density at other stages through the milk stage contributed towards maximum reduction in yield. Maximum <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> were recorded in cultivar ICSV 1 (88 · 6 %), followed by CSH 1 (69 · 9 %), and CSH 5 (53 · 9 % in 1986 and 55 · 0 % in 1987). Loss in grain yield/ha due to one insect/panicle at half-anthesis and that based on natural increase, were 548 and 232 kg in CSH 5 during 1986 and 1987, respectively, 251 kg in ICSV 1, and 77 kg in CSH 1. EILs based on a cost-benefit ratio of 1 : 1 ranged from 1 · 3 – 1 · 4 insects/panicle for CSH 1, 0 · 4 for ICSV 1, and 0 · 4 – 0 · 6 and 0 · 2 – 0 · 4 for CSH 5 during 1986 and 1987, respectively.
