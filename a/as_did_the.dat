5|$|Along the way, Rolling Thunder also fell prey to {{the same}} {{dysfunctional}} managerial attitude <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> rest of the American military effort in Southeast Asia. The process of the campaign became an end unto itself, with sortie generation as the standard by which progress was measured. Sortie rates {{and the number of}} bombs dropped, however, equaled efficiency, not effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} The New York Times in 2006 wrote that parents hired outside tutors in {{concern for the}} school's {{academic}} preparation. A third of the original students left within the 2004 academic year, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> original teachers.|$|E

5|$|As {{the issue}} of his college {{eligibility}} was playing out, Gambino was being courted by several professional football teams. The Chicago Bears of the NFL, which had drafted him during the war, still had {{a strong interest in}} him, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Baltimore eventually acquired Gambino, and to do so, they traded their first-round 1948 draft selection to the Cleveland Browns, who held Gambino's AAFC draft rights.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's public {{popularity}} as a virtuoso {{began to}} wane, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> {{number of his}} pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65.|$|E

In 1997, Dugan licensed his system to Protech Audio of Indian Lake, New York, yielding the Protech 2000 model series.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years of World WarII, Australia's {{military}} strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom. In line with this, most Australian military units deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed {{a key part of the}} Commonwealth forces in the area. The three AIF infantry divisions sent to the Middle East saw extensive action, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> RAAF squadrons and warships in this theatre.|$|E

Conflict with the legislature over state bank regulations marked Edwards' administration, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> pursuit of Indian removal. As governor or territorial governor he twice sent Illinois militia against Native Americans, in the War of 1812 and the Winnebago War, and signed treaties for the cession of Native American land. Edwards returned to private life when his term ended in 1830 {{and died of}} cholera two years later.|$|E

5|$|Holden {{introduced}} the all-new VT Commodore in 1997, {{the outcome of}} a A$600million development programme that spanned more than five years. The new model featured a rounded exterior body shell, improved dynamics and many firsts for an Australian-built car. Also, a stronger body structure increased crash safety. The locally produced Buick-sourced V6 engine powered the Commodore range, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre LS unit.|$|E

5|$|John treated his {{children}} equally within the home. He educated them {{in politics and}} social issues and exposed them to various politically important visitors. John's political work and ideology had a strong influence on Josephine, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> religious teaching she received from her mother; the family background and the circles in which she moved formed a strong social conscience and a staunch religious faith.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{directly}} overthrew feudal {{remains in}} much of western Continental Europe. He liberalised property laws, ended seigneurial dues, abolished the guild of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised divorce, closed the Jewish ghettos and made Jews equal to everyone else. The Inquisition ended <b>as</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and equality under the law was proclaimed for all men.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused {{a large number}} of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge.
