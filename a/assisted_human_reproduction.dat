40|$|Background: Human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) {{has contributed}} many {{improvements}} to <b>human</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction.</b> However, effects of hMG on oocyte development and clinical results remain controversial. Objective: This {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of hMG on the zona pellucida of oocytes, as well as clinical results in superovulation treatment. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was performed with 150 cycles of long-protocol treatment using recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (r-FSH) with or without hMG. The number of retrieved oocytes, fertilization rate, implantation rate, pregnancy rate, and birefringence and thickness of the zona pellucida of oocytes were investigated. Results: No significant differences were existed in r-FSH +hMG, and r-FSH groups in the number of retrieved oocytes (11. 99 ± 0. 75 vs. 13. 9 ± 0. 73, p= 0. 06), maturation rate (84. 76...|$|R

Its high variation in heteroplasmic oocytes, ranging from 1. 1 % to 33. 5 % and from 0. 4 % to 15. 5 %, can be explained by random genetic drift in the female germ line.

Embryo cryopreservation has decreased the number of fresh embryo transfers and maximized the effectiveness of the IVF cycle. The data shows that women who had transfers of fresh and frozen embryos obtained 8 % additional births by using their cryopreserved embryos. Oocyte cryopreservation offers more advantages compared to embryo freezing, such as fertility preservation in women at risk of losing fertility due to oncological treatment or chronic disease, egg donation, and postponing childbirth, and eliminates religious and/or other ethical, legal, and moral concerns of embryo freezing.

40|$|Spermatids are the {{earliest}} male germ cells with haploid set of chromosomes. Spermatid injection {{was introduced in}} <b>human</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{for the treatment of}} men with non-obstructive azoospermia. Spermatozoa can be recovered in half of patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. The use of spermatids for intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI) has been proposed for cases in which no spermatozoa can be retrieved. However, there are low pregnancy rates following ICSI using round spermatids from men with no elongated spermatids or spermatozoa in their testes. The in vitroculture of immature germ cells has been proposed as a means to improve this poor outcome. Oocyte activation rarely occurs when injected with a spermatid. Therefore, spermatid injection requires use of calcium ionophores for oocyte activation which is otherwise carried out by PLC zeta from mature sperms. This is the only option available for the nonobstructive azoospermic patients to have their own biological child...|$|R
