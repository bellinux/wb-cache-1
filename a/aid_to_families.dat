5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients.

25|$|The {{only country}} {{suffering}} lasting {{damage from the}} storm was Honduras. After the storm turned out to sea and Gamma's rains desisted, Honduran helicopters began rescuing those stranded by flood waters. The United Nations' World Food Programme spent $460,000 (2005USD) airlifting 645tonnes of food, enough for 195,000five-person families, to northern Honduras. The Red Cross also provided food aid, hygiene kits, blankets and other humanitarian <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>families</b> that had sustained damage to their property or were displaced into shelters.

25|$|Title VI {{amended the}} Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA) {{to change how}} the U.S. Victims of Crime Fund was managed and funded, {{improving}} the speedy provision of <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>families</b> of public safety officers by expedited payments to officers or the families of officers injured or killed {{in the line of}} duty. Payments must be made no later than 30 days later. The Assistant Attorney General was given expanded authority under Section 614 of the U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act to make grants to any organization that administers any Office of Justice Programs, which includes the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. Further changes to the Victims of Crime Fund increased the amount of money in the Fund and changed the way that funds were distributed. The amount available for grants made through the Crime Victim Fund to eligible crime victim compensation programs were increased from 40 percent to 60 percent of the total in the Fund. A program can provide compensation to U.S. citizens who were adversely affected overseas. Means testing was also waived for those who apply for compensation. Under VOCA, the Director may make an annual grant from the Crime Victims Fund to support crime victim assistance programs. An amendment was made to VOCA to include offers of assistance to crime victims in the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any other U.S. territory. VOCA also provides for compensation and assistance to victims of terrorism or mass violence. This was amended to allow the Director to make supplemental grants to States for eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs, and to victim service organizations, public agencies (including Federal, State, or local governments) and non-governmental organizations that provide assistance to victims of crime. The funds could be used to provide emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, compensation, training and technical assistance for investigations and prosecutions of terrorism.|$|E
