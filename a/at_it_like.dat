5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind of looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But {{what do we need}} to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

In his 1997 {{biography}} Bad As I Wanna Be, he expresses his feelings for his father: [...] "I haven't seen my father in more than 30 years, so what's there to miss... I just look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> this: Some man brought me into this world. That doesn't mean I have a father". (He would not meet his father again until 2012.) ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Monte Neuble, Perry {{wrote the}} song {{entitled}} [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] for her third studio album, Teenage Dream. A total of 17 music engineers {{contributed to the}} track's composition. Critics suggest the song is about her former relationship with Gym Class Heroes' lead vocalist Travie McCoy. When finally asked about his opinion on the track, McCoy admitted to hearing about [...] "Circle the Drain", but has never actually listened to the song. Nonetheless, he commented: [...] "I heard she put out a song that's about me, or about some old habits or whatever. [...] I look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> this: I'm just stoked that she finally has a song with some substance on her record. Good job." ...|$|E

500|$|Nicole is Roman Harris' (Conrad Coleby) {{daughter}} {{and she was}} often mentioned on-screen before producers decided to introduce her into the serial. In January2008 {{it was announced that}} ex-Neighbours star Tessa James had been cast as Nicole. Executive producer Cameron Welsh said [...] "She is an exciting talent and I think audiences are going to love her character and respond really well to her." [...] James then moved to Sydney especially for the role. Speaking of working on the serial James stated: [...] "Working on a series like this [...] is the best training you can get, I look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> an apprenticeship and never forget how lucky I am." [...] Fellow cast member Celeste Dodwell who plays Melody Jones originally auditioned for the part of Nicole. After Coleby who plays Roman quit the serial, James' time with the show was in doubt.|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first. It's an art, you've got to look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> an art, treat it like an art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E
500|$|The drug itself, lithium, is {{typically}} {{used as a}} mood stabilizer to prevent acute manic behavior in patients with bipolar disorder. Lee chose the title as a [...] "metaphor for happiness from a negative point of view": [...] "It's looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like,</b> 'I don't want to numb myself and not feel anymore'." [...] She explained that during her process of writing music, she would get into a mood or a [...] "strange low that I ride" [...] that she would try to overcome by telling herself {{to let go of}} certain things, change and rejoice again; such experiences also inspired her to write [...] "Lithium". Initially, Lee was indecisive as to which song to choose as the second single from The Open Door, having in mind four different album tracks. [...] "Lithium" [...] was eventually chosen and made available for digital download on December 4, 2006. It was physically released in the United Kingdom on January 8, 2007. [...] "The Last Song I'm Wasting on You", a track originally written for The Open Door and later included as a bonus track on several editions of the album, was the single's B-side.|$|E

500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> that." ...|$|E

Die Natur sucht sich ja auch aus, was sie gebrauchen kann, was sie sich vermehren läßt und was nicht. Und wenn wir's mal so nehmen: Wenn die Lesben und Schwulen nun auch noch Kinder kriegen würden, dann hätten wir heute noch viel mehr Arbeitslose" [...] ("That {{lesbians and}} gays can't have {{children}} is after all quite natural. Nature too seeks {{out what it}} can use, what can reproduce and what can't. If we look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> that, if lesbians and gays did have children, then we'd {{have a lot more}} unemployed people today") – a remark made during a lecture on 12 March 1997 in Berlin – meant that she lost friends within the gay scene as well.|$|E
2500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins' albums Monuments to an Elegy (2014) {{and their}} {{upcoming}} tenth album (2016) will conclude the Teargarden by Kaleidyscope project. Corgan is unsure when Teargarden by Kaleidyscope {{will result in}} a box set, as originally announced, but it could include up to approximately 60 previously unreleased demos recorded for the project. He also stated that the future of the band is up in the air following the project's completion, saying: [...] "as I said {{at the beginning of the}} Teargarden project, I looked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like,</b> OK, I'm going to take this journey, and when this journey is over—which it now will be with Day for Night—it will [...] be the beginning [...] a new era of what the Smashing Pumpkins could be in the 21st century, or it will be the end.

2500|$|When {{asked by}} reporters after the 2011 ALDS {{if he had}} {{considered}} {{that he might have}} played for the final time with the Yankees, Posada said, [...] "I don't want to look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> that. We lost, and we'll see what happens in the off-season." [...] As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left the clubhouse area to compose himself. Girardi said, [...] "This guy, {{when you look at what}} he did in this series, he was awesome. He's had a tremendous career, and I'm sure he's going to continue to play, and I don't know what's going to happen." [...] Girardi added, [...] "But you talk about being proud of players — what he went through this year and what he gave us in the postseason, I don't think there's a prouder moment that I've had of Jorge." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{elevation}} to {{the status}} of a beloved classic came decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in the late 1970s. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. [...] "It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen," [...] Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. [...] "The film has {{a life of its own}} now, and I can look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> I had nothing to do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be president. I'm proud... but it's the kid who did the work. I didn't even think of it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea." [...] In a 1946 interview, Capra described the film's theme as [...] "the individual's belief in himself" [...] and that he made it [...] "to combat a modern trend toward atheism".|$|E
2500|$|Contrasting {{with some}} of the more sexual {{relationships}} of the other characters, Willow and Tara demonstrate a sentimental, soft, and consistent affection for each other. Some of this was pragmatic: the show was restricted in what it could present to viewers. Willow and Tara did not kiss until the fifth season in an episode that diverted the focus away from the display of affection when Buffy's mother dies in [...] "The Body". Before this, much of their sexuality is represented by allusions to witchcraft; spells doubled for physical affection such as an erotic ritual in [...] "Who Are You?" [...] where Willow and Tara chant and perspire in a circle of light until Willow falls back on a pillow gasping and moaning. Within the Buffy universe, magic is portrayed in a mostly female realm. As opposed to it being evil, it is an earth-bound force that is most proficiently harvested by women. The treatment of the lesbian relationship as integral to magic, representative of each other (love is magic, magic is love), earned the series some critical commentary from conservative Christians. To avoid large-scale criticism, scenes had to be shot several different ways because censors would not allow some types of action on screen. In the fourth and fifth seasons, the characters could be shown on a bed, but not under the covers. Hannigan noted the inconsistent standards with the other relationships on the show: [...] "you've got Spike and Harmony just going <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> rabbits, so it's very hypocritical". As a couple, Willow and Tara are treated {{by the rest of the}} Scoobies with acceptance and little fanfare. Susan Driver writes that younger viewers especially appreciate that Willow and Tara are able to be affectionate without becoming overly sexual, thus making them objects of fantasy for male enjoyment. Willow and Tara's influence on specifically younger female viewers is, according to Driver, [...] "remarkable".|$|E
