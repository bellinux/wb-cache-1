5|$|The four windows {{from the}} Tiffany studios include those {{donated by the}} college's Class of 1899 and Class of 1900. A window {{depicting}} Joan of Arc was donated in memory of Rutgers College sophomore Henry Janeway Weston (1877–1898) who committed suicide in 1898. According to Rutgers, this window was a gift of the Tiffany studios.

5|$|On December 1, 2006, {{a private}} party {{was held at}} the Jena Fair Barn. Bailey and four other black youths tried to enter the party at about 11:00p.m. According to U.S. Attorney Washington, they were told by <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>that</b> no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already at the party. A white male, who was not a student, moved in front of the woman and a fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the woman told both the white male and the black {{students}} to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students. Justin Sloan, a white male, was charged with battery {{for his role in the}} fight and was put on probation. Bailey later said that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head, but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} hype related to {{commercials}} {{in the months}} leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>that</b> feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} kind of bhoot, that of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>that</b> died during pregnancy or childbirth, {{is known as a}} chudail (dakini in Nepal and eastern India). Chudails look like human women, but their feet are turned backwards or other features are turned upside down. They can change their forms at any time. Chudails often try to lure young men at road crossings and fields or similar places. If a man is enamored of a chudail, it is believed that she will cause his death. There are, however, stories of people living with a chudail, or even marrying one.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{defection}} of {{some former}} supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to rally outside the courthouse, arousing criticism by anti-rape groups for regular {{attacks on the}} integrity and moral standing of Zuma's accuser, insults yelled at {{a close friend of}} the accuser, and even stones thrown at <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>that</b> members of the crowd mistook for the accuser. Zuma's defence team introduced evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to a state of shock, and that {{the relationship between the two}} was like that of a 'father-daughter' pair.|$|E

25|$|Two {{different}} {{oral traditions}} explain {{the use of}} the nose for playing the `ohe hano ihu. According to one, the `ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person's hā, breath, is expressive of the person's inner being. As the hā travels from the na`ao, or gut, through the mouth, the hā can be used to lie. When the hā travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>that</b> love will be expressed in the music he plays with his `ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing.|$|E
25|$|Spielrein {{completed}} her medical school dissertation, supervised first by Bleuler then by Jung, on a close {{study of the}} language of a patient with schizophrenia. It was published in the Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen, which Jung edited. Freud referenced it in the same volume in his postscript to the Schreber Case; It was the first doctorate ever to appear in a psychoanalytic journal, {{and one of the first}} psychoanalytic case studies of schizophrenia. Her dissertation contributed greatly to the understanding {{of the language of}} people with schizophrenia. Because her study was one of the first to focus on schizophrenia, the need for more research began and led to more people focusing on the mental illness. It was also the first dissertation written by <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>that</b> was psychoanalytically oriented. She left Zurich the day after her graduation, having resolved to establish an independent career as a psychoanalyst elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Dick's {{marriage}} to Nancy Hackett broke down, and she {{moved out of}} their shared home. Dick descended into amphetamine abuse, eventually allowing other drug users {{to move into the}} house with him. One day in November, Dick returned to his home in San Rafael to discover that it had been burgled, with his safe blown open and personal papers missing. The police were unable to determine the culprit, and even suspected Dick of having done so himself. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to be guest of honor at the Vancouver Science Fiction Convention in February 1972. Within a day of arriving at the conference and giving his speech The Android and the Human, he informed people that he {{had fallen in love with}} <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>that</b> he had met there, called Janis, and announced that he would be remaining in Vancouver. An attendee of the conference, Michael Walsh, movie critic for local newspaper The Province, invited Dick to stay in his home, but asked him to leave two weeks later due to his erratic behavior. This was followed by Janis ending her and Dick's relationship and moving away. On March 23, 1972, Dick attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the sedative potassium bromide. Subsequently, after deciding to seek help, Dick became a participant in X-Kalay (a Canadian Synanon-type recovery program), and was well enough by April to return to California.|$|E
