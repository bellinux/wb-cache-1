In this context, {{the purpose of the present}} paper was to analyze a real case study through a comparison of the environmental sustainability between a conventional steel crossbeam for light commercial vehicles and an innovative lightweight aluminum one. Methods For both scenarios, a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment methodology and a sensitivity analysis has been used through the study of the following phases: mineral extraction, component manufacturing, use on vehicle, and end of life. In particular, many primary data and a complete vehicle model simulation with three different European driving cycles have been used in order to reach the highest possible level of accuracy during the analysis. Results and discussion Regarding the manufacturing phase, the aluminum component’s production gave the highest impact because of the high energy required in the mineral reduction. Anyway, this stage of the analysis had a low effect on the entire LCA,becausethebenefitofweightreductionduringvehicleuseshowedastronglyhighercontribution. Theurbandrivingcycle had the most relevant impact, as a consequence of the frequent start and stop operations and the longest time with engine at idle speed, while the <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycle</b> is the less demanding due to its higher average speed and no start and stop.

In order {{to comply with the}} Protocol, CEE strategy is based on capillary information of fuel consumption of motor vehicles, to be done by producers, coupled to economic incentives to users in order to encourage ecological choices. The need to standardize the measure of GHG emission, related to the fuel consumption of a vehicle, allowed the drawing up of a very detailed procedure that includes the choice of driving simulation on urban and <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycles.</b> Many drivers claim that the difference between consumption of their own car and values declared by the producer is too high; tests performed by experts and published on trade journals such as Quattroruote (Italy) and Autobild (Germany), also demonstrate this datum; unfortunately nothing can be done to go against producers as such differences mainly depend on almost unrealistic car use simulations. Car producers fully respect the 98 / 69 /CE [1] while the 1999 / 94 /CE [2] is not so carefully followed.

40|$|Abstract: Pure {{electric}} mobility {{is still}} struggling {{to emerge in the}} present road vehicles scenario. This is mostly due to costs, nowadays still very high, and to battery range, which is intrinsically very limited with respect to the fuel tank of a traditional vehicle. To be effectively competitive, e-mobility should not be thought as the mere substitution of the thermal powertrain with the electric one on the same vehicle; instead, a holistic approach comprehensive of the integration of a charging network within the territory should be adopted. The vehicles should be tailored on the missions to be accomplished promoting the lightness, simplicity and low cost, and should be integrated within a charging infrastructure and a car-sharing system implemented in the reference territory. In this paper the authors aim at exposing their idea of e-mobility, justifying it by simulations carried out on three different vehicles (a Diesel-fuelled Renault Kangoo, an electric driven Renault Kangoo and an electric micro-vehicle Renault Twizy) and experimental data. The simulations were carried out {{with the help of a}} validated road vehicle model in different real road missions, namely <b>a</b> urban, <b>an</b> <b>extra-urban</b> and <b>a</b> mountain mission...|$|R

40|$|Reduction of the {{environmental}} impact of cars represents one of the biggest transport industry challenges. Beyond more efficient engines, a promising approach is to use eco-driving technologies that help drivers achieve lower fuel consumption and emission levels. In this study, a real-time microscopic fuel consumption model was developed. It was designed to be integrated into simulation platforms for the design and testing of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), aimed at keeping the vehicle within {{the environmental}}ly friendly driving zone and hence reducing harmful exhaust gases. To allow integration in platforms employed at early stages of ADAS development and testing, the model was kept very simple and dependent on a few easily computable variables. To show the feasibility of the identification of the model (and to validate it), a large experiment involving more than 100 drivers and about 8000 km of driving was carried out using an instrumented vehicle. An instantaneous model was identified based on vehicle speed, acceleration level and gas pedal excursion, applicable in <b>an</b> <b>extra-urban</b> traffic context. Both instantaneous and aggregate validation was performed and the model was shown to estimate vehicle fuel consumption consistently with in-field instantaneous measurements. Very accurate estimations were also shown for the aggregate consumption of each driving session...|$|R

Therefore, the optimal control strategy is the sticking point to effectively manage hybrid {{electric vehicle}}s.

40|$|International audienceTruck drivers {{typically}} display different behaviors when facing various driving events, e. g., {{approaching a}} roundabout, and thereby {{have a major}} impact both on the fuel consumption and the vehicle speed. Within the context where fuel is increasingly a major cost center for merchandise transport companies, {{it is important to recognize}} different driver behaviors in order to be able to simulate them as closely to the real data as possible during the truck development process. In this paper, we introduce, instead of economic driving, the notion of rational driving which seeks to decrease the average fuel consumption while respecting the transport companies’ constraint, i. e., the delivery delay. Moreover, we also propose an indicator, namely rational driving index (RDI), which enables to quantify how good a driver behavior is with respect to the rational driving. We then investigate various driving features contributing to characterize a rational driver behavior, using real driving data collected from 34 different truck drivers on <b>an</b> <b>extra-urban</b> road section particularly representative of travel paths of trucks ensuring regional merchandise distribution. Given the fact that real driving data collected on an open road can differ in terms of environment, e. g.,weather, trafﬁc, we further study, through simulations on a digital representation of a roundabout, the impact of two major driving features, i. e., the use of coasting and crossing speed at roundabouts, with respect to rational driving. The experimental results from both real driving data and simulations show high correlations of these two driving features with respect to RDI and demonstrate that a good rational driver tends to decelerate slowly during braking periods (use of coasting) and have high crossing speed in roundabouts...|$|R

The urban results {{were compared to}} <b>an</b> <b>extra-urban</b> control area (near the S. Rossore-Migliarino-Massaciuccoli Natural Park). The soils of the greenspaces of Pisa city were mostly sandy, subalkaline, lightly calcareous, with a rather high (mean of 3. 27 ± 1. 24 gC 100 g− 1 dry soil) and variable (1. 32 – 7. 57 gC 100 g− 1 dry soil) organic matter content. There were little differences in the functional diversity (AWCD) of soil microbial communities. Dehydrogenase, catalase, alkaline phosphatase, B-glucosidase and lipase showed little variability among soils while arylsulphatase, protease and urease activities varied within a fairly wide range of values. Values of the alkali-and water-soluble TEAC of urban soils varied within quite large ranges (2. 53 – 11. 45 mM g− 1 soil and 0. 11 – 2. 91 mM g− 1 dry soil, respectively) and were generally {{higher than those of}} control.

40|$|Reduction of {{pollutant}} emission by exhaust systems due to stricter limits has drastically increased {{the impact of}} previously ignored factors {{on the results of}} emission tests. One such factor is the cooling of the engine by the chassis dynamometer's external fan. Improper cooling can increase the temperature of the engine and the catalytic converter. Preliminary studies conducted by the Motor Transport Institute have confirmed that the configuration of the cooling fan influences exhaust system emissions.

To achieve this aim, emission levels were measured for various configurations of the chassis dynamometer (including both the fan speed and the distance {{from the front of the}} vehicle). During the tests, measurements were taken of temporary pollutant levels in the CVS and of the temperature of exhaust before and after the catalytic converter.

40|$|On the {{location}} of the ancient Greek colony of Akragas (near modern Agrigento, Sicily), just outside the ancient city walls, <b>an</b> <b>extra-urban</b> sanctuary has been revealed known under the toponiem, S. Anna. During the most recent investigations of the site several non-destructive survey techniques have been carried out to indicate presence of archaeological features on the field. The results from these surveys have indeed shown archaeological features which probably from an extension of the previously excavated areas. However, the results have been mainly treated as individual results and this thesis has opted to bring the data together in a comprehensive Geographical Information System. Thereafter the interpretations have been re-evaluated for new possible interpretations. This final step in the process has been aided by studying satellite imagery and topological features of the field. The analysis has clearly shown the that extensive analysis of the available resources yielded a more precise interpretation from the same survey results. Moreover, it be said that this study allows for a better preparation of future investigations on the field. The most important conclusion has shown that the modern surface level has significantly changed in time. Most probably, this is caused by decennia of ploughing from at least the 1960 s. The conclusion can be mainly verified by the newly gained results of the core drillings executed in June 2014. This, once more, confirms the importance of the creation of a complete dataset which comprises all aspects, research and field conditions known from a site. Eventually, the director of the project has been advised on excavation techniques mainly creating awareness of the expectation that the archaeological feature possibly lie more shallow than expected from the previous excavation. For the more remote future after the planned excavation project it has been advised to urge the farmer to change the ploughing technique or to change the agricultural purpose of the field to protect the archaeology for future research...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{economists have}} {{recently}} {{focused on a}} 'newly recognised' phenomenon: edge cities. In {{the first part of}} this paper we review the model of Krugman and Fujita and the model of Henderson and Mitra regarding this urban phenomenon. The introduction of our model represents a possible third way of explaining the edge city process. Our objective is to examine the conditions under which we can observe a relocation of firms from an urban location to <b>a</b> new <b>extra-urban</b> location. Our methodological framework is based on the model of monopolistic competition, which examines the economic relationships among firms at each industrial location and the relationships among distinct firms at different locations. These intrarelationships and interrelationships are examined according to the concept of complementarity. Complementarity in our case combines the notions of (1) firm interaction with cumulative and reinforcing effects, and (2) coordination among firms in local industrial structures. Our interest in this notion stems from the necessity to explain the spatial distribution of firms, particularly the reason why and where firms choose to locate in clusters. In our model we analyse this aspect of location in clusters from the point of view of the elasticity of substitution. ...|$|R
40|$|Consumption can be {{regarded}} as a typically urban specificity, at the point that the complex tangle of purchase dynamics, sale formats as well as space organisation patterns have been recently moulding a process of (re) urbanisation which dates back from the osmotic relationship between urban settlements and the marketplace. As a consequence, spatial dimension and consumption are so interwoven that even the apparently non-urban shopping centres reveal elements referable to urban “attitudes”, in terms of space patterns and social practices, owing to the urban values these new “consumption cathedrals” are representatives of. It is not a chance that shopping is considered as the main driving force shaping the so-called “cityscape” and “mindscape”: that is to say, both the tangible space organisation of urban fabric and what is generally perceived as the “spirit of the city”. The paper, part of a wider project still in progress, aims at highlighting the deep impact exerted by the recently opened Factory Outlet “Sicilia Fashion Village”, strategically located {{at the core of the}} island, in the province of Enna, within the territory of Agira municipality. This 25. 000 -square-metres aggregative non-lieu seems to be perfectly inserted in the wider retail Sicilian scenery, where the centre/periphery dialectics has been lately structuring around the dichotomy between “natural” shopping vocation of old town centres and, on the other hand, the newly abrupt proliferation of suburban shopping centres, which combine contemporary shopping practises with unprecedented socialisation dynamics. This new Factory Outlet Village stands on a traditionally depressed Sicilian area, where the tottering economy is still clinging to rural traditions, whilst the attempts at creating an industrial cluster, in the nearby Val Dittaino, have broken on infrastructural gaps as well as on the inadequacy of local players. Therefore, from the strategic standpoint, the apparently reckless location choice is justified by the wide accessibility provided by the motorway linking the main urban centres, Palermo and Catania, not to mention the perfect centrality at the core of the island, which lets prefigure a broader number of consumers coming from the whole Southern Italy. As a result, the main focus of this work deals with the geo-economic impact of such a consumption place, set in a chiefly half-rural landscape, punctuated by small or medium scale towns: in other words, it covers the new geographies of territories and flows, not to mention the effects on the local employment level as well as the potential process of re-imag(in) ing of such an area, rich in cultural and artistic heritage, which the new Outlet Village could promote indirectly. For this reason, the methodology implies an exhaustive study of the territorial and socio-economic layouts, in addition to a series of qualitative face-to-face semi-structured interviews to be distributed among both store managers and employees and, on the other hand, among visitors, in order to gather a patchwork of multifaceted “consumption narratives”. Compared to the retail Sicilian landscape, the wider Italian one reveals itself only slightly more rooted, since the first Outlet Villages have been rising for the last ten years, as the Italianised versions of the North American ones. These new shopping centres have been inserted into the constantly increasing evolution of urban patterns, branded by dispersion and fragmentation, apart from the consequent split between urbs and civitas. Strictly linked to this sprawl-oriented evolution, the growing mobility tendency has drawn a new map of space organisation, often structured around this consumption landscape, where shopping centres, factory outlets, malls (re) produce in <b>an</b> <b>extra-urban</b> dimension functions and narratives of space traditionally reserved to the urban one. It is against these (post) modern sceneries of anthropic contemporaneity, full of symbolic layers, that the Outlet Villages are outlined, demanding a specificity depending not only on the product array but also on the architectural patterns which hint more explicitly to the real urban layouts, in a kind of trick of reflections between real places and fictional non-lieux. It is not a chance that this study is inserted in a wider analyses of the whole retail Sicilian landscape which, later on but similarly to Northern Italy, has been recently facing a sudden multiplication of new consumption centres at the point that a new geography of shopping places and practices has upset atavistic relations, such as those centre/periphery, city/countryside, urban/rural...|$|R
40|$|The European Union, in the “Thematic Strategy on the Urban Environment” (2006), {{has pointed}} out the {{importance}} of identification and monitoring urban environment quality indicators. In this scheme, the quality of 31 urban green areas in Pisa was assessed by monitoring topsoil physical, chemical and biological features and by using the plant bioindicator Taraxacum officinale Web. Results were compared with <b>an</b> <b>extra-urban</b> area (near S. Rossore-Migliarino-Massaciuccoli Natural Park) and with the quantitative limits fixed by Italian Law (DLgs 152 / 2006). The soils of the green areas of Pisa were mostly sandy, sub-alkaline, and lightly calcareous, with rather high organic matter content. They showed a widespread pollution by hydrocarbons, probably caused by road traffic incomplete combustion and by domestic heating. Only in few sites the total amounts of Cd, Cr and Hg {{were significantly higher than}} the minimum value established by the Italian Law. Probably due to the vehicular traffic, pollution by Pb, Cu and Zn was instead widespread. A sequential extraction (BCR method) was performed for determining the forms of heavy metals within the soil matrix. Instead of Zn and Pb, Cr and Cu showed the absence in soil of the labile forms. As far as Cr forms were concerned, the most represented one was the residual, while the anthropogenic addition of the element was found in the oxidizable form. For Cu forms, the most represented was the residual, while reducible and oxidizable forms were enriched by anthropogenic addition of the element. Regarding Pb and Zn forms, the most represented one was the reducible, while the anthropogenic additions of the elements were evenly distributed among the four fractions. Principal component analysis revealed the existence of four different patterns of distribution of the elements, whose differences have been attributed at the origin, each composed of a different number of variables: the first one, consisting of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, and Zn, whose main source was fit to identify in the traffic; as to the second factor, consisting of Fe, Mn, and Ni, the main source was identified by pedogenic substrate. Each of the third and the fourth factor was composed of a single element, respectively Cr and Hg, which had a particular distribution, different from that of all other HMs. Even the geostatistical analysis has identified the previous four patterns of distribution of HMs, bringing back, through interpolation techniques, also their coarse spatial distribution; according to this analysis, the central area of the city was identified as the one having the most polluted green areas. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified different groups of areas with different levels of contamination, both from the qualitative and quantitative point of view. Platinoids (Pt, Pd), “new generation” pollutants, released from recently introduced three way catalytic converters, absent in the substrate, showed a beginning of accumulation in a limited number of areas. As to soil biological features, cumulative respiration of monitored areas was evaluated during a 25 day incubation period. Results showed that evolved CO 2 -C was different among the monitored areas and influenced by soil carbon total content and pollution level. Community level physiological profiling of soil microbial population of the monitored areas was performed by using Biolog Ecoplates. The relative data of AWCD, CMD and H (Shannon-Weaver index of biodiversity) showed a limited variability among the monitored areas. Soil antioxidant capacity was evaluated and showed changes among monitored areas, being correlated with organic carbon content and, in particular, with phenolic substances. Soil enzymatic activities vary among monitored sites and appear to be influenced by organic matter and pollutants’ contents. The control site has shown the lowest rate of activities if compared to all the other sites. Positive correlation was detected among all enzymatic activities except for dehydrogenase. In spite of the presence of various pollutants, vegetal bioindicator Taraxacum officinale Web. did not show any alteration in the photosynthetic process with values of Fv/Fm, and FPSII, representing respectively the efficiency of PSII in conducting photochemical events and photochemical yield of PSII, typical of the leaves of healthy plants. Even photosynthetic pigment contents and qNP, representing mechanisms aiming at dissipating excess excitation energy, did not show any alteration among the monitored areas. That trend was confirmed by other parameters, monitored in order to understand if the polluted urban environment is not dangerous for the plant or if vegetal put into repairing actions. On the dissected aboveground and radical portions of the biomarker, antioxidant capacity, phenolic content, heavy metals contents and metal chelating capacity of vegetal tissues did not reveal any differences among the monitored sites, probably showing the dandelion ability in non-absorbing pollutants. We can finally conclude that the degree of pollution of the green areas in the city of Pisa, although present, does not cause major problems to the utilized bioindicators. We need more sensible biomarkers to effectively detect this degree of pollution...|$|R
