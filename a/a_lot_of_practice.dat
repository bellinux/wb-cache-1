25|$|A Zimbabwe {{team that}} had made one change from the {{previous}} Test, exchanging Ewing for Test debutant Waddington Mwayenga, gave the Indian slip fielders and wicket-keeper <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> during the first morning of the second Test of the series, as four catches went to hand during the first 69 balls of the match. It started with Brendan Taylor, who edged to Rahul Dravid with the third delivery of the match, out for 4. Terry Duffin and Dion Ebrahim showed more patience, lasting for ten overs, but once Irfan Pathan found Duffin's outside edge Zimbabwe lost three wickets for no runs. Captain Tatenda Taibu, who had been top-scorer in both innings in the last Test, made a two-ball duck, while Dion Ebrahim was caught behind off Zaheer Khan, Zaheer's first wicket in the match. Heath Streak and Hamilton Masakadza survived for fifteen overs – four of them bowled by captain Sourav Ganguly, testing his skills with the swinging ball – but Streak eventually edged a ball from Harbhajan onto his pads and {{into the hands of}} Gautam Gambhir, leaving Zimbabwe at 75 for 5 at lunch.|$|E

[...] Fifteen songs were rehearsed for the album pre-production sessions in New York {{in preparation for the}} Electric Lady Studios recording sessions.

The other song, an ode to two women who ran the Weezer fanclub called [...] "Mykel & Carli", was attempted during the Electric Lady sessions, but was also abandoned (this recording would later be released as a digital bonus track on the 2010 Death to False Metal album).

40|$|Monitoring {{of metal}} oxide surge arresters (MOA) due to aging, {{moisture}} and other components cause increased resistive current. Through <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>practices,</b> {{it has been}} proved {{that in the early}} days, MOA insulation damage and current increase is not obvious. The accurate working conditions of the MOA are also not obvious but it can reflect the aging or moisture of MOA. When the resistive current of the fundamental component increases, there is no increment in the harmonic components that is the general performance of a serious or moisture contamination. In the same way when the resistive current of harmonic components increases, the fundamental component is not increased and it is the general performance of aging. Therefore, this paper designed an experiment-based FPGA and C 8051 F-line monitoring device. This device uses resistive current as a detection target. The main monitoring parameters are the fundamental and peak value of resistive current, third harmonic content of the leakage current, phase angle difference and power consumption. Through laboratory tests, the device can be used with a network arrester line monitoring, maintenance, reduce the economic losses caused by power outages and improve the distribution network reliability. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} developing a {{computer aided design system}} for a traditional tie-dyeing craft named “Shibori”. These products of folk crafts are made with the manual labors and their processes are divided into <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>practiced</b> hand works. In addition their manufacturing processes are dispersed to different regions. So the <b>practiced</b> hand works <b>of</b> the “Drawing / Pattern carving Shibori” process decrease in number. Producing Shibori products may become difficult because anyone cannot plan the Shibori products in the future. If the “Drawing / Pattern carving Shibori” process is simplified by computerizing, we can record the Shibori technology and can also design Shibori products easily. In this report, therefore, we developed both a CAD system for “Drawing” process in order to simplify its process and keep skilled hands of Shibori products, and a CAM system for “Pattern carving Shibori” process using CAD data. This CAD system is useful for “Mokume-Shibori” to make their stitch images by means of its small scale modification. This report also provides an overview of a CAD system for “Mokume-Shibori” to make their stitch images and a CAM system to make its trial fabric. © 2015 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R
