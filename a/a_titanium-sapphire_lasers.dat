40|$|Amplified {{spontaneous}} emission (ASE) is demonstrated in volume-distributed feedback (DFB) structures, formed by colloidal CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals and ZrO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer matrix. Periodic redistribution of the NPs in an organic matrix {{was carried out}} by holographic photopolymerization in a specially developed light-sensitive nanocomposite. The composite consists of two acrylate monomers and two types of inorganic NPs. The NPs provide for the formation of two co-phased gratings-a refractive index grating and an optical gain (losses) grating. The core-shell CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals are used as a gain medium, while ZrO 2 NPs create the refractive index grating and enhance the distributed feedback. The period of the volume structure provides the feedback for lasing at the wavelength lambda(las) of about 575 nm in the second diffraction order. In contrast to known laser systems based on volume DFB cavities, in which the different components of the formulation provide optical gain and feedback, in our case the inorganic NPs serve as an emitting material and can provide simultaneously for feedback.

Forward and backward signals were detected and compared. Results:The three imaging modalities provide complementary information on intact tissue over the entire thickness of the cornea. THG imaging reveals the tissue morphology, including the epithelium structure with sub-cellular resolution. Polarization-resolved THG microscopy reveals stromal birefringent domains. In phenol-stained corneas, THG also reveals the keratocytes network. SHG imaging probes the distribution of stromal collagen lamellas organization. 2 PEF imaging reveals the elastic component of the extra-cellular matrix {{and the distribution of}} fluorescent organelles (i. e. mitochondria) in stromal and epithelial cells.
