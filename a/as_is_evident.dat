5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that there was a}} facade in front of the chamber, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy. It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice {{gives way to the}} epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E
5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It is probable {{that there was an}} ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been quarried.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 8th {{century as}} {{architectural}} styles evolved, new elements were added <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> in kasuga-zukuri (Kasuga Shrine and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at Enjō-ji), the flowing roof or nagare-zukuri (Shimogamo Shrine), hachiman-zukuri (Usa Shrine) and hiyoshi-zukuri (Hiyoshi Taisha). The nagare-zukuri continues to be the more popular style, followed by the kasuga-zukuri. The honden of Ujigami Shrine dates to this period. At {{the end of the}} Heian period torii and fences were commonly replaced with two-storied gates and grand colonnades copied from temple architecture. The influence of the residential shinden-zukuri style of palaces and mansions is apparent in shrines such as Itsukushima Shrine.|$|E
5|$|Godwin had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} {{in language and}} communication (<b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), {{and this was the}} topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of words and phrases also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, François Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem, all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel.|$|E
5|$|Currently, both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus are {{classified}} within the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out. Currie and colleagues, in 2003 and 2017, {{argued that a}} synonymy is very probable {{in the light of}} new fossil discoveries in the Nemegt Formation. After relocating the original Nemegtosaurus quarry, these researchers excavated postcranial bones of the Nemegtosaurus holotype including the centrum of a caudal vertebra and hind limb bones, which allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison between the Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia type specimens based on overlapping elements. These postcranial elements were found to be very similar to the corresponding parts of the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype. Most importantly, the discovered caudal centrum is opisthocoelous – a diagnostic feature of Opisthocoelicaudia – suggesting that both genera were either closely related or synonymous. Furthermore, these authors noted that none of the 32 known sauropod localities of the Nemegt Formation revealed evidence for the presence of more than one species of sauropod. In her first description, Borsuk-Białynicka (1977) argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is nothing unusual, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> in the North American Morrison Formation. Currie and colleagues, however, stressed that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was fundamentally different, as larger dinosaurs were present with only few species per clade, indicating a harsh and geographically restricted habitat. Definitive proof for the suggested synonymy is, however, still missing, and additional overlapping elements would be required before Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus can be formally declared synonyms.|$|E

25|$|From an expansionist perspective, Uthman is {{regarded}} as skilled in conflict managements <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> from how he dealt with the heated and troubled early Muslim colonies such as Kufa and Basra by directing the hot-headed Arab settlers to the new military campaigns and expansions. This not only resulted in settling the internal conflicts in those settlement garrisons, but also further expanded the Rashidun's territory which reached as far west as southern Iberia and as far east as Sindh, Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|At one point, which {{coincided with}} the new Islamic powers during the Emirate of Córdoba, the {{fortress}} was constructed. Later, during the Caliphate and early taifas, the local infrastructures were altered, resulting in the expansion of some living quarters into the defensive walls.

The defensive systems were altered over time, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> in the late construction of the tower protecting the main gate.|$|E
40|$|Using event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs), {{we examined}} the relative contributions of familiarity and recollection to recognition memory for items and their study contexts in school-aged children and adults. Whereas adults were able to selectively accept target items and to reject familiar nontarget items in ail exclusion task, this discrimination was more difficult for children, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> in the high false alarm rates to nontargets even when item memory was controlled for. The analysis of the adults' ERPs revealed more flexible and task-appropriate retrieval mechanisms, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> in the correlates of familiarity, recollection, mid nontarget retrieval, {{as well as in}} postretrieval evaluation. In contrast, children's ERPs revealed a parietal old/new effect for targets taken as a putative correlate of recollection. These findings suggest that children rely predominantly oil recollection during recognition judgments, {{even in the absence of}} efficient memory control processes. The latter processes enable adults to monitor and verify the retrieved information and to control nontarget retrieval in the service of adequate source memory performance...|$|R
