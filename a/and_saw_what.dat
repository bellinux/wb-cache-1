5|$|At Monte Cassino the {{historic}} abbey overlooked Allied positions below. Ground commanders were sure the monastery {{was being used}} by the Germans as an observation post. Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg, commander of the New Zealand Corps preparing for a new assault on the mountain, had repeatedly requested that the abbey be bombed. Taking advantage of the German practice of not giving away their positions by firing on small planes, Devers and Eaker flew low over the monastery, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> they believed to be a radio aerial and enemy soldiers moving in and out. Wilson reluctantly agreed to its bombing. On 15 February Devers watched waves of American bombers level the monastery with Alexander, Clark, Freyberg and Eaker. But follow-up attacks that day, and over the next eight days, failed to take the position, much less break the Gustav Line. Devers visited Anzio on 16 February, and agreed with Alexander that Lucas should be relieved. Clark did so on 22 February.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Abraham {{went to the}} place where he stood before God. He [...] "looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah" [...] <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> became of the cities of the plain, where not even [...] "ten righteous" [...] (v.18:32) had been found, as [...] "the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1981 {{expedition}} would {{feature the}} only [...] "close encounters" [...] of the Mackal expeditions. It occurred when, {{while on a}} river, they heard a loud splash <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> Greenwell described as [...] " [...] large wake (about 5") ... originating from the east bank". Greenwell asserted that the wake must {{have been caused by}} an [...] "animate object" [...] that was unlike a crocodile or hippo. Additionally, Greenwell noted that the encounter occurred at a sharp river bend where, according to natives, Mokèlé-mbèmbé frequently lived due to deep waters at those points.|$|E
2500|$|His {{former coach}} Dan Reeves said about Gradishar, [...] "He {{was as good}} a linebacker as I have ever been around, and I have been around some great ones. He was a leader without {{question}} of our defense while I was with Denver. He was an exceptional football player. I {{had a great deal}} of respect for him when I was at Dallas before I ever went to Denver. After I arrived in Denver <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> kind of a leader he was my respect for him grew. He never missed a game and was a dominant force on the field. The opposing team always had to take him into account when they devised their game plans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boccioni {{became the}} main theorist {{of the artistic}} movement. [...] "Only when Boccioni, Severini {{and a few other}} Futurists {{traveled}} to Paris <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> Braque and Picasso had been doing did the movement begin to take real shape." [...] He also decided to be a sculptor after he visited various studios in Paris, in 1912, including those of Braque, Archipenko, Brâncuși, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and, probably, Medardo Rosso. In 1912 he exhibited some paintings together with other Italian futurists at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, and the following year returned to show his sculptures at the Galerie La Boétie: all related to the elaboration of what Boccioni had seen in Paris, they in their turn probably influenced the Cubist sculptors, especially Duchamp-Villon.|$|E

2500|$|The first air–launch was {{performed}} on 25 July 1958 by NOTS research pilot William West, a career US Navy officer. The flight originated from China Lake's airstrip at Inyokern. The jet fighter was placed into a steep climb. The rocket released automatically at 41,000 feet, and three seconds later the first two HOTROCs ignited. The pilot was distracted during this time–the sudden release of weight had flipped his aircraft into a tumble. In mid–crisis, West looked up <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> he thought was the vehicle exploding. He reported it that way, but John Nicolaides (director of the Navy's space program in Washington D.C.) later determined that the [...] "explosion" [...] was the plume from the rocket's motors as the exhaust expanded in the thin atmosphere. However, when ground control heard {{the report of the}} [...] "explosion", it ordered the ground tracking stations (approximately six in number) around the world to stand down. Thus only one station (at Christchurch NZ) remained on the air; it heard a beeping {{in the right place at}} the right time. However, the signal was not repeated, so the shot was declared a failure.|$|E
2500|$|Freeman Dyson, a British (and later American) {{physicist}} who {{had worked}} as a young man with RAF Bomber Command from July 1943 {{to the end of the}} war, wrote in later years: [...] "For many years I had intended to write a book on the bombing. Now I do not need to write it, because Vonnegut has written it much better than I could. He was in Dresden at the time <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> happened. His book is not only good literature. It is also truthful. The only inaccuracy that I found in it is that it does not say that the night attack which produced the holocaust was a British affair. The Americans only came the following day to plow over the rubble. Vonnegut, being American, did not want to write his account in such a way that the whole thing could be blamed on the British. Apart from that, everything he says is true." [...] Dyson later goes on to say: [...] "Since the beginning of the war I had been retreating step by step from one moral position to another, until at the end I had no moral position at all".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the Third Age, the use of palantíri {{influenced}} {{events of}} The Lord of the Rings. Saruman looked through the Orthanc stone, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> he thought was an unassailable strength in Mordor, helping to corrupt him. When Pippin touched the Orthanc-stone, he encountered Sauron, who was likely attempting to contact Saruman using the Ithil-stone. Sauron thought he saw the hobbit who had the One Ring. [...] When Aragorn, exercising his lawful authority as heir to the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor, used the stone, he revealed himself to Sauron and wrenched the stone's power free of Sauron's will. As a lawful user of the stone, Aragorn then used the stone to see many things and most importantly the attack on the Falas, which he then intercepted by riding the Paths of the Dead with Rangers of the North. Denethor's constant use of the Anor-stone in Minas Tirith since becoming Steward of Gondor aged him as he battled with Sauron. The images that he saw steered by Sauron in part plus Faramir's apparently mortal wound convinced him that there was no hope for Gondor, which resulted in his attempted murder of Faramir and his own suicide in the tomb of the Stewards off the Rath Dinen, the Silent Way.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{went to see}} {{quite a lot of}} them" [...] , [...] "I mean I {{went back}} to the villages, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> I had done. I used to go painting, as you know, when I had any time off, and I went to one village in Normandy, and painted it, because I had picked it {{particularly}} and it was a waste of time, because everybody" [...] "had got through," [...] " [...] and I found what I had thought in the rubble were a whole row of footballs, and they weren't footballs - I was sitting right beside them, painting - and they weren't footballs, they were children's heads, and what it was, I discovered later, was a whole school of kids, a convent, had been pulled out of school, out of class, and lined up in this little narrow alleyway between the buildings to save them from the bombing, and the whole thing had come in on top of them, plus the nuns, but by that time [...] they were lice-ridden, and there was nothing. I can talk about it now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that. A row of kid's heads that you thought were footballs and you kick one and it wasn't, and it rolled away down the rubble." ...|$|E

60|$|Mabel said nothing. Bob was not clever, {{but he was}} {{sometimes}} shrewd <b>and</b> she <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> was in his mind. This was easier because he looked uncomfortable.
