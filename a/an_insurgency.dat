5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation.

This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Mu'azzam {{organised}} <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> {{to overthrow}} Aurangzeb and proclaim himself the Mughal emperor. This plan {{may have been}} hatched at the instigation of the Marathas, and Mu'azzam's own inclinations and sincerity are difficult to gauge. Anyway, Aurangzeb learned about the plot and sent Mu'azzam's mother Begum Nawab Bai (a Muslim Rajput princess by birth) to dissuade Mu'azzam from rebellion. Nawab Bai brought Mu'azzam back to the Mughal court, where {{he spent the next}} several years under Aurangzeb's supervision. However, Mu'azzam revolted in 1680 on the pretext of protesting Aurangzeb's treatment of Rajput chiefs. Once again, Aurangzeb followed his previous policy to dissuade Mu'azzam with gentleness and then to place him under greater vigilance.|$|E

5|$|In an {{alternate}} universe, Joker (Richard Epcar) tricks Superman (George Newbern) into killing a pregnant Lois Lane, which detonates {{a nuclear weapon}} that destroys Metropolis and kills millions. Batman (Kevin Conroy) interrogates Joker (on where he got the weapon) after the attack, but a devastated Superman breaks into the interrogation room and murders Joker in retribution. Over the following years, Superman becomes a ruthless tyrant who establishes a unified world government named the One Earth Regime that eliminates crime through a worldwide authoritarian regime, which he leads as its High Councillor, but Batman establishes <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> against his regime, and a war breaks out between the two factions, leaving the Justice League disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to President Ngo Dinh Diem's abrogation of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists {{during the late}} 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and material to the guerrillas of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), who were fighting <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> to topple the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E
5|$|Many Katangese gendarmes {{and their}} {{mercenary}} leaders {{took refuge in}} Angola to reorganise, acting under orders from Tshombe. In 1964, Tshombe was welcomed back to the Congo and made prime minister. He immediately called on his forces to suppress communist revolts {{in the east and}} centre of the country. This they accomplished but Tshombe was dismissed from his post in 1965, ultimately losing all contact with them following his imprisonment in Algeria in 1967. Relations between the new central government and the gendarmes soured and after a mutiny was repressed, they returned to Angola. <b>An</b> <b>insurgency</b> for Katangese secession continued until late 2016.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, the communist-dominated Vietminh {{fought the}} French colonial forces {{in an attempt}} to gain Vietnamese independence. After the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Vietnam was {{partitioned}} at the 17thparallel, pending national reunification elections in 1956. The elections were canceled, resulting in the long-term existence of communist North Vietnam and anti-communist South Vietnam as separate states. In the late-1950s, South Vietnamese guerrillas known as the Viet Cong—covertly supported by North Vietnam—began <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> with the aim of forcefully reunifying the country under communist rule. With the Cold War at its height, the United States—the main backer of South Vietnam—sent military advisers into the country to help train and guide the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in their fight against the Vietcong. By 1964, there were 23,000American military personnel in the country. The communists viewed the Americans as colonizers and the South Vietnamese as their puppets, and attacked both with force.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990 <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> {{known as}} the Log Revolution took place in Croatia, centred on the {{predominantly}} Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and, after the RSK declared its intention to unite with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a breakaway state. By March 1991 the conflict escalated, resulting in the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium on Croatia and the RSK's declarations followed, after which their decisions were implemented on 8 October.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E
5|$|Mersea Fort {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} Captain William Burrell. Guns and {{ammunition}} were kept there in case of a fresh rebellion, with a garrison of 36 men, which was temporarily reinforced by an additional squadron of horsemen and 50 foot soldiers in July 1650. Repairs were made from 1651 onwards, and new accommodation was constructed for the fort's gunners. After an invasion scare in 1655, Mersea was temporarily used to imprison Royalists suspected of planning <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> against Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth government. The fort was then demobilised by Cromwell as part of his efforts to reduce defence costs; Burrell was ordered to dismantle the fort but the order was never carried out, partially because of the practical difficulties and because of opposition from the owner of the land. The admiralty court continued to be held in the fort, although it proved much harder to enforce the fishery rules because of the political turmoil.|$|E
5|$|The Jin persisted {{with their}} advance into the {{remaining}} Song territories {{south of the}} Yangtze.

The Jurchens created the puppet government of Da Qi {{to serve as a}} buffer state between Song and Jin, but Qi failed to defeat the Song. The Jin abolished Qi in 1137. As the Jin gave up on conquering the Southern Song, diplomatic talks for a peace treaty resumed. Signed in 1142, the Treaty of Shaoxing established the boundary between the two states along the Huai River, which runs north of the Yangtze. The treaty forbade the Song from purchasing horses from the Jin, but smuggling continued in the border markets.

On 16 June 1963, Somali guerrillas started <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> at Hodayo, in eastern Ethiopia, a watering place north of Werder, after Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie rejected their demand for self-government in the Ogaden. The Somali government initially refused to support the guerrilla forces, which eventually numbered about 3,000. However, in January 1964, after Ethiopia sent reinforcements to the Ogaden, Somali forces launched ground and air attacks across the border and started providing assistance to the guerrillas. The Ethiopian Air Force responded with punitive strikes across its southwestern frontier against Feerfeer, northeast of Beledweyne and Galkayo. On 6 March 1964, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed to a cease-fire. At {{the end of the}} month, the two sides signed an accord in Khartoum, Sudan, agreeing to withdraw their troops from the border, cease hostile propaganda, and start peace negotiations. Somalia also terminated its support of the guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|The new cruiser {{was laid}} down in 1907 at the Ansaldo {{shipyard}} in Genoa for the Ottoman Empire, under the name Drama. But following {{the rise of the}} Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government became unwilling to pay its foreign debts, which led Ansaldo to halt construction work. Work on the ship only resumed in late 1911 when Italy seized the ship following its declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire in the Italo-Turkish War. The completed hull was launched on 11 November 1912, and following the completion of fitting-out work, the new ship was commissioned on 25 March 1913. On 3 September 1914, Libia was in the port of Durazzo, Albania when Prince William, the ruler of the country, departed following turmoil caused by <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> in the country, coupled with the outbreak of World War I. Libia had landed a contingent of marines to restore order in the city, where some 2,000 refugees fleeing the insurgents attempted to board passenger ships bound for Italy.

5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} {{on the hot}} summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched <b>an</b> <b>insurgency</b> that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E
