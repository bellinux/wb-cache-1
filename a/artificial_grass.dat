5|$|Mercedes {{topped the}} time sheets {{in the second}} session, now {{switching}} to the soft compound tyres as well, with Nico Rosberg two and a half-tenths of a second clear of Kimi Räikkönen, while Lewis Hamilton was third fastest, more than seven tenths off Rosberg's time. Räikkönen's running was interrupted for a while when he was called back into the pitlane to investigate a fuel system problem, but {{was able to get}} back out. Fernando Alonso was seventh fastest for McLaren, but needed a replacement of his car's plank after running wide over <b>artificial</b> <b>grass</b> surrounding the track. His teammate, Jenson Button, also experienced problems, having to stop {{at the end of the}} pitlane early in the session with an electrical issue. Renault's problem from the first session continued: Jolyon Palmer, back in his car in place of Ocon, suffered a tyre failure on the start-finish straight, bringing out red flags in the process. Renault and tyre supplier Pirelli were left puzzled over the failure, as in this incident, no sign of a cut from debris was found.|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the {{understanding}} of wind flow in an urban environment, windtunnel simulations were carried out using an urban model of 1 / 250 scale. The results fromthese simulations were compared with those derived from tests based upon the moderately roughsurface flow generated by the uniformly distributed <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses</b> in the previous paper. The {{results show that the}} boundary layer thickness increases with the fetch above both theurban model and the <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses.</b> Close to the ground surface, there is a layer in whichmean wind speed and turbulence intensity distributions vary with the surface roughness andthe fetch. In the case of the urban model, the lower layer occupies almost the half of the bound-ary layer. But {{in the case of the}} <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses</b> it occupies less than thirty percent.

60|$|Early on the {{following}} morning Thorne set out for his holding, and {{on the day after}} he got there he set about cutting prairie hay. As a rule, nobody sows <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses</b> when taking up new land, but as some fodder for the teams is required it is generally cut in a dried-up sloo where the water gathers in the thaw. In such places the grass grows tall, and as it rapidly ripens and whitens in the sun all the farmer need do is to cut it and carry it home.|$|R

Space time correlations and power spectra areobtained from the longitudinal wind speed fluctuation. Integral scales of turbulence are cal-culated by three different ways and compared with each other. The aspect ratio of the tur-bulent eddy obtained from the space correlations is three to five. Taylor's hypothesis ischecked by comparing the integral scales obtained form the space correlation with those fromthe autocorrelation. The ratio of the traveling speed of the turbulent eddy to the mean windspeed decreases with the height and the wind speed...|$|R
60|$|Now, <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses</b> {{are seldom}} sown {{on the prairie}} where usually the natural product grows {{only a few inches}} high, and as {{building}} logs are scarce, implements are often kept just where they last were used. It was therefore necessary to seek hay worth cutting in a dried-out slough, or swamp, and next to find the mower, which might lie anywhere within a radius of four miles or so. We came upon them both together, the mower lying on its side, red with rust, amid a stretch of waist-high grass. The latter was harsh and wiry, heavy-scented with wild peppermint, and made ready for us by the sun.|$|R
25|$|Artificial turf, or {{synthetic}} turf, is {{a man-made}} surface {{made to look}} like natural grass. It is most often used in arenas for sports that were originally or are normally played on grass. In 1960, David Chaney is the man long credited with inventing the first generation of <b>artificial</b> <b>grass</b> turfs. Artificial turf then had its commercial birth in 1965 when it was installed at the Reliant Astrodome, a stadium in Houston, Texas.|$|E

The arena is completely enclosed by tight netting, a few metres from each side and end of the pitch. The playing surface is normally <b>artificial</b> <b>grass</b> matting. Whilst the pitch is the same length, however, the batsmen do not have to run the entire length. The striker's crease is in the regulation place in front of the stumps, but the non-striker's crease is only halfway down the pitch.|$|E

If either team feels that the pitch is unsafe, the referee must try to resolve the issues and must not start the match if any part of the ground is considered to be dangerous.|$|E
40|$|The mail goal of {{this paper}} was to analyse the {{environmental}} impact of agricultural practices in Valea Calugareasca viticultural ecosystem. Diversity characterizes the healthy state of ecosistems. The quantification of biodiversity was achieved in order to understand and compare the ecosystem community structure, based on the following indicators: Simpson biodiversity index, Shannon biodiversity index, equitability. They were applied five different variants of vines culture technology: (1) natural permanent grassing soil; (2) temporary natural grassing; (3) <b>artificial</b> <b>grassing</b> or sown; (4) cultivation of the strips between the rows with plants bees; (5) black furrow by plowing. The biodiversity at the level of useful and harmful insect species was influenced by the applied culture technology, this process been highlighted by the values of diversity indices.

60|$|Dio, however, {{is said to}} be an old German {{word for}} a slave; and it is {{possible}} that aldius (a word only known, seemingly, in Lombardy) may have signified originally an old slave, an old Roman colonus, or peasant of some sort, found by the conquerors in possession of land, and allowed to retain, and till it, from father to son. We, in England, had the same distinction between 'Laet,' or 'villains' settled on the land, glebae adscripti, and mere thralls or theows, slaves pure and simple. No doubt such would have better terms than the mere mancipia--slaves taken in war, or bought--for the simple reason, that they would be agriculturists, practised in the Roman tillage, understanding the mysteries of irrigation, <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses,</b> and rotation of crops, as well as the culture of vines, fruit, and olives.|$|R
60|$|To many persons this Egdon was a {{place which}} had slipped out of its century generations ago, to intrude as an uncouth object into this. It was an {{obsolete}} thing, and few cared to study it. How could this be otherwise {{in the days of}} square fields, plashed hedges, and meadows watered on a plan so rectangular that on a fine day they looked like silver gridirons? The farmer, in his ride, who could smile at <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses,</b> look with solicitude at the coming corn, and sigh with sadness at the fly-eaten turnips, bestowed upon the distant upland of heath nothing better than a frown. But as for Yeobright, when he looked from the heights on his way he could not help indulging in a barbarous satisfaction at observing that, in some of the attempts at reclamation from the waste, tillage, after holding on for a year or two, had receded again in despair, the ferns and furze-tufts stubbornly reasserting themselves.|$|R

2500|$|Sutil's race ended {{instantly}} but Pérez {{was able}} to limp back his damaged Force India back to the pit lane to retire. The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car to allow debris to be cleared from the track by trackside marshals. Both McLaren cars, Hülkenberg, Gutiérrez and Vettel made pit stops for medium compound tyres. The safety car was withdrawn {{at the end of}} the fourth lap and racing resumed with Rosberg leading Hamilton [...] Both Mercedes cars pulled away from Massa who fended off attempts by his teammate Bottas to retake third position. Alonso locked his rear wheels, and Ricciardo drove on the outside line before steering onto the inside lane to pass him for fifth. He narrowly avoided hitting the rear-end of Bottas's car. Alonso attacked Ricciardo and the two went alongside each other through the second corner with the Ricciardo keeping fifth by driving onto the <b>artificial</b> <b>grass</b> at the turn's exit, prompting Alonso to reduce his speed as they drove through the turn three and four switchback. Maldonado pressured Räikkönen but the latter resisted his overtaking attempts. Vergne lined up an overtake on Maldonado entering the first turn but was unable to get ahead of Maldonado.|$|E

He managed to get past Grosjean by going around the outside of him on lap 42. Vettel braked late and got ahead of Magnussen to take over ninth place on the same lap. Alonso made a pit stop for soft compound tyres on lap 43 and emerged in seventh behind Vettel. He immediately became involved in a three-way battle between Vettel and Magnussen for sixth to eighth. Vettel was not happy with the handling of his car because his tyres were worn and Alonso passed him with DRS to retake sixth place on lap 46. Rosberg went half a second quicker than teammate Hamilton to be 1.9 seconds adrift of his teammate {{at the start of the}} next lap and Hamilton was cautioned over the radio to be cautious about tearing up a piece of <b>artificial</b> <b>grass</b> which became dislodged at the turn 19 exit. As Rosberg attacked to further reduce the gap, Hamilton went quicker to extend his lead by four-tenths of a second. Massa was told by his team to reduce the deficit to Ricciardo and responded by going half a second quicker than Ricciardo on lap 49. Vergne and Grosjean made contact at turn one with the former getting past around the inside for ninth position on lap 50. Maldonado took advantage of the manoeuvre and overtook his teammate Grosjean to claim tenth.|$|E

50|$|Oats yield {{a profit}} of £1 1s.; and in the year 1732, quoted by the author, wheat cost 10s.9d and barley 3s. 6d. on an acre. The <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses</b> are white and red clovers; sainfoin, lucerne, ryegrass, and cow-grass. The latter plant means the cow-grass, or Trifolium medium of botany. The manures are well described; bat no new {{substance}} is added to former lists, only hoofs come very near to the knowledge of bones. Of lime the author thinks that calcination sets free and enables to act a balsamic alkaline salt that is coagulated in the crude stone or chalk, and till the acid barren quality is evaporated by tire, the salts in them are of little or no signification to the land. Fire, fermentation, and putrefaction cure the dead quality and bring out the dormant powers. Lime is used in three ways—by mixing it with turf or mould, by being sown over the ground when pulverized, and over the ground with turnip seed, on a clover ley sometime previous to being ploughed. He thinks hot lime kills the small animals of the soil, and that it must benefit lands of every kind in some degree. Chalk is reckoned an excellent alternative, and corrects every kind of acidity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{westerly}} {{situation and}} the granite upland areas resulted in mainly pastoral farming in most of Cornwall. A narrow belt of land along the south coast of Cornwall east of the River Fal however supported a more mixed type of agriculture. [...] "With its mineral wealth and large fishing interests Cornwall was less absolutely dependent on its agriculture, and farming was frequently a part-time occupation and of second rank in the county." [...] (Giles V. Harrison.) In south western counties the century following 1640 saw a development of specialisation in livestock farming which included livestock-rearing in north Devon and north Cornwall. Cornwall was less affected than other counties by developments such as changes in land tenure, crop and technical innovations and increasing commercialism. The south-western counties were progressive {{in the use of}} manures and burn beating (or devonshiring) to improve the soil of moorland, waste or fallow land. The introduction of new root crops and <b>artificial</b> <b>grasses</b> which occurred elsewhere in the late 17th century did not happen in Cornwall until the 18th century. This was for various reasons, including the county's geographical isolation and the lesser importance of agriculture in the economy. The innovations in root crops are found earliest in south-east Cornwall, e.g. at St Germans and Liskeard by 1715 and 1725 respectively.|$|R
