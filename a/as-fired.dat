40|$|Purpose: The {{microbial}} {{colonization of}} new ceramic materials developed for abutment manufacturing was assessed. Materials and Methods: The {{materials used in}} these experiments were disks of "asfired" and "rectified" ceramic material made of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals stabilized with yttrium (Y-TZP) and commercially pure grade 2 titanium (Ti) with corresponding eluates. They were tested in vitro with the following bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, S sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, A naeslundii, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Proliferation was evaluated on plates by inhibitory halos around pits, previously inoculated with eluates obtained from the materials. Bacterial adhesion on materials was quantified by spectrophotometric evaluation of the slime production by the same bacteria. Moreover, early bacterial adhesion was evaluated in human volunteers and observed with SEM. Results: No inhibition of bacterial proliferation using eluates was observed. In vitro <b>as-fired</b> and rectified Y-TZP showed significantly more adherent S mutans than did Ti disks, while S sanguis seemed to adhere easily to Ti specimens. No differences were noted for Actinomyces spp and P gingivalis. In vivo Y-TZP accumulated fewer bacteria than Ti {{in terms of the}} total number of bacteria and presence of potential putative pathogens such as rods. No differences were observed between rectified and <b>as-fired</b> Y-TZP. Discussion: Overall, Y-TZP accumulates fewer bacteria than Ti.

40|$|Surface {{treatments}} of alumina {{have been investigated}} {{with the aim of}} increasing the strength of the bond created between the alumina and a toughened epoxy adhesive. Four surface conditions have been assessed: as-fired; grit blasted; and krypton fluoride excimer laser treated under two sets of conditions. Compared with the <b>as-fired</b> surface, the grit blasted surface was rougher with poorer wettability, probably due to surface contamination. It was found that the laser treatments removed some of the sintering additives and caused rounding of the alumina grains, slightly increasing the surface roughness. Further, the laser treatment led to an increased surface energy and wettability, which has been linked tentatively to an observed increase in the hydroxyl groups on the surface. The adhesive bond strength was assessed by testing joints in tension and shear. It was found that the laser treated surfaces demonstrated slight improvements in bond strength, with a cohesive failure of the adhesive in tension for surfaces subjected to one of the two laser treatments, compared with failure at the interface for the <b>as-fired,</b> grit blasted and other laser treated samples in tension and for all samples in shear. Thus, it has been demonstrated that modifications to the surface of alumina can result in mechanical and chemical changes which affect roughness, wettability, bond strength and the locus of failure...|$|E

In this study, three biomaterials {{that are used}} in spinal implants &ndash; titanium (Ti), poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK), and silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) &ndash; were tested to understand their respective susceptibility to bacterial infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphlococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus. Specifically, the surface chemistry, wettability, and nanostructured topography of respective biomaterials, and the effects on bacterial biofilm formation, colonization, and growth were investigated. Ti and PEEK were received with as-machined surfaces; both materials are hydrophobic, with net negative surface charges. Two surface finishes of Si 3 N 4 were examined: <b>as-fired</b> and polished. In contrast to Ti and PEEK, the surface of Si 3 N 4 is hydrophilic, with a net positive charge. A decreased biofilm formation was found, as well as fewer live bacteria on both the <b>as-fired</b> and polished Si 3 N 4. These differences may reflect differential surface chemistry and surface nanostructure properties between the biomaterials tested. Because protein adsorption on material surfaces affects bacterial adhesion, the adsorption of fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin on Ti, PEEK, and Si 3 N 4 were also examined. Significantly greater amounts of these proteins adhered to Si 3 N 4 than to Ti or PEEK. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} surface properties of biomaterials lead to differential adsorption of physiologic proteins, and that this phenomenon could explain the observed in-vitro differences in bacterial affinity for the respective biomaterials.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Despite the {{esthetic}} {{advantage of}} finishing and polishing, there remains concern that these procedures might reduce {{the strength of}} a finished ceramic restoration. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of surface finishing procedures on the flexural strength of four dental ceramic materials. Material and Methods: The materials used were feldspathic porcelain (Vitadur N), Dicor, IPS Empress glass ceramic, and In-Ceram aluminous core porcelain. Abiaxial flexure test was conducted on a total of 10 specimens each in 9 groups. These groups were <b>as-fired,</b> polished and glazed Vitadur N discs; as-cast and polished Dicor discs; as-cast and polished IPS Empress discs; and <b>as-fired</b> and polished In-Ceram core porcelain discs. The flexural strength was evaluated using biaxial Piston on three ball test. Results: The mean biaxial flexural strength values were 63 ± 4 MPa for as fired feldspathic porcelain specimens, 100 ± 9 MPa for polished feldspathic porcelain, and 66 ± 7 MPa for glazed porcelain, 106 ± 13 MPa for as cast Dicor specimens and 229 ± 13 MPa for their polished counterparts. 109 ± 9 MPa for IPS Empress specimens and 218 ± 13 MPa for their polished counterparts 343 ± 34 MPa for nonpolished IN-Ceram core porcelained discs and 536 ± 37 MPa for their polished counterparts. The In-Ceram core materials resulted in the highest mean flexural strength values regardless of the surface finish. Though polished In-Ceram core specimens were 56 % stronger than their as fired counterpart. The strength of glass ceramic specimens (Dicor and IPS Empress specimens) was double that of their unpolished counterparts indicating a higher sensitivity to surface finish. Conclusion: In general, within the limitation of this experiment, the results suggests that strength of a ceramic restoration may be increased by finishing and polishing. Nevertheless, clinical trials are necessary to confirm these findings. Clinical Implications: The results of this in vitro experiment suggest that surface finishing may have an effect on the strength of the ceramic specimens tested. King Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|Existing {{thick film}} hybrid {{microcircuit}} (HMC) production utilizing integral thick film resistors requires that thick film resistors be deposited via screen printing {{directly on the}} base alumina substrate material. This requirement, when coupled with circuits of moderate to high density and associated layer buildup prior to resistor application, results in printing on surfaces with significant topography surrounding the resistor, compared to required as-printed resistor thicknesses. Due to the technological requirement to print resistors after most other thick film processing has been completed, resistor printing is seldom performed on a flat surface. The surface topography of the substrate surrounding the resistor area prohibits the printing process from maintaining a relatively uniform printed resistor thickness across the substrate. Although resistors are, in most cases, adjusted to final electrical values by physically modifying the length-to-width ratio through laser trimming, the resistors must be within certain resistance ranges. This variation in thickness translates into potential scrap product through extreme variation in <b>as-fired</b> resistor electrical values and/or product incapable of being laser trimmed due to excessive resistor thickness. The development of a thick film resistor application process compatible with existing conductor and dielectric materials and enabling more planarization of the print surface was needed to enhance production yields on products of moderate complexity...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to present}} {{the current status of}} the {{coal-fired}} power sector in Russia, the prospects for renovation activities based on the fluidised bed technology and the existing experience on CFB refurbishment projects. The renovation needs of the power sector, among the retrofitting, repowering and reconstruction options, were estimated through a multi-criteria analysis. The most attractive system to renovate a power plant between the Supercritical Combustion (SC) and the Fluidized Bed Combustion (FBC) technology was evaluated. Furthermore, the boiler replacement with a CFB unit in the Shatura power plant was studied and its replication potential in the Russian coal-fired power plant park was examined. Nowadays, the installed capacity of coal-fired power plants in the Russian Federation is 29. 3 GWe, while they account for about 19 % of the total electricity generation in the area. The low efficiency and especially the advanced age are the determinant factors for renovation applications at the Russian units. Even in the more conservative modernisation scenario, over 30 % of the thermoelectric units have to be repowered or reconstructed. CFB is the most promising technology for such modernisation projects, when the renovation potential is high. The main characteristics including high volatile yield, low ash content and a large share of light fractions in the <b>as-fired</b> milled peat were taken into account during the CFB boiler calculations in the Shatura power plant. Upgrading the existing coal-fired power plant equipment with CFB technology, which is known to be environmental friendly and efficient, will open new perspectives to the operating power plants in Russia.

40|$|Resistors on {{aluminium}} nitride (AlN) are very interesting for microwave applications {{because of the}} high thermal conductivity and the excellent dielectric properties of AlN. During the firing process the conductive phase RuO 2 of the resistor film can react with AlN. This reaction depends on surface quality of the substrate as roughness and content and composition of yttrium aluminates which are formed if yttria is used as additive to AlN for sintering. The yttrium aluminates on the AlN surfaces were identified by X-ray diffraction and quantified by Rietvelt analysis. The interactions between the resistor and AlN were investigated by cross section, FESEM and EDX. Four kinds of surface states were microscopically found: tight AlN, AlN with pores, residuals of yttrium aluminate after treatment of the <b>as-fired</b> surface and yttrium aluminate crystallites embedded in AlN. Each of this state can show another interactions with the resistor film. If yttrium aluminate is on the AlN surface the reaction between RuO 2 and AlN is inhibited. On the other hand pores in the AlN increase the reaction rate. The resistance were related to the surface properties of AlN. High standard deviation of resistance was observed on some substrates. The reason for this phenomenon was investigated by different methods. The resistance correlates with the content of YAlO 3 on the substrate surface. The increased resistance can be explained by reaction between RuO 2 containing in the resistors as conductive phase and AlN. As result of this reaction Ru metal and gaseous nitrogen are formed. Four kinds of areas were microscopically identified: tight AlN, porous AlN, residuals of yttrium aluminates on the surface and crystallites of yttrium aluminate embedded in AlN. The reaction between RuO 2 and AlN on this four areas is different. A porous AlN surface accelerates and yttrium aluminates can inhibits this reaction. Therefore the surface treatment and the homogeneity of the substrate surface are very important requirements for small standard deviation of the resistance...|$|E
40|$|Lowering the {{operating}} {{temperature of the}} high-temperature, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) improves both the thermodynamic efficiency and the lifetime of this energy efficient technology. Unfortunately the rate of oxygen-ion transport through the solid electrolyte is temperature dependent, and materials previously employed as electrolytes in the high-temperature SOFC perform poorly at intermediate temperatures. Therefore new oxygen-ion conductors with enhanced ionic conductivity at intermediate temperatures are required. The bulk of the existing literature on high-temperature SOFCs has focussed on zirconia-based binary systems as electrolytes, due to their high ionic conductivity and negligible electronic conductivity. Only select compositions within the zirconia-scandia system have demonstrated acceptable ionic conductivity levels at intermediate temperatures; however unstable phase assemblage and the high economic cost of scandia are clear disadvantages. Ceria-based binary systems have demonstrated improved oxygen-ion conductivity at intermediate temperature compared to many zirconia systems, however significant levels of n-type electronic conductivity are observed at low oxygen partial pressures. Consequently it was thought unlikely that significant increases in ionic conductivity would be found in existing zirconia- and ceria-based binary systems, therefore another approach was required {{in an attempt to}} improve the performance of these established fluorite systems. The fluorite systems Zr 0. 75 Ce 0. 08 M 0. 17 O 1. 92 (M = Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Ho, Y, Er, Yb, Sc) were prepared and investigated as possible, intermediate-temperature SOFC electrolytes in an attempt to combine the higher conductivity found in the ceria systems with the low electronic conductivity observed in the zirconia systems. Also it was anticipated that systems containing dopants not previously observed to confer high ionic conductivity in either zirconia- and ceria-based binary systems, might exhibit enhanced ionic conductivity with expansion of the zirconia lattice resulting from the addition of ceria. All the <b>as-fired</b> Zr 0. 75 Ce 0. 08 M 0. 17 O 1. 92 compositions possessed the face-centred cubic structure and lattice parameter measurements revealed the anticipated unit cell enlargement as the size of the dopant cation increased. No unusual microstructural parameters were identified that could be expected to interfere with the ionic transport properties in the <b>as-fired</b> compositions. The electrical conductivity was found to be influenced by the dopant-ion radius, the presence of ceria, low oxygen partial pressures and, in some compositions, the formation of poorly conducting, ordered-pyrochlore microdomains dispersed amongst the cubic defect-fluorite matrix. In a second approach to the formulation of new oxygen-ion conductors suitable for the intermediate-temperature SOFC, compounds possessing structures other than the fluorite structure were considered. An examination of the literature for oxides having the pyrochlore, scheelite and perovskite structures showed that the Sr+ 2 - and Mg+ 2 -doped LaGaO 3 perovskites (LSGM) possessed ionic conductivity equal to the highest conducting, zirconia and ceria binary compounds. Therefore the perovskite systems La 0. 9 Sr 0. 1 Ga(0. 8 -x) InxMg 0. 2 O 2. 85 (X = 0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8) (I-LSGM) were prepared and examined, the objective being to favourably influence structural parameters believed responsible for optimal ionic conductivity, namely the unit cell symmetry and volume. It was found that In+ 3 systematically substituted for Ga+ 3 on to the B-site of LSGM at least up to the X = 0. 4 composition. While In+ 3 was found to replace the Ga+ 3 as expected, Mg+ 2, which occupies the same crystallographic site, was also replaced by In+ 3. Up to the X = 0. 2 composition, at least two trace level secondary phases were observed to form along with the bulk I-LSGM phase. For I-LSGM compositions with X > 0. 2, significantly larger concentrations of the secondary phases were identified. Evidence of a strontium-rich, high-temperature liquid phase was observed also near the grain boundaries on as-sintered and thermally etched surfaces in LSGM and I-LSGM compositions. It is believed that the observed, high sintered density in the complex, doped-LaGaO 3 systems is due to the formation of this high-temperature liquid phase. Increasing levels of diffuse scatter and superstructure formation were observed in electron diffraction patterns in the I-LSGM bulk phase (up to X = 0. 2), indicating a possible decrease in vacancy concentration and reduced, localised unit cell symmetry. The electrical conductivity in the I-LSGM compositions was believed to be influenced by the distortion of the oxygen-ion conduction path, a reduction in vacancy concentration, formation of stronger dopant-vacancy associates at low temperature and the presence of ordered structures. In addition, phase instability, in the form of subtle ordering in specific crystalline planes, was observed to influence the electrical conductivity as a function of time at intermediate temperatures...|$|E

The team uniquely combines mineral processing, chemical engineering, and geochemical expertise. This project meets more than 11 goals of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Energy Strategy, and the 1993 Climate Change Action Plan. During this project: (1) Equations were developed to predict the concentration of trace elements in as-mined and cleaned coals. These equations, which address both conventional and advanced cleaning processes, {{can be used to}} increase the removal of hazardous air pollutant precursors (HAPs) by existing cleaning plants and to improve the design of new cleaning plants. (2) A promising chemical method of removing mercury and other HAPs was developed. At bench-scale, mercury reductions of over 50 percent were achieved on coal that had already been cleaned by froth flotation. The processing cost of this technology is projected to be less than $ 3. 00 per ton ($ 3. 30 per tonne). (3) Projections were made of the average trace element concentration in cleaning plant solid waste streams from individual states. Average concentrations were found to be highly variable. (4) A significantly improved understanding of how trace elements occur in coal was gained, primarily through work at the USGS during the first systematic development of semiquantitative data for mode of occurrence. In addition, significant improvement was made in the laboratory protocol for mode of occurrence determination. (5) Team members developed a high-quality trace element washability database. For example, the poorest mass balance closure for the uncrushed size and washability data for mercury on all four coals is 8. 44 percent and the best is 0. 46 percent. This indicates an extremely high level of reproducibility of the data. In addition, a series of ''round-robin'' tests involving various laboratories was performed to assure analytical accuracy. (6) A comparison of the cost of lowering mercury emissions through the use of coal cleaning technologies versus the use of post-combustion control methods such as activated carbon injection indicates that, in many cases, coal cleaning may prove to be the lower-cost option. The most significant disadvantage for using coal cleaning for control of mercury emissions is that a reduction of 90 percent or greater from <b>as-fired</b> coal has not yet been demonstrated, even at laboratory-scale...|$|E
