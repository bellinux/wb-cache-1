Tactical teams carry rifles, depending on the operation, the most common being the Heckler & Koch HK416 assault rifle and Heckler & Koch MP7 submachine gun. Tasers are also carried as standard by tactical teams. In addition to firearms, ERU operators carry routine police equipment such as a knife, ASP baton, pepper spray, flashlight and handcuffs. First aid kits, firefighting equipment and respirators are commonly carried. Protective clothing for tactical teams includes ballistic armour for the head, neck, torso and limbs (including bulletproof vest, combat helmet and ballistic eyewear), fire-retardant fabric and combat boots.|$|E

30|$|In HRd (like BRCA 1 & 2 mutated) cells, by {{inhibiting}} PARP, we {{can create}} a “synthetic lethality” state: single-strand DNA damage cannot be repaired by BER and the cell is forced to use an inefficient mechanism to repair double-strand breaks, like NHEJ. This results in a large DNA loss. Without it, the cell losses critical genes for surviving and finally the cell dies (Audeh et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2013; Cancer Genome <b>Atlas</b> Research <b>Network</b> 2011; Liu et al. 2014 b; Fong et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ovarian {{cancer is}} the most deadly {{gynecological}} cancer because of late diagnosis, frequently with diffuse peritoneal metastases. Recent findings have shown that serous epithelial ovarian cancer has a narrow mutational spectrum with TP 53 being the most frequently targeted when single genes are considered. It is, however, important to understand which pathways as a whole may be targeted for mutation. Findings Previously published mutational data provided by the cancer genome <b>atlas</b> <b>networks</b> findings on ovarian cancer was searched for statistically significant enrichment of genes in pathways. These pathways were then searched in all patients to identify the spectrum of mutations. Statistical significance was further shown through in-silico permutations of exome sequences using empirically observed mutation rates. We detected mutations in the cell adhesion pathway genes in more than 89 % of serous epithelial ovarian cancer patients. This level of near universal mutational targeting of the cell adhesion pathway, including the extracellular matrix pathway, is previously unreported in epithelial ovarian cancer. Conclusions Taken together with previous studies {{on the role of}} cell adhesion and extracellular matrix gene expression in ovarian cancer and metastasis, our results identify pathways for which the mutational prevalence has previously been overlooked using single gene approaches. Analysis of mutations at the pathway level will be critical in studying heterogeneous diseases such as ovarian cancer. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Cancer Genome <b>Atlas</b> (TCGA) <b>Network</b> {{recently}} comprehensively catalogued {{the molecular}} aberrations in 487 high-grade serous ovarian cancers, with much remaining to be elucidated regarding the microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, using TCGA ovarian data, we surveyed the miRNAs, {{in the context}} of their predicted gene targets. Methods and Results: Integration of miRNA and gene patterns yielded evidence that proximal pairs of miRNAs are processed from polycistronic primary transcripts, and that intronic miRNAs and their host gene mRNAs derive from common transcripts. Patterns of miRNA expression revealed multiple tumor subtypes and a set of 34 miRNAs predictive of overal...|$|R
40|$|The Cancer Genome <b>Atlas</b> (TCGA) Research <b>Network</b> is {{an ambitious}} multi-institutional {{consortium}} effort aimed at characterizing sequence, copy number, gene (mRNA) expression, microRNA expression, and DNA methyla-tion alterations in 30 cancer types.

DNA methylation changes are integral to all aspects of cancer genomics and have been shown to have important associations with gene expression, sequence, and copy number changes.

40|$|The <b>ATLAS</b> TDAQ <b>Network</b> {{consists}} of three separate networks spanning four levels of the experimental building. Over 200 edge switches and 5 multi-blade chassis routers are used to interconnect 2000 processors, adding {{up to more than}} 7000 high speed interfaces. In order to substantially speed-up ad-hoc and post mortem analysis, a scalable, yet flexible, integrated system for monitoring both network statistics and environmental conditions, processor parameters and data taking characteristics was required. For successful up-to-the-minute monitoring, information from many SNMP compliant devices, independent databases and custom APIs was gathered, stored and displayed in an optimal way. Easy navigation and compact aggregation of multiple data sources were the main requirements; characteristics not found in any of the tested products, either open-source or commercial. This paper describes how performance, scalability and display issues were addressed and what challenges the project faced during development and deployment. A full set of modules, including a fast polling SNMP engine, user interfaces using latest web technologies and caching mechanisms, has been designed and developed from scratch. Over the last year the system proved to be stable and reliable, replacing the previous performance monitoring system and extending its capabilities. Currently it is operated using a precision interval of 25 seconds (the industry standard is 30 0 seconds). Although it was developed in order to address the needs for integrated performance monitoring of the <b>ATLAS</b> TDAQ <b>network,</b> the package can be used for monitoring any network with rigid demands of precision and scalability, exceeding normal industry standards...|$|R
