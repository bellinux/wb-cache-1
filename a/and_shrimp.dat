5|$|Madagascar's natural {{resources}} include {{a variety of}} unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources. Agriculture (including raffia), fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang. Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees <b>and</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Major {{tracts of}} the Allen Ranch were {{liquidated}} opening up new development around Pasadena and other bayside communities. Commercial fishing for oysters <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> grew {{as a significant}} area industry. The lumber industry also continued to grow. A sugar refinery opened in Texas city, a paper mill in Pasadena, and other factories in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely {{populated}} Bay Area transformed during the 20th century. Following the hurricane, donations by {{the newly established}} Red Cross helped revive area farming communities.

5|$|Although it is {{a federally}} {{designated}} park, fishing within Biscayne {{is governed by}} the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, spiny lobster, stone crab, blue crab <b>and</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary, administered {{by the state of}} Florida to protect spiny lobster breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay.|$|E
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill <b>and</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E

5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> nets.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> in the creek. The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing. The only remaining fish species in the creek is carp, which can withstand high amounts of chlorine. Carp up to 18inches (1.5feet / 45cm) long have been found in Aliso Creek near the mouth. Temperatures of the creek near the mouth have been known to exceed , although the temperature at the outflow is often much colder because it has been mixed with seawater.|$|E
5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation.|$|E
40|$|This {{seems to}} be the first record of {{cleaning}} symbiosis between marine turtles <b>and</b> <b>shrimps.</b> During their foraging on the reef flat, the turtles regularly visited and posed at the stations. The same stations were visited by a few species of reef fishes, which posed and were cleaned by the shrimps. We suggest that cleaning symbiosis between turtles <b>and</b> <b>shrimps</b> is widespread <b>and</b> went unrecognised due to the superficial resemblance between a resting turtle and a posing and cleaned one. Additionally, we submit a putative origin for the cleaning symbiosis between marine turtles <b>and</b> cleaner <b>shrimps</b> following a few simple behavioural steps...|$|R

5|$|Though little {{specific}} data are available, the Japanese sleeper ray {{is believed to}} be caught incidentally in shrimp trawls and other demersal fishing gear throughout its range. It is not utilized economically; however, electric rays tend not to survive being caught and discarded, <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> trawling is known to have caused marked population declines in other electric ray species elsewhere. Given the high intensity of fishing activity off East Asia, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Within the Malacostraca, no fossils {{are known}} for krill, while both Hoplocarida and Phyllopoda contain {{important}} groups that are now extinct as well as extant members (Hoplocarida: mantis shrimp are extant, while Aeschronectida are extinct; Phyllopoda: Canadaspidida are extinct, while Leptostraca are extant). Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous, as are the first true mantis shrimp. In the Decapoda, prawns and polychelids appear in the Triassic, <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> and crabs appear in the Jurassic; however, the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous, particularly in crabs, {{and may have been}} driven by the adaptive radiation of their main predators, bony fish. The first true lobsters also appear in the Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} can {{be readily}} approached underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback guitarfish population is small and fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> trawlers, and the urgent need for additional information to ensure its long-term regional survival.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, <b>and</b> <b>Shrimp</b> Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{species are}} mostly {{external}} parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood. The larvae of the Gnathiidae family and adult cymothoidids have {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts. In general, isopod parasites have diverse lifestyles and include Cancricepon elegans, found in the gill chambers of crabs; Athelges tenuicaudis, attached to the abdomen of hermit crabs; Crinoniscus equitans living inside the barnacle Balanus perforatus; cyproniscids, living inside ostracods and free-living isopods; bopyrids, living in the gill chambers or on the carapace of shrimps and crabs and causing a characteristic bulge which is even recognisable in some fossil crustaceans; and entoniscidae living inside some species of crab <b>and</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Cymothoa exigua is a parasite of the spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus in the Gulf of California; it causes the tongue of the fish to atrophy and takes its place in what {{is believed to be}} the first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals.|$|E

5|$|The 20th century saw industrialization, {{through the}} {{construction}} of a shipping port, and a fish processing factory of Royal Greenland in 1924, the first such factory in Greenland. Fishing remains the primary occupation of Sisimiut inhabitants, with the town becoming the leading center of shrimping <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> processing. Until 2008 Sisimiut had been the administrative center of Sisimiut Municipality, which was then incorporated into the new Qeqqata Municipality on 1 January 2009, with Sisimiut retaining its status as the administrative center of the new unit, consisting also of the former Maniitsoq Municipality and the previously unincorporated area of Kangerlussuaq. The municipal council, seated in the town hall and headed by Mayor Hermann Berthelsen, consists of 13 members, including the mayor and his deputies, and representatives of the four primary political parties of Greenland: Siumut, Atassut, Democrats and Inuit Ataqatigiit.|$|E
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E
5|$|The smooth toadfish {{has strong}} jaws that readily crush {{shellfish}} and crustaceans. It feeds predominantly on benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms in the substrate {{of the bodies}} of water in which it forages. Its diet includes molluscs such as black mussels, pipis, white sunset shells (Soletellina alba) and oysters (Crassostrea), crustaceans such as semaphore crabs <b>and</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and brown algae. The proportions of crustaceans to molluscs can vary widely depending on the abundance of food items; hence in a 1999 field study, the soldier crab (Mictyris longicarpus) predominated in Cowan Creek while the black mussel did so in nearby Berowra Creek. Field experiments showed it was a consumer of oysters and the gastropod Bembicium auratum, and had {{a major impact on}} their numbers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of non-decapod {{crustaceans}} are also {{commonly referred to as}} shrimp.

Many of these species look quite unlike like the commercial decapod shrimp that are eaten as seafood. For example, skeleton shrimp have short legs and a slender tail like a scorpion tail, fairy shrimp swim upside down with swimming appendages that look like leaves, and the tiny seed shrimp have bivalved carapaces which they can open or close. Krill resemble miniature <b>shrimp,</b> <b>and</b> are sometimes called [...] "krill shrimp".|$|R
