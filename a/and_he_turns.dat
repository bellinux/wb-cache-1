During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, {{and is about to}} fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.|$|E
5|$|In a bid {{to impress}} Martin and his colleagues, Rhys {{purchases}} a barbecue and invites them over for dinner. He is granted {{an interview with the}} surgical board to join their training program at the hospital. Following a night out with Dane Canning (Luke Pegler), Rhys gets a hangover and is horrified to learn his interview has been moved to an earlier time. Rhys struggles to answer the panel's questions and he is not invited to join the program. He later visits his mother, Elaine, at her hospice, where he tells her he has joined the program. Rhys treats Chris Pappas (James Mason) after he is attacked, but fails to get him to stay for his X-rays. Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) spots that Chris has a broken rib, which is pressing on his lung and Rhys finds him collapsed on the floor of Fitzgerald Motors. Rhys performs an emergency decompression on his lung and saves his life. Rhys asks senior surgeon Jessica Girdwood (Glenda Linscott) to reconsider letting him join the surgical program, but she declines. Rhys tries unsuccessfully to get Robbie O'Brien to quit the program <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> his attentions to Erin Salisbury. He pretends to be romantically interested in her and tries to distract her from her studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> aside, <b>and</b> sat down.|$|R
60|$|He never answered--oh me! <b>he</b> never answered, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> {{away his}} face.|$|R

25|$|In the Seongju Puli, {{the evil}} magician Sojinhang {{attempts}} {{to claim the}} earth goddess. However, Sojinhang is defeated, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> into a Jangseung, or totem pole. His daughters turn into the Seonangshin.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} return home, {{where they}} meet Arthur Spiderwick, {{who had been}} living with the elves and so had not aged. He and his daughter Lucinda, now an old woman, share a poignant goodbye, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to dust. With Mulgarath defeated, the Grace family is presumably now free to live happily ever after.|$|E
25|$|This {{information}} {{brings a}} lot of emotional turmoil for Hikari even more when she goes to Mao Natsukawa for support <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> his back on her, tired of always coming to sloppy seconds to Ooishi. Natsukawa is frustrated with her, since Hikari is always focusing herself on Ooishi even though she always knew deep inside that Ooishi (while he was developing feelings for her at first) always thought {{of her as a}} friend or a little sister.|$|E
60|$|And {{then another}} doubt assailed him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> {{back into the}} shop.|$|R
60|$|A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>and</b> {{looked at}} Dorian.|$|R

25|$|Charlie Prince is {{an outlaw}} highwayman and the {{right-hand}} {{man of the}} outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford in 1957 and Russell Crowe in 2007) and his gang. Unlike other characters, Prince appears in both films. Prince is portrayed as a cold-blooded killer who attacks people for merely insulting him. Throughout the film he employs intelligence and wit to overcome his enemies; for example, he makes a deal with Contention's sheriffs with promises to spare them only to kill them after all, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> the whole city of Contention against its lawmen by promoting a reward of $200 for everyone who can kill even a single of Wade's captors. After Evans gets Wade on the train to Yuma, Charlie pursues on foot, but is {{shot and killed by}} Evans; the rest of the gang quickly gives up the chase.|$|E
25|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place in}} the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems {{determined}} to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and The Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> back, with a determined and violent look in his eyes, and produces a Priest and Chorus Girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, The Persian {{and the rest of the}} group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, The Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain").Christine remarks that The Phantom was always the angel of music ("He Will Not Go Without A Friend").|$|E
500|$|The first {{third of}} the novel {{provides}} a lengthy exploration of the characters' histories. Balzac makes this clear after 150 pages: [...] "Ici se termine, en quelque sorte, l'introduction de cette histoire." [...] ("Here ends what is, in a way, the introduction to this story.") At {{the start of the}} novel, Adeline Hulot– wife of the successful Baron Hector Hulot– is being pressured into an affair by a wealthy perfumer named Célestin Crevel. His desire stems in part from an earlier contest in which the adulterous Baron Hulot had won the hand of the singer Josépha Mirah, also favored by Crevel. The Hulots' daughter, Hortense, has begun searching for a husband; their son Victorin is married to Crevel's daughter Celestine. Mme. Hulot resists Crevel's advances, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> his attention elsewhere.|$|E

60|$|The hunter's countenance flushed deeply, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> {{with a look}} of {{severity}} {{towards his}} companion.|$|R

500|$|Needing {{money to}} pay for a repair after Bart damages the gas line, the Simpson family visits [...] "Cockamamie's", an offbeat {{collectibles}} shop, hoping that it will purchase one of the family's heirlooms (an [...] "authentic" [...] American Civil War doll which {{turns out to be a}} decorative liquor bottle). Homer meets John, the antiques dealer, who explains that much of the merchandise is there because of its camp value. Bart and Lisa take an instant liking to John, and Homer invites him to the Simpsons' house to see the campy items that the family owns. The next morning, Homer tells Marge that he likes John and suggests they invite him and [...] "his wife" [...] over for a drink some time. Marge tries to hint repeatedly to an oblivious Homer that John is gay, and when she eventually can't, she tells him face to face and Homer is horrified. Homer's attitude towards John changes completely, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> against him, refusing to join his tour of Springfield. The rest of the family joins John and has a good time, but Homer is upset with the family upon their return. The rest of the Simpson family continue to enjoy John's company, especially Bart, who starts wearing Hawaiian shirts and dancing in a woman's wig. This makes Homer uneasy, and he begins to fear Bart is gay.|$|E
2500|$|Diedrich Bader as Bill Ericsson: a {{high-profile}} campaign official, formerly the {{campaign manager for}} Joe Thornhill. He later abandons Thornhill, and Selina appoints him her new Director of Communications. When a scandal breaks that the Meyer campaign used stolen confidential medical data to send flyers appealing to bereaved parents of deceased children, the core characters band together to scapegoat him in their place, resulting in his imprisonment. His sentence is later overturned on appeal <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> against Selina, claiming he is [...] "consumed" [...] by desire to destroy her. (Season 3–present) ...|$|E
2500|$|Meier founded MicroProse with Stealey in 1982, and by 1986 {{the company}} was using his name and face in {{advertisements}} for its games. MicroProse at first developed mostly simulation video games, such as Silent Service and F-19 Stealth Fighter. In 1987, the company released Sid Meier's Pirates!, which also began a trend of placing Meier's name in the titles of his games. He later explained that the inclusion of his name {{was because of the}} dramatic departure in the design of Pirates! compared to the company's earlier titles. Stealey decided that it would improve the company's branding, believing that it would make those who purchased the flight simulators more likely to play the game. Stealey recalled: [...] "We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to me and says 'Bill, you should put Sid's name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.' And that's how Sid's name got on Pirates, and Civilization." ...|$|E
50|$|Failing health {{forced him}} to retire in 1920, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his {{practice}} over to his son.|$|R

2500|$|When Kiefer Sutherland {{took the}} project, {{he did not}} {{understand}} that the series was set in real-time, having skipped the line that said, [...] "All events take place in real time." [...] Kiefer said it was, in fact, the interaction between the characters that prompted him to take the pilot. Sutherland was sent the script by director Stephen Hopkins, with whom he had a previous relationship. Sutherland was attracted to the shades of grey in the Jack Bauer character, as well as his status as a [...] "normal guy", citing Jack's inability to handle his own teenage daughter. The Tony Almeida character was originally called [...] "Geller" [...] in the original Pilot script, who Bernard called a [...] "backbiting Jewish techie guy". Bernard didn't understand why they had sent him the script, given his Hispanic ethnicity. Carlos and the crew came up with the Tony Almeida name fifteen minutes before shooting, but the legal department wouldn't let them use it. Legal told the crew that they could use the name 'Tonio', which Carlos found underwhelming. Bernard said, [...] "So we were filming the very first scene, Kiefer walking down CTU, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to me and says, 'Sorry man, I can't call you Tonio, I'm just gonna call you Tony.' I owe Kiefer everything: Tonio's the name of a guy who gets killed in the first episode." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marlowe {{returns to}} his office, where he finds a note from Kingsley's {{secretary}} giving him the names and address of Almore's wife's parents. Marlowe visits them and learns {{the name and address}} of the detective they hired to investigate their daughter's death and that Dr. Almore's nurse was named Mildred Haviland. They also tell him that Almore is a [...] "dope" [...] doctor and that they believe he killed their daughter by drugging her and then putting her in the garage with the motor running on her car. The detective they hired was charged with drunk driving, spent 6 months in jail and is now not in contact with them. Marlowe visits the detective, who is not at his modest home, and is rebuffed by the detective's wife, who says that [...] "they" [...] have been there. Marlowe notices someone looking at his car and upon leaving realises he is being followed. He is confronted by the police again, who force him to drink liquor, beat him up and arrest him for speeding, resisting arrest and drunk driving, charges similar to those levelled against the parents' detective. Marlowe talks to a police captain, Webber, who treats him decently for a Bay City policeman, and although Webber isn't convinced by Marlowe's theories on the case, he is convinced that Marlowe is mostly telling him the truth, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> him loose.|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (recoiling). Who {{told you}} that? (She {{shakes her head}} mysteriously, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> away from her moodily and adds) You had much better not have asked.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> about <b>and</b> {{led the way}} in the {{direction}} that had been indicated for us.|$|R
60|$|My foot struck {{something}} yielding--it was a sleeper's leg; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> groaned, {{but without}} awaking.|$|R
60|$|I think I said I {{was glad}} to be of any service to him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> away.|$|R
60|$|CRAVEN. Why, I didn't know {{it until}} to-night. It's a most {{extraordinary}} thing. We met by {{chance at the}} theatre; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> out to be my oldest friend.|$|E
6000|$|His flesh quivers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> with a start, as if fancying that [...] {{some one}} {{may be about to}} stab him in the back. Then he rises, [...] mounts, and rides on.|$|E
60|$|Oh, much. He'll be {{all right}} in a minute. [LADY KELSEY goes to the window, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> to MRS. CROWLEY.] You are a brick to come here to-day, when they're all in such awful trouble.|$|E
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} there came a crash of steel from the left, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his head.|$|R
60|$|Then Cauchon winced, {{and looked}} less placidly content than before, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> him about <b>and</b> went away.|$|R
