40|$|Understanding {{that the}} {{environment}} {{is more than the}} resource base of human economic activities was a watershed in the awareness of the real value of the environment and the need for an assessment of its quality. The complex of benefits from ecosystems that people obtain in the literature became referred as ecosystem services. Ecosystem services are seen as an intermediate link between the processes and phenomena in the environment and human well-being. The main groups of the ecosystem services are providing services (products which obtained from ecosystems), regulating services (benefits which obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes), cultural services (intangible benefits that people obtain from ecosystems) and supporting services (necessary for the production of all other types of services). As practice shows ecosystem services are generally recognized, but at the same time, are undervalued by mankind. The ecosystems of the planet are stressed by human economic activities. Population growth, rising living standards entail that ecosystems do not have time to replicate itself. Inability of ecosystems to remediate in deadlines undermines their basic functions for reproduction of natural resource potential and regulation of processes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The exertion in ecosystems increases but their abilities due to degradation reduce. To evaluate the potential of the territory from the perspective of ensuring maximum flow of ecosystem services is possible only considering areas that are not affected by human activities. In densely populated areas such possibility can provide the Protected <b>Areas</b> (PAs). Valuation <b>of</b> ecosystem services of PAs can be {{a solution to the problem}} of sustainable economic development at both the regional and global levels. For any ecosystem service a set of methods is developed. The main approaches use direct and indirect market value, as well as the principle of 'willingness to pay' (or 'willingness to accept compensation'). The paper uses the concept of total economic value, which synthesizes all approaches mentioned above. Key <b>area</b> <b>of</b> research is the territory of Pasvik Nature Reserve, located in the northwest of the Kola Peninsula. On the basis of the concept of total economic value the most valuable components and landscape features are determined; the latent possibilities of economic development district are revealed (GRP growth, an increase in employment income, an increase in tax liabilities). In spatial planning (or choice one of several alternative types of economic activity) the value equivalent <b>of</b> <b>unspoiled</b> <b>nature</b> should be taken into consideration...|$|R

Experiences and recreation in the Norwegian nature are the most important reasons why foreign tourists travel to Norway.

While parts of the region are densely populated including both Copenhagen and Malmö, other parts are very rural. Here large <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>unspoiled</b> landscapes exist including seaside, woodland and agricultural areas, which are often very little exploited for tourism. The objective of the project is to promote and initiate tourism regarding experiencing nature and cultural heritage in the region. Partners in the project are private tourist entrepreneurs, municipalities, the regional council and universities. The {{focus has been on}} guided tours on different topics as wildlife, "wild food", geology and gardens with the aim to increase visitors' understanding in these fields. Thus the project aims to contribute to sustainable tourism by emphasizing the attractiveness of the region by promoting tourism which does not involve long distance travelling, emphasizing the use of public transport {{and at the same time}} increasing the public's knowledge and awareness about nature, wildlife and cultural heritage. In particular it is attempted to better learn to know and understand the "other side", which means the other side of the Sound, the strait which separates Denmark form Sweden. So far two approaches have been chosen. Firstly new guided tours carried out by private entrepreneurs have been initiated and secondly already existing products have been highlighted. Network meetings have been arranged to strengthen entrepreneurs and the cooperation of different tourist operators has been encouraged (e. g. combination of guided tours with consumption of local food production and overnight stays).

40|$|There is {{no human}} right {{that has been}} as {{controversial}} as religious liberty. While it is but {{a consequence of the}} existing pluralism in society which today is recognised by the most advanced States and communities of States as forming the practical and theoretical basis for all political institutions, Islamic countries still reject what they consider simply a Judeo-Christian tradition; and the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam of 1990 subjects all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration to the Islamic Sharia. The essential flaw of this position consists in that it regards religious liberty not a liberty of man but a liberty of truth. And since Islam is considered to be the religion <b>of</b> true <b>unspoiled</b> <b>nature</b> it is concluded that there cannot exist any human right that is not supported by, or even runs counter to, Islamic doctrine. Until this approach is overcome, there will not be true religious liberty in Islamic countries. That it is possible, for a religious community that claims to be the keeper of religious truth, to overcome such an approach has been demonstrated in an exemplary manner by the Catholic Church. Papal teaching and ecclesiastical doctrine before the Second Vatican Council maintained a position not unsimilar to that of the Cairo Declaration, arguing that error cannot claim the same right as truth. It was only the Council’s Declaration on Religious Liberty Dignitatis humanae of 1965 that brought about a radical change by recognising that religious liberty is a liberty of man deriving from his dignity as a free person and – as all human rights – not subject to any other restrictions than those which are necessary to protect the same rights and liberties of others.
