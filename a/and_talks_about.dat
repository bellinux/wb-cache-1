[...] "Stay" [...] and [...] "Don't You Know" [...] were combined into one song, [...] "Stay", which was included on the Like a Virgin album. The songs use triple-rhythms and double-tracked vocals and includes a noise resembling someone slapping a microphone and a spoken sequence which fades away in the end. The 1981 versions of [...] "Everybody", [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Ain't No Big Deal" [...] are the pure demo versions of officially released songs whose titles are tagged with {{the year in which}} they were recorded to differentiate them from the officially-released versions.|$|E

The experience triggered {{the writing of the}} song which she later brought to her producer, Dr. Luke, who was then contacted by Diddy in hopes of a collaboration; he came to the studio the same day and recorded his lines and the song was completed. According to Kesha, the song's lyrics are representative of her and based on her life; the song has a carefree message <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> not letting anything bring you down.|$|E

A paralysed Tony comes backstage to visit him <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> how far Jim's career has come. Jim broke up with Laura and has not seen her since his run in Macbeth. After Tony leaves, Kirstie arrives to see Jim. She is now Tony's full-time carer. She has watched Jim's performance {{every day of the}} week, and says she knew that he just needed [...] "a little push" [...] to achieve greatness. She tells him that Laura committed suicide by slitting her wrists in the dressing room's shower. Jim did not know about this, because he was overseas filming a role in Game of Thrones at the time. He believes that Laura pushed Tony off the battlements and could not live with her guilt. Kirstie reveals that she herself is the one who pushed Tony, and spiked his juice with alcohol backstage. She also got Felicity sacked because Felicity would not let Jim perform as Macbeth. Kirstie is wearing the engagement ring that she took from Laura's corpse. She tells Jim that she is waiting for him [...] "in the wings ... like an understudy". She leaves, and as Jim prepares to go onstage, he sees bloody visions of Laura's death.|$|E
500|$|Moreno González {{required}} his men {{to carry}} a [...] "spiritual manual" [...] that he wrote himself, [...] " [...] pseudo-Christian aphorisms for self-improvement." [...] In his [...] "bible," [...] Moreno González prohibited his men from consuming alcoholic beverages or other drugs, and stated that he would severely punish those who mistreated women. His writings encouraged the corporal punishment of thieves by beating them and making them walk naked with billboards in the city streets. He prohibited members of his cartel from consuming or selling methamphetamines in Michoacán, arguing that the drug was only to be smuggled into the U.S. for American consumers. Moreno González justified drug trafficking by stating that La Familia Michoacana allegedly regulated the drug trade to prevent exploitation of the people. The book, sometimes known as [...] "The Sayings of the Craziest One", also talks about humility, service, wisdom, brotherhood, courage, and God. His second book, titled [...] "They Call Me The Craziest One", is 13 chapters long <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> his life, idealism, the origins of La Familia Michoacana, their battle against Los Zetas, and his rationale behind joining organized crime. The text reads like a diary and justifies his criminal activities under the rationale that just like others in Michoacán, the limited opportunities and his poor financial situation pushed him {{to get involved in}} the drug trade. In addition to that, Moreno González blamed the government for the existence of criminals.|$|E
