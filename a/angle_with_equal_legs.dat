H 577 M BRE 2016 Xiongiv, 94 pages :color illustrationsHigh {{strength}} steels (HSS) {{have been}} attracting increasing {{attention in the}} design and construction industry because of their high ultimate strength and reduced cost of production. With the increased ultimate strength, smaller HSS structural sections can be designed and used in structural systems. This scenario translates to weight reduction and cost saving. However, HSS possess lower ductility than normal steels (NS), thereby possibly affecting the structural behaviour of members and connections. In particular, the reduced ductility of steel materials may have a significant influence on the tensile strength and behaviour of angle sections, which are usually governed by the shear lag effect. The current design equations used to evaluate the tensile capacity of angle sections considering the shear lag effect are based on studies using NS materials, and the existing literature on HSS tension member strength and behaviour is scarce. Therefore, a study including both experimental and numerical works was conducted to examine the tensile strength and the behaviour of HSS angle sections. A total of 18 full-scale bolted and welded single angles were tested, including 14 HSS angle specimens and 4 NS angle specimens. The test parameters included steel grade, connection length and out-of-plane eccentricity. Finite element models were established and validated using test results, and a numerical parametric study was subsequently conducted for further investigation. According to the experimental and numerical results, the low ductility of HSS has a negligible effect on the tensile capacity of <b>angles</b> <b>with</b> long leg connections, whereas the tensile capacity of <b>angles</b> <b>with</b> short leg connections is reduced because of the low ductility of HSS. The test tensile capacities of the HSS welded single angles and HSS bolted single <b>angles</b> <b>with</b> long leg connections can be accurately predicted using the 1 x/L rule to consider the shear lag effect. On the contrary, the predictions for HSS bolted single <b>angles</b> <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> and short <b>leg</b> connections are un-conservative. A reduction factor is proposed {{on the basis of the}} results of the tests and numerical study to consider the effect of steel grade by modifying the 1 x/L rule. The modified equation provides a more accurate prediction of the test results. Department of Building and Real EstateM.

We performed a prospective study on 94 patients who were evaluated preoperatively and one year after surgery for clinical leg length differences, which were then compared with radiological measurements. The effect of leg length differences on walking ability, limp, pain and patient satisfaction was studied. The mean clinical leg length difference after operation was 0. 05 cm (- 1. 5 to 1. 5, SD 0. 5). Clinical and radiological measurements correlated poorly (? = 0. 36 pre- and ? = 0. 186 postoperatively). Patients with a shorter operated leg on clinical assessment were more prone to limping (p> 0. 05), and patients with a longer leg had more pain compared to patients <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> <b>leg</b> lengths (p> 0. 05). Walking ability, Harris Hip Score and patient satisfaction were only marginally affected by leg length differences. Virtually <b>equal</b> <b>leg</b> length was achieved for most patients but small differences had a negative influence in relation to limping and pain.

The procedures for determining the buckling load for elements with a compact and slender crosssection according the European Eurocodes and American AISC standards are presented.

Influence of residual stresses and geometrical imperfections resulting from the method of manufacture of steel elements, is incorporated in buckling curves. Numerical analysis of buckling behaviour were calculated in numerical environment Abaqus. In numerical simulations material and geometric imperfections were combined in an equivalent geometric imperfection with the corresponding amplitude, so that the results of numerical simulations for centrically loaded elements with a compact cross-section coincide with the corresponding buckling curve in Eurocode standard. Adequacy of the numerical model eccentrically loaded elements was validated by comparing the results of the buckling load by the results of other researchers. The results of numerical simulations centrically and eccentrically loaded elements are further compared with the results calculated according the standards. Proposals for less complicated and more accurate calculations are given for standards...|$|R

Pentacam and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) were able to measure the anterior chamber angle quantitatively and objectively; however, UBM examination is invasive, where as Pentacam is without contact with eye globe surface. The aim of this study was to seek the conformation between Pentacam and UBM in measuring the anterior chamber angle. The study was analytic descriptive study with the agreement of both measurements in 42 eyes of 31 patients with glaucoma and non-glaucoma Cicendo Eye Hospital Bandung, in period of November to December 2010. The examination used both instruments in nasal and temporal area of anterior chamber <b>angle</b> <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> illumination. The agreement test using Bland and Altman and hypothesis using paired t-test. Statistically, there were no significant differences in anterior chamber open angle of nasal and temporal area between using Pentacam (37. 51; 40. 49; p= 0. 55) and UBM (38. 87; 40. 76; p= 0. 22), while the limit of agreement indicated wide range in nasal area (11. 94 to - 18. 14) and in temporal area (11. 51 to - 15. 31) in 95 % confidence interval. In closed angle of anterior chamber, there was a significant difference at nasal and temporal area between using Pentacam (27. 33; 35. 65; p< 0. 001) and using UBM (31. 47; 37. 34; p< 0. 001), while the limit of agreement showed (4. 01 to - 16. 65) for nasal area (2. 98 to - 14. 73) for temporal area in 95 % confidence interval.

Furthermore, lipped <b>angle</b> sections <b>with</b> unequal flange widths form a non-symmetric section and the behaviour of the section is even more complicated than a singly-symmetric <b>angle</b> section <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> flange widths. A test program on cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns is presented. The non-symmetric angle sections were brake-pressed from high strength structural steel sheets having nominal yield stresses of 450 and 550 MPa with plate thicknesses of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 1. 9  mm. The material properties of the column specimens were obtained by tensile coupon tests. The behaviour and strengths of cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns were investigated. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification {{for the design of}} cold-formed steel structural members. In addition, the current design rules in the North American Specification for cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns are assessed using reliability analysis. It is shown that the design strengths are generally quite conservative. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Electron-impact {{ionization}} of helium {{has been}} studied in the energy range from 3 – 10 eV above the ionization threshold by measuring. e; 2 e / angular correlations {{over a wide range}} of scattering angles from the coplanar to the perpendicular plane geometry. In these measurements the two outgoing electrons are observed at symmetric scattering <b>angles</b> and <b>with</b> <b>equal</b> energies. Angular correlation experiments in which an incident electron ionizes a helium atom and the resulting electrons are detected in coincidence provide rigorous tests of electron-impact ionization theories, particularly when carried out at excess energies from a few eV to approximately 50 eV above the ionization threshold, sometimes called the intermediate range of energies. In this range the ionization mechanism involves all the complexities of exchange and capture, distortions in the incoming and outgoing channels, and both long-and short-range correlations, but the energy range is too far above threshold to benefit from the simplifications offered by the Wannier model (Wannier 1953, Read 1985, Selles et al 1987). The testing and development of current theories (for a recent review see McCarthy and Weigold 1995) can be further challenged by including a wider range of scattering an...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the three-dimensional flow architecture of conjugate cooling channels in forced convection with internal heat generation within a solid. Two types of cross-section channel geometries were used. The first involved equilateral triangles <b>with</b> three <b>equal</b> <b>legs</b> in length and all three internal angles of 60 °. The second was isosceles right triangles <b>with</b> two <b>legs</b> of <b>equal</b> length and internal angles of 90 °, 45 ° and 45 °. Both the equilateral triangle and isosceles right triangle are special case of triangle that can easily and uniformly be packed and arranged to form a larger construct. The configurations were optimised {{in such a way that}} the peak temperature of the heat generating solid was minimised subject to the constraint of a fixed global volume of the solid material. The cooling fluid was driven through the channels by the pressure difference across the channel. The degrees of freedom of the channels were aspect ratio, hydraulic diameter and channel to channel spacing ratio. The shape of the channel was allowed to morph to determine the best configuration that gives the lowest thermal resistance. A gradient-based optimisation algorithm was applied in order to search for the best optimal geometric configurations that improve thermal performance by minimising thermal resistance for a wide range of dimensionless pressure difference. The effects of porosities, applied pressure and heat generation rate on the optimal aspect ratio and channel to channel spacing are reported. It was found that there are unique optimal design variables for a given pressure difference. The numerical results that were obtained were in agreement with the theoretical formulation using scale analysis and method of intersection of asymptotes. Results obtained show that the effects of applied dimensionless pressure drop on minimum thermal resistance were consistent with those obtained in the open literature.
