5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

Dan and Maddy have always been {{incredibly}} close without becoming lovers, but it is obvious that they are great together, so when it happens it is effortless and joyous and has wonderful potential. But Dan's private demons prevent it from being allowed to live and grow. I always thought it might be great for him, if only he could have let it be." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry's {{decision}} to write [...] "E.T." [...] came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session {{she had with}} Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo. It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this. I know this seems like a long shot, but I think I have the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' And I did, and it really worked out perfectly." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E
500|$|... "Jazz Me Blues" [...] {{was also}} {{important}} because it introduced {{what has been called}} the [...] "correlated chorus", a method of improvising that Beiderbecke's Davenport friend Esten Spurrier attributed to both Beiderbecke and Armstrong. [...] "Louis departed greatly from all cornet players in his ability to compose a close-knit individual 32 measures with all phrases compatible with each other", Spurrier told the biographers Sudhalter and Evans, [...] "so Bix <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> credited Louis as being the father of the correlated chorus: play two measures, then two related, making four measures, on which you played another four measures related to the first four, and so on ad infinitum {{to the end of the}} chorus. So the secret was simple—a series of related phrases." ...|$|E
500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|During the Presidential {{campaign}} of 1952, Pat Nixon's attitude toward politics changed {{when her husband}} was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed [...] "Checkers speech", so-called for the family's dog, a Cocker Spaniel given to them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself {{as a man of}} the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer, then said, [...] "I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> tell her she would look good in anything." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song.

[...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> say, 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and just do the last half.'

500|$|In 1984, American Continental Corporation bought Lincoln Savings and Loan Association {{for just}} over $50 million. Up {{through the early}} 1980s, Lincoln had been a conservatively-run enterprise, with almost half its assets in home loans and {{only a quarter of}} its assets {{considered}} at risk. It made slow growth at best, and had shown a loss for several years until it made a profit of a few million dollars in 1983. Once he took over, Keating fired the existing management. Savings and loan associations had been deregulated in the early 1980s, allowing them to make high-risk investments with their depositors' money, a change of which Keating and other savings and loan operators took advantage. When Keating later was asked why he got into savings and loans, he said, [...] "I know the business inside out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> felt that an S & L, if they'd relax the rules, was the biggest moneymaker in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheryl is {{introduced}} as an emotionally fragile woman, who pines for the affection of Archer. As the series began to progress, the character abandons her depressive characteristics and adopts a more maniacal and unstable personality. [...] "It was really {{fun to see}} her evolve," [...] Greer asserted, [...] "and I think [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had fun recording together. I'm so thankful that it got so crazy and turned so upside down, and how nuts this character is. It's so fun." [...] Her instability has regularly resulted in Cheryl being sent into mental institutions. She is often sexually aroused from being choked. Commentators have described Cheryl as [...] "", [...] "insane", [...] "glue-chugging", and [...] "empty-headed". Throughout much of the first season, the character frequently developed aliases for herself to acquiesce to her coworkers; these aliases include Cristal, an homage to the alcoholic beverage of the same name, and Cariña, which she professed [...] "better captured [...] sensual womanhood".|$|E
500|$|Press {{framing of}} Reagan changed {{from that of}} just helpmate and {{protector}} to someone with hidden power. As {{the image of her}} as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do I apologize for it." [...] She wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted," [...] but went on, [...] "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> will." ...|$|E

500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records myself, and I suppose that must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> promised myself I'd never do that, put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E
500|$|When {{describing}} the film's accuracy, Burton explained, [...] "it's {{not like a}} completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some {{of the film is}} trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it." [...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want to}} ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{contains}} {{allusions to}} many works, including those loved by Juster {{in his own}} upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including The Wind in the Willows, had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, {{going so far as}} to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style. Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of puns, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio. According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to radio serials helped inspire The Phantom Tollbooth, as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on sidekick Jim Fairfield from Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit. As a child, Juster had synesthesia, and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. [...] "One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the Lone Ranger [...] they would say, 'Here come the Injuns!' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had an image of engines, of train engines." ...|$|E
