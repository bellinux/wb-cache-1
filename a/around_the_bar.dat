25|$|As more music became {{available}} for karaoke machines, more {{people within the}} industry saw karaoke as a profitable form of lounge and nightclub entertainment. It {{is not uncommon for}} some bars to have karaoke performances seven nights a week, commonly with high-end sound equipment superior to the small, stand-alone consumer versions. s and lighting effects are also becoming common sights in karaoke bars. Lyrics are often displayed on multiple television screens <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2.8cm thick {{steel or}} {{fiberglass}} bar raised 2.5m above the landing area {{is all the}} gymnast has to hold onto as he performs giant swings or giants (forward or backward revolutions <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> in the handstand position), release skills, twists, and changes of direction. By using all of the momentum from giants and then releasing at the proper point, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts, such as a triple-back salto. Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar.|$|E
25|$|Reality in this Albee play is {{something}} that most of its characters try to escape. The most obvious escape route is through alcohol. Its presence is so entwined in the dialogue that it becomes almost a character itself. Every scene revolves <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and decanters of brandy, cognac, anisette, and gin. Claire is alcohol’s most wounded victim, but she is also the one who, although she has the most trouble dealing with reality, sees reality the clearest. Tobias is not as ruled by alcohol but uses it to calm himself enough to maintain his patience and usual silence.|$|E

25|$|This {{is often}} highly {{emphasized}} by spectators and novice vaulters, {{but it is}} arguably the easiest phase of the vault and {{is a result of}} proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing it so it falls away from the bar and mats. As the torso goes over and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern is making sure that their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or pits, face up.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the New York {{hardcore}} scene centred around squats and clubhouses. After the squats were closed down, {{the scene was}} headquartered in a small after-hours bar, A7, {{on the lower east}} side of Manhattan. [...] Later, New York's hardcore scene was centered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> CBGB, whose owner, Hilly Kristal, embraced hardcore punk. [...] The Dead Boys, originally from Cleveland but gained popularity in New York played at Hilly's club often and he even managed them. [...] For several years, CBGB held weekly hardcore matinees on Sundays. This stopped in 1990 when violence led Kristal to ban hardcore shows at the club.|$|E
2500|$|Allegedly, the Seventy-Niner's Café {{was robbed}} {{about an hour}} after the water incident. [...] A crowd of angry African Americans, some bar patrons and some residents, {{gathered}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> The Feigenbaums said they received a report that their establishment had been robbed at about 8 PM, and arrived at the Seventy-Niner at 8:20 PM. They claimed that a crowd of about 300 people had already gathered outside the bar, and began throwing rocks at the windows once the owners had gone inside. Abe Feigenbaum then said he went outside with a [...]44 caliber Ruger Model 44 rifle in his hands, followed by his brother Dave armed with a pistol. The rock-throwing stopped, they said, but resumed when they went back inside. After four calls to the police for help went unanswered, the Feigenbaums called the fire department in desperation and fled the café. The crowd now attempted to burn down the bar, but the attempt failed. At 9:11 PM, the Cleveland Division of Fire arrived at the Seventy-Niner's Café. Worried fire officials notified the Cleveland police of the large crowd, and the police arrived at 9:30 PM.|$|E

60|$|He {{stopped short}} in his reflections. His careful {{scrutiny}} of the heterogeneous crowd gathered together <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> had revealed to him no unfamiliar type save the little man who at that moment was ambling along {{on the other side}} of the way. Jocelyn Thew slackened his pace somewhat and watched him keenly. He was short, he wore a cheap ready-made suit of some plain material, and a straw hat tilted on the back of his head. He had round cheeks, he shambled rather than walked, and his vacuous countenance seemed both good-natured and unintelligent. To all appearances a more harmless person never breathed, yet Jocelyn Thew, as he studied him earnestly, felt that slight tightening of the nerves which came to him almost instinctively in moments of danger. He changed his purpose and turned down Fifth Avenue instead of up. The little man, it appeared, had business in the same direction. Jocelyn Thew walked the length of several blocks in leisurely fashion and then entered an hotel, studiously avoiding looking behind him. He made his way into a telephone booth and looked through the glass door. His follower in a few moments was visible, making apparently some aimless enquiry across the counter. Jocelyn Thew turned his back upon him and asked the operator for a number.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shape of}} a {{sideways}} figure eight has a long pedigree; for instance, it appears in the cross of Saint Boniface, wrapped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of a Latin cross.
