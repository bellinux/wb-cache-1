5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>technology</b> showcase, Valve {{considered}} Lost Coast to {{have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E

Quantum cellular automata, one way of performing computations using the principles of quantum mechanics, are often required to be reversible.

5|$|St George's Academy is a co-educational {{comprehensive}} {{secondary school}} based in the English market town of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, with a satellite school at nearby Ruskington. Its origins date to 1908, when Sleaford Council School opened at Church Lane to meet the growing demand for elementary education in the town. After the Education Act 1944, the senior department became a secondary modern. A second school building was constructed at Westholme in the 1950s and expanded in 1983, allowing the Church Lane site to close; to mark the occasion, it was renamed St George's School. After it became grant-maintained, the school became a comprehensive, received <b>a</b> <b>Technology</b> specialism, became <b>a</b> <b>Technology</b> College in 1994 and later converted to Foundation status. Coteland's School in Ruskington federated with St George's in 2007; they merged to form the Academy in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The idea of <b>a</b> <b>technology</b> {{school in}} Georgia was {{introduced}} in 1865 during the Reconstruction period. Two former Confederate officers, Major John Fletcher Hanson (an industrialist) and Nathaniel Edwin Harris (a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia), who had become prominent citizens {{in the town of}} Macon, Georgia after the Civil War, strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the industrial revolution that was occurring throughout the North. However, because the American South of that era was mainly populated by agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, <b>a</b> <b>technology</b> school was needed.|$|E

Plans for a new sports hall were first discussed in 1990, but they only came to fruition in 1996, when Northgate Sports Hall opened. The Sports Council and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts donated £250,000 towards its construction; this was matched by North Kesteven District Council, while Carre's raised £50,000 towards the building work. An all-weather pitch at the school opened in 2007; it cost £649,000 to lay, half of which was met by the Football Foundation. A building programme costing £835,000 provided the school with food technology facilities and a two-storey Fitness Suite, which were opened in March 2011.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be <b>a</b> <b>technology</b> demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that <b>a</b> <b>technology</b> transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E
5|$|Chain of Memories was {{announced}} along with Kingdom Hearts II at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2003.

The cut scene animations were rendered using the graphical engine of the PlayStation 2 iteration and then encoded for the Game Boy Advance by using <b>a</b> <b>technology</b> developed by Japanese company, AM3. To help market the game, Disney and Square Enix launched official Japanese websites. A playable demo was first {{made available to the}} public at the 2003 Jump Festa in Japan; this demo and subsequent demos highlighted the card-based combat system. Aside from information gathered from the opening sequences, most details regarding the story were kept secret until the release.|$|E
