The more common <b>A-scope</b> represents distances {{across the face of}} the tube, while the J-scope presents as the angle around the cathode ray tube's face. This increases the amount of room on the scale by a factor of π for any given display size, improving accuracy. In spite of using the J-scope, and adopting the frequency change for more stability, the team found accurate measurements of range quite difficult. At the time, the procedure for generating sharp pulses of signals was in its infancy, and their signals were considerably spread out in time, making measurements difficult.|$|E
50|$|Size of <b>A-scope</b> {{displays}} vary, but 5 to 7 inch diagonal {{was often}} {{used on a}} radar display. The 7JPx series of CRT's (7JP1, 7JP4 and 7JP7) was originally designed as an <b>A-scope</b> display CRT. Since {{the job of the}} A scope was to track an object, the phosphor used in the CRT has to have a long persistence (the trace remained on the display longer) from sweep to sweep. The P7 phosphor has the longest persistence so the 7JP7 was used.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT] A multi-wavelength Mie lidar is a {{powerful}} tool to investigate the optical properties of aerosol particles along with their vertical profile information. In the usual analysis with the Fernald method, however, it is required to assume both the extinction-to-backscattering ratio (lidar ratio, S_ 1) and the extinction coefficients {{at the far end}} boundary. For a multi-wavelength lidar, appropriate choices of these parameters are indispensable to derive consistent profiles from the actual data. In this work, we propose two algorithms for the analysis of four-wavelength lidar data. The first approach is a pragmatic one, and it relies on the sun photometer data simultaneously measured with the lidar data. By assuming a constant S_ 1 value for each wavelength in the lower troposphere, a consistent set of S_ 1 is determined by fitting the observed profiles to reference profiles that are relevant to the aerosol optical thicknesses from the sun photometer measurement. The second algorithm is more comprehensive in that it adopts the direct fitting of the lidar <b>A-scopes</b> to the theoretical curves that are based on a look-up table: the table is pre-calculated for various combinations of the extinction coefficient, S_ 1 parameter, complex refractive index, and aerosol size distribution. As a result, the vertical profiles of these parameters are determined along with the extinction profile...|$|R
50|$|Early American and German radars {{used the}} J-scope, which resembled a {{circular}} {{version of the}} <b>A-scope.</b> These display range as an angle around the display face, {{as opposed to the}} linear distance along it. This arrangement allows greater accuracy in reading the range with the same sized display as an <b>A-scope</b> because the trace uses the full circumference rather than just the horizontal distance (so the time base is π times longer). An electro-mechanical version of the J-scope display remained common on consumer boating depth meters until recently.|$|E
50|$|Modifications {{made to the}} radars {{included}} a new antenna pedestal to support a 6-ft parabolic reflector, a rack-mounted PPI and <b>A-scope,</b> and a fiberglass radome to protect the antenna and allow operation without wind and ice loading.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} radar display, the <b>A-scope</b> or A-display, shows {{only the}} range, not the direction, to targets. Some people referred to these displays also as R-scope for range scope. A-scopes were {{used on the}} earliest radar systems during World War II, notably the seminal Chain Home (CH) system.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Chain Home is the {{canonical}} <b>A-scope</b> system. This image shows several target [...] "blips" [...] at ranges between 15 and 30 {{miles from the}} station. The large blip {{on the far left}} is the leftover signal from the radar's own transmitter, targets in this area could not be seen. The signal is inverted to make measurement simpler.|$|E
50|$|A {{similarly}} {{modified version}} of the <b>A-scope</b> display was commonly used for air-to-air and ground-search radars, notably in AI radars and ASV radars - (Air-Surface Vessel). In this case, two receiver antennas were used in front of a common reflector, pointed slightly to the left and right of the aircraft centerline. Reception from both, using lobe switching, was sent to the left and right sides of a vertically oriented <b>A-scope,</b> and range could be measured as before. However, displacement of the target to the sides of the aircraft would result in the return being stronger on one side than the other, causing the blip on that side to be larger. This allowed the radar operator to easily indicate what direction to turn to intercept the target. These types of displays were sometimes referred to as ASV-scopes or L-scopes, although the naming was not universal.|$|E

50|$|Operations Rooms {{are widely}} {{depicted}} in {{film and television}} treatments, frequently with large maps, numerous computer consoles and radar and sonar repeater displays or consoles, {{as well as the}} almost ubiquitous grease-pencil annotated polar plot on an edge-lighted transparent plotting board. At the time the CIC concept was born, the projected map-like polar display (PPI scopes) with the ship at the center was making its way into radar displays displacing the <b>A-scope</b> which was simply a time-delayed blip showing a range on an oscilloscope Cathode ray tube.|$|E
50|$|In early {{tests in}} April, {{the superiority of}} the {{scanning}} PPI system was evident, and all work on the older <b>A-scope</b> version ended. H2S performed its first experimental flight on 23 April 1942, with the radar mounted in a Halifax bomber, V9977. The scanning unit installed in the aircraft's belly using the position previously occupied by the mid-under turret, which was by that time seldom installed. The rotating scanner mounting was designed and manufactured by Nash and Thompson. The scanning aerial was covered by a distinctive streamlined radome.|$|E
50|$|Helicopters appears like {{a rapidly}} pulsing noise emitter {{except in a}} clear {{environment}} free from clutter. An audible signal is produced for passive identification {{of the type of}} airborne object. Microwave Doppler frequency shift produced by reflector motion falls into the audible sound range for human beings (20 - 20,000 Hz), which is used for target classification in addition to the kinds of conventional radar display used for that purpose, like <b>A-scope,</b> B-scope, C-scope, and RHI indicator. The human ear may {{be able to tell the}} difference better than electronic equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Some early radars, notably {{versions}} of the Chain Home system, used the HR-scope, a modified <b>A-scope.</b> CH receivers were connected {{to a number of}} vertically displaced antennas, and by comparing the strength of a blip from each one, the operator could determine the vertical angle of the target, and then calculate its altitude. To aid this measurement, the systems were modified to allow the returns from two selected antennas to be displays at the same time, making it much easier to compare the blips. The name refers to [...] "height-range".|$|E
5000|$|Typical radar {{displays}} {{of the era}} measured range by comparing the blip of the return against its position on the CRT face. Measuring against a scale might offer range accuracy {{on the order of}} [...] on the Mk. III's 6 inch cm CRTs, far less accuracy than needed for the gun laying role. To solve this problem, the Mk. III used two range displays, coarse and fine. The coarse display, placed about eye level in the console, was a classic <b>A-scope</b> display, showing all the blips within the range of the radar, normally [...]|$|E
50|$|A {{receiver}} in the aircraft would tune in these signals {{and send them}} to an <b>A-scope</b> type display, like those used by Chain Home. If the aircraft was properly lined up with the runway, both signals would be received at the same instant, and thus be drawn at the same point on the display. If the aircraft was located to one side or the other, one of the signals would be received before the other, forming two distinct peaks on the display. By determining which signal was being received first, pilots would know that they were closer to that antenna, and would be able to recapture the proper direction by turning away from it.|$|E
5000|$|PPI {{displays}} {{are actually}} {{quite similar to}} A-scopes in operation, and appeared fairly quickly after the introduction of radar. As with most 2D radar displays, {{the output of the}} radio receiver was attached to the intensity channel to produce a bright dot indicating returns. In the <b>A-scope</b> a sawtooth voltage generator attached to the X-axis moves the spot across the screen, whereas in the PPI the output of two such generators is used to rotate the line around the screen. Some early systems were mechanical, physically spinning the deflection magnets, but the electronics needed to do this in a [...] "solid-state" [...] fashion were not particularly complex, and were in use in the early 1940s.|$|E
50|$|For a {{production}} system, the team {{began working with}} a system using a circular J-scope display for improved accuracy. A J-scope presents time differences not as a linear displacement across the tube, as in the more common <b>A-scope,</b> but instead as the angle around the cathode ray tube's face. Times differences could be represented with a longer length (by a factor of π) for a given display size, improving accuracy. In spite of using the J-scope, and adopting the frequency change for more stability, the team found accurate measurements of range quite difficult. At the time, the procedure for generating sharp pulses of signals was in its infancy, and their signals were considerably spread out in time, making measurements difficult.|$|E
50|$|The commanders were {{impressed}} and, on 1 January 1942, the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) {{set up a}} team under Bernard Lovell to develop an S-band airborne targeting radar based on AIS. An initial order for 1,500 sets was placed. It was clear even {{at this point that}} a Plan Position Indicator (PPI) display would be desirable, but this would require a complex scanning parabolic antenna, compared to the very simple set of fixed antennas used in the <b>A-scope</b> system. The new targeting radar was designed to fit in an aerodynamic blister on the belly of a bomber. In March, it was decided that both H2S and a new centimetric Air-Surface-Vessel radar (ASV) radar, ASV Mk. III, would be built using the same components, reducing competition for parts.|$|E
50|$|The P-3 was {{produced}} in two variants the P-3A (fixed) and the P-3M (mobile) with a transmitter and receiver mounted on separate trucks. Both variants operate {{in a similar fashion}} using two mast mounted antennas (transmitter and receiver) composed of Yagi antennas mounted one above the other {{in the case of the}} receiver, the radar also used an <b>A-scope</b> display. Azimuth was scanned mechanically by the receiver antenna with elevation determined using a Goniometer, the phase difference between the upper and lower Yagi antenna was used to calculate the elevation angle which could then be used to determine the height of the target once the range was known. The P-3 had a maximum power output of up to 100 kW and a pulse duration of 10-15 microseconds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary input}} to the <b>A-scope</b> was the amplified return signal {{received}} from the radar, which was sent into the Y-axis of the display. Returns caused the spot to be deflected downward (or upward on some models), drawing vertical lines on the tube. These lines were known as a [...] "blip" [...] (or [...] "pip"). The X-axis input was connected to a sawtooth voltage generator known as a time base generator that swept the spot across the display, timed to match the pulse repetition frequency of the radar. This spread out the vertical traces across the display according to {{the time they were}} received. Since the return time of the signal corresponds to twice the distance to the target divided by the speed of light, the distance along the axis directly indicates the range to any target. This was usually measured against a scale above the display.|$|E
50|$|The P-8 being a {{development}} of the earlier P-3 shares many similarities with the earlier system, like the P-3M (mobile variant) the P-8 was mounted in two ZiL trucks. The P-8 used a single antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception which rotated at a speed of 2 r.p.m. The antenna was composed of four Yagi antennas mounted in sets of two with one set above the other atop a 30-meter mast. Azimuth was scanned mechanically by the antenna with elevation determined using a Goniometer in similar fashion to the P-3. The P-8 {{was one of the}} first Russian radars to incorporate a means of clutter suppression, a coherent oscillator in the receiver circuit acted as a simple moving target indicator to eliminate passive interference like ground clutter. The P-8 was also the first Russian radar to use a plan position indicator in addition to an <b>A-scope</b> to indicate height, the radar had a maximum power output of up to 75 kW and a receiver sensitivity of 7 mV.|$|E
5000|$|A B-scope or b-scan {{provides}} a 2-D [...] "top down" [...] representation of space, with the vertical axis typically representing range and the horizontal axis azimuth (angle). B-scope displays were common in airborne radars in the 1950s and 60s, which were mechanically scanned {{from side to}} side, and sometimes {{up and down as}} well. The B-scope's display represented a horizontal [...] "slice" [...] of the airspace {{on both sides of the}} aircraft out to the tracking angles of the radar. The spot was swept up the Y-axis in a fashion similar to the A-scope's X-axis, with distances [...] "up" [...] the display indicating greater range. This signal was mixed with a varying voltage being generated by a mechanical device that depended on the current horizontal angle of the antenna. The result was essentially an <b>A-scope</b> whose range line was rotated to point up, and then rotated back and forth about a zero point at the bottom of the display. The radio signal was sent into the intensity channel, producing a bright spot on the display indicating returns.|$|E
5000|$|The P-18 uses {{a single}} antenna {{accomplishing}} both transmission and reception. The antenna {{is composed of}} sixteen Yagi antennas mounted in sets of eight with one set above the other. The radar antenna is mounted on the truck used to transport it improving mobility and the radar also features a mechanism which allows the antenna height and elevation to be altered during operation. Azimuth is scanned mechanically by the antenna with a rotation of 10 r.p.m, the original P-18 used three indicators, including two plan position indicators {{in addition to a}} back-up <b>A-scope.</b> Like the P-12 the radar features automatic frequency control with four pre-set operating frequencies, moving target indicator to eliminate passive clutter and active jamming, the radar could also display tracks from another radar it was paired with. The original P-18 used a coaxial cavity resonator transmitter, vacuum tube receiver with transistor based preamplifier and a vacuum tube/pin diode based duplexer. A secondary radar for IFF is generally used in conjunction with the P-18, either the NRS-12 or the later 1L22 [...] "Parol".|$|E
5000|$|The P-10 shares many {{similarities}} {{with the}} earlier P-8; the P-10 was also mounted in two ZiL trucks. The P-10 used a single antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, the antenna was composed of four Yagi antennas mounted in sets of two with one set above the other. The antenna mast was mounted directly to the Zil transport truck, previous radar like the P-8 had a free standing mast, {{the advantage of the}} P-10 mast was that it could be deployed and stowed much faster than before, improving the mobility of the radar. Azimuth was scanned mechanically by the antenna with elevation determined using a Goniometer in similar fashion to the original P-3. The P-10 used a plan position indicator in addition to an <b>A-scope</b> to indicate height, the radar had a maximum power output of up to 100 kW and a pulse width of 4-12 microseconds. A secondary radar for IFF was generally used in conjunction with the P-8 such as the NRS-12 (NATO [...] "Score Board"). In addition to incorporating a means of passive clutter suppression the P-10 was also able to alter its carrier frequency to improve resistance to both passive clutter and active jamming techniques.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a synthetic model intercomparison {{to investigate the}} importance of transport model errors for estimating the sources and sinks of CO 2 using satellite measurements. The experiments were designed for testing the potential performance of the proposed CO 2 lidar <b>A-SCOPE,</b> but also apply to other space borne missions that monitor total column CO 2. The participating transport models IFS, LMDZ, TM 3, and TM 5 were run in forward and inverse mode using common a priori CO 2 fluxes and initial concentrations. Forward simulations of column averaged CO 2 (x CO 2) mixing ratios vary between the models by σ= 0. 5 ppm over the continents and σ= 0. 27 ppm over the oceans. Despite {{the fact that the}} models agree on average on the sub-ppm level, these modest differences nevertheless lead to significant discrepancies in the inverted fluxes of 0. 1 PgC/yr per 10 6 km 2 over land and 0. 03 PgC/yr per 10 6 km 2 over the ocean. These transport model induced flux uncertainties exceed the target requirement that was formulated for the <b>A-SCOPE</b> mission of 0. 02 PgC/yr per 10 6 km 2, and could also limit the overall performance of other CO 2 missions such as GOSAT. A variable, but overall encouraging agreement is found in comparison with FTS measurements at Park Falls, Darwin, Spitsbergen, and Bremen, although systematic differences are found exceeding the 0. 5 ppm level. Because of this, our estimate of the impact of transport model uncerainty is likely to be conservative. It is concluded that {{to make use of the}} remote sensing technique for quantifying the sources and sinks of CO 2 not only requires highly accurate satellite instruments, but also puts stringent requirements on the performance of atmospheric transport models.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the project is to simulate the real time Radar detection and tracking operations using MATLAB software. Radar system use modulated waveforms and directive antennas to transmit electromagnetic energy into a specific volume in space to search for targets. Objects (targets) within a search volume will reflect portions of this energy (radar returns or echoes) back to the radar. These echoes are then processed by radar receiver to extract target information such as range. Velocity, angular position, and other target identifying characteristics. The project mainly concentrates on the radar displays and different radar types to collect the information of the flying objects, such as the range, speed, distance, angles. The display types are <b>A-scope,</b> B-scope, C-scope, PPI, and RHI, which are used in modern radars. While others are either obsolete or are found only in very specialized applications. Signals displayed on these scopes can be raw video, synthetic video (detected video) or computer-generated symbols.

On the basis of photographs of <b>A-scope</b> recorder which were taken every 1 km along the traverse routes, the reflection intensity of the radio echo signals from the ice/bedrock interface was calculated by correcting {{the effect of the}} attenuation loss of electromagnetic waves within the ice sheet. Rock specimens collected from Massif A of the Yamato Mountains, the Minami-Yamato Nunataks and the nearby moraine field, and dielectric constants of the rocks were measured in a frequency range from 3 to 50 MHz. According to the measurements, the values of dielectric constant of the rock samples varied from 2 to 5. To identify bedrock types beneath the ice sheet in the bare ice area, the reflection intensity of the bedrock is compared with the echo strength calculated from the measured dielectric constant of rock samples.

40|$|The {{remote sensing}} technique, total column {{differential}} absorption LiDAR (TC-DIAL) {{has been proposed}} {{in a number of}} feasibility studies as a suitable method for making total column measurements of atmospheric CO 2 from space. Among the sources of error associated with TC-DIAL retrievals from space is an undefined modulation of the received signals resulting from the variability in the Earth's surface reflectance between the LiDAR pulses. This source of uncertainty is investigated from a satellite perspective by the application of a computer model for spaceborne TC-DIAL instruments. The simulations are carried out over Europe and South America using modified MODIS surface reflectance maps and a DIAL configuration similar to that suggested for the proposed ESA <b>A-SCOPE</b> mission. A positive bias of 0. 01 ppmv in both continental test sets is observed using 10 Hz pulse repetition frequency and 200 km integration distance. This bias is a consequence of non-linearity in the DIAL equation, and in particular regions such as the Alps and over certain coastlines it contributes to positive errors of between 0. 05 and 0. 16 ppmv for 200 and 50 km integration distances.

40|$|The high {{request of}} the {{preoperative}} diagnosis for liver metastasis of cancer is the claimed factor in the surgical field. Many kinds of examinations; i. e, physical examination, liver function test of serum, liver biopsy, laparoscopy, roentogenological diagnosis and others were using for this purpose, but the diagnosis was unliable yet. Recently, the clinical application of radioisotope is remarkably advanced, and the scintiscanning {{is used as a}} standard tool for clinician. The advances of the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus and techniques is also evident. In this paper the investigations were carried out by combinating method of ultrasonic diagnosis with hepatoscintigram. The excellent point of this method is to improve the weak points each other of the hepatoscintigram and ultrasonic diagnosis. By means of hepatoscintigram every large space occupying lesion (more than 2 - 3 cm in diameter) in liver can be seen but the depth and structure of the lesion can not be recognized, however the ultrasonic <b>A-scope</b> method is able to clarify the laters. Ultrasonic method is able to diagnose the character of the aimed occupying lesion, respectively. Generally, the continuous multiplying echo indicate the cancer tissue, the boundary wall echo is the cyst or abscess, and the gall stone is easily diagnosed at the same time. But the risk for over diagnosis is respective in two methods, the diagnosis by this combinating method must be carefull in considerations. Combinating method of ultrasonic <b>A-scope</b> with hepatoscintigram gave a good result for liver disease. But the nature of the echoes obtained various kind of livers tend to over-lap. Therefore it is difficult to remark the distinguished accuracy in all cases. The suitable frequency was 2. 25 MC and a barium titanate of 10 mm in diameter was used. Now we are using the ultrasonic contact compound scope, Aloka SSD- 10. In this paper some results and problems of this method were presented. The examination is carried out at the lower right chest wall or through the abdominal wall. Several normal human livers were examined first. Some echograms of them were shown. Details of the deep structure are shown when STC (Sensitivity Time Control) is on. But concerning intrahepatic structure, it demonstrates more clearly than when STC off. Some echo patterns of the metastatic liver cancers were shown. A patient who had alarge tumor at his upper right abdomen was examined. His echogram of liver is shown. There is a large tumor (4 cm in diameter) at the deep region in liver and the back surface of liver is pressured backwards. But no malignant echo pattern is seen. In some cases of our examinations malignant tissues showed only the surface and bottom echoes. The result of operation actually showed the metastatic cancer of liver, corresponding with the echogram.

The probe, therefore, has retractable 7 mm bare tip, {{so it can be}} safely withdrawn without any, danger from hemorrhage of destructed tissue after coagulation. As a preliminary experiment, stereotaxic thalamic lesions by the probe {{have been produced}} in the dog brain as well as the formalin suspended human brains under observation with ultrasonic <b>A-scope</b> apparatus by reflection method. The transducer provided with barium titanate (2. 25 Mc, 10 mm diameter) was used. It was clearly identified that the echoes were corresponded to size and location of the lesions in the dog brain as well as human brain specimen. During the surgery, echo was noted from the tip of probe which was in the target area of the thalamus of the patients. In every case, the lesion echoes showed high fluctuating amplitude and width during coagulation procedure. Lesion echoes were observed up to 45 days after the surgery. They maintained stable duplicate echoes during the period. It is our suggestion that the ultrasonic examination of the stereotaxic lesion is useful to note accidental hemorrhage in the lesion of a reconvalescent patient. It is also a great aid for this purpose to check the midline echo at the same time. Recently further investigations with ultrasonic compound sector scope, Aloka SSD- 10, were done. The ultrasonic scanning was performed on the operative side vertically. During and after the coagulation of the target, twenty three cases were examined with compound sector scope. The reflextion from the lesion with compound scope was noted in 91. 3 % of the cases while 82. 9 % with <b>A-scope.</b> The lesionecho was obtained about 1. 4 cm lateral from the midline echo in case of destruction of V. L. nucleous of the thalamus. In case of the centre median the lesionecho was located adjacent to the midline echo. These lesionechoes were located correctly in their anatomical coordinates of the targets. But {{the size and shape of}} the lesionechoes were identified rather larger than the destructed lesions. This deflexion would be due to the width of the ultrasonic reflected wave. As confirmative experiments, stereotaxic thalamic destructive lesions have been produced in the specimen of the formalin suspended human brains under observation with ultrasonic compound sector scope. It is our impression that echo-encephalgraphy with the ultrasonic compound scope has a potential usefulness to observe location, shape and size of the lesion as well as to detect the accidental hemorrhage of a reconvalescent patient...|$|E
40|$|The {{attenuation}} {{of radio}} waves within the ice sheet {{is caused by}} absorption loss due to dielectric and electric properties of ice and geometric loss due to spreading of radio waves. The dielectric structure of the ice sheet can be derived by estimating the attenuation. This estimation is useful {{for the design of}} the future radio echo sounder. The inland traverse party of the 23 rd Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in 1982 measured an ice thickness by radio echo sounding which operated on 60 MHz. Calculations of the attenuation rate of radio waves were made by reading the rate of decrease of the strength of internal echoes on the photographs of the <b>A-scope</b> display records. Values of the attenuation coefficient (dB/ 100 m) in the present study change between about 1. 2 and about 3,and become smaller with increase of surface elevation of the ice sheet. But the attenuation coefficient in the bare ice field, the Meteorite Ice Field, around the Yamato Mountains is remarkably high. The regional difference of the attenuation coefficient is caused mainly by the temperature distribution with depth in the ice sheet. But it is considered that the high value of the effective attenuation coefficient in the bare ice field is due to not only different temperature distribution but also different dielectric properties of the bare ice...|$|E
