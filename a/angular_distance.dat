This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an <b>angular</b> <b>distance</b> of 20″ with an angular width of 2″.

25|$|The Moon's {{elongation}} is its <b>angular</b> <b>distance</b> {{east of the}} Sun at any time. At new moon, it is {{zero and}} the Moon {{is said to be}} in conjunction. At full moon, the elongation is 180° and it is said to be in opposition. In both cases, the Moon is in syzygy, that is, the Sun, Moon and Earth are nearly aligned. When elongation is either 90° or 270°, the Moon is said to be in quadrature.|$|E
25|$|Whether a star is {{circumpolar}} {{depends upon}} the observer's latitude. Since the altitude of the north or south celestial pole (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of the observer's latitude, any star whose <b>angular</b> <b>distance</b> from the visible celestial pole {{is less than the}} absolute latitude will be circumpolar. For example, if the observer's latitude is 50° N, any star will be circumpolar if it is less than 50° from the north celestial pole. If the observer's latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the south celestial pole are circumpolar. Stars on the celestial equator are not circumpolar when observed from any latitude in either hemisphere of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|The other {{direct method}} is the {{so-called}} moving cluster method. This relies {{on the fact that}} the stars of a cluster share a common motion through space. Measuring the proper motions of cluster members and plotting their apparent motions across the sky will reveal that they converge on a vanishing point. The radial velocity of cluster members can be determined from Doppler shift measurements of their spectra, and once the radial velocity, proper motion and <b>angular</b> <b>distance</b> from the cluster to its vanishing point are known, simple trigonometry will reveal the distance to the cluster. The Hyades are the best known application of this method, which reveals their distance to be 46.3parsecs.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} {{angle of the}} secondary {{with respect to the}} primary is measured, together with the <b>angular</b> <b>distance</b> between the two stars. The time of observation is also recorded. After a sufficient number of observations are recorded over a period of time, they are plotted in polar coordinates with the primary star at the origin, and the most probable ellipse is drawn through these points such that the Keplerian law of areas is satisfied. This ellipse is known as the apparent ellipse, and is the projection of the actual elliptical orbit of the secondary with respect to the primary on the plane of the sky. From this projected ellipse the complete elements of the orbit may be computed, where the semi-major axis can only be expressed in angular units unless the stellar parallax, and hence the distance, of the system is known.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallax}} {{of a star}} {{is defined}} as half of the <b>angular</b> <b>distance</b> that a star appears to move relative to the celestial sphere as Earth orbits the Sun. Equivalently, it is the subtended angle, from that star's perspective, of the semimajor axis of the Earth's orbit. The star, the Sun and the Earth form the corners of an imaginary right triangle in space: the right angle is the corner at the Sun, and the corner at the star is the parallax angle. The length of the opposite side to the parallax angle is {{the distance from the}} Earth to the Sun (defined as one astronomical unit (au), and the length of the adjacent side gives the distance from the sun to the star. Therefore, given a measurement of the parallax angle, along with the rules of trigonometry, the distance from the Sun to the star can be found. A parsec is defined as the length of the side adjacent to the vertex occupied by a star whose parallax angle is one arcsecond.|$|E

The size of the M87 clusters shows a gradual increase with distance from the galactic center. The first hypervelocity globular cluster, HVGC-1, was discovered escaping M87. The discovery of HVGC-1 suggests that the core of M87 held not one but two supermassive black holes. A supermassive black hole binary can result from a long-ago collision between two galaxies, which merged to form a single giant galaxy.|$|E
