500|$|At the October 30, 2007 {{debate in}} Philadelphia and the November 15 debate in Las Vegas, Biden was noted for some one-liners that drew some {{laughter}} from the audience. First, when speaking about Rudy Giuliani at the Philadelphia debate, Biden stated, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated, [...] "I know there's more to say, Campbell. I <b>appreciate</b> <b>you</b> asking me the question and I'm sorry I answered it. I know you're not supposed to answer questions, based on what I've heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening {{with the}} {{disclaimer}} [...] "No mythological creatures were harmed {{in the making}} of this video", Kesha appears sitting next to two unicorns pouring champagne while having a conversation on how she was elected to the parliament of Uzbekistan, [...] "So I grabbed the bear by the throat and I looked him right in the eyes, and I said, 'Bear, you have till the count of zero to put some pants on and apologize to the president.'" [...] The music begins and Kesha makes eyes at James Van Der Beek. After the eye contact Kesha grabs one of the unicorns and kisses him then removes her bra and throws it across the room, Van Der Beek then does the same with his bra, puzzling Kesha as to why he was wearing a bra. The music fades in the background as the two then {{make their way to the}} center of the dance floor and exchange words ("Well, well, well. If it isn’t James Van Der Douche.", [...] "I don't <b>appreciate</b> <b>you</b> slander-Beeking my name, Ke dollar sign ha.") before engaging in a gun fight. They begin shooting lasers at one another, killing multiple unicorns. Van Der Beek gets hit in the shoulder and falls. Kesha steps on his arm to stop him from reaching for his gun, as he begs for mercy, which Kesha denies. At the end of the video, it is revealed that Kesha killed Van Der Beek and that she has mounted his head on her wall with the plaque reading, [...] "James Van Der Dead", as she sits with two unicorns laughing. She then frowns at the camera and it switches to Van Der Beek one more time before the screen goes black.|$|E
2500|$|After the White House party {{crashing}} {{incident in}} 2009, Virginia Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment {{wrote a letter}} to Gov. Kaine asking for Salahi's removal from the board: [...] "Mr. Salahi's recent outrageous behavior and personal promotion in regards to trespassing in the White House is not the face we need for Virginia tourism…I would <b>appreciate</b> <b>you</b> taking swift action to avoid any further negative situations." [...] Salahi resigned from the Virginia Tourism Board on December 7, 2009.|$|E

6000|$|... "I almost envy that man," [...] said John Effingham, with warmth. [...] "To have <b>appreciated</b> <b>you,</b> Powis, was {{a mark of}} a high judgment; but {{it seems}} he {{properly}} appreciated himself, his country, and human nature." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had listened}} eagerly, as I say; {{and it was}} her nature to {{understand}} quickly. [...] "I wonder if <b>you</b> <b>appreciate</b> what <b>you</b> say. If you do, you take a great responsibility." ...|$|R

[...] The Rebbe responded: [...] "I also want to be in Israel." [...] The journalist insisted, [...] "So when, when will you come?" [...] The Rebbe responded, [...] "That depends on the Moshiach, not on me." [...] The journalist persisted, [...] "You are the Moshiach!" [...] to which the Rebbe responded, [...] "I am not." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, President Barack Obama was {{interrupted}} at {{a speech in}} New Hampshire {{by a group of}} Occupy Wall Street protesters who attempted to chant slogans during the speech; the protesters later delivered a paper message to the press, which read, [...] "Mr. President: Over 4,000 peaceful protesters have been arrested while bankers continue to destroy the economy. You must stop the assault on our First Amendment rights. Your silence sends a message that police brutality is acceptable. Banks got bailed out. We got sold out." [...] The crowd quickly drowned the protesters out with chants of “Obama!” Obama then responded, [...] "I <b>appreciate</b> <b>you</b> guys making your point. Let me go ahead and make mine." [...] Later in the speech, Obama said, “Families like yours, young people like the ones here today— including the ones who were just chanting at me— you’re the reason that I ran for office in the first place.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his inauguration}} in 2001, President George W. Bush often used the noun-as-adjective when {{referring}} to the Democratic party. In 2006, Ruth Marcus, an opinion-writer and columnist for The Washington Post, noted that [...] "he derisive use of 'Democrat' in this way was a Bush staple during the recent campaign", and she chastised Bush, alleging he was being intentionally offensive. Marcus {{went on to say}} the argument about the term was [...] "trivial, sticks-and-stones [...] linguistic bickering". Bush spoke of the [...] "" [...] in his 2007 State of the Union Address, although the advance copy that was given to members of Congress read [...] "Democratic majority". Democrats complained about the use of Democrat as an adjective in the address: John Podesta, White House Chief of Staff for Bush's predecessor Bill Clinton, argued that it was [...] "like nails on a chalkboard," [...] although Congressional historian Julian E. Zelizer argued that [...] "It's hard to disentangle whether that's an intentional slight". Political analyst Charlie Cook doubted it was a deliberate attempt to offend Democrats, saying Republicans [...] "have been [...] so long that they probably don't even realize they're doing it". Bush joked about the issue in a February 4, 2007 speech to House Democrats, stating [...] "Now look, my diction isn't all that good. I have been accused of occasionally mangling the English language. And so I <b>appreciate</b> <b>you</b> inviting the head of the Republic Party." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lynch {{is known}} for being {{reluctant}} {{to talk to the}} media. He was fined $50,000 by the NFL for refusing to talk to the media throughout the 2013 NFL season, which inspired fans of the Seattle Seahawks to fundraise that amount. However, the fine was subsequently pulled back in an agreement that he would be fined another $50,000 if he broke the same rule, after which he donated the money raised by Seahawks fans to pay his fine to charity. Lynch was fined $100,000 on November 19, 2014, for once again refusing to speak to the media. A few days later, after the Seahawks win over Arizona, he answered nearly every question from reporters with [...] "Yeah". On December 21, 2014, after the second Seahawks-Cardinals game, he answered nearly every question from reporters with some version of [...] "Thanks for asking" [...] or [...] "I <b>appreciate</b> <b>you</b> asking." [...] The only people to get an [...] "extended interview" [...] were Deion Sanders, former teammate turned analyst Michael Robinson, and Michael Silver, in which they discovered his reluctance came from his upbringing {{and the fact that he}} felt that he was [...] "forced to do something." [...] On January 27, 2015, during Super Bowl Media Day in Glendale, Arizona, Lynch continued the trend of declining to give detailed media interviews by showing up for five minutes, and answering every question with some variation of [...] "I'm just here so I won't get fined," [...] and the following day [...] "You know why I'm here." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 6, 2012, Bryant passed O'Neal for fifth {{place on}} the all-time scoring list. Bryant {{said it was an}} honor because of their championships together. O'Neal congratulated Bryant, saying [...] "I'm proud of him. I'm happy for him. And, most of all, I want to thank him for being a part of the {{greatest}} 1-2 punch ever created, never to be duplicated." [...] Bryant stated on radio the following day that he and O'Neal were never going to last as teammates. Bryant recalled: [...] "There was an interview that I heard Shaq do which he kind of threw down the challenge of me not being able to win without him. After I read that, I said, 'Aw, that's it.' Some comparison that he made with me and Penny Hardaway, and once I read that, I said, 'You know what? I can't finish my career with people saying that. There's no way.'" [...] In 2013, Bryant said that the two [...] "have a really, really good relationship now", calling it [...] "a good lesson for all of us." [...] He said the two had [...] "mutual respect" [...] for each other, while O'Neal commented that they had an [...] "athletic dislike" [...] for each other but [...] "never had a real dislike". That year, the Lakers retired O'Neal's No. 34 during a halftime ceremony. [...] Bryant did not attend the ceremony, but called O'Neal [...] "the most gifted physical specimen I've ever seen play this game" [...] in a recorded video during the event. [...] Questioned about his absence, Bryant told the media, [...] "I <b>appreciate</b> <b>you</b> guys trying to start some stuff for old times' sake." [...] Later, it came out that Bryant had missed the ceremony because he had been receiving treatment from the Lakers' training staff.|$|E

There {{is not one of the}} family who does not love and respect you, and long to see all the world <b>appreciating</b> <b>you</b> as we do; and your poor mother--" ...|$|R
50|$|On 11 October 2007 at the M.E.N.

6000|$|Mrs. Ferrand dropped half a mock curtsey. [...] "A polite partner {{would have}} said 'bar one,' Harry," [...] she murmured petulantly. [...] "How awfully {{in love with her}} you are, my dear boy. It must be nice to have a man so {{perfectly}} devoted to one.... And I don't believe either she half <b>appreciates</b> <b>you.</b> Some women would give their very eyes, do you know, to be as much loved by any man as she's loved by you, Harry." [...] And she looked at him significantly.|$|R

60|$|There is no {{pleasure}} {{comparable to}} making a vow {{in the presence of}} one who appreciates that vow, in the presence of men who honor and <b>appreciate</b> <b>you</b> for making the vow, and men who admire you for making the vow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it {{necessary}} to ask me? You know that I loved you--and I love you now. If you had been happy I might have hid my feelings--at least, I would have tried--but when I find you with a ploughman husband who could never understand or <b>appreciate</b> <b>you,</b> silence becomes impossible.

5000|$|Poe {{disagreed}} with the complaints. A month after [...] "Berenice" [...] was published, he wrote to White saying that many magazines achieved fame because of similar stories. Whether in bad taste or not, {{he said it was}} his goal to be appreciated, and [...] "to be <b>appreciated</b> <b>you</b> must be read." [...] He admitted, [...] "I allow that it approaches the very verge of bad taste - but I will not sin quite so egregiously again." [...] Even so, Poe also emphasized that its final judgment should come not from the taste of the reading public but on the circulation of the magazine.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is funny," [...] she persisted. [...] "Don't say {{you have}} lost your sense of humour, Paul; {{it was the one}} real thing you possessed. You were so cocky--you don't know how cocky you were! Everybody was a fool but Vane; nobody else but he <b>appreciated</b> <b>you</b> at your true worth.

6000|$|... "Mouse dear," [...] she said, hesitatingly, [...] "the {{reason why}} I {{wanted to have}} you come out here, why I couldn't sleep, I {{wanted to tell you}} how ashamed I am for having been peevish, being petulant, last night.

6000|$|For {{the next}} three weeks Black Sheep was {{strictly}} allowed to do nothing. He spent his time in the old nursery looking at the broken toys, for all of which account must be rendered to Mamma. Aunty Rosa hit him over the hands if even a wooden boat were broken. But that sin was of small importance compared to the other revelations, so darkly hinted at by Aunty Rosa.
