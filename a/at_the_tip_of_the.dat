5|$|Highly innervated, the glans exists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{clitoral}} {{body as a}} fibro-vascular cap, and {{is usually}} {{the size and shape}} of a pea, although it is sometimes much larger or smaller. While whether or not the glans is composed of erectile or non-erectile tissue is subject to debate (see above), it, or the entire clitoris, is estimated to have 8,000 or more sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|Most antbirds have proportionately large, heavy bills. Several genera of antshrike have a {{strongly}} hooked tip to the bill, and all antbirds have a notch or 'tooth' <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two genera of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.|$|E

5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare {{is similar}} to the Abyssinian hare (Lepus habessinicus) which has grizzled, silvery gray dorsal pelage and has a narrow,black rim <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ears. It is also similar to the African savannah hare (Lepus victoriae) which has brown dorsal pelage grizzled with black, and ears having lesser black on tip. Its nuchal patch is brownish-orange to orange, and it has not been observed to occur in the Ethiopian plateau.|$|E

The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E

5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout called the rostral scale.|$|E
5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a {{prominent}} gap in the tooth row <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and {{that part of the}} unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is recognized as most likely a specimen of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Several tyrannosaurid skeletons {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana {{probably}} belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether {{they belong to}} G. libratus or a new species. One specimen from Montana (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, osteomyelitis (infection) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, and possibly a brain tumor.|$|E

5|$|The Seven Days Battles {{were the}} climax of the Peninsula Campaign, during which McClellan's Army of the Potomac sailed around the Confederate lines, landed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Peninsula, {{southeast}} of Richmond, and struck inland towards the Confederate capital. Confederate commander-in-chief Joseph E. Johnston fended off McClellan's repeated attempts to take the city, slowing Union progress on the peninsula to a crawl. When Johnston was wounded, Lee took command and launched a series of counterattacks, collectively called the Seven Days Battles. These attacks culminated in the action on Malvern Hill.|$|E
5|$|US Highway25 (US25) {{was a part}} of the United States Numbered Highway System in {{the state}} of Michigan that ran from the Ohio state line near Toledo and ended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Thumb in Port Austin. The general routing of this state {{trunkline}} highway took it northeasterly from the state line through Monroe and Detroit to Port Huron. Along this southern half, it followed undivided highways and ran concurrently along two freeways, Interstate75 (I-75) and I-94. Near the foot of the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, US25 turned north and northwesterly along the Lake Huron shoreline to Port Austin.|$|E
5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beak of all {{birds in the}} family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There {{is evidence that the}} nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E

5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted {{at this point and}} the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and {{that part of the}} unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
