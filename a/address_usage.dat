40|$|Abstract—Smart mobile {{handheld}} devices (MHDs) {{are being}} adopted {{at a fast}} speed. Compared to wireless non-handheld devices (NHDs), MHDs {{tend to be more}} mobile and can be used more opportunistically. In this paper, we study two important network usage characteristics of MHDs, namely session lengths and IP <b>address</b> <b>usage,</b> in a university campus WiFi network. Specifically, we analyze two five-week long DHCP traces collected from the network, characterize session lengths of MHDs, and develop two hyper-exponential models to capture the distribution of session lengths. We further characterize the IP <b>address</b> <b>usage</b> of MHDs, and develop two analytical models to predict the number of concurrent IP addresses that are being used by MHDs at one point of time. Goodness of fit tests indicate that our analytical models of session lengths provide good fit, and evaluation results demonstrate that the predictions from our models for IP <b>address</b> <b>usage</b> are accurate. Our results provide important insights on managing MHDs as they are being adopted rapidly in WiFi networks. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{role played}} by address forms in the {{management}} of interpersonal relations has been widely recognized (cf. Bargiela et al. 2002; Clyne, Norrby, and Warren 2009; Formentelli 2007). In relation to service encounters, studies available on face-to-face interactions have shown how address forms contribute to constructing the interaction as friendly and egalitarian, for example, or perhaps hierarchical and even discriminatory. E-commerce, however, is a context in which <b>address</b> <b>usage</b> has received little attention. The growth of internet retailing over recent years makes examining <b>address</b> <b>usage</b> in e-service encounters a timely and revealing exercise. From a politeness perspective (cf. Locher and Watts, 2005; Spencer-Oatey 2008 [2000]), this paper examines how address forms are used in 230 anonymous interactions between shoppers and sellers in Mercado-Libre Ecuador, an online market place. The focus of this paper is on both pronominal and nominal address. Reference is made to results from previous studies in face-to-face service encounters in Ecuadorian Spanish (Quito) which have displayed an overall preference for formal/respectful address. The {{results of the present study}} show that the online environment, with its anonymity, is allowing for the development of more informal and more egalitarian, and in some ways, less personalized service relationships...|$|E

40|$|Nominal and pronominal address forms, which play {{a central}} role in the {{construction}} of interpersonal relations (cf. Bargiela et al. 2002; Clyne, Norrby and Warren 2009), have been the focus of attention in different linguistics subfields for several decades now. Less attention, however, has been paid to these forms from a variational pragmatics (Schneider and Barron 2008) perspective, particularly in Spanish. Using a corpus of role play interactions, we examine the impact of region and gender on nominal <b>address</b> <b>usage</b> among male and female university students from Quito (Ecuador), Santiago (Chile) and Seville (Spain). We look at how these forms are employed in rapport management (Spencer-Oatey 2008 [2000]) in two situations: giving advice and making a direct complaint (Boxer 1993). Building on work on nominal forms (cf. Leech 1999; McCarthy and O’Keefe 2003), we examine similarities and differences in their use across the three varieties of Spanish. Among the findings recorded was a larger repertoire of nominal forms in the Santiago and Quito data sets relative to the Seville corpus, with the highest frequency of use in Santiago. We suggest that <b>address</b> <b>usage</b> in the dyadic contexts examined is connected to the expression of affect and involvement, with Chileans (Santiago) and Ecuadorians (Quito) displaying more affect than Spaniards (Seville). Contrary to early research suggesting that women employ more affiliative language than men (cf.

40|$|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) {{was defined}} to {{facilitate}} automatic configuration of IP addresses and other network parameters to hosts in a network. Efficiency of DHCP’s address management {{is especially important}} today {{in part due to}} proliferation of mobile devices with transient network access patterns and the consequent increased demand on transient IP addresses in open-access networks. Unfortunately, DHCP’s flexible design makes it susceptible to a variety of misconfigurations. The focus of this work is, therefore, to evaluate the performance and vulnerabilities of DHCP in operational networks today. To this end, we developed a tool called DHCP-Watch that facilitates DHCP-related network debugging and enables better capacity planning. We used this tool to perform a first-of-its-kind detailed measurement study of DHCP performance in operational university campus networks.

40|$|Exhaustion of the IPv 4 {{address space}} is driving {{mitigation}} technologies, such as carrier-grade NAT or IPv 6. Understanding this driver requires knowing how much allocated IPv 4 space is actively used over time – a non-trivial goal due to privacy concerns and practical measurement challenges. To address this gap {{we present a}} collaborative and privacy-preserving capture-recapture (CR) technique for estimating IP address space utilisation. Public and private datasets of IP addresses observed by multiple independent collaborators can be combined for CR analysis, without any individual collaborator's privately observed addresses leaking to the others. We show that CR estimation is much more accurate than assuming all used addresses are observed, and that our scheme scales well to datasets of over a billion addresses across several collaborators.

40|$|For both {{fixed and}} mobile network operators, {{interconnection}} constitutes an indisputably key element to provide end users {{with a variety}} of services. Internet interconnection is particularly an intriguing subject due to the importance of the Internet in our everyday lives and our genuine curiosity to grasp its underlying structure. This thesis aims to provide a holistic approach to study the Internet interconnections in a nation-centric stance. To accomplish the objective, initially the method that breaks down the key features of the interconnection analysis is introduced. The nation-centric analysis is conducted for Finland by jointly utilizing the Internet registry data and collected Internet routing data. Covering {{the last decade of the}} Finnish Internet, the longitudinal analysis yields significant findings for the Internet <b>address</b> <b>usage</b> statistics and the level of multi-homed networks, along with the classification and inference of relationships between stakeholders in the interconnection ecosystem. The implications that the emerging interconnection models pose for the future global service delivery among both fixed and mobile networks are expounded from the perspective of the existing domestic interconnection practices. The longitudinal interconnectivity study allows us to comprehend both technical and business interfaces between market players by revealing a complete list of customer-provider relationships. Within a national milieu, the assessment of the current Internet market dynamics and future implications of emerging models can be considered in more rationally anticipated manner. Hence, authorities who desire to design new pricing schemes and policies for future networking interconnections can be guided more thoroughly...|$|E
40|$|The Internet {{has grown}} tremendously {{in terms of}} the number of users who rely on it and the number of {{organizations}} that are connected to it. Characterizing how this growth affects its structure and topology is vitally important to determine the fundamental characteristics and limitations that must be handled, such as address space exhaustion; understanding the process of allocating and delegating address space can help to answer these questions. In this paper, we analyze BGP routing data to study the structure and growth of IPv 4 address space allocation, fragmentation and usage. We explore the notion of delegation relationships among prefixes and use this information to construct an autonomous system (AS) delegation tree. We show that delegation in the Internet is not significantly correlated to the underlying topology or AS customer-provider relationships. We also analyze the fragmentation and usage of address space over a period of five years and examine prefixes that are delegated by organizations vs. those that are not delegated. We notice that the address space usage due to delegating prefixes is increasing at the same rate as the address space usage due to non-delegating prefixes. This indicates that fragmentation rate of the address space is actually almost a constant with respect to total <b>address</b> <b>usage.</b> Additionally, we show that most delegation is performed by a small number of organizations, which may aid in the implementation of a public-key infrastructure for the Internet. 1...|$|E
